"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
cried the startled pirates .
"`` The cabin 's as black as a pit , '' Cecco said , almost gibbering , `` but there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ''"
"The exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were seen by Hook ."
"`` Cecco , '' he said in his most steely voice , `` go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo . ''"
"Cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying `` No , no '' ; but Hook was purring to his claw ."
"`` Did you say you would go , Cecco ? ''"
he said musingly .
"Cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly ."
"There was no more singing , all listened now ; and again came a death-screech and again a crow ."
No one spoke except Slightly .
"`` Three , '' he said ."
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . ''
"'S ` death and odds fish , '' he thundered , `` who is to bring me that doodle-doo ? ''"
"`` Wait till Cecco comes out , '' growled Starkey , and the others took up the cry ."
"`` I think I heard you volunteer , Starkey , '' said Hook , purring again ."
"`` No , by thunder ! ''"
Starkey cried .
"`` My hook thinks you did , '' said Hook , crossing to him ."
"`` I wonder if it would not be advisable , Starkey , to humour the hook ? ''"
"`` I 'll swing before I go in there , '' replied Starkey doggedly , and again he had the support of the crew ."
`` Is this mutiny ? ''
asked Hook more pleasantly than ever .
`` Starkey 's ringleader ! ''
"`` Captain , mercy ! ''"
"Starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now ."
"`` Shake hands , Starkey , '' said Hook , proffering his claw ."
"Starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him ."
"As he backed up Hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye ."
With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea .
"`` Four , '' said Slightly ."
"`` And now , '' Hook said courteously , `` did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ''"
"Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , `` I 'll bring out that doodle-doo myself , '' he said , and sped into the cabin ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
I only got home half an hour ago ... and no Dora to be seen .
Davy declares he never saw her since I left . ''
"`` Neither I did , '' avowed Davy solemnly ."
"`` She must be somewhere around , '' said Anne ."
`` She would never wander far away alone ... you know how timid she is .
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms . ''
Marilla shook her head .
`` I 've hunted the whole house through .
But she may be in some of the buildings . ''
A thorough search followed .
"Every corner of house , yard , and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people ."
"Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood , calling Dora 's name ."
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar .
"Davy accompanied each of them in turn , and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be ."
Finally they met again in the yard .
"`` It 's a most mysterious thing , '' groaned Marilla ."
`` Where can she be ? ''
"said Anne miserably `` Maybe she 's tumbled into the well , '' suggested Davy cheerfully ."
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other 's eyes .
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words .
"`` She ... she might have , '' whispered Marilla ."
"Anne , feeling faint and sick , went to the wellbox and peered over ."
The bucket sat on the shelf inside .
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water .
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea .
If Dora ... but Anne could not face the idea .
She shuddered and turned away .
"`` Run across for Mr. Harrison , '' said Marilla , wringing her hands ."
`` Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away ... they went to town today .
I 'll go for Mr. Barry . ''
"Mr. Barry came back with Anne , carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork ."
"Marilla and Anne stood by , cold and shaken with horror and dread , while Mr. Barry dragged the well , and Davy , astride the gate , watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment ."
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
"And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her , and I 'm going to . ''"
`` Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her ? ''
"`` Well , I ai n't going to let anybody else pull it , '' said Davy , doubling up his fists and frowning ."
`` They 'd just better try it .
I did n't hurt her much ... she just cried 'cause she 's a girl .
I 'm glad I 'm a boy but I 'm sorry I 'm a twin .
"When Jimmy Sprott 's sister conterdicks him he just says , ` I 'm oldern you , so of course I know better , ' and that settles HER ."
"But I ca n't tell Dora that , and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me ."
"You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell , since I 'm a man . ''"
"Altogether , Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard , where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves ."
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out .
"Dora submitted calmly to be kissed , but Davy responded to Anne 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement , `` I 'm Mr. Davy Keith . ''"
"At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady , but Davy 's manners left much to be desired ."
"`` I 'm so hungry I ai n't got time to eat p ` litely , '' he said when Marilla reproved him ."
`` Dora ai n't half as hungry as I am .
Look at all the ex ` cise I took on the road here .
That cake 's awful nice and plummy .
"We have n't had any cake at home for ever 'n ever so long , 'cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us ."
And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes .
Catch her !
Can I have another piece ? ''
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice .
"However , she reminded Davy that he ought to say `` Thank you '' for it ."
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite .
"When he had finished the slice he said , `` If you 'll give me ANOTHER piece I 'll say thank you for IT . ''"
"`` No , you have had plenty of cake , '' said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final ."
"Davy winked at Anne , and then , leaning over the table , snatched Dora 's first piece of cake , from which she had just taken one dainty little bite , out of her very fingers and , opening his mouth to the fullest extent , crammed the whole slice in ."
Dora 's lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror .
"Anne promptly exclaimed , with her best `` schoolma'am '' air , `` Oh , Davy , gentlemen do n't do things like that . ''"
"`` I know they do n't , '' said Davy , as soon as he could speak , `` but I ai n't a gemplum . ''"
`` But do n't you want to be ? ''
said shocked Anne .
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
"Then she came over , sat down beside me , and took me in her arms . ''"
"` Do n't cry , dear little Rilla-my-Rilla ."
"You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to Fred ; and if Leslie West 's son asked you to keep your lips for him , I think you may consider yourself engaged to him ."
"But -- oh , my baby -- my last little baby -- I have lost you -- the war has made a woman of you too soon . '"
`` I shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mother 's hugs .
"Nevertheless , when I saw Fred marching by two days later in the parade , my heart ached unbearably ."
`` But I 'm glad mother thinks I 'm really engaged to Ken ! ''
"CHAPTER XXII LITTLE DOG MONDAY KNOWS `` It is two years tonight since the dance at the light , when Jack Elliott brought us news of the war ."
"Do you remember , Miss Oliver ? ''"
Cousin Sophia answered for Miss Oliver .
"`` Oh , indeed , Rilla , I remember that evening only too well , and you a-prancing down here to show off your party clothes ."
Did n't I warn you that we could not tell what was before us ?
Little did you think that night what was before you . ''
"`` Little did any of us think that , '' said Susan sharply , `` not being gifted with the power of prophecy ."
"It does not require any great foresight , Sophia Crawford , to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over ."
I could do as much myself . ''
"`` We all thought the war would be over in a few months then , '' said Rilla wistfully ."
`` When I look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it . ''
"`` And now , two years later , it is no nearer the end than it was then , '' said Miss Oliver gloomily ."
Susan clicked her knitting-needles briskly .
"`` Now , Miss Oliver , dear , you know that is not a reasonable remark ."
"You know we are just two years nearer the end , whenever the end is appointed to be . ''"
"`` Albert read in a Montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more , '' was Cousin Sophia 's cheerful contribution ."
"`` It ca n't , '' cried Rilla ; then she added with a sigh , `` Two years ago we would have said ` It ca n't last two years . '"
But five more years of this ! ''
"`` If Rumania comes in , as I have strong hopes now of her doing , you will see the end in five months instead of five years , '' said Susan ."
"`` I 've no faith in furriners , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The French are foreigners , '' retorted Susan , `` and look at Verdun ."
And think of all the Somme victories this blessed summer .
The Big Push is on and the Russians are still going well .
"Why , General Haig says that the German officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war . ''"
"`` You ca n't believe a word the Germans say , '' protested Cousin Sophia ."
says he .
`` This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk ; and I hae nae trokings * wi ' night-hawks .
What brings ye here ?
I have a blunderbush . ''
* Dealings .
"`` Is that yoursel ' , Mr. Balfour ? ''"
"returned Alan , stepping back and looking up into the darkness ."
`` Have a care of that blunderbuss ; they 're nasty things to burst . ''
`` What brings ye here ?
and whae are ye ? ''
"says my uncle , angrily ."
"`` I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side , '' said Alan ; `` but what brings me here is another story , being more of your affair than mine ; and if ye 're sure it 's what ye would like , I 'll set it to a tune and sing it to you . ''"
`` And what is ` t ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` David , '' says Alan ."
`` What was that ? ''
"cried my uncle , in a mighty changed voice ."
"`` Shall I give ye the rest of the name , then ? ''"
said Alan .
"There was a pause ; and then , `` I 'm thinking I 'll better let ye in , '' says my uncle , doubtfully ."
"`` I dare say that , '' said Alan ; `` but the point is , Would I go ?"
Now I will tell you what I am thinking .
"I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business ; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever ; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel ' , and a gentleman of better family . ''"
"This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer ; he was a little while digesting it , and then says he , `` Weel , weel , what must be must , '' and shut the window ."
"But it took him a long time to get down-stairs , and a still longer to undo the fastenings , repenting -LRB- I dare say -RRB- and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar ."
"At last , however , we heard the creak of the hinges , and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and -LRB- seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two -RRB- sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands ."
"`` And , now '' says he , `` mind I have my blunderbush , and if ye take a step nearer ye 're as good as deid . ''"
"`` And a very civil speech , '' says Alan , `` to be sure . ''"
"`` Na , '' says my uncle , `` but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding , and I 'm bound to be prepared ."
"And now that we understand each other , ye 'll can name your business . ''"
"`` Why , '' says Alan , `` you that are a man of so much understanding , will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman ."
"My name has nae business in my story ; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull , of which ye will have heard ."
"I should think you ought to be able to , with that imagination you 're always talking of . ''"
"`` But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things , '' said Anne , cuddling Davy ."
`` There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more . ''
"In the end Davy was sent to bed , as usual , there to remain until noon next day ."
"He evidently did some thinking , for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly ."
"Going in , she found him sitting up in bed , with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands ."
"`` Anne , '' he said solemnly , `` is it wrong for everybody to tell whop ... falsehoods ?"
I want to know ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed . ''"
`` Is it wrong for a grown-up person ? ''
`` Yes . ''
"`` Then , '' said Davy decidedly , `` Marilla is bad , for SHE tells them ."
"And she 's worse 'n me , for I did n't know it was wrong but she does . ''"
"`` Davy Keith , Marilla never told a story in her life , '' said Anne indignantly ."
`` She did so .
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I did n't say my prayers every night .
"And I have n't said them for over a week , just to see what would happen ... and nothing has , '' concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone ."
"Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal , and then earnestly set about saving Marilla 's reputation ."
"`` Why , Davy Keith , '' she said solemnly , `` something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day . ''"
Davy looked sceptical .
"`` I s ` pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper , '' he said scornfully , `` but THAT is n't dreadful ."
"Course , I do n't like it , but I 've been sent to bed so much since I come here that I 'm getting used to it ."
"And you do n't save anything by making me go without supper either , for I always eat twice as much for breakfast . ''"
`` I do n't mean your being sent to bed .
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today .
"And , Davy , '' ... Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit ... `` for a boy to tell what is n't true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him ... almost the very worst ."
So you see Marilla told you the truth . ''
"`` But I thought the something bad would be exciting , '' protested Davy in an injured tone ."
`` Marilla is n't to blame for what you thought .
Bad things are n't always exciting .
They 're very often just nasty and stupid . ''
"`` It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well , though , '' said Davy , hugging his knees ."
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
There could n't be a better child and you 'd hardly know she was in the house . ''

This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell ` speckled ' and could n't manage it .
"` Well , ' he said finally , ' I ca n't spell it but I know what it means . ' ''"
` What ? '
I asked . ''
"` St. Clair Donnell 's face , miss . '"
"`` St. Clair is certainly very much freckled , although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it ... for I was freckled once and well do I remember it ."
But I do n't think St. Clair minds .
It was because Jimmy called him ` St. Clair ' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school .
"I heard of the pounding , but not officially , so I do n't think I 'll take any notice of it ."

One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves .
said Nat innocently .
"`` Well , I do n't know about that , '' began Mrs. Bhaer , rather startled by the coolness of the proposition ."
"`` Why , I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you , and be kind to 'em as you were to me , '' said Nat , looking surprised and alarmed ."
"`` So I do , but I like to know something about them first ."
"I have to choose them , because there are so many ."
I have not room for all .
I wish I had . ''
"`` I told him to come because I thought you 'd like it , but if there is n't room he can go away again , '' said Nat , sorrowfully ."
"The boy 's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer , and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope , and spoil his kind little plan , so she said , `` Tell me about this Dan . ''"
"`` I do n't know any thing , only he has n't got any folks , and he 's poor , and he was good to me , so I 'd like to be good to him if I could . ''"
"`` Excellent reasons every one ; but really , Nat , the house is full , and I do n't know where I could put him , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her ."
"`` He could have my bed , and I could sleep in the barn ."
"It is n't cold now , and I do n't mind , I used to sleep anywhere with father , '' said Nat , eagerly ."
"Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his shoulder , and say in her kindest tone : `` Bring in your friend , Nat ; I think we must find room for him without giving him your place . ''"
"Nat joyfully ran off , and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy , who slouched in and stood looking about him , with a half bold , half sullen look , which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself , after one glance , `` A bad specimen , I am afraid . ''"
"`` This is Dan , '' said Nat , presenting him as if sure of his welcome ."
"`` Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us , '' began Mrs. Jo , in a friendly tone ."
"`` Yes , '' was the gruff reply ."
`` Have you no friends to take care of you ? ''
`` No . ''
"`` Say , ` No , ma'am , ' '' whispered Nat ."
"`` Sha n't neither , '' muttered Dan ."
`` How old are you ? ''
`` About fourteen . ''
`` You look older .
What can you do ? '' ''
` Most anything . ''
"`` If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do , work and study as well as play ."
Are you willing to agree to that ? ''
`` Do n't mind trying . ''
"`` Well , you can stay a few days , and we will see how we get on together ."
"Take him out , Nat , and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home , when we will settle about the matter , '' said Mrs. Jo , finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person , who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard , suspicious expression , sorrowfully unboyish ."
"It seems there was a ship lost in those parts ; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands , when he came upon a lad that was half drowned ."
"Well , he brought him to ; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld , ruined castle , where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends ."
"My friends are a wee wild-like , and not so particular about the law as some that I could name ; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk , and was your born nephew , Mr. Balfour , they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter ."
"And I may tell ye at the off-go , unless we can agree upon some terms , ye are little likely to set eyes upon him ."
"For my friends , '' added Alan , simply , `` are no very well off . ''"
My uncle cleared his throat .
"`` I 'm no very caring , '' says he ."
"`` He wasnae a good lad at the best of it , and I 've nae call to interfere . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Alan , `` I see what ye would be at : pretending ye do n't care , to make the ransom smaller . ''"
"`` Na , '' said my uncle , `` it 's the mere truth ."
"I take nae manner of interest in the lad , and I 'll pay nae ransome , and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care . ''"
"`` Hoot , sir , '' says Alan ."
"`` Blood 's thicker than water , in the deil 's name !"
"Ye cannae desert your brother 's son for the fair shame of it ; and if ye did , and it came to be kennt , ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side , or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` I 'm no just very popular the way it is , '' returned Ebenezer ; `` and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt ."
"No by me , onyway ; nor yet by you or your friends ."
"So that 's idle talk , my buckie , '' says he ."
"`` Then it 'll have to be David that tells it , '' said Alan ."
`` How that ? ''
"says my uncle , sharply ."
"`` Ou , just this way , '' says Alan ."
"`` My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it , but if there was nane , I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased , and be damned to him ! ''"
"`` Ay , but I 'm no very caring about that either , '' said my uncle ."
`` I wouldnae be muckle made up with that . ''
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
`` And what for why ? ''
asked Ebenezer .
"`` Why , Mr. Balfour , '' replied Alan , `` by all that I could hear , there were two ways of it : either ye liked David and would pay to get him back ; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him , and would pay for us to keep him ."
"It seems it 's not the first ; well then , it 's the second ; and blythe am I to ken it , for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends . ''"
"`` I dinnae follow ye there , '' said my uncle ."
`` No ? ''
said Alan .
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
"`` There is no sense in believing a thing just because you 'd like to believe it , Susan Baker ."
The British have lost millions of men at the Somme and how far have they got ?
"Look facts in the face , Susan Baker , look facts in the face . ''"
`` They are wearing the Germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west .
"I am not , '' admitted Susan in tremendous humility , `` I am not a military expert , Sophia Crawford , but even I can see that , and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything ."
The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world .
"Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum 's son Roderick , from the Upper Glen ?"
He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week .
"He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on , till you would have supposed everything was lovely ."
"But when he signed his name , right in between Roderick and MacCallum , he wrote two Gaelic words that meant ` all lies ' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy 's name ."
"So he let it pass , never dreaming how he was diddled ."
"Well , I am going to leave the war to Haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake ."
And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf .
The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it .
We had company for tea that night and when I went to get my cake what a sight did I behold ! ''
`` Has that pore orphan 's father never been heerd from yet ? ''
asked Cousin Sophia .
"`` Yes , I had a letter from him in July , '' said Rilla ."
"`` He said that when he got word of his wife 's death and of my taking the baby -- Mr. Meredith wrote him , you know -- he wrote right away , but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost . ''"
"`` It took him two years to begin to think it , '' said Susan scornfully ."
`` Some people think very slow .
"Jim Anderson has not got a scratch , for all he has been two years in the trenches ."
"A fool for luck , as the old proverb says . ''"
"`` He wrote very nicely about Jims and said he 'd like to see him , '' said Rilla ."
"`` So I wrote and told him all about the wee man , and sent him snapshots ."
Jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck . ''
"`` You did n't used to be very fond of babies , '' said Cousin Sophia ."
"`` I 'm not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever I was , '' said Rilla , frankly ."
"`` But I do love Jims , and I 'm afraid I was n't really half as glad as I should have been when Jim Anderson 's letter proved that he was safe and sound . ''"
`` You was n't hoping the man would be killed ! ''
cried Cousin Sophia in horrified accents .
`` No -- no -- no !
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
"Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:"
"""Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear."
"No there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."""
"""Good-bye, ducky,"" said Nurse. ""Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."""
"So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"""
"He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time."
"As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand."
"""I thought we were a Republic,"" said Lionel. ""I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."""
"""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"" said the Prime Minister, ""and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown so much a week, you know, according to people's means sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."""
"""But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"""
"""Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."""
"Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery."
"Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked."
"After tea Lionel said: ""I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"""
"""Bless the child,"" said Nurse. ""You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."""
"So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now when Lionel cried out: ""Oh, what a worldful of books!"
"Are they yours?"""
"""They are yours, Your Majesty,"" answered the Chancellor. ""They were the property of the late King, your great-great """
"""Yes, I know,"" Lionel interrupted. ""Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."""
"""If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"" said the Prime Minister, ""I should not read these books. Your great """
"""Yes?"" said Lionel, quickly."
"""He was a very good King oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little well, strange."""
"""Mad?"" asked Lionel, cheerfully."
"""No, no"" both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. ""Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was er too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."""
Lionel looked puzzled.
"""The fact is,"" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, ""your great """
"""Go on,"" said Lionel."
""" was called a wizard."""
"""But he wasn't?"""
"""Of course not a most worthy King was your great """
"""I see."""
"""But I wouldn't touch his books."""
"""Would there were folk hereaway,"" thought Halvor, ""that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together."""
"When he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle."
"""Good evening,"" said Halvor."
"""Good evening,"" said the old wife."
"""But what errand can you have in coming hither?"" she went on, ""for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more."""
"Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to Soria Moria Castle, and asked if she knew the way thither."
"""No,"" said the old wife, ""that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything?"""
"So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the tree-tops, the old wife went out."
"""THOU MOON, THOU MOON,"" she screamed, ""canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"""
"""No,"" said the Moon, ""that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."""
"""Wait a bit still,"" said the old wife to Halvor, ""bye and bye comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."""
"""Nay, nay,"" said the old wife when she went out again, ""you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door."""
Then she ran on:
"""But won't you swop him away to me? we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to Soria Moria Castle."""
"That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy."
"""For now,"" she said, ""I shall be able to ride to church. I, too, think of that."""
"As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry."
"""Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes."""
"So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again."
Out ran the old wife.
"""THOU WEST WIND, THOU WEST WIND! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."""
"""Yes, I know it very well,"" said the West Wind, ""and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."""
Out ran Halvor.
"""You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,"" said the West Wind."
"So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up."
"""Well,"" said the West Wind, ""now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."""
"In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding."
"""Aye, aye, that I have,"" said Halvor, ""he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It'll not be long before he's here,"" and then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle."
"So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be."
"So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor. He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass."
Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
"""Who is most worthy to have one of us,"" she said, ""he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom?"""
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said, ""That must be the fruit; go and gather it."" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, ""Come with me to my room while I open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat me."""
"""No,"" said King Dantal; ""remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to eat you."""
"Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor."
"Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him sadly, ""Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."""
"King Dantal answered, ""It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly."" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again."
"Then Laili said, ""Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"""
"""Oh!"" said Prince Majnun, ""I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them."" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs."
"After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden."
"""We must go into that garden and see it,"" said Majnun."
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked man."" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, ""Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you to seize me."""
"""What nonsense,"" said Majnun. ""I believe he is a very good Raja."
"Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away."""
"""Well,"" said Laili, ""it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed."" Now Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow."
"Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said, ""Why did you kill my husband?"""
"""Because I want to take you,"" he answered."
"""You cannot,"" said Laili."
"""Yes, I can,"" said the Raja."
"""Take me, then,"" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch."
"Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and said, ""What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had slept for years!"" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by Laili's horse."
"""What's that?"" said Majnun."
"""That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."""
"""Who killed him?"" asked Majnun."
"""I did,"" answered Laili, ""and it was I who brought you to life."""
"""Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,"" said Majnun."
"""No,"" said Laili, ""for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm."" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, ""Jump up on the horse, then, and go far away with the groom."""
"""What will you do,"" said Majnun, ""if I leave you? I cannot leave you."""
"""I will take care of myself,"" said Laili; ""but this man is so wicked, he may kill you again if you are near him."" So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili."
"Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace."
"There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and angry. ""How lucky for you that you have such a wife,"" he said."
"""Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; ""for,"" said King Dantal, ""Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."""
"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal"
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"""Very well,"" said the crow, ""open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down and see."" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very quickly. ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach,"" said the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. ""Oh, jackal,"" said the Rohu, ""do tell me what I have inside me."""
"""How can I tell?"" said the jackal. ""I cannot see unless I go inside you."" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."" So off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. ""Oh,"" says the fish, ""do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.'"""
"The snake said, ""Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it is."" The snake went down: when he returned he said, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you."" ""If you do that, I shall die,"" said the Rohu. ""Oh, no,"" said the snake, ""you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again."" So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili."
"She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and they asked her what she wanted. ""I want King Majnun,"" she said."
"So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, ""An old woman outside says she wants you."" ""I cannot leave this place,"" said he; ""send her in here."" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted."
"""I want to marry you,"" she answered. ""Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for you."" Prince Majnun said, ""Very good."""
"""Pray to Khuda,"" said Laili, ""to make us both young again, and then we shall be married."" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, ""Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire, she and you will become young again."" When he touched Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again."
"And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother."
"Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, ""Laili, Laili, Laili."" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time with him."
"They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves."
"One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, ""Let us go through this jungle."""
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle."
"And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, ""I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see."" So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes."
"Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. ""I will only have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,"" said Prince Majnun."
"""How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"" said the father."
"""Then I'll not have any wife at all,"" said Prince Majnun."
"Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."""
"At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said to Khuda, ""Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'"
"and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun."""
"""Well,"" said Khuda, ""you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed."""
"So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal's garden. ""Now,"" he said, ""it is Khuda's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a little white dog."" He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form."
"Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when he married Laili."
"As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. ""Oh, look, look!"" he cried, ""see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us."" Laili looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness; but this only frightened Majnun the more. ""It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them."
"""What nonsense,"" said his father. ""Fancy two grown men being so frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten you."" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more."
"The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed."
"But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, ""What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!"" Poor Laili answered, ""Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more."" Majnun, however, said ""How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,"" and he was in great terror."
"In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. ""An old woman! an old woman! always an old woman!"" said his father. ""You do nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?"" However, when he saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back at night, he advised him to say to her, ""I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as you are?"""
"That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog, crying ""Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you."" ""Well,"" said Majnun, ""if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry you."""
"Laili said, ""Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on."" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and disappeared in the garden."
"Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit."
"""Oh!"" said the Prince, ""I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."""
"But Nurse said: ""Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."""
"Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all."
"Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: ""We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and everything!"""
"And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward."
"Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book."
"""After all,"" they said, ""soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it."""
"Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough."
"All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage."
"Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something. The question was, what?"
"The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all the creatures in The Book of Beasts could not be wicked, like the Dragon, and he thought: ""Suppose I could get another beast out who would fight the Dragon?"""
"So he took The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He could only see ""cora,"" but he felt the middle of the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: ""What animal ends in 'cora'?"""
"The Chancellor answered: ""The Manticora, of course."""
"""What is he like?"" asked the King."
"""He is the sworn foe of Dragons,"" said the Chancellor. ""He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago worse luck!"""
"Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had ""cora"" on it, and there was the picture Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written, ""Manticora."""
"In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well."
"And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty."
"The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with."
"At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: ""Nurse, wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more."""
"Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King."
"""Crying,"" said she, ""never did anyone any good yet."""
"""I don't know,"" said the little King, ""I seem to see better, and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I must try to see if I can't save the people."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said Nurse, ""but don't tear your clothes or get your feet wet."""
So off he went.
"The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden, and opened it very quickly, so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the page, ""Hippogriff,"" and before Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the roses."
"The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: ""But for the wings you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse."" And the Blue Bird's song was very loud and sweet."
"Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught up The Book of Beasts and jumped on the back of the gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the sharp, white ear: ""Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste."""
"And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise."
"When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think what they would wear for Court mourning."
"But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste."
"Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there is no sand all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a hundred miles of it."
"Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped The Book of Beasts and laid it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles."
"Since the above was written, the account of the death of Governor      Andros is flashed across the wires to us. Verbum sap. Also In      hoc signo vinces."
"The author wishes to express by this means his grateful      acknowledgments to his friends and the public generally for the      great turn-out and general sympathy bestowed upon his relative, the      late Peter B. Stuyvesant, on the sad occasion of his funeral, which      was said to be one of the best attended and most successful      funerals before the war. Should any of his friends be caught in the      same fix, the author will not only cheerfully turn out himself, but      send all hands from his place that can be spared, also a six-seated      wagon and a side-bar buggy."
CHAPTER IX.
SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE STATES.
"The present State of New Jersey was a part of New Netherland, and the Dutch had a trading-post at Bergen as early as 1618. After New Netherland passed into the hands of the Dutch, the Duke of York gave the land lying between the Hudson and the Delaware to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret for Christmas."
"The first permanent English settlement made in the State was at Elizabethtown, named so in honor of Sir George's first wife."
"Berkeley sold his part to some English Quakers. This part was called West Jersey. He claimed that it was too far from town. It was very hard for a lord to clear up land, and Berkeley missed his evenings at the Savage Club, and his nose yearned for a good whiff of real old Rotten Row fog."
"So many disputes arose regarding the title to Jersey that the whole thing finally reverted to the crown in 1702. When there was any trouble over titles in those days it was always settled by letting it revert to the crown. It has been some years now, however, since that has happened in this country."
"Thirty-six years later New Jersey was set apart as a separate royal province, and became a railroad terminus and bathing-place."
"Delaware was settled by the Swedes at Wilmington first, and called New Sweden. I am surprised that the Norsemen, who it is claimed made the first and least expensive summer at Newport, R. I., should not have clung to it."
"They could have made a good investment, and in a few years would have been strong enough to wipe out the Brooklyn police."
"The Swedes, too, had a good foothold in New York, Jersey, and Delaware, also a start in Pennsylvania. But the two nations seemed to yearn for home, and as soon as boats began to run regularly to Stockholm and Christiania, they returned. In later years they discovered Minneapolis and Stillwater."
"William Penn now loomed up on the horizon. He was an English Quaker who had been expelled from Oxford and jugged in Cork also for his religious belief. He was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, and had a good record. He believed that elocutionary prayer was unnecessary, and that the acoustics of heaven were such that the vilest sinner with no voice-culture could be heard in the remotest portion of the gallery."
"The only thing that has been said against Penn with any sort of semblance of truth was that he had some influence with James II. The Duke of York also stood in with Penn, and used to go about in England bailing William out whenever he was jailed on account of his religious belief."
"Penn was quite a writer (see Appendix). He was the author of ""No Cross, No Crown,"" ""Innocency with her Open Face,"" and ""The Great Cause of Liberty of Conscience."""
"From his father he had inherited a claim against the government for sixteen thousand pounds, probably arrears of pension. He finally received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco."
"Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore he did not cheat them."
"The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to better advantage than you can with Russell Sage."
"Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with him for a farm."
"Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge working at 32°, while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel."
"But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid."
"Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by marrying the second time in 1695."
"In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718."
"Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man."
"In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people, exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves against, but the police also."
Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief.
"Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing the talking and the chief doing the lying."
"It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not wish to have any controversy."
"President Lincoln was not admired by a class of people in the North and South who heard with horror that he had at one time worked for ten dollars a month. They thought the President's salary too much for him, and feared that he would buy watermelons with it. They also feared that some day he might tell a funny story in the presence of Queen Victoria."
The snobocracy could hardly sleep nights for fear that Lincoln at a state dinner might put sugar and cream in his cold consommé.
"Jefferson Davis, it was said, knew more of etiquette in a minute than Lincoln knew all his life."
"The capture of Sumter united the North and unified the South. It made ""war Democrats"" i.e., Democrats who had voted against Lincoln join him in the prosecution of the war. More United States property was cheerfully appropriated by the Confederacy, which showed that it was alive and kicking from the very first minute it was born."
"Confederate troops were sent into Virginia and threatened the Capitol at Washington, and would have taken it if the city had not, in summer, been regarded as unhealthful."
"The Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, hurrying to the capital, was attacked in Baltimore and several men were killed. This was the first actual bloodshed in the civil war which caused rivers and lakes and torrents of the best blood of North and South to cover the fair, sweet clover fields and blue-grass meadows made alone for peace."
"The general opinion of the author, thirty-five years afterwards, is that the war was as unavoidable as the deluge, and as idiotic in its incipiency as Adam's justly celebrated defence in the great ""Apple Sass Case."""
"Men will fight until it is educated out of them, just as they will no doubt retain rudimentary tails and live in trees till they know better."
It's all owing to how a man was brought up.
"Of course after we have been drawn into the fight and been fined and sent home, we like to maintain that we were fighting for our home, or liberty, or the flag, or something of the kind. We hate to admit that, as a nation, we fought and paid for it afterwards with our family's bread-money just because we were irritated. That's natural; but most great wars are arranged by people who stay at home and sell groceries to the widow and orphan and old maids at one hundred per cent. advance."
"Arlington Heights and Alexandria were now seized and occupied by the Union troops for the protection of Washington, and mosquito-wires were put up in the Capitol windows to keep the largest of the rebels from coming in and biting Congress."
"Fort Monroe was garrisoned by a force under General Benjamin F. Butler, and an expedition was sent out against Big Bethel. On the way the Federal troops fired into each other, which pleased the Confederates very much indeed. The Union troops were repulsed with loss, and went back to the fort, where they stated that they were disappointed in the war."
"West Virginia was strongly for the Union in sentiment, and was set off from the original State of Virginia, and, after some fighting the first year of the war over its territory, came into line with the Northern States. The fighting here was not severe. Generals McClellan and Rosecrans (Union) and Lee (Confederate) were the principal commanders."
"The first year of the war was largely spent in sparring for wind, as one very able authority has it."
"In the next chapter reference will be made to the battle of Bull Run, and the odium will be placed where it belongs. The author reluctantly closes this chapter in order to go out and get some odium for that purpose."
CHAPTER XXV.
BULL RUN AND OTHER BATTLES.
"On the 21st of July, 1861, occurred the battle of Bull Run, under the joint management of General Irwin McDowell and General P. G. T."
"Beauregard. After a sharp conflict, the Confederates were repulsed, but rallied again under General T. J. Jackson, called thereafter Stonewall Jackson. While the Federals were striving to beat Jackson back, troops under Generals Early and Kirby Smith from Manassas Junction were hurled against their flank.[5] McDowell's men retreated, and as they reached the bridge a shell burst among their crowded and chaotic numbers. A caisson was upset, and a panic ensued, many of the troops continuing at a swift canter till they reached the Capitol, where they could call on the sergeant-at-arms to preserve order."
"As a result of this run on the banks of the Potomac, the North suddenly decided that the war might last a week or two longer than at first stated, that the foe could not be killed with cornstalks, and that a mistake had been made in judging that the rebellion wasn't loaded.[6]"
Half a million men were called for and five hundred million dollars voted. General George B. McClellan took command of the Army of the Potomac.
"The battle of Ball's Bluff resulted disastrously to the Union forces, and two thousand men were mostly driven into the Potomac, some drowned and others shot. Colonel Baker, United States Senator from Oregon, was killed."
"The war in Missouri now opened. Captain Lyon reserved the United States arsenal at St. Louis, and defeated Colonel Marmaduke at Booneville."
"General Sigel was defeated at Carthage, July 5, by the Confederates: so Lyon, with five thousand men, decided to attack more than twice that number of the enemy under Price and McCulloch, which he did, August 10, at Wilson's Creek. He was killed while making a charge, and his men were defeated."
"General Frémont then took command, and drove Price to Springfield, but he was in a short time replaced by General Hunter, because his war policy was offensive to the enemy. Hunter was soon afterwards removed, and Major-General Halleck took his place. Halleck gave general satisfaction to the enemy, and even his red messages from Washington, where he boarded during the war, were filled with nothing but kindness for the misguided foe."
"Davis early in the war commissioned privateers, and Lincoln blockaded the Southern ports. The North had but one good vessel at the time, and those who have tried to blockade four or five thousand miles of hostile coast with one vessel know full well what it is to be busy. The entire navy consisted of forty-two ships, and some of these were not seaworthy."
Some of them were so pervious that their guns had to be tied on to keep them from leaking through the cracks of the vessel.
"Hatteras Inlet was captured, and Commodore Dupont, aided by General Thomas W. Sherman, captured Port Royal Entrance and Tybee Island. Port Royal became the dépôt for the fleet."
"It was now decided at the South to send Messrs. Mason and Slidell to England, partly for change of scene and rest, and partly to make a friendly call on Queen Victoria and invite her to come and spend the season at Asheville, North Carolina. It was also hoped that she would give a few readings from her own works at the South, while her retinue could go to the front and have fun with the Yankees, if so disposed."
"These gentlemen, wearing their nice new broadcloth clothes, and with a court suit and suitable night-wear to use in case they should be pressed to stop a week or two at the castle, got to Havana safely, and took passage on the British ship Trent; but Captain Wilkes, of the United States steamer San Jacinto, took them off the Trent, just as Mr. Mason had drawn and fortunately filled a hand with which he hoped to pay a part of the war-debt of the South and get a new overcoat in London."
"Later, however, the United States disavowed this act of Captain Wilkes, and said it was only a bit of pleasantry on his part."

[1473] The cymbal certainly belonged to Demeter also (see Miss
"Harrison, _op. cit._ p. 562) but not, I think, the kettle-drum."
"[1474] Psellus (_Quaenam sunt Graecorum opiniones de daemonibus_, 3,"
ed. Migne) refers the formulary to the rites of Demeter and Kore. But
I cannot agree with Miss J. Harrison (_Prolegomena to the Study of
"Greek Religion_, p. 569) as to the importance of Psellus’ testimony"
in any respect. He appears to me to give no more than a _résumé_ of
"information derived from Clement’s _Protreptica_, misunderstood and"
even more confused.

"supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone.  Go"
quietly into the dining-room and wait for her.

do it!

being out.  I'll explain.

"LADY DEDMOND.  Yes, I know.  But you needn't say so.  Do you"
understand?
"PAYNTER.  [In polite dudgeon]  Just so, my lady."

CHAPTER I
HIS LORDSHIP
Madame Gilbert's war service ended when Austria fell out. She had been
in Italy busied with those obscure intrigues for the confounding of an
"enemy which are excused, and dignified, as patriotic propaganda. She is"
"satisfied that on the Italian Front she, and those who worked with her,"
really won the war.
"The war satisfactorily won, Madame Gilbert sped home to revel in the"

almost historical importance in the events of the German occupation.

LA GUERRE
"Ma soeur, vous souvient-il qu'aux jours de notre enfance,"
"En lisant les hauts fails de l'histoire de France,"
"Remplis d'admiration pour nos frères Gaulois,"
Des généraux fameux nous vantions les exploits?
"En nos âmes d'enfants, les seuls noms des victoires"
Prenaient un sens mystique evocateur de gloires;
On ne rêvait qu'assauts et combats; a nos yeux
Un général vainqueur etait l'égal des dieux.
Rien ne semblait ternir l'éclat de ces conquétes.
Les batailles prenaient des allures de fêtes
Et nous ne songions pas qu'aux hurrahs triomphants
"Se mêlaient les sanglots des mères, des enfants."
"Ah! nous la connaissons, hélas, l'horrible guerre:"
"Le fléau qui punit les crimes de la terre,"
Le mot qui fait trembler les mères à genoux
Et qui seme le deuil et la mort parmi nous!
Mais ou sqnt les lauriers que réserve l'Histoire
A celui qui demain forcera la Victoire?
Nul ne les cueillira: les lauriers sont flétris
Seul un cypres s'élève aux torubes de nos fils.]

LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.

GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?

speak English.

"late, sir."
GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?

JAMES FREDERICK FERRIER
INTRODUCTION
Mr. Oliphant Smeaton has asked me to write a few words of preface to
"this little book. If I try, it is only because I am old enough to have"
had the privilege of knowing some of those who were most closely
associated with Ferrier.

DR. J. C. BOSE ENTERTAINED
PARTY AT RAM MOHAN LIBRARY
"On Saturday, 24th July, 1915, the members of the Ram Mohan Library and"
"Reading room received Dr. J. C. Bose, the President of the Library in a"
"right royal fashion, on his return to India from his Scientific"
Deputation to the West.
"There was a large and influential gathering, and the spacious hall was"
tastefully decorated.
Dr. J. C. Bose arrived at 6:15 p.m. and was received at the gate by Mr.
"D. N. Pal, Secretary. Dr. Bose then went round the hall accompanied by"
the members of the Executive Committee while the Bharati Musical
Association played excellent Jaltaranga Orchestra.
"Babu Bhupendra Nath Bose, Vice-President of the Library, made a"
brilliant speech welcoming Dr. Bose and detailing the great services
done to the country by him.
DR. BOSE'S REPLY
Dr. Bose in reply expressed his thanks for the great interest shown in

"CLARE.  You mean your name, don't you?"
GEORGE.  Look here.  Did that fellow Malise put all this into your
head?
CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.
CLARE.  [With a touch of rapture]  Ah-h!
GEORGE.  Why do you let him come?  What d'you find interesting in
him?
CLARE.  A mind.
GEORGE.  Deuced funny one!  To have a mind--as you call it--it's not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
CLARE.  We don't.
GEORGE.  Then what do you talk about--your minds?  [CLARE looks at
him]  Will you answer a straight question?  Is he falling in love
with you?
CLARE.  You had better ask him.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.
[She follows the GENERAL out]
"[CLARE stands perfectly still, with her eyes closed.]"
MALISE.  Delicious!
"CLARE.  [In her level, clipped voice]  Perfectly beastly of me!  I'm"
so sorry.  I simply can't help running amok to-night.
MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]
MALISE.  Don't spoil it!
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.

GEORGE.  Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir."
GEORGE.  Well?
"BURNEY.  I don't think she meant it, sir."
"GEORGE.  I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact."
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir.  The mistress said: ""I hope it'll be a pleasant"
"evening, Burney!"""
GEORGE.  Oh!--Thanks.
"BURNEY.  I've put out the mistress's things, sir."
GEORGE.  Ah!
"BURNEY.  Thank you, sir.  [She withdraws.]"
GEORGE.  Damn!

HUNTINGDON.  Never heard her say so.
SIR CHARLES.  [Dimly]  I don't know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her.  H'm?
[A short silence.]
LADY DEDMOND.  There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night.  I forget

HUNTINGDON.  Yes.  Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.

"MALISE.  [Admiring her] Ah-h-h!  [Then, as she drops her arms"
suddenly]  Play me something.
CLARE.  [Going to the piano]  I'm awfully grateful to you.  You don't
make me feel just an attractive female.  I wanted somebody like that.
"[Letting her hands rest on the notes]  All the same, I'm glad not to"
be ugly.
MALISE.  Thank God for beauty!
PAYNTER.  [Opening the door]  Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton.
MALISE.  Who are they?
CLARE.  [Rising]  She's my chief pal.  He was in the Navy.
"She goes forward.  MRS.  FULLERTON is a rather tall woman, with"
"dark hair and a quick eye.  He, one of those clean-shaven naval"
"men of good presence who have retired from the sea, but not from"
their susceptibility.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Kissing CLARE, and taking in both MALISE and her"
husband's look at CLARE]  We've only come for a minute.
CLARE.  They're playing Bridge in the dining-room.  Mr. Malise
"doesn't play.  Mr. Malise--Mrs. Fullarton, Mr. Fullarton."
[They greet.]

MALISE.  I'll say good-night.
"He shakes hands with CLARE, bows to MRS. FULLARTON, and makes"
his way out.  HUNTINGDON and FULLERTON foregather in the
doorway.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  How are things, Clare?  [CLARE just moves her"
shoulders]  Have you done what I suggested?  Your room?
CLARE.  No.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Why not?
CLARE.  I don't want to torture him.  If I strike--I'll go clean.  I
expect I shall strike.
MRS. FULLARTON.  My dear!  You'll have the whole world against you.
"CLARE.  Even you won't back me, Dolly?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course I'll back you, all that's possible, but I"
can't invent things.
"CLARE.  You wouldn't let me come to you for a bit, till I could find"
my feet?
"LADY DEDMOND.  It's getting serious, Reginald.  I don't know what's"
to become of them.  You don't think the Rector--you don't think your
father would speak to Clare?
HUNTINGDON.  Afraid the Governor's hardly well enough.  He takes
anything of that sort to heart so--especially Clare.
SIR CHARLES.  Can't you put in a word yourself?
HUNTINGDON.  Don't know where the mischief lies.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road.  Very
"steady-goin' fellow, old George."
"HUNTINGDON.  Oh, yes; George is all right, sir."
LADY DEDMOND.  They ought to have had children.
HUNTINGDON.  Expect they're pretty glad now they haven't.  I really
"don't know what to say, ma'am."
"SIR CHARLES.  Saving your presence, you know, Reginald, I've often"
noticed parsons' daughters grow up queer.  Get too much morality and
rice puddin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  [With a clear look]  Charles!
SIR CHARLES.  What was she like when you were kids?
"HUNTINGDON.  Oh, all right.  Could be rather a little devil, of"
"course, when her monkey was up."
"The door is opened, and PAYNTER announces ""Mr. Kenneth Malise."""
"MALISE enters.  He is a tall man, about thirty-five, with a"
"strongly marked, dark, irregular, ironic face, and eyes which"
seem to have needles in their pupils.  His thick hair is rather
"untidy, and his dress clothes not too new."
LADY DEDMOND.  How do you do?  My son and daughter-in-law are so very
sorry.  They'll be here directly.
"[MALISE bows with a queer, curly smile.]"
"SIR CHARLES.  [Shaking hands] How d'you do, sir?"
"HUNTINGDON.  We've met, I think."
"He gives MALISE that peculiar smiling stare, which seems to warn"
the person bowed to of the sort of person he is.  MALISE'S eyes
sparkle.
LADY DEDMOND.  Clare will be so grieved.  One of those invitations
MALISE.  On the spur of the moment.
"SIR CHARLES.  You play Bridge, sir?"
MALISE.  Afraid not!
SIR CHARLES.  Don't mean that?  Then we shall have to wait for 'em.

"He was the author of a delightful book entitled ""A Cruising Voyage Round"

Crane dropped the paper and got up from the desk.
That son-of-a-bitch Taber was to blame for this. Shaping
up a goddamn hoax and feeding it out piecemeal. By
God--!
"He went to the desk and dialed, and when the answer came he said,"
"""Halliday? Senator Crane here. I want to have a little talk with you"

"a deliberate attempt to ... What's that? An appointment! Why, goddamn"

But Crane was no longer talking to Halliday. He had hung up.

"which consisted of friends and neighbours of Peterson, threw out the bill."
"Among other charges, Peterson was accused of selling some hides and"
"elephants' teeth to a Boston merchant for £57, being part of the booty he"
had previously taken out of prizes in the West Indies.
"PETERSON, ERASMUS."
Tried for piracy with the rest of Captain Quelch's crew at Boston. Was
"hanged there on June 30th, 1704. When standing on the gallows ""He cryed of"
"injustice done him and said, 'It is very hard for so many lives to be"
"withholding the non-essentials. But, above all, let us fill the scrip"
"with gifts that the child need never reject, even when he passes"
through “the gate of sleep.”

The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans

When there are two appellatives coming in different parts of

Arrange in two alphabets names that differ slightly in spelling and
"come close together in the alphabet: e.g.,"
"_Brown_ and _Browne_, and the French names beginning with _Saint_ and"
_Sainte_. As readers may not always know the spelling of the author's
"name, cross-references should be made: e.g., _Brown_. See also _Browne_."
Arrange by the forename headings in which the family name is the
same.

"Served in a slave vessel, the _Polly_ (Captain Fox, commander), on a"
"voyage to the coast of West Africa. While the captain was on shore, the"
"crew ran away with the ship, turned pirates, called their vessel the"
"_Bravo_, and elected Power to be captain and sailed to the West Indies."
"Arrived there, he tried to sell his cargo of slaves, but being suspected"
"of having stolen them, he thought it best to sail to New York. Here the"
"pirates got ashore, but the ship's surgeon informed the authorities, and"
"Power was arrested and sent to England, where he was tried, and hanged at"
"Execution Dock on March 10th, 1768."

The word “Number” has been omitted: thus Hymn 22 means Hymn No. 22.
_Cf._ means compare. (Latin: confer).
"The original texts of German hymns found throughout the _Handbook_,"
"especially in the section of Chorales, Book IV, are the versions used in"
"one or more of the following works: _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, (Berne,"
"Ind., 1890); _Gesangbuch der Mennoniten_, (Canadian, 1942); _The"
"Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal_, (Concordia Pub. House, 1942);"
_Gesangbuch zum gottesdienstlichen und häuslichen Gebrauch in
"Evangelischen Mennoniten-Gemeinden_, (Konferenz der süddeutschen"
"Mennoniten zu Ludwigshafen a. Rh. 1910); and Knapp, _Evangelischer"
Liederschatz_. Many variations occur in the texts as found in these
"versions, the explanation of which would require a much greater"
knowledge of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has
been made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German
practice of omitting the “h” where it was formerly used with the “th”;
the use of “ss” instead of “sz”; and printing the initial letter of the
"pronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals."
AN INTRODUCTION TO OUR HYMNS AND TUNES
With Illustrations From the _Hymnary_
1. Definition of a Hymn.
2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"In a few cases, chiefly of artists, a universally-used sobriquet"
"is to be taken in place of the family or forename, as _Tintoretto_"
(whose real name was Giacomo _Robusti_). Similar cases are _Canaletto_
"(Antonio _Canale_ and also B. _Belotto_), _Correggio_ (Ant. _Allegri_),"
"_Garofalo_ (Benvenuto Piero _Tisi_), Il _Sodoma_ (Giov. Ant. _Bazzi_),"
"_Spagnoletto_ (Jusepe _Ribera_, now however oftener called _Ribera_),"
_Uccello_ (Paolo _Doni_). Always cross-reference from the family name.
"(_b_) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g., _Kaye_, John,"
"Bishop of Lincoln. _Lincoln_, John, Bishop of. See _Kaye_."
"Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their forename: e.g.,"
"_Canon Liddon_, _Bishop of Ripon, Henry Edward_, _Archbishop of"
"Westminster_, i.e., _H. E. Manning_. Care must be taken not to treat"
Canon as a forename or Edward as a family name.
"(_c_) Married women, using the known form:"
"Wives often continue writing, and are known in literature only under"
"their maiden names (as _Miss Freer_ or _Fanny Lewald_), or after a"
second marriage retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
"Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., _Ward, Mrs. Elizabeth"
"(Phelps)_. Use the form _White, Mrs. Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C._,"
"when the husband's name is used: e.g., _Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake)"
"Garretson_. _Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)_. _Soyaux, Frau Frieda"
"(Schanz)_. _Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier) Comtesse de_."
Women known under their husbands' names are to be entered as follows:
"_Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan), Mrs. H. A. Hinkson_. Cross-reference"
to be made from the latter form.
"MRS. FULLARTON, taken aback, cannot refrain from her glance at"
FULLARTON automatically gazing at CLARE while he talks with
HUNTINGDON.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course--the only thing is that----
"CLARE.  [With a faint smile]  It's all right, Dolly.  I'm not coming."
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Oh!  don't do anything desperate, Clare--you are so"
desperate sometimes.  You ought to make terms--not tracks.
CLARE.  Haggle?  [She shakes her head]  What have I got to make terms
with?  What he still wants is just what I hate giving.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  But, Clare----"
"CLARE.  No, Dolly; even you don't understand.  All day and every day"
"--just as far apart as we can be--and still--Jolly, isn't it?  If"
you've got a soul at all.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  It's awful, really."
"CLARE.  I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on"
"with it; only, you see, I happen to have something in me that--comes"
"to an end.  Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever."
"She has taken a flower from her dress, and suddenly tears it to"
bits.  It is the only sign of emotion she has given.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Watching]  Look here, my child; this won't do.  You"
must get a rest.  Can't Reggie take you with him to India for a bit?

[Footnote 641: It was by entirely overlooking this historic fact that M.
"Fustel de Coulanges, in the last chapter of his _Cité antique_, was able"
to propound a theory of historic Christianity as something
extra-political. He there renounced the inductive method for a pure
"ecclesiastical apriorism, and the result is a very comprehensive"

[Footnote 723: This principle may have been copied from the practice of
the Lombard _Umiliati_. The common account of that order is that when in
"1014 the Emperor banished a number of Lombards, chiefly Milanese, into"
"Germany, they formed themselves into a religious society, called ""The"
"Humbled,"" and in that corporate capacity devoted themselves to various"
"trades, in particular to wool-working. Returning to Milan in 1019, they"
developed their organisation there. Down to 1140 all the members were
laymen; but thereafter priests were placed in control. For long the
organisation was in high repute both for commercial skill and for
"culture. Ultimately, like all other corporate orders, they grew corrupt;"
"and in 1571 they were suppressed by Pius V. (Pignotti, _Hist. of"
"Tuscany_, Eng. trans. 1823, pp. 266-67, _note_, following Tiraboschi.)]"

"(_c_) In all other languages, under the name following the prefix, with"
cross-references whenever the name has been commonly used in English
"with the prefix, as _Del Rio_, _Vandyck, Van Ess_: e.g. _Gama, Vasco"
"da_, _Goethe, J. W. von_."
"But when the name is printed as one word, entry is made under the"
"prefix, as _Vanderhaeghen_."
(_d_) Naturalized names with prefixes are to be treated by the rules of
the nation adopting them.
"Thus German names preceded by _von_, when belonging to Russians, are to"
"be entered under _Von_, as this is the Russian custom. So when Dutch"
names compounded with _van_ are adopted into French or English (as _Van
Laun_) the _Van_ is treated as part of the family name.
"Prefixes are _d', de, de La_ (the name goes under _La_ not _de_),"
"_Des, Du, L', La, Le, Les, St, Ste_ (to be arranged as if written"
"_Saint, Sainte_), _da, dal, dalla, dalle, dai, dagli, del, della,"
"delle, dei_ (_dé_ or _de_), _degli, da, dos_, _das, ten, ter, thor,"
"Van, vander, van't, ver, am, auf, auf'm, aus, aus'm, in, im, von, vom,"
"zu, zum, zur, A', Ap, O', Fitz, Mac_ (which is to be printed as it is"
"in the title, whether _M'_, or _Mc_, or _Mac_, but to be arranged as if"
written _Mac_).
"Index names of capes, lakes, mountains, rivers, forts, etc.,"
"beginning with _Cape_, _Lake_, _Mt._, etc., under the word"
"following the prefix, but when the name is itself used as a"
"prefix, do not transpose _Cape_, etc., nor in such names as _Isle"
"of the Woods_, _Isles of Shoals_; but there is more reason for"

"for chapter sinkages, giving us a volume of about 344 pages. As the"
"presswork is usually done in forms of 32 pages, an effort is always"
made not to exceed even forms by a small number of pages. Striking out
the bastard-title will often save a form of press-work.
Various short-cuts have been suggested for estimating the number of
"words in a printed page, but the old-fashioned method of counting is"
the safest. Here is a table which is as accurate as any short-cut can
be:
Words in
sq. in.
"18-Point (Great Primer), solid     7"
"14-Point (English), solid         10"
"12-Point (Pica), solid            14"
"12-Point (Pica), leaded[35]       11"
"11-Point (Small Pica), solid      17"

hymns and some of the Gospel Songs. Some of the numbers in the Gospel
"Songs section of the _Hymnary_ might well be classified as hymns, e.g.,"
"Nos. 441, 444, 447, 458, 463, 468, 470, 471, 472, and 492. Either words"
or music meet the generally accepted standards of a hymn.

"of a foreign compound name has been used alone, as _Merle d'Aubigné_"
(index under _Merle_ with a cross-reference from _Aubigné_).
"In French, a forename is sometimes joined to a surname by a hyphen. In"
"such cases make the entry under the family name, with a cross-reference"
"from the forename: e.g., entry, _Rochette, Désiré Raoul_;"
"cross-reference, _Raoul-Rochette, Désiré_. See _Rochette_."
"(_c_) In foreign compound names of women also, although the first part"
"is usually the maiden name and the second the husband's name, the entry"
"should generally be under the first, with a cross-reference from the"
"second[51]: e.g., _Rivé-King_, with cross-reference from _King, born"
Rivé_.
Index surnames preceded by prefixes:
"(_a_) In French and Belgian, under the prefix when it is or contains"
"an article, _Le, La, L', Du, Des_; under the word following when the"
"prefix is a preposition, _de, d'_: e.g., _Des Essarts, Du Cange,"
"La Fontaine, Le Sage, L'Estoille_; but _Charlevoix, P. F. X. de_;"
"_Estrées, Mme d'_."

"they are, enter under the _D_: e.g., _Debucourt, Decamps, Delisle_; but"
"_Bucourt, A. de_, _Camps, C. de_, _Lisle, J. de_."
"(_b_) In English, under the prefix, no matter from what language the"
"name is derived, with cross-references when necessary: e.g., _De"
"Quincey_, _Van Buren_."

"Dormer Stanhope)_. _Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)_."
"Cross-reference from _Stanhope_. _Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroi, Duc"

Authors should be put under their names. The definition of a name is
"""that by which a person or thing is known."" Noblemen are known by their"
"titles, not by their family names."
In the few cases in which the family name[50] or a lower title is
"decidedly better known, index under that and cross-reference from"
"the title: e.g., _Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam_; _Robert Curzon,"
"14th Baron Zouche_; _John Napier, Baron of Merchiston_; _Horace"
"Walpole, 4th Earl of Oxford_; likewise the military nobles and"
"princes of the French Empire: e.g., _Lucien Bonaparte, Prince de"
"Canino_; _McMahon, Duc de Magenta_."
Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be treated by the following
rules. In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries above her
"own rank she takes her husband's title in exchange for her own,"
if below her own rank she keeps her own title.
(_a_) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.

"say _Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness_; not _Brassey, Annie"
"(Allnutt), Lady_."

waking life. It may be worth while to bring forward a few dreams which
incidentally illustrate the moral attitude of the dreamer.
A lady narrated the following dream immediately on awakening: 'I had
murdered a woman from some moral or political motive--I forget what--and
had come in great agony to my husband with her shoes and watch-chain. He
"promised to help me, and while I was wondering what could be done for"
"the benefit of the woman's family, some one came in and announced that a"
"lecture was about to be given on the beauty of nakedness. I then went,"
with several prim and respectable ladies of my acquaintance [the names
"were given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who--so far as appearance"
"is concerned--was a well-known Member of Parliament, then entered and"
"gave a most eloquent address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc."
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason people are shocked at
nakedness is that they usually only see unbeautiful bodies which repel
"them because they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand, and"
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
"Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come before the name), as"
"_Hon., Mrs., Rev._, etc., should in the heading be placed before"
"the Christian name (as _Smith, Capt. John_), and suffixes as"
"_Jr., D.D., LL.D._, after it (as _Channing, James Ellery, D.D._)."
"Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name, as _Derby,"
"Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of_; but British courtesy titles (i.e.,"
"those given to the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede,"
"as _Wellesley, Lord Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)_. In"
"other languages than English, French, and German the title usually"
"precedes the forename; as, _Alfieri, Conte Vittorio_. Occasionally a"
"French nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames; as,"
"_Gasparin, Comte Agénor de_."
_Lord_ should be replaced by the exact title in the names of English
"noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay should be entered as _Macaulay, 1st"
baron_. _Lord_ in the title of Scotch judges follows the family name;
"as, _Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord_."
"The title Baronet is given in the form _Scott, Sir Walter, bart._"
"Patronymic phrases, as _of Dedham_, follow all the names; but they must"
immediately follow the family name when they are always used in close
"connection with it, as _Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe_; similarly"
"_aîné_, _fils_, _jeune_, as _Dumas fils, Alexandre_; _Didot fils,"
Ambroise_. Latin appellatives should not in general be separated from
"their nouns by a comma; as, _Caesar Heisterbacensis_."
"The name of a king's wife should be written thus: _Charlotte, Queen,"
"consort of George III of England_. _Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of"
Henry VIII of England._

8. Psalm Versions.
"The use of the psalms in singing, first on the Continent, then in"
"England and Scotland, and later in America, brought forth many metrical"
"versions of the psalter, the principal ones being the following:"
"a. _The Genevan Psalter_, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It was"
"made at the request of John Calvin by Clément Marot, court poet of"
"France, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book"
"for the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the"
most famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was
issued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of
"tongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., “Old"
Hundredth.”
"b. _The Anglo-Genevan Psalter_, Geneva, 1556. This was used by John"
"Knox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions"
"of “Bloody Mary,” and formed a congregation at Geneva. The book"
incorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which were in
"use in England, and added others."
"c. _The Old Version_, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562. Used in"
"England for 134 years. It is entitled, _The Whole Booke of Psalmes_, but"
"“Watchman, tell us of the night” (66)"
“God is love; His mercy brightens” (55)
"Henry F. Lyte, 1793-1847, “Abide with me” (40)"
_2. The Oxford Group_:
"John Keble, 1792-1866, “New every morning is the love” (22)"
"“Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear” (30)"
"Matthew Bridges, 1800-94, “Crown Him with many crowns” (118)"
"John Henry Newman, 1801-90, “Lead, kindly light” (162-3)"
"Richard Trench, 1807-86, “Lord, what a change within” (183)"
"Frederick Faber, 1814-63, “There’s a wideness in God’s mercy” (58)"
“Faith of our fathers” (154)
"Mrs. Cecil Frances Alexander, 1823-95, “There is a green hill” (104)"
(_Translators of Latin and Greek Hymns_)
"John Chandler, 1806-76, “Christ is our Cornerstone” (9)"
“What star is this” (87)
"Edward Caswall, 1814-78, “Bethlehem, of noblest cities” (88)"
"“Jesus, the very thought of Thee” (155)"
"John M. Neale, 1818-66, “O come, O come Emmanuel” (67)"
"“All glory, laud, and honor” (100)"
_3. Translators of German Hymns_:
"Catherine Winkworth, 1829-78, “Wake, awake for night” (522)"
and 24 others
"Frances E. Cox, 1812-97, “Sing praise to God” (512)"
“Jesus lives” (543)
"Jane L. Borthwick, 1813-97, “Be still, my soul” (54)"
"“My Jesus, as Thou wilt” (250)"
"“Jesus, still lead on” (574)"
"Sarah Borthwick Findlater, 1823-1907, “O happy home” (358)"
_4. Other Hymnists—19th Century_:
"Christopher Wordsworth, 1807-85, “Gracious Spirit,” (174)"
“O day of rest and gladness” (285)
"Horatius Bonar, 1808-89, “I heard the voice of Jesus say” (142)"
"Spriggs's part, for as he was sailing off the west end of Cuba he again"
met the man-of-war which had so nearly caught him before in the bay.
"Spriggs clapped on all sail, but ran his ship on Rattan Island, where she"
"was burnt by the _Spence_, while Captain Spriggs and his crew escaped to"
the woods.
"SPRINGER, CAPTAIN."
He fought gallantly with Sawkins and Ringrose in the Battle of Perico off
"Panama on St. George's Day in 1680. He gave his name to Springer's Cay,"
one of the Samballoes Islands. This was the rendezvous chosen by the
"pirates, where Dampier and his party found the French pirate ship that"
rescued them after their famous trudge across the Isthmus of Darien.
"STANLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
With a few other buccaneers in their stronghold at New Providence Island
"in 1660, withstood an attack by a Spanish fleet for five days. The three"
"English captains, Stanley, Sir Thomas Whetstone, and Major Smith, were"
carried to Panama and there cast into a dungeon and bound in irons for
seventeen months.
"STEDMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"In 1666, with Captain Searle and a party of only eighty men, he took and"
"plundered the Dutch island of Tobago. Later on, after the outbreak of war"
"with France, he was captured by a French frigate off the Island of"
"Guadeloupe. Stedman had a small vessel and a crew of only 100 men, and"
"found himself becalmed and unable to escape, so he boldly boarded the"
name given to each being given also to the corresponding time
"division. Thus we speak of the CAMBRIAN SYSTEM, meaning a certain"
succession of formations which are classified together because of
broad resemblances in their included organisms; and of the
"CAMBRIAN PERIOD, meaning the time during which these rocks were"
deposited.

APPENDIX XI
"THE PRIZE COURTS ACTS, 1894"
The front matter is often put into type after the composition of
"the body has been completed, so that the number of pages is rarely"
"definitely determined at the beginning of the work. For this reason,"
publishers have favored the expedient of numbering the preliminary
"pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios for the text itself."
The front matter and the chapter pages running through the book
offer opportunities for embellishment and distinctive typographical
"treatment, and therefore should be kept in exact accord, whether"
elaborate decorations are used or the severest form of typographical
simplicity.

"history of the Low Countries, some have a special and general scientific"
interest. Among these is the research of M. Alphonse Wauters on _Les
"libertés communales_ (Bruxelles, 1878). Barante's _Histoire des Ducs de"
Bourgogne_ (4th ed. 1838-40) contains much interesting matter on the
"Burgundian period. The assiduous research of M. Lefèvre Pontalis, _Jean"
"de Witt, Grand Pensionnaire de Hollande_ (2 tom. 1884; Eng. trans. 2"
"vols.), throws a full light on one of the most critical periods of Dutch"
history.
"Dutch works on the history of the Low Countries in general, and the"
"United Provinces in particular, are many and voluminous; indeed, no"
history has been more amply written. The good general history of the
"Netherlands by N.G. van Kampen, which appeared in German in the series"
"of Heeren and Uckert (1831-33), is only partially superseded by the"
"_Geschichte der Niederlande_ of Wenzelburger (Bd. i, 1879; ii, 1886),"
which is not completed. But the most readable general history of the
"Netherlands yet produced is that of P.J. Blok, _Geschiedenis van het"
"Nederlandsche Volk_ (1892, etc.), of which there is a competent but"
"unfortunately abridged English translation (Putnams, vol. i, 1898)."
"Standard modern Dutch works are those of J.A. Vijnne, _Geschiedenis van"
"het Vaderland_, and J. van Lennep, _De Geschiedenis van Nederland_. For"
Belgian history in particular the authorities are similarly numerous.
"The _Manuel de l'histoire de Belgique_, by J. David (Louvain, 1847),"
"will be found a good handbook of authorities, episodes, and chronology,"
though without any sociological element. The _Histoire de Belgique_ of
"Th. Juste (Bruxelles, 1895, 3 tom. 4to) is comprehensive, but disfigured"
by insupportable illustrations.

"With these details settled, the sample page is next in order. Knowing"
that the book is to be a 12mo (size of leaf 5⅛ × 7⅝) or a 10mo (size
"of leaf 5½ × 8¼), the printer must ""lay out"" the page so as to leave"
margins of proper size and proportion. A 12mo type page may vary from
"3 × 5¼ inches to 4 × 6¾ inches. Somewhere within this area, in the"
"given example, the page must contain about 280 words. If the manuscript"
"is long, then the type page must be large, the type itself small (never"
"smaller than long primer[36] nor larger than pica[36]), the leads[36]"
reduced or omitted altogether. This is where the printer's taste and
skill is given an opportunity for expression: he is the architect
"of the book, and must not combine types or decorations which are"
"inharmonious, and his proportions must be kept correct."

6. Hymns of the Reformation: the German Chorales.
"The movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian"
"Brethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement."
Luther’s influence on the worship and music of the church was
revolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in church
song. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music had at first
been introduced for congregational use but it became more and more
"liturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian Chant"
which followed was never intended for use except by the priests and
trained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational
singing; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it into full
fruition.

4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.
Two great names are associated with the music of the Western Church:
"Ambrose, c. 340-97, known as the “Father of Hymnody in the Western"
"Church;” and Gregory the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and"
reformer of church music.
"Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but"
stimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed a
"large body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be"
"known as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar,"
"theologian, and preacher, Ambrose’s most lasting influence was upon the"
music of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.
"Gregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of"
"Ambrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,"
thus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and
variety. The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to
"be known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is “plain”"
"because unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the free"
"rhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian Chant"
remained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms the

contribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs
"represented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent"
"works of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,"
"Washington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical"
"contributions have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are"
coming into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for
"a long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others."
The tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in English
and German traditions. The _Hymnary_ illustrates this trend. It makes
large use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving a
"considerable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this trend,"
"the recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other"
"churches of English origin, incorporate some of the German chorale tunes"
and in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn books of our
time have become the channels through which flow the rich contributions
to the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian people of all times
and places.

"the English expeditions of discovery fitted out by him (Schanz,"
"_Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 321), but private voyages were"
"successfully made by traders (_id._ pp. 321, 327)."
"In the seventeenth century, however, and until far on in the"
"eighteenth, all Dutch shipping was more economically managed than"
the English. In all likelihood the Dutch traders knew and improved
upon the systematic control of ship-construction which the
"Venetians and Genoese had first copied from the Byzantines, and in"
"turn developed. (Above, p. 197.) Raleigh was one of the first to"
point out that the broad Dutch boats carried more cargo with fewer
hands than those of any other nation (_Observations touching
"Trade_, in _Works_, ed. 1829, viii, 356). Later in the century"
Petty noted that the Dutch practised freight-economies and
"adaptations of every kind, having different sorts of vessels for"
different kinds of traffic (_Essays in Political Arithmetic_
"[1690], ed. 1699, pp. 179, 180, 182, 183). This again gave them the"
primacy in shipbuilding for the whole of Europe (_Mémoires de Jean
"De Witt_, ptie. i, ch. vi), though they imported all the materials"
"for the purpose. When Colbert began navy-building, his first care"
"was to bring in Dutch shipwrights (Dussieux, _Étude biographique"
"sur Colbert_, 1886, p. 101). Compare, as to the quick sailing of"
"the Dutch, Motley, _United Netherlands_, ed. 1867, iv, 556. In the"
next century the English marine had similar economic advantages
"over the French, which was burdened by royal schemes for"
"multiplying seamen (see Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 37)."
"The frugality which pervaded the whole of Dutch life may, however,"
have had one directly disastrous effect. Sir William Temple noted
that the common people were poorly fed (_Observations upon the

"746, _note_, as to possible exaggeration. Cp. Burke, ii, 113;"
"Hume's ed. ii, 84). In the early Lutheran period the spread of"
scholarly Protestantism in Spain was extremely rapid (La
"Rigaudière, _Histoire des persécutions religieuses en Espagne_,"
"1860, p. 245 sq.), and in the early years of Philip II it needed"
"furious persecution to crush it, thousands leaving the kingdom"
"(Prescott, _Philip II_, bk. ii, ch. iii; M'Crie, _Reformation in"
"Spain_, ch. viii; De Castro, _History of the Spanish Protestants_,"
"Eng. tr. 1851, _passim_). At the outset, 800 persons were arrested"
in Seville alone in one day; and the Venetian ambassador in 1562
"testifies to the large number of Huguenots in Spain (Ranke, _Hist."
"of the Popes_, bk. v, Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. p. 136)."
Had Philip II had Flemish sympathies and chosen to make Brussels
"his capital, the stress of the Inquisition could have fallen on the"
Netherlands as successfully as it actually did on Spain. His
"father's reign had proved as much. According to Motley, not only"
"multitudes of Anabaptists but ""thousands and tens of thousands of"
"virtuous and well-disposed men and women"" had then been ""butchered"
"in cold blood"" (_Rise_, p. 43), without any sign of rebellion on"
"the part of the provinces, whose leading men remained Catholic. In"
"1600 most of the inhabitants of Groningen were Catholics (Davies,"
"ii, 347). A Protestant historian (Grattan, p. 93) admits that the"
"Protestants ""never, and least of all in these days, formed the"
"mass."" Another has admitted, as regards those of Germany, that"
"""nothing had contributed more to the undisturbed progress of their"
"opinions than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long"
"absence of Charles, and the slackness of the reins of government"
"Majesty's Ships of War, she may, with the Consent of the Re-captors,"
"prosecute her Voyage, and it shall not be necessary for the Re-captors"
to proceed to Adjudication till her Return to a Port of the United
Kingdom.
"The Master or Owner, or his Agent, may, with the Consent of the"
"Re-captors, unload and dispose of the Goods on board the Ship before"
Adjudication.
"In case the Ship does not, within Six Months, return to a Port of the"
"United Kingdom, the Re-captors may nevertheless institute Proceedings"
"against the Ship or Goods in the High Court of Admiralty, and the Court"
"may thereupon award Prize Salvage as aforesaid to the Re-captors, and"
"may enforce Payment thereof, either by Warrant of Arrest against the"
"Ship or Goods, or by Monition and Attachment against the Owner."

Yes.
You probably don't remember me.

I just wanted to thank you.
For?
"I was a student here, and you gave me some advice once."
"Winchester, right."
Right.
Yeah.
"You, uh -- You wrote that horror story."
This is going okay!
We're gonna be okay!
You do realize you're not getting out of this?
But you do realize you'll be good at crossing the road?

"Did she tell you, Hugh?"
My horse died.
Pie-O-My?
That's too bad.
"-God, this wine."
-There was a fire at the stables.
She had to be destroyed.
You should've seen her.
"String beans, Hugh?"
"-Baby, what happened?"
-He got jacked by some spics.
"-They took his ride, his fucking watch,too."
"-Jesus Christ, the Cartier?"
"-Christopher, you're bleeding."
-Stop touching it.
-Do you think I could get some money?
-What?
-Who are you?
-Eddie.
-From down the park.
"-He's good people, Adriana."
I took him home.
"He was all fucked up, but I straightened him out."
He owes me $30.
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What?
Get out of my house.
"-Don't stiff me on this, man."

What's the matter with you?
The guy's my friend.
That's your friend?

I'll go collect the money for you.
But give me a smile first!

That woman is crazier than any 10 people I know.
She wasn't expecting me to ask her out.
Rebecca?

"Oh, fine, thank you."
You Tickler?
"Yes, sir."
"Well, Rick sent me."
He said you used to work the Wiki-Wiki Club on Hotel Street during the war.
[ Chuckles ] Sure did.
Great club.
Lot of action.
Lot of fun.
Lines for everything.
Even to hear my music.
Times sure have changed.
- She work there?
- [ Tickler ] Oh.
Pretty lady.
Yeah.
You remember her?
"You know, her face does look kind of familiar."
Her name's Diane Westmore.
Yeah.
Diane.
Nice girl.
I remember when she died.
Lot of people cried.
She died?
That's right.
During the war.
The big one.
"In a car accident with some flyboy from Wheeler, I think."
- You sure it was Diane Westmore?
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
"Oh, I think it sounds like fun."
"I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
Oh.
We've already made plans.
What plans?
Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug?
Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off,"
I have to let everybody take a night off.
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me!
"Mr. Monk, come on, it's one night!"
"Well, then, I guess I'll just have to say no kay."
No-kay.
No-kay.
Which is it?
No or okay?
No-kay.
No-kay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever going to get.
No-kay.
No-kay.
I'm so excited.
No-kay.
She looks nervous.
Yeah.
"Well, listening it's better than medicating, no matter what they tell you."
Can I tell you something?
Yeah.
Sure.
Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
"-Hi, how are you?"
"-Fine, thanks."
You?
"Fine, thanks."
Did I leave you enough room?
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
I'll see you in the morning.
Another day at the office.
All right.
"-Hey, how's it going?"
"-Good, you?"
Okay.
"Hey, come on in the water."
It's delicious.
Maybe later.
Thanks.
You're always welcome.
"In fact, more than welcome."
"Obviously, you're welcome."
"Fucking hell, it's your house."
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.
Someone else got there first.

Look at this.
The druid symbol for sunrise.
(nigel:) huh?
"Okay, let's assume for the moment"
"That this is the sarsen stone,"
Referred to by the dagger.
"Alright, 240 peds from here."
But in which direction?
Sunrise...
East.
Underneath the druid's noch.
"Alright, 240 steps."
"Peds, very small steps."
Right.
"One, two Nine, 230."
"231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239... 240."

Do you have something?
I've got some string.
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-And you will learn....
-Excuse me.
I can't talk about it now.
"What do you mean, you can't talk about it now?"
"Four days already, you can't talk about it."
"Yeah, and you don't understand."
"I can't do it anymore, Frank."
You understand?
Why can't you do it anymore?
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?
-It's over.
-Come dance.
What?
What are you talkin' about?
"Bravo, Nicko."
Come here.
Come here.
This man saved my life.
I'm fond this man.

"Come on, you say it."
Say it.
That's it.
Come here.
So you never harmed any of your fellow Dauntless or the Abnegation?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I did.

And I...
(SOBBING)
I shot him first.
What was his name?
I can't.
What was his name?
Will.
I killed Will.
'Cause that's what happens to people when they get close to me.
They get hurt or they die.
I can't forgive myself.
Thank you for your candor.

"Ah, Helen."

[Claire] I don't care what you say.
"Lfhe's good-looking, I don't give him to anybody."
So you mean we don't have a chance around you.
Is that what we're saying?
"- Oh, no."
I don't say that at all.
- Oh.
I take him fast and whisk him away.

"No, actually."
"He's kind of looking forward to it,"
Because it's sort of like two stunts in one.
"It's a regular fire burn and the stair fall,"
So he wants it for his reel.

Every time he feels old.
He's in trouble.
"No, he's not."
Are you crazy?
You nearly drowned.

"Oh, definitely get a bottle."
Coffee for me.
"You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you."
Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes.
"No, I mean, I've only got one good eye."

Hey
"Aigoo, I need help!"
"Come, come!"

Not here!
Put down your swords.
"Long time no see, Your Highness."
I never dreamed of seeing you in a place like this.
"You used to act like you own everything,"
Now look where you are.
"You're a lucky man, Commander."

"Okay, I'll wait here."
"Listen, call me as soon as you find out anything, all right?"
You got it.
"Okay, Dave."
"Hello, Maria."
"Listen, I'm sorry it's so late."
That's all right.
Can I get you some coffee?
"Uh, no, no."
Would you sit down?
I just want to talk to you.
"Maria, I just left the hospital."
"Maria, Michael is dead."
- No.
"- Yes, he is."

If she comes looking for me and sees you then we got the screaming problem again.

You saved your daughter's life.
"You have her, now tell me his name."

"Yes, I am!"

He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up...
And there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it!

"Mrs Ransom, if I mentioned the name ""Dennis"" and the word ""blackmail"", would this mean anything to you?"
Yes?
Splendid.
"What I want to know is are you going to pay him, or are you going to fight?"

Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.

They've got no right dropping bombs!

Um... who... hurt... this man?
Perhaps using her own experience of pain may help to convey the question you're trying to ask.
Fen.
Hurt.
(slowly):
Hurt.
Hurt.
Pff!
Pfff!
Hurt?
Hurt.
(Fen moaning loudly)
"Yes, hurt."
Fen... this man.
Who hurt... this man?
Pa!
Pa!
That's the same gesture and sound she made
- when she saw you with Roland!
- Is she saying father?
- She could be.
- Paaaaa!
Ah!
I think she's trying to tell us who hurt Mr. de Jaager.
- (Fen):
Pa!
- You were feeding Roland when she became so animated.
Perhaps she's referring to the man who feeds her?
"Her keeper, Mick Travis."
Is she trying to tell us he is the killer?
(Fen grunts once.)
(Fen grunting)
"- How do you do, madame?"
My name is Louis Bernard.
"We thank you very much, Mr Bernard."
"- That's our son, Hank."
"- Hello, Hank."
Hello.
You talk Arab talk.
A few words.
Why was he angry?
It was an accident.
But the Muslim religion allows for few accidents.
"- Yeah, I suppose so."
- 0h.
- May I?
"- Yeah, sit down right in front of Jo."
"0h, I thought his name was Hank."
"0h, it's my wife's name."
- J-0.
No E.
- How different.
Short for Josephine.
I've called her that so long nobody knows her by any other name.
- l do.
Mommy.
"- 0h, yeah."
"Now, about the accident."
A Muslim woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.
They feed her intravenously?
"- No, Hank."
- What a big word for such a small boy.
(Laughs) I'm a doctor.
0h.
"Oh, but this is very important."
"I'm sure it is, and I want to hear all about it."
"Well, I'd like to start from the beginning."
After breakfast.
But this is very important!
"Now, what would you like?"
"How about some oatmeal and a nice big glass of milk, huh?"
That'll build up your strength.
I'll take a look down this way.

This was delightful.
It was an exceptionally tough looking game.
But we have a boy who refused to give up.
And that on the touchline proves to be a champion of responsibility.
- Brilliant.
- Tore is where he should be.
"And you can finally sleep, Stian, with a clear conscience."
- You're good at taking care of Tore.
- Yes very.
"Goodnight, Stian."

"Damn, it's complicated."
"There is no more behind, that is."

"Yeah, I'm out here."
We are saved!
It is a miracle.
We have received an inquiry from Asia.
A Chinese company from Kuala Lumpur.
"It sounds like a joke, but they seem quite serious."
They will come and watch factory.
Do you understand?
Wait a minute now.
One thing at a time.
Pacific World Group.
They are big.
Have you nothing to say?
-Fantastic.
"Yes, they are super serious!"
-Hi.
"Champagne, please."
-And Fish.

-This is the new reality.
The Chinese are unlikely worse than anyone else.

It looks like hobbit land down there.
There we have them.

IT GOT ME THINKING.
OUTDOOR TYPES ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE WOODS.
SO I GOT AHOLD OF A BUDDY OF MINE.
HE'S AT THE COAST GUARD.
"HE KNOWS A GUY IN PARK SERVICE, AND I SAID,"
"""THERE'S A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF PATR_N IN IT FOR YOU --"""
"JUST TELL ME, SAM."

YEAH.
"I'D GO THERE WITH YOU,"
BUT VERONICA SORT OF SET UP A MINI VACATION IN BOCA --
ONE OF THOSE SWIMMING-WITH-THE-DOLPHINS --
"I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, SAM."
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU FOUND HIM SO QUICKLY.
THAT'S AMAZING.
MY FRIEND SAM MAY HAVE BRUISED
"A COUPLE OF FEDERAL STATUTES ALONG THE WAY,"
BUT NOTHING A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA CAN'T SMOOTH OVER.
"WELL, HE WON'T GET IN TROUBLE?"
WE FOUND HIM.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.
IS THAT LOADED?
YEAH.
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA BRING THAT WHEN YOU GO GET JASPER, RIGHT?"
IT'LL BE FINE.
TRUST ME.
THIS IS IT?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY GETTING HURT.
And I think you know what I want from you.
I think you know very well.
Hello?
It's me.
"Claire, hello."
"Yeah, I'm here."
Is Tracey there?
"Yeah, sure."
You want to talk to her?
She called me today.
She wanted me to call back.
"I know, she told me."
"Um, Tracey's asleep."
She's in bed.
Already?
Is she okay?
What's wrong?
She waited for you to call all day.
She's drawing things I don't understand and waking up at night.
"No, she's not okay."
Is there anything I can do?
"Let's talk about this another time, okay?"
I'll tell her you called.
Okay.
Nathan.
Nathan!
Nathan.
"Listen, I came to apologize for this morning."
I was a little heavy-handed and I wanted to apologize.
I have something to show you not far from here.
"Nathan, wait."
Listen.
"And hey, I grabbed Emma's hand without even thinking about it."
Uh-huh!

"Hey, didn't you hear the bell?"
I'm testing the sound on the FlowerCam Mark 3.
"Oh, wow!"
- Holy crap.
I knew it was you.
I haven't seen you in years.
"Hey-Hey-Hey, Frankie, it's me."
Bobby Thunderson.

Yes.
"Yes, Bobby."
- Look at you!
You... really let yourself go.
"Oh-Oh, are you trying to get back into fighting form?"

"Hey, don't listen to everything this guy tells you."
You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round.
"Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes."
- Ass... hole.
"- Yeah, asshole."
"Okay, don't listen to anything he says."
He's a real creep.
Come here.
And... you're married.
I know.
"I keep looking down at my hand like, ""What the hell?"""
"And, um... you're living in a big house out in Gladwynne now?"
It's crazy.
It's got nine bathrooms.
Really?
Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.
It's not really enough to build a relationship on.
"WELL, APPARENTLY SHE'S GOT MOBLEY."
"NO, I MEAN TO ATTRACT A MAN."
"OH, FORGET THEM, LOVE."
I'M WORRIED.
ABOUT THE JOB?
WHAT ELSE?
KYNE WORRIES ME.
"HE WAS HUMILIATED TODAY IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,"
AND IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU MADE UP FOR IT WITH THE SCOOP ON MOBLEY ON HIS OWN TELECAST.
LET ME TELL YOU THE FACTS OF LIFE.
THAT BREAK WAS AN ACCIDENT OF TIMING.
IF ONLY I HAD MOBLEY IN MY CORNER.
HE KNOWS THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
DON'T YOU?
"OH, SURE."

IT MIGHT DO A GREAT DEAL OF HARM
IF HE RATS ABOUT IT TO GRIFFITH.
DEAR HEART.
"YOU WANT ME TO HAVE THIS JOB, DON'T YOU?"
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK THAT.
THEN GO TO MOBLEY FOR ME.

"Anyway, here I am, just one week late."
This is for my mama!
-What is this?
-You remember Merle?
Hello.
How are you?
Thank you.
Where's Michael?
I've got to talk to him and I can't wait on line.
You go see your children first.
Then you worry about waiting on line to see your brother.
Like everybody else.
Ladies and gentlemen...
A most distinguished guest would like to say a few words.
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary of the State of Nevada.
And there is Mrs. Geary.
Thank you very much.
"This is a very, very happy day for me and my wife Mrs. Geary."
We see Nevada far too seldom.
We're landing!

-There is no need.
"You, too, Tegan."
"You, too."
-Where are the others?
-Adric and Nyssa went to look for the Master.
What?
They should know better than that.
There's been enough unnecessary deaths as it is.
-What deaths?
-The murder of innocent Logopolitans.
And the murder of innocent Earth people.
-Earth people?
-Yes.
-Aunty Vanessa?
-Yes.
"I'm so sorry, Tegan."
I'm so sorry.
The Master is already at work on Logopolis.
I'm going to stop him if it's the last thing I do.
Nyssa!
-Did you find him?
-No.
"I've got to-- My homework, OK?"
OK.
"That was, um-- That was nice of you."
No problem.
She's a good dancer.

I'm sorry we made a mess.
"Oh, no, don't worry about that."
"So, what do you think about Shannon?"
"Well, l-- l think that she's--"
"She has good instincts, but she's, um-- she's at least a grade behind, and she can-- she has a way with the truth."
[chuckles]
"A way with the truth, right."

"Why don't you ask me some more questions, Sarah Beth;"
-About what;
-About her.
Ain't you curious about your mother;
You never think of her;
-What for;
-She's your mother.
I don't know who she is.
Don't you ever wonder why she's never come to see you;
-You always say good things about her.
-You always stuff your ears when I did.
She gave up a lot when she went away and she hasn't got much left now.

I AM NOT GONNA JUDGE PHYLLIS FOR DESECRATING CHRISTMAS.

I NEED YOU TO GET RID OF THE TREE.
- BUT--
"YOU KNOW, UM, DO A ""DAY IN THE LIFE"" KIND OF THING."
"WELL, OUR MEETINGS ARE USUALLY CONFIDENTIAL,"
BUT I'M SURE WE CAN ARRANGE SOMETHING.
"LOOK, I GOT TO GET JAMES TO SCHOOL."
YOU GOT ANY MORE QUESTIONS?
YES.
WHEN ARE YOU RUNNING?
MAMA'S GONNA PICK YOU UP.
YOUR FATHER SEEMS TO THINK HE'LL GO FAR
IF HE CAN HANDLE THE PRESSURE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME.
"OH, HE'S JUST SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS MOTHER, THAT'S ALL."
"MM, WELL, I THINK HE'S INTIMIDATED"
BY THE SIZE OF MY REPUTATION.

HOW ARE YOU TWO DOING?
GREAT.
"THINGS ARE A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT WE'RE GREAT."
"WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT."

"OH, YEAH?"
I NEED TO WATCH THAT.
THEY MENTION ME?
"NO, THEY WEREN'T SINGLING ANYBODY OUT."
YOU WANT ME TO RECORD IT?
SAM?
"UH, YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT."

"UH, MY MOTHER DIED FROM LIVER CANCER."
"BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS A HEAVY SMOKER AND BIG DRINKER."
"Yeah, yeah, it's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Can we talk about this on Monday?
"No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.

"Well, I understand that."
"Well, you boys about ready?"
Just a second.
DALE:

Keep the change.
"There ain't no change here, Hurricane."
It's a $12 check.
You give me a ten.
I'll catch you later.

I haven't had a full meal since I met the son of a bitch.
"2-10, go ahead, Jimmy."
Go over to Harlan Childress'.
Lureen said he's raising hell.
I'm on a case.
Unless he's trying to kill her I don't have time.
She said he is.
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mason."
"When I call you last night-- uh, meet Lieutenant Anderson."
We've met.
"You Mr. Norstaad's lawyer, Perry?"
"No, no, not for this."
For something else.
This morning I forget to call you and tell you I do not need appointment anymore.
But it is all right.
You send me bill anyway.
And now you turn around and go back.
Goodbye.
"Well, Axel, as long as I'm already here--"
"No, no, no, you're such a busy man."
We don't want to keep you.
Goodbye.
"Goodbye, Perry."
"All right, Axel."
"Good luck, Andy."
What's the matter?
They stop serving?
Mm-mm.
Floyd Chapman's over there.
"All right, let's have a meeting of the Bar Association."
Perry.
What on earth?
"Hello, Miss Street."
- Hello.
"- Well, Counselor."
[both] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't answer that satisfactorily.
Can you?
Don't see why not.
Master finagler!
"-Oh, right."
-(laughter)
"Drink up, boys."
"Ernie, uh, what have you been doing since you got out of the Army?"
I'm with some outfit.
"Come on, drink up."
"Oh, come on, come on, now, Ernie."
-What are you doing?
"-Well, it's a big outfit-- big."
"If I mention the name, you'd know it right away."
MORGAN:
What outfit?
What difference does it make?
I'm doing all right.
Believe me.
"Secret, huh?"
"Well, in a way, it has to be, yeah."
TUBBY:
I got it-- government work.
You could call it that.
Yeah.
You got a contract with the government.
For four years.
-Four years?
-Whoa.
I got a six months' contract.
Then comes cancellations and changes in specifications.
-How do you do it?
-Very simple.
"When the four years is up, I simply reen... uh, renegotiate."
-They're only too glad to do business with me. -(buzzing)
The tea is for Sifu!
Thinking of making a run for it?
Grab him!

That guy's involved as well!
He knows Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
Stop!
On your knees!
- Sifu...

You two have gone too far!
Committing crimes in my name!
You're the real Wong Fei-hung?
I've been too lenient with them.
"Marshal, please don't take offence."
I'll deal with them later!
"OK, Wong Fei-hung."
"I won't pursue this, for your sake."
"Marshal, thanks for your understanding."
"Tonight, I'll hold a dinner upstairs especially for you."
Good on you.
"Foon, come with me!"
Sifu Wong?
You've already learnt Shirt Pinching Toad Trap.
You don't need another Sifu.
Get out!

Hejira?
Hejira?
"I'm not even going to ask you to show me a first letter, because I know that's wrong."

There was this rogue bull.

He got behind the raja's elephant and tried to mount him.
"Uh, the elephant, not the raja."

Of course.
Ellie's been singing your praises all year.
It's great to finally meet you both.
"Emphasis on ""finally."""
Yeah.
I know.
"Um, I'm sorry again, Abby, about missing your Halloween party."
"Oh, that's okay-- I'm sure you had some... super big, top secret emergency NSA meeting that you couldn't miss."
"Uh, we were being audited, actually."
"But yes-- once again, my job forced a last-minute change of plans."
But not tonight.
No.
"We are spending the holiday in Turks and Caicos with Jake's family, no matter what."
"You better get going, then."
Gibbs.

"Jake, yeah."
How you doing?
Gibbs.
Wow.
I'm good.
"Um, listen, I can't thank you enough for what you've meant to Ellie this past year."
All of you.
She's earned it.
"Turks, huh?"

Yeah.
"Uh, the country Turkey might have been a little too on the nose."

I think she has no inter est in me at all.
Got to r espect her f or that.
"I don't even know her, and -- no joke --"

It's little painf ul to me that I'm not gonna be seeing her tonight.

Good evening.
"From New York City,"
I'm Dan Rydell alongside Casey McCall.
"Bats and balls, balls and strikes -- let's play ball."
It's time for spring training.
"You hear that, gentlemen?"
This is the sound of opportunity knocking.
Don't be slow to answer the door.
J.D. :
I still can't believe you did it.
His name is Vito Corleone.
We'll send him olive oil from here.
To his company in America.
"They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio."
"We'd like your blessing, and your permission to start work."
Where is this young man from New York?
Have him come closer.
I can't see him so good.
"My respects, Don Ciccio."
Give me your blessing.
Bless you!
What's your name?
You took the name of this town!
And what's your father's name?
His name was...
Antonio Andolini.
"Louder, I don't hear so good."
My father's name was Antonio Andolini and this is for you!
"Michael, say goodbye."
"Hi, Al."
"Can I speak with you for a second, Tom?"
"Tom, where's Mike?"
Waiting for you to leave.
-Can I talk with him?
"-Sorry, Fredo."
No chance.
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.
"Michael, it's Connie."
Michael...
"I'd like to stay close to home now, if it's all right."
Is Kay coming?
SAM:
"When I told Dad I was scared of the thing, he gave me a .45."
DEAN:
What was he supposed to do?
-I was 9 years old.
SAM:
The weapon training?
And melting the silver into bullets?
"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors, the windows, close the shades."
-Most important--
-Watch out for Sammy.
[GROWLS]
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
-It's called being a good son.
"-Dad's gonna be here, right?"
"He'll be here, promise."
"-Where is he, anyway?"
-On business.
-That's why you ran away.
-I was going to college.
"It was Dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
"Your brother and me, we needed you."
"You walked away, Sam."
-You walked away.
DEAN:
Stop it.
You're the one who said don't come back.
"You closed that door, not me!"
This isn't the life I wanted for you.
[SCREAMING]
"BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO SAY ""I TOLD YOU SO."""
"THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU, MICHAEL."
I KNOW.
"FIONA,I NEED YOUR HELP."
"OH,SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HANDLE THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN."
"YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF, COULD YOU?"
"SADLY,NO."
TAKE DOUG BACK TO THE LOFT.
LOCK HIM DOWN TIGHT.
"YOU CAN HANDLE THAT,RIGHT?"
HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN?
"BE CAREFUL,FI."
"DON'T WORRY,MICHAEL."
I NEVER LET MY GUARD DOWN.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T GET AHOLD OF HER?
SHE DOESN'T HAVE SOME KIND OF A --
"YEAH,ALL RIGHT, WELL,KEEP TRYING."
"MIKE,SHE'S IN SOME KIND OF A MEETING WITH A NEW CLIENT"
THAT JUST CALLED THIS MORNING.
"I MEAN,IT MIGHT BE NOTHING."
"IT'S NOT GONNA BE NOTHING,SAM."
HELLO?
Evelyn:
"Michael,if I had known you were this much fun to work with,"
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'M GLAD ONE OF US IS HAVING FUN.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress,are you?"
"""Michael,my son!"
I'm afraid!
"Please,Michael!"""
You changed.
This is more my style.
"Come, come, come."
You must be famished.
"Let me help you, my dear."
There we go.
That's better.
"Now, quite comfy, hmm?"
"Ha, ha."
"It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?"
[Match strikes]
"Uh, do you like it?"
It is rather a fine one.
"- [Laughs] - [Woman] Oh, my."
"[Clears throat] Sorry, Grim."
"Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks."
"Ah, very amusing. [sniffs]"

"- All right, all right, Jimmy, why don't you change the subject, huh?"
What else is in the news?
"- Well, Namath going to the Rams."
I mean...
- Who cares?
"- Well, I for one, don't like it."
Anyone care to weigh in?

The family is making an investment in Havana.
This is a gift for the President.

-Don't know.
"Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?"
No.
I've never met them.
"Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of..."
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?
I thought maybe we'd go out together.
I know a place where we can spend some time together.
Sometimes I think I should have married a woman like you did.

"In Cuba, Track 1 was, uh, the Bay of Pigs invasion."
[Chuckles] Track 2 was our idea.
We thoughtthat the invasion wouldn'twork... unless we got rid ofCastro.

Was itthe Mafia ormoney people?
So we puttogether Track 2.

You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?
"Oh, you're Jenna's favour."
This is Emily.
"This is Em, my daughter."
My father is a very special man.
It's nice to meet you.
I paid her to say that.
- Let's get started.
- Okay.
I don't know.
Just...
"Sorry, I gotta ask."
"You didn't marry Jim Finnerty from Sigma Chi, did you?"
- That guy was--
- An asshole.
"Yes, he was."
"This is my colleague, Special Agent Todd."
Standard Secret Service protocol requires a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.
"- I'm sorry, I just looked at him."
- You're only to look at me.
So we just-

The subject is John Cale.
"Born 1980, grew up in the District of Columbia graduated Hill High in 1999."

Married Melanie Schopp in 2002 and had a child six months later.

Don't you talk about Haziya.
At least use a decent knife.
What's wrong with you?
Unbelievable.
It's Isabelle Moretti.
So answer already.
"Remember, only Ricky talks."
She gave us exactly 15 minutes.

"Come in, you can leave the gate open."
Are you the one I spoke to?

"- And these are her sons, Natanel..."
- Pleased to meet you.
"Pardon me, I'm religious."
- And Shai.
- Pleased to meet you.
"At first I thought you were an Israeli producer, that's why I said I don't make movies there."
I don't like the Mideast any more.
Your smile looks like Jonah's.
- Did you know her?
"- No, but Maurice showed me a photo once-."
How is she?
She died three weeks ago.
I'm so sorry.
I thought her children wanted to bring her and Maurice together but I guess that only happens in movies.
Come.
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
And... and you're right.
You're right.
It's not... it's... it's not just about you and me anymore.
And being a good mother means doing what's best for your child.
"And you may not understand this, and you may never... forgive me for it, but I..."
I walked out that door tonight to do what's best for Lucas.

-Everybody to Hawaii!
-wonderful!
-It will be a great holiday!
"-Grandma, Iet's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie."""
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."
"""of your eldest brother..."
"""Suzujiro Haruno."
"""Ever since my father..."
"""came from Japan..."
"""to Hawaii in 1920..."
"""he lived with the pineapples..."
"""and he will soon die as an American..."
"""leaving me this vast farm."
"Oh,for crying out loud, I'm not gonna shoot you here."
"Besides,I need you."
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO TELL ME WHERE DOUG IS.
"OH,HERE."
YOUR CAR IS IN THE CAMPGROUND PARKING LOT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO RESOLVE OUR PROBLEM?
"WELL,I THINK OUR PROBLEMS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT,"
"BUT,YES, LET'S RESOLVE THEM."
"YOU KNOW,YOU AND I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL CONNECTION."
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHO I'M TALKING TO.
"OH,WE MET, IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING --"
ISTANBUL ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO.
"JULY,SEVEN YEARS AGO --"
YOU TOOK OUT THOSE TWO DIPLOMATS.
YES.
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU CAME TO CATCHING ME?
"NOW,THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE."
"AND EVER SINCE THEN, I'VE KEPT TABS ON YOU."
YOU MIGHT SAY I'VE BECOME A FAN.
I HEARD YOU GOT BURNED AND GOT THIS GIG IN MIAMI.
SO THE STARS JUST KIND OF LINED UP.
I LIKE THE NEW LOOK.
"AND YOUR BRUISE,IT HEALED."
"YEAH,WELL, THAT WAS TEMPORARY."
I'VE BEEN STUDYING UP ON YOU.
IT'S NOT EASY WITH SOMEONE AS SECRETIVE AS YOU ARE.
"BUT,OF COURSE,THINGS GOT A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU GOT BURNED."
YOU'RE NOT CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ANYMORE.
LUCKY YOU.
'CAUSE I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR EARLY YEARS.
"YOUR DADDY WAS MEAN,HMM?"
SO I FIGURED AN ABUSIVE HUSBAND
YOUR OFFICES JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL."
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
"A LITTLE OF THIS, A LITTLE OF THAT."
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN GETTING YOUR REPORTS FROM YOUR FBI BUDDIES?
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING THEY COULDN'T FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
"IF YOU TELL THEM,"
"THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES, DO THEY?"
"UH, I..."
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT TRAINED ME
IN THE DELICATE ART OF GIVING PEOPLE USELESS INFORMATION.
"I SAID NICE THINGS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH."
THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE A JOB FOR ME?
"A WOMAN I MET, EVELYN."
SHE HEARD I WORK SECURITY.
SHE ASKED ME FOR HELP.
I GUESS HER EX RAN OFF WITH THEIR SON.
"WE RAN CHECKS, CREDIT CARDS, AIRLINES, GOT NOTHING."
SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME LEGWORK.
BUT A JOB THAT SMALL -- NOT REALLY OUR THING.
YOU THOUGHT OF ME?
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A FAVOR IF YOU TOOK THE JOB.
AND THE MONEY'S NOT BAD.
MONEY'S NOT THE PRESSING ISSUE.
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
IDENTITY.
NOT FOR TRAVELING?
"MICHAEL, IF YOU LEAVE MIAMI,"
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT KIND OF THING.
- No.
- Huh?
Are you goin' sick?
- No!
"What do you say we ""popeye"" down to the Chez and have a couple of drinks?"
- I'm beat.
I'm gonna go home.

One drink.

These guys are real interesting.
And quiettoo.

It's notoften us Texans getan opportunity... to entertain the future president ofthe United States.
"Like you said, Jack, I'm justa New York lawyer."
- We'll see about that.

- I don't know aboutthat.
- He will!
I guarantee it!
"- [CocktailJazz] - [Chattering, Laughing]"
Whoo-hoo!
[Giggling]
- Where will you go?
- Into the wolf's den.
To be near the woman he loves.
The Dulce base.
-Are you sure you're not human?
How will you get there?
I will take you.
Jaelen?
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
Robert.
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE] Jaelen.
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE] Alyssa.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
"-Despite the circumstances, I'm happy to have known you, Robert."
-The feeling's mutual.
"-I hope that we've made a difference, you and I."
-We have.
"Jaelen,"
"I'd like to wish you good luck, but..."
-Luck won't help me.
"A miracle, perhaps."
-Where will you go?
-Chicago.
I've got a niece there that I'm quite fond of and a brother who hasn't spoken to me in twenty years.
He doesn't believe in all this UFO crap.
"-I see an exoneration in your near future, my friend."
-Human eyesight has been deceived for thousands of years.
-How so?
"Theywere, you know, conservative bible folk, butthey had a powerful sense of rightand wrong."
Forty years ago... [Chuckles] I was like you.
Looking foranswers.
- See?
- [Murmuring Continues]
[Boy] Tricky Dick himself.
My mother used to feed hobos stopping overat our house.
- [Haldeman] We got him.
"- [Boy] Don't push, pig"
- [Agent] Move away.
"- We're just rapping, my friends and I."
"In fact, we agree on a lot ofthings, don'twe?"
"[Girl] No, we don't."
"You say you wantto end the war, so why don'tyou?"
Change always comes slowly.
[Sighs] I pulled out more than halfthe troops.
I'm trying to cutthe military budget forthe firsttime in 30 years.
I wanta volunteer army.
But it's also a question of American credibility.
- Our... our position in the world.
"- Come on, Mr. Nixon."
It's a civil war between Vietnamese.
You don'twantthe war.
We don'twantthe war.
The Vietnamese don'twantthe war.
- So why does it go on?
- [Faint Voice On Radio]
"- You should be going, Mr. President."
- Okay.
Please.
"You can'tstop it, can you?"
Even ifyou wanted to.
"- Oh, Dr. Klein gave me this, uh, calorie counter."
"You know, it's amazing how much food you can eat if you eat the right food."
"I mean, like, I could eat a- a whole cow, as long as I didn't butter it."
- [ Doorbell Buzzes ] - [Emily] Come in.
Emily?
"Emily, wait till you see the present I picked out for-"
"Uh, Howard?"
"Uh, Bob- Bob, Howard's here."
"Hi, Bob."
"I, uh- I didn't realize you were here."
"Yeah, I-I kind of live here, Howard."
"Of course you do, and- and you should."
Uh
"- Well, I can come back later."
"I just, uh, stopped by to say hello."
- Yes.
Howard just... stopped by to say hello.
- That's right.
"Hello, Howard."
Hello.
"Howard, is there something you wanna discuss in private with Emily?"
"No, no, no, Bob."
"Uh, no."
Nothing at all.
"Uh, well, so you got a birthday coming up, huh?"
Wow.
Forty-one.
That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.
"I hope, uh, nobody in this room is, uh, planning anything for my birthday."
"Like what, Bob?"
"Oh, like people jumping out of closets, people jumping up from behind furniture... and, uh, expecting me to be surprised when I'm not surprised."
HMM.
THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE...
FOR A FEE.
THE FEE IS NOT AN ISSUE.
COME ON BACK.
I DON'T GET MUCH CALL FOR THE GOOD STUFF ANYMORE.
MOST OF MY BUSINESS IS JUST TEENAGERS
TRYING TO GET PAST A BOUNCER AT THE TITTY BAR.
TITTY BAR.
"THEY GOT NO APPRECIATION FOR ART, YOU KNOW?"
GIVE ME YOUR RIGHT HAND.
HOW ABOUT PULLING YOUR SLEEVE BACK?
"IF THIS STUFF GETS ON YOUR SHIRT, IT'LL NEVER COME OUT."
"AND SLIDE THESE ON FOR ME, IF YOU DON'T MIND."
"THIS IS YOU, ISN'T IT?"
"UH, KIND OF HARD TO TELL FROM HERE."
"PUT THOSE ON FOR ME, IF YOU DON'T MIND."
"IN SOME SITUATIONS, A TACTICAL RETREAT IS YOUR BEST OPTION."
"LISTEN, WELL, I'M SORRY AS I CAN BE ABOUT THIS."
BUT A GUY LIKE ME DON'T STAY IN BUSINESS VERY LONG
UNLESS HE SLIPS THE FBI A BONE EVERY NOW AND THEN.
AND LET'S FACE IT -- YOU'RE A BIG OLD SOUP BONE.
FLATTERED.
THEY COME THROUGH EVERY NOW AND THEN ASKING ABOUT YOU.
A GUY WITH A GUN IS A GUY WITH A GUN.
YOU CAN FIGHT HIM AND RISK SOMEONE GETTING SHOT
OR WAIT FOR BACKUP.
YOU'RE GONNA BE MY GET-NO-HASSLES-FOR-A-YEAR CARD.
"YEAH, SPECIAL AGENT ALLEROT."
"YEAH, TELL HIM IT'S JUMBO."
"WELL, HOW MANY JUMBOS YOU THINK HE KNOWS?"
"MIKE, LOOK AT THE DEAL I GOT ON THESE SHOES."
It's been the same for about 30 years.
Ah.
I need to be alone.
"Hi, I've brought a bottle."
I didn't know if that was...
I'm not really sure what the rules are.

"Hello, hello."
Hiya.
Hello.

Jack Dee.
Welcome to Jack.
Jack Dee was described by a fire chief as a hero and was once involved in extreme sports.
"Jack Dee, everyone."
APPLAUSE
Matthew Crosby.
"Nice to see you, Matthew."
"Earlier this year, he didn't go to see Morrissey."
"Thank you, Matthew, that's what I like to hear."
APPLAUSE
And I'm delighted to welcome Julian Clary.
Bon?
"Hey, Bon?"
Where?
Bon?
"Oh, he found out"
Really?
What happened?
He hugged her
Seriously?
I wanted to see that
"Don't worry, I'm recording"
Awesome
Please turn it off
Nope
I didn't ever wanna expose myself again but I'm still scared
I promise it will be Ok
It's totally not Ok
Like I said earlier...
I'm not interested in dating at all
Cause I'm an old man?
Yep
Yeah
Honestly it's a question of mental readiness
"Lin, look look!"
Lin look
No
Give it to me so I can delete it
It's the pic that your little sis kindly sent us
"You asked for it, right?"
"A little pouty, are we?"
"Here here, good boy"
I'm not little Moro
"""Only courage!"
"The results are shining!"""
"""You've no more business in the factory."
"The patents are registered in my name only and belong to me."""
The inventor has meanwhile become most needy and turns for the last time to the one who cheated him.
All pleas are in vain.
The poor man finds support under his comrades.
The inventor is a hero.
The conscience of the factory owner triumphs over greed.
The hard days are over.
The end.

WE SHOULD DEFINITELY KEEP TALKING.
IT WAS VERY NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
"YOU SHOULD SEE MY FRIEND, CLIO."
"CARE FOR A NIGHTCAP, CONGRESSMAN?"
"WHAT, ARE YOU DRUNK?"
YOU'RE NOT DRUNK ENOUGH.
WOULD YOU COME TO BED?
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?
WE WOULD BE SCRUTINIZED UNDER A MICROSCOPE.
"YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?"
WE HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE?
OF COURSE NOT.
BUT YOU KNOW THESE CAMPAIGNS GET PERSONAL.
"CERTAIN LEVEL OF BRUTALITY, EXPOSURE."
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT MOMENT
WHILE JAMES IS SO YOUNG.
"WELL, JAMES ISN'T LIKE HIS FRIENDS."
HE OBSESSES ABOUT PRESIDENTS
THE SAME WAY OTHER BOYS OBSESS ABOUT DINOSAURS.
"I MEAN, ISN'T THIS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED?"
WHAT?
I JUST NOTICED HOW ADORABLE YOU ARE IN MY SHIRT.
"No, Pavel Ivanovich"
How do you know about a soccer player?
"Is it rumors, or are there facts?"
"Ask your second real wife, she's telling everyone"
--May I speak to Kuziakin please --Nonsense!
She knows nothing at all ...about Ellie's existence.
She never even heard of her name.
Dammit.
Nobody's working today.
--Doesn't know?
--Nope --Never heard?
--Nope
"Sofia, good afternoon."
Vasin is troubling you.
--Cut that out --Hang on
"Sofia, do you know about the love affair between your husband and your neighbor Elvira?"
Who doesn't know about it?
--Then tell him that --Hey!
--He's in my office.
--[Reporter] Now can we talk?
!
--I of course understand that you're kidding...
--I'M ON BREAK!
"--But this is a bad, cruel joke, and doesn't become you."
--It's 2 PM!

"Sofia, try to see that you're creating an odd situation for everyone"
Why do I have to raise my grand-daughter in a lie?
She hung up
Now you know that she knows.
So what?

"You know, if I was a Cajun man, I'd say, ""Orange and dorange""."

Definitely two points for you.
"Now, young girls and the expanding universe are also famous obsessions of Allen Stewart Konigsberg."
- Or better known as Woody Allen.
- Woody Allen.
"Yes, Woody Allen."
Well done.
Half a point for knowing Woody Allen's real name.
- (Alan) A tiny fragment of a point.
"- (Stephen) Yeah, a fragment."
A pebble.
A little pebble.
An Alan of a point.
But Woody Allen is by no means the Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"Who is, Rich, would you say?"
The Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"It's Alan ""Big Al"" Allinson, who was so taken by his Celtic Breton background that he killed a lot of people with rocks."
No.
Would it help if I told you his name?
- (Peter) I think I know what it is.
- Yeah?
- Is it Alan Smithee?
- Yes!
Oh!
Ten points to you.
- Well done.
Absolutely right.
"ADMIT IT, MICHAEL."
YOU NEED ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN HAIRPIN.
I DO NOW.
YOU HAPPY?
"WELL, YEAH, I KNOW A FEW GUYS WHO DO I.D. WORK, MIKE."
"BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FEDS ARE GONNA BE ALL OVER THEM, TOO,"
ESPECIALLY NOW.
"FEEL THEM OUT FOR ME, WILL YOU?"
"MIKE, THEY SAID IF YOU LEAVE MIAMI,"
THEY'RE GONNA PICK YOU UP.
"IN D.C., THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEONE THERE"
WHO IS GONNA RECOGNIZE YOU.
THE BEST FAKE I.D. IN THE WORLD ISN'T GONNA CHANGE THAT.
THE GUY THAT BURNED ME TRIED TO HAVE ME KILLED.
"AS LONG AS I'M IN MIAMI, HE CAN FIND ME."
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES IN D.C.
YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP IS LUCY.
"SHE CALLED A WHILE BACK WITH A JOB,"
BUT YOU WERE PRETTY BUSY
"WITH THIS WHOLE BURN-NOTICE BUSINESS, YOU KNOW."
WHAT'S THE JOB?
"WELL, I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS, BUT I DO KNOW"
THAT SHE WORKS WITH SOME REAL ARTISTES.
THESE ARE THE GUYS
WHO CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE NEW LIFE TO GO WITH YOUR I.D.
YOU INTERESTED?
LET'S GIVE HER A CALL.
CORPORATIONS NEED SPIES JUST LIKE GOVERNMENTS DO.
"OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT CALLED SPIES."
THEY'RE CALLED SECURITY CONSULTANTS.
THEY'RE BASICALLY MERCENARIES WITH NICE SUITS.

(JIM SCRAPING FLASK)
Ree done that to you?
I'm just asking.
"Yeah, they done it."
They took their sweet time with it.
"At the start, I didn't feel nothing."
I just heard the sound of the knife scraping against my skull and them all laughing and whooping and hollering and whatnot.
Then the blood came.
It was cold.
"It started streaming down my face, in my eyes, and breathing it in."
Choking on it.
That's when I felt it.
I MET THIS GUY WHO SUGGESTED I COULD MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY
JUST GOING ON A FEW DATES FOR AN AGENCY.
HE WAS RIGHT.
THAT HOW YOU MET THE DEFENDANT?
NO.
ELITE ENCOUNTERS ONLY SERVICED VERY HIGH-END CLIENTS.
"POLITICIANS, PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN."
"I, UH, SAVED THE LOWLIFES FOR MY PERSONAL LIFE."
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE MAKES YOU
AN EXPERT IN LYING?
NO.
"NO, IT'S -"
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ABOUT FULFILLING PEOPLE'S FANTASIES
WHILE MINIMIZING THEIR GUILT.
I'D SAY BEING A LAWYER
IS PROBABLY BETTER TRAINING FOR LYING.
BUT YOU DO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD.
NOT FOR LYING.
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS ABOUT IT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS A STREET WALKER.
YOU THINK THE JURY WOULD PERCEIVE THAT DISTINCTION?
THE MEN WILL.
- WOW.
- HMM.
YEAH.
I KNOW I SHOULD REALLY PUSH THE PARENT ISSUE.
THE JURY MIGHT GET PAST IT
IF THEY SEE HER AS AN ABANDONED KID UP THERE.
MAYBE.
EVERYONE'S GOT A DARK SIDE YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET TO SEE.
I THINK JURORS UNDERSTAND THAT.

IN THESE DAYS OF CRITICAL COLD WAR TENSIONS?
NARRATOR:
"THE HOUSE COMMITTEE WAS TARGETING THE SINGER,"
"ACTIVIST, AND FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL STAR PAUL ROBESON"
AND WAS SURE THAT JACKIE ROBINSON
WOULD REFUTE ROBESON'S CLAIM THAT BLACKS
WOULD NOT FIGHT IN CASE OF WAR AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION.
PAUL ROBESON: [music] HE DON'T PLANT TATERS [music] [music] HE DON'T PLANT COTTON [music] [music] AND THEM THAT PLANTS 'EM [music] [music] IS SOON FORGOTTEN... [music]
ROGER KAHN:
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A BASS BARITONE SING
UNTIL YOU HEAR A RECORDING OF ROBESON.
ROBESON: [music] ...
JUST KEEPS ROLLING ALONG [music]
HE WAS ALSO A SERIOUS RADICAL.
HE WAS A GREAT FAN OF THE SOVIET UNION.
AND HE SPOKE HIS MIND.
ROBESON:
I' AND YOU LAND IN THE JAIL...
I'
HARRY BELAFONTE:
"FOR ME, PAUL ROBESON WAS"
THE TALLEST TREE IN OUR FOREST.
"ROBESON STOOD THAT STRONG IN OUR MIDST AS THE KIND OF VOICE,"
"NOT ONLY FOR THE ISSUES AFFECTING BLACK PEOPLE,"
"BUT FOR ISSUES AFFECTING POOR PEOPLE, SAYING,"
"""THIS IS ALSO OUR SPACE, THIS IS ALSO OUR TURF,"
"THIS IS ALSO OUR COUNTRY."""
NARRATOR:
"BRANCH RICKEY, FERVENTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST,"
HAD URGED ROBINSON TO TESTIFY.
I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS
ON PAUL ROBESON'S STATEMENTS IN PARIS
I WANT A BALLPLAYER
WITH GUTS ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT BACK.
THINK YOU'VE GOT GUTS ENOUGH TO PLAY THE GAME
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS?
NARRATOR:
"BUT IT WAS A ONE-DIMENSIONAL PORTRAIT,"
HELPING TO SOLIDIFY MYTHS ABOUT ROBINSON
THAT WOULD PROVE STUBBORNLY HARD TO DISLODGE.
SO I HAUL OFF AND PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE CHEEK.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
"MR. RICKEY, I'VE GOT TWO CHEEKS."
GOOD.
[SPECTATORS CHATTERING]
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, JACKIE'S ASSERTIVENESS"
BEGAN TO RANKLE MANY IN THE BASEBALL WORLD.
ROBINSON WAS CERTAIN THAT UMPIRES
WERE TREATING HIM DIFFERENTLY...
"MAKING BAD CALLS, TAUNTING HIM,"
THROWING HIM OUT OF GAMES WITH LITTLE PROVOCATION
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.
"LATER, THE ""SPORTING NEWS"" WOULD CALL HIM A ""CHRONIC GRIPER,"""
AND HE WOULD BE FALSELY ACCUSED
OF KICKING IN THE DOOR OF THE UMPIRES' DRESSING ROOM.
EARLY:
HE HAD A KIND OF FURY IN HIM.
"I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC, IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM"
TO SEE A BLACK MAN ARGUING AND BEING FEISTY.
IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT
THAN TO SEE THE ROBINSON THEY SAW AT FIRST.
NARRATOR:
"MEANWHILE, BRANCH RICKEY"
IN HIS PERCEPTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DAY'S NEWS-
IT'S ALREADY ON THE WIRE.
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR.
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
"AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING, IN OUR CITY,"
ONE HUMAN BEING TOOK THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.
"IN OUR WORLD, ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE NOT RARE."
"AND SO MY EXCUSE,"
"OR, I SHOULD SAY, MY REASON,"
"FOR GIVING IMPORTANCE TO THIS PARTICULAR STORY,"
IS MY HOPE THAT THE KILLER MAY BE LISTENING TO ME.
FOR I BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PROGRESS TO THE CHAIR
OR TO THE INSANE ASYLUM
"THAT HE HAS REACHED A WAY STATION,"
WHERE HIS SICK AND WARPED EGO DEMANDS TO BE FED
WITH THE MILK OF SELF-IMPORTANCE.
"AND SO, WITH THE CONSENT OF A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,"
"WHO IS BY WAY OF BEING A REMARKABLE CRIMINOLOGIST,"
"BUT WHO HAS ALSO ASKED THAT HIS NAME NOT BE CREDITED,"
"I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW THINGS TO THE KILLER,"
FACE TO FACE.
ITEM 1-
"MR. UNKNOWN,"
YOU WILL NOT FOR VERY LONG REMAIN UNKNOWN.
ITEM 2-

So ‎.‎.‎.

You're not going to leave you alone‎.
"Right‎, Max‎?"
"By Saint Andreasberg‎, then we'll cross the river‎."

Caped Crusader probably has Black Widow under lock and key at this very minute.
- Commissioner Gordon.
-This is Irving Irving at the just-opened Heritage First National Bank.
"- Yes, Mr. Irving."
-I just had a call from Batman.
"He wants me to take $40,000 in a brown paper bag to the front of the bank at exactly 11:43 this morning."
"-Well, that sounds odd, Mr. Irving."
He says the Batmobile will be parked there.
And he's arranged for Black Widow to meet him and they will split the money.
"Oh, well, then do it by all means."
"- Thank you for calling, Mr. Irving."
"- All right, commissioner."
Ha!
"Apparently, Batman is springing a trap on Black Widow."
That's good.
Are you sure you're gonna be able to drive the Batmobile from the passenger side?
"Perfectly, Tarantula."
"What time is it, doll?"
Exactly 11 :37.
"Got to run, sweetheart."
Keep an eye on the Dynamic Duo.
While my Batman and Robin do their stuff.
"Ta-da, darling."
"Well, Chief O'Hara, Black Widow's caper should be just about over."
And I should be hearing from Batman now.
"Yes, right on schedule."
Why isn't he calling on the Batphone?
Commissioner Gordon.
"Ah, ha-ha-ha."
Ro-
"- Robin did what, Mr. Irving?"
Oh.
I'm really embarrassed.
Grandma puts her hands together to worship what I cooked.
-And it was really delicious.
-That's true!
We're all counting on you from now on.
Look at this.
What is this?
"To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii, I talked about Suzujiro today."
Then Grandma started to remember the names of her brothers.
"""Tetsutaro."
"""Dozaburo."
"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."
"""Nabe."
"""Kane."
"Kyoko."""
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane."" So this is our Grandma, right?"
-eleven!
-eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
But they do not know how to wait‎.
Thank you‎.
"Hey‎, what's wrong‎?"
We have to take an alternative path for Saint Andreasberg‎.
"So we get to ""emptiness"" and go‎."
"Sorry‎, gentlemen‎."
We were told that the bridge is broken‎.
So we have to divert another way‎.
I do not mind the trip‎.
It is actually pleasant‎.
"But here we have a guy on the other hand‎, it ‎.‎.‎."
I'm not sure who likes shortcuts‎.
"You can go in the cabin if you want‎, sir‎."
I'm Lieutenant Goss‎.
Sergeant Jesse Owens‎.
"A pleasure to meet you‎, Lieutenant‎."
"Jesse Owens‎,‎.‎.‎."
How Olympic medalist Jesse Owens‎?
Exactly‎.
"Must be nice to confuse you with him‎, I guess‎."
‎
- Looks like a good guy‎. ‎
- Do you think‎?
‎
"- The man won 3 gold medals‎. ‎- 4 medals‎, sir‎."
Four‎?
It broke a world record‎.
I did seem to others as fools‎.
I can be liked‎.
¡Going‎!

It is the Right Cholla Navy's turn to save the people of this kingdom.
"June 2nd, 1592."
Yi Soon-shin's Left Cholla Navy launched another attack on the Japanese invasion force in Dang-po.
The enemy commander on this battle battle was Gurojima Mikiyuchi who had previously been routed in Sa-chun.
"Struck by Kwon Joon's arrow, Gurujima met his demise that day."
"In Yi Soon-shins 5th sea battle, the Battle of Dang-po, 21 Japanese ships were destroyed and 2.820 Japanese soldiers died in action."
"Winning is becoming a habit, High Commander!"
Sir!
"It's a counterattack, sir."
Alert the fleet!
Return to your positions and prepare for battle!
"Yes, sir!"
Third place:
"Kang Do-hyung, Min Hyung-suk, Han Joon-pil!"
Second place:
"Yi Suk-woo, Shin Jin-hwa!"
First place:
A scholar of Ahsan Song Byung-tek!
Make way!
Make way for the first place winner!

Make way for the first place winner!
Huh?

What's he doing on that horse?
Soon-shin!

"Soon-shin, what happened?"
How did this happen?
Why him?
How did that no-good bastard take first place?

Just a little tired‎.
"Then‎, ‎.‎.‎."
What happened up there‎?
What made Shonbeck‎?
Good ‎.‎.‎.
It's a long story‎.
"I do not know where it came from‎, but we caught past the farm‎."

What is happening‎?
Last night the Germans blew up the bridge‎.
They flew around the area‎.
They have engineers working on repairs‎.
And the rest of the convoy‎?
"We let them take risks‎, but the last to cross ‎.‎.‎."
got caught between the bridge and the river‎.
Luckily no one died‎.
It will take all day to repair that bridge‎.
So what do we do‎?
You have to take the 520‎.
That is why Saint Andreasberg‎.
It has a small bridge where you can cross‎.
And how far is that‎?
About 20 miles‎.
It's like an hour‎.
You better wait here‎.

And the boy a rose did see
Give it up!

"As they say‎, it's better than being in the back of the bus‎."
Sorry‎.
I'm not familiar with that term‎.
It's what the bus drivers told us in America‎.
"Blacks had to be at the end of the bus‎, even if it were empty‎."
What kind of behavior is that‎?
In me it seems fair‎.
"That I say‎, sir‎."
What happened there later‎?
Back off‎!
¡Let's go‎!
"¡Vamos‎, walking‎!"
The City hunter... is you!
He recklessly ran around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor... became like that because of you!
You killer!
"Entered the country on April 13, 2011."
"On May 2nd, he came to work in Network Security and Communication in the Blue House."
"When the Blue House's IP was used during the Lee Kyung Wan incident, I met Professor Lee Yoon Sung in this room."
"When the Blue House's IP was used to hack the police CCTV system, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo came."
He was even there in the library looking for the Blue House Security Agent Album from 83'.
Is it Lee Yoon Sung?
Seoul Prosecutor's Office's Investigator Jang Pil Jae is here.
Okay.
Let him in.
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo was investigating two people he thought might be the City Hunter...
Lee Jin Pyo and professor Lee Yoon Sung.
Lee Jin Pyo and Lee Yoon Sung?
Lee Jin Pyo was part of the Special Forces team.
And before 1983 he was definitely a bodyguard at the Blue House.
"However, he went missing after that."
So Prosecutor Kim Young Joo thought he definitely has something to do with the Sweep Mission.
"He now uses a new identity as Steve Lee, a Korean living in America."
But that's actually fake.
He was a drug lord in the Triangle...
although it's not confirmed yet.
Triangle.
Then Lee Yoon Sung?
"As expected, another Blue House bodyguard in 1983 who came from the Special Forces named Park Mu Yeol, and a woman named Lee Kyung Hee gave birth to him."
Park Moo Yeol and Lee Kyung Hee's...?
From what I found out...
Lee Jin Pyo took Lee Yoon Sung when he was 1 month old and raised him in the Triangle.
Wait.
I think the president noticed something.
"-Most interesting thing probably was, um, what appeared to be that broad head arrow mark."
But it's one of those universal characters
"-that, you know, it stands for the King's Mark."
"-Yeah, exactly."
What else can it stand for?
A directional symbol?
It may be an arrow that was used for a different purpose.
"Exactly, yeah."
I mean that's...
"All that is, is my take on it."
That's my part of history that I-I know.
"But, I mean, symbolically, is that symbol used by other people?"
I don't know.
"Well, it's a symbol on the 90 Foot Stone."
-Is that right?
-Yeah.
"A triangle is on the 90 Foot Stone, an arrow symbol is on the 90 Foot Stone."
"Isitpossible that what appears to be acarvingof aBroadArrow, or the King's Mark, issomethingquitedifferent?"
"Coulditbe , as Doug Crowell insists, anotherimportantclue-- onelinkingthecarvings found at New Ross tothe90 FootStone found buried intheOakIslandMoneyPit?"
"Tim, you've taken the first step on a longer journey."
-Yes.
-Congratulations.
Welcome to Oak Island.
"Okay, let's gear up and go home."
"Onedayafter the team's productive investigationatNewRoss,"
"Rick,Martyandmembers of the Oak Island team meetwitharchaeologist Laird Niven."

Okay.

All that crap you have a package worth just there‎.

Could you discuss the rebel activity and what this can mean to our businesses?
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.
"I assure you that, although the rebels have started a campaign in Las Villas,"
That's true‎.
Do you know the Helcats‎?
Yes‎.
I spent two years training maneuvers in the field with 827‎.
I came here and started to be in action in November‎.
Does the 827‎?
Seriously‎?
It is part of Division 12‎.
Correct‎.
So where did they get the Helcats‎?
‎
- I have no idea‎.
Only appeared in March‎. ‎
- Marzo‎?
"We were in Togans for most of the war and then change us by M18‎, just 2 weeks of training maneuvers‎."
Why‎?
Helcats is that we removed in February and look at this log ‎.‎.‎.
and it seems quite familiar‎.
Seriously‎?
"¿Oye‎, Simms‎?"
What‎?
Think you telling the truth‎?
Which part‎?
Do you think your Helkath was run by a bunch of black guys‎?
No‎.
He's lying‎.
I know why I do not like‎.
¿Fuistes you who assaulted the officer with an ax‎?

JACKIE ROBINSON WAS AN INTEGRATIONIST.
"SYMBOLICALLY, EVERYTHING HE STOOD FOR WAS"
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO CAREERS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WHITE PEOPLE HAD.
BUT THERE WERE LOTS OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO WERE UPSET WITH THAT

"It is located in Trnje, in 87 Paromlinska street."
"It was built by my granddad who was a railwayman, back in 1909."
"It was where my father was born, and so was I."
But we haven't been living here permanently.
My father was a teacher.
"I've spent most of my childhood in Dalmatia, and when I got back to my old house at the age of 17, boys from the hood kept calling me ""Dalmo"" for a while."
I'm a loner.
I teach history and geography at elementary school nearby.
"Circumstancially, I never got married, and I wouldn't find easy to move away from here since the house, like the rest of this street, is to be demolished soon."
I haven't been disturbed when I heard about this.
"For quite some time, I wasn't even paying attention to it."
"What do I need, anyway?"
"I begun serious thinking about the house, my departing and the whole neighborhood only when Fabian shown up."

RACHEL ROBINSON:
"EARLY ON, THEY LIKED JACK,"
BECAUSE HE WAS BEING A GOOD BOY
AND HE WAS DOING WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD DO
AND HE WAS KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT.
"AND THE MINUTE HE DECIDED TO DEFEND HIMSELF,"
THEY WOULD CALL HIM UPPITY;
THEY WOULD CALL HIM A LOUD MOUTH TO DISCREDIT HIM.
NARRATOR:
"AFTER BASEBALL, HE WOULD SPEAK OUT TIRELESSLY,"
USING HIS IMMENSE FAME TO PROMOTE EQUALITY
AND CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EVERYWHERE.
BUT IN AN AGE OF PROFOUND SOCIAL UPHEAVAL
"AS HIS INFLUENCE DIMINISHED AND HIS HEALTH DECLINED,"
HE WOULD SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO FIND HIS PLACE
IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
HE HAD ONCE SYMBOLIZED.
"AND HIS HOME, ONCE A HAVEN FROM THE FIGHT OUTSIDE,"
WOULD SEE UNIMAGINABLE SORROW.
RACHEL ROBINSON:
JACK NEVER TALKED ABOUT CARRYING
THE ASPIRATIONS OF OUR RACE AS A BURDEN.
HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT AS...
AS KIND OF OPPORTUNITY.
"AND HE WAS PROUD, VERY PROUD, WHEN HE SUCCEEDED IN SOME WAY"
AND DEVASTATED WHEN HE DIDN'T.
BUT HE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO HAVE RACIAL EQUALITY IN AMERICA.
"AND IF WE DIDN'T, IF HE DIDN'T DO HIS PART"
"AND DIDN'T ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THEIR PART,"
NO CHANGE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

A CONVlCTlON APPEARED IMMlNENT... (Ruby) AAH!
Japonian martxotik aurrera iristen hasi zitzaizkigu heien antzeko sintomen kontakizunak.
Hasi nintzen susmatzen menturaz osasun kalteak handiagoak zirela telebistetan kontatuak baino.
"Ikerketan hasita, amak galdezkatu nituen, eta ohartu nintzne egoera zinez arriskutsua zela."
Hau martxo bukaera aldean gertatu zen.
Apirila bukatutakoan Japonia osotik hasi nintzen jasotzen hitz egiteko gonbiteak.
"Noan leku guztietan, Txernobylen gertatutakoen antzekoak entzuten ditut."
Haurretan oso antzeko sintomak aurkitzen ditugu.
Zu eta zure taldeak antolatu zenuten Japonian haurrentzako lehenbiziko kontsulta.
Esango diguzu zein izan zen gurasoen erantzuna?
Nola esango nizuke...
"Gure lehen asmoa zen besterik gabe gurasoei aukera ematea Txernobylgo haurrak ikusiak zituzten medikuekin hitz egiteko, lasaitu zitezen."
Baina teléfono deiak ez zitzaizkigun gutxitu.
Ohartu ginen konbidatu genituen medikuak ez zirela aski.
Berehala dei egin behar izan genien mediku boluntarioei.
"Hala ere sekulako jendetzak deitzen zuen, askori esan behar izan genien ez etortzeko."
Ikusten ari garen osasun arazoak ez dituzte erakutsi komunikabide nagusietan.
Baina SOS dei asko jaso dituzue.
Egia da.
Geuk ere begiratu dugu ea zer ari den gertatzen oraintxe.
"Fukushimako osasun kontsultaz eta osasun arazoen zainketa independienteaz egin dugu erreportajea; mesedez, ikusi ondoko bideoa."
"Fukushima hiria, Fukushima probintzian [zentral nuklearretik 60 kilometrora]."
Ekainean ekin zitzaion haurren osasun kontsultari.
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Fukushimako Sarea""ren ekipoak antolatu zuen."
Hasieran 150 haurrentzako behar zuen.
Baina eskariz gainezka zeuden.
"Azkenerako, 500 ume etorri ziren."
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Pediatren Sare Nazional""eko kideek aztertzen zituzten."
Nola dago hau?...
OK?
Ikus'tagun hemen...
OK.
Min egiten dizu?
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
Our good vibes are out for her.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, it doesn't."
BETH HOYT:

I just don't want to end up like my mother.
JULlE KLAUSNER:

"I would say ""Girl, Interrupted"" as well."
BETH HOYT:
You're both correct.
Points.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
We're going to drink anyway.
BETH HOYT:
You can drink anyway.
"Cheers, yeah."
Cheers because you got it correct.
All right.
I see how this game goes.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
This is not bad for boxed wine.

It's actually quite good.

A student at our school left the guy she had a crush on... and supposedly kissed another guy.
"On top of that, it was in broad daylight at school."
How could she?
Dumping someone like Baek Seung Jo.
Dumping?!
That doesn't make sense.
With a completely old looking sunbae.
"Ah, that girl!"
Really!
"Oh, look here!"
If you just leave like this...

Seung Jo came.
He came.
- It seems like Seung Jo doesn't know about it.
- He doesn't.
Oh Ha Ni even kissed Kyung Sunbae.

Kiss?!
"That's right, a kiss."
Oh Ha Ni is really great.
"She even said to him ""Can you do it one more time?""."
"Then, what happens with Baek Seung Jo?"
What do you mean?
Oh Ha Ni dumped him.

Are you coming with us?
Kate:
I think so.
James:
Yeah.
Amy:
Ok.
James:
Shall we go?
Connor:
So... why have you thrown your evening away to go on shift?
Kate:
James was going to come meet me for dinner but he told me you guys had to...
Connor:
Oh... sorry.
Kate:
"It's ok, don't worry."
Matt:
And how did James manage to convince you that vending machine food is going to be an acceptable substitute?
Amy:
"Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?"
James:
I told her.
Kate:
I insisted.
And it's a miss.
Will takes... down his second target.
He's slightly in the lead of Paul.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:
Missed.
Paul:
"Sheez, I can't see."
NARRATOR:
Looks like he has some problems with his safety classes fogging up.
And it's a miss.
Will has a miss on his third target again.
Let's see how Paul's going to catch up.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:
Paul's hit his second target.
Paul:
I wish I had a machine gun.
"Will ""Big South:"" See it."
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Yeah."
NARRATOR:

"I spoiled it for you, Johnny."
I spoiled it for you.
"If you hadn't listened to me, you would have been all right."

All I want is to do one good thing.
One big thing.

Everyone with cancer dies.
Why?
Does someone have it?
No...
Mom...
Mom!
"Mom, are you okay?"
Of course!
Why wouldn't I be?

Maybe we should--
-Haunt people so we can charge 'em a bunch of money to get rid of me so we can get super rich?

Connor:
Same place as last time.
Amy:
Same place as what?
Connor:
Cracked my skull climbing.
Connor:
They had to put a metal plate in my head.
Amy:
You never told me about that.
Connor:
It was when I went home for a few weeks.
Connor:
After Prague.
Amy:
Oh.
Connor:
I didn't mean it like that.
Connor:
Just give me a minute.
Connor:
And I'll see what I can do with the terminal.
Connor:
Is there anything up there?
James:
"There's a door, it's secure."
There's no one about.
I think we're safe for now.
Connor:
All right.
We'll stay here for a bit.
"I'll try and get through the firewall, see if I can get any help."
You have an atom bomb.
- Where is it?
Here it is.
- Here.
Here.
- Wait.
Kishen.
- Dad.
"Kishen, give me my gun."
Who are you?
"- Your father, you fool."
Dad.
"- Sorry, Father, I couldn't recognise your voice."
But I instantly recognised you when you called me fool.
Stop blabbering and pass me my gun.
- Here Father.
"Careful, Father."
Careful.
- Wait there.
"Stand just like that, one behind the other."
I will need only one bullet that way.
Let me see who saves you two today.
I will save them.
Grandma.
"Careful, grandma."
This glass piece might've hurt you.
"Rai Bahadur, what's going on?"
Why are you scaring these innocent children?
Innocent children?
"Look, what they've done to my plants."
"I know, I made them cut the branches."
Why did you cut the branches?
"Thanks for watching my video, and thanks to Nancy Blachman for giving me the opportunity  to collaborate with Vi, and thanks to Vi for giving me the opportunity..."
"If you haven't seen Vi's version of this video,  press the annotation on my left."
See ya!
-Hey!
"Hey, Kiwi!"
Hey!
"Hey, Kiwi, hey!"
"Hey, hey, Kiwi."
Kiwi?
-What?
"What is it, mate?"
I'm trying to read the paper.
-[laughs]
[with accent]:
"What happened to your voice, mate?"
[laughs]
"-Dude, I'm a kiwi."
I'm from freakin' New Zealand.
-Oh.
"Well, that explains the accent and the boomerangs."
"-I told you, we're bananas."
-Accent?
I don't have a [hiccup] accent.
-What's a hippo accent?
"-It's [hiccup] not a hippo, it's a... [hiccuping]"
"-Whoa, sounds like a Hungry Hungry Hippo."
[laughs]
-It's... [hiccup] it's not funny.

Hey!
Baek Eun Jo!
Chef!
Are you worried about something??
Oh!
Your face has a look of concern.
"Oh, are you finished?"
"Yes, of course!"
I cleaned everything.
Good job.
"Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?"
Huh?
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?
You can go home now.
"Yes, Chef."
I'll be leaving.
Okay.
Good work today.
- Get home safely.
- Yes!
"Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature."
No Ri gets fevers very often.
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.
"So, you should have been more careful around him."
"If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?"
I'm sorry.
Please be cautious.
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.
"Michelle, um-- [ Chuckles ]"
Do you want to be my date for the prom ?
Really ?
You seriously want to go with me ?
Yes.
Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards ?
Because that would be so cool.
"- Sure, whatever you want."
- Cool !
We're gonna have such a good time.
It'll be like this one time at band camp when we all had a campfire--
[ Knocking At Door ]
"[ Siren Wailing, Distant ]"
Hi.
- How'd you know I was here ?
- Stifler told me.
- Talked to Stifler ?
"- Well, I needed to find you."
We're gonna have to work on that song.
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.
So you work nights ?
- My dad's the manager.
- Really ?
Cool.
Tell him the subs are great.
-So you're going to Michigan next year ?
-Yeah.

Ataman!
Help us!
My cow!
My cow!
Ataman!
Those bandits have taken away my last cow.
"What did you expect, you fool?"
Get freedom without paying for it?
Didn't you scream when you gave birth to children?
And you expect to give birth to a new world without pain?
With no pain at all?
I've got small children.
It was my very last cow.
Your last!
"Remember this, silly woman:"
"Today they took away one cow, and tomorrow... they'll give you back ten!"
"- What do you mean, ten?"
- Just that.
Who had all the cows?
Who?
"I'm behind, but I'm thinking, ""You know,"
"I can lash pretty good, and I can lash fast."
"I'm going to catch up."""
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Here he comes, Rob."
Here he comes.
Paul finally made it.
Come on.
Let's go.
You need to get those lashings night and tight.
"Great job, dude."
Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" Done."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Done."
All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.
I really want to win this competition.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, come on, dude."
Paul's almost done.
You got this.
Aw!
Paul:
I got one more to go.
I hope nothing is wrong here.
- No.
How long have you planned to stay here?
Now I'm planning to settle down.
Jimmy!
Hey!
What's the reason of my friend's worry?
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
I've gone mad today.
Many girls came in my life and I forgot them.
But this one has impressed me.
Wow!
"Excuse me, Jaikishan!"
- Mr. Berry!
Senior sir has come from Delhi.
Hello!
"- Sir, he's Jaikishan!"
I had told you about him.
Oh!
Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.
"In a short time, you became a hero of our company."
I read your suggestions about Rajdoot motorcycle
I liked it.
- Thank you very much.
"So, mister."
"You got promotion, right?"
I never say anything wrong.
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
She has gone to visit a motorbike factory... ...with her Jimmy.

Lee:
So I got Chili Mac.
Paul:
I got Train Wreck.
NARRATOR:
Both these dishes are time-honored Boy Scout classics.
"The Chili Mac consists of ground beef, chopped onions, diced tomatoes, macaroni, cheese, and water."
"Train Wreck is a one-dish breakfast with bacon, sausage links, hash browns, and eggs, all mixed together with plenty of syrup."
Paul:
I hope you guys like what I make you.
Child #1:
"If we don't like it, you're going home."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"""

Children:
We're hungry!
Child #2:
Move quicker.
We don't got all day.
Paul:
He has also sent few of yours photographs together.
See!
God!
I look so fat.
Read what he says.
"Dear Damodar, many thanks for your help... you gave me in India."
India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.
Sleep!
Sleep!
Shyamaprasad Shrivastava!
Who's he?
I don't know.
But he wants to see you.
Send him in.
- Okay.

No!
Oh no!
NOOOOOO!
(bubble pops) (Twilight screams) (Twilight grunts repeatedly)
(Twilight shakes off confusion) (ponies cheer) Pinkie Pie:
"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight:
"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and  I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
"I mean, that hydra- (theremin music, Pinkie Pie shudders)"
Twilight:
Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie:
That wasn't it.
Twilight:
Huh?
Spike:
What wasn't what?
"Father, I think the water pressure was low."
So..
Father.
Father.
You're fool.
"That's a nice kurta, Kishen."
"Kundan, please leave me alone."
"Bhikhu, take his kurta off."
- Will I do all the work?
"No, Kundan, let me go."
Don't tear my clothes.
Mala's gang is here.
We'll deal with you later.
"Bhikhu, let's go."
Mala.
Are you fine?
Are you fine?
Those children stepped on me.
Who are you?
- I will tell you later.
Bye.
Mother is coming.

How could it not be THE DOOZY?!
What could be DOOZlER than THAT?!
Pinkie Pie:

Twilight:

I can't fight it anymore.

2NE1- Falling in Love.
Ju:
"Even though I like ""Do you love me?"" and I listen to it a lot."
FlL has something different; it's more unforgettable than DYLM.
"So I love it, every time I listen to it I feel like I'm on the beach..."
I don't know ... it cheers me up.
Jana:
"I feel like Falling in love and touch me over here, touch over there."
Ju:
Exactly.
That's the feeling.
So 1st place Infinite- Destiny!

Jana:
Fell in love.
Ju:
I did.
"The only that listened from them were ""The Chaser"", that we like very much."
"""Be Mine"" and ""She's Back""."
"So after ""Destiny"" I'm listening to everything, watching variety shows with them."
Jana:
She became a stalker.
Ju:
Yes.

"OK, OK."
I admit it.
"I was dishonest, selfish and wrong."
"Now, can I please just have my stories?"
"Jessica, you're on now."
But the stories!

"- Hey, guys!"

- Cancel it!
"- Yeah, like you can cancel it."

"- No, seriously!"

Hona GurePlaneta-TBk ikusleengandik jasotako emailak.

Sudurretik odol jario handia.

Neke handia.
"Ez haurrek bakarrik, adin ezberdinetako jende batzuek ere antzeko sintomak aipatzen dituzte."

"""Txernobyl:"
"Hondamendiaren eraginak gizakietan eta ingurumenean""."
Liburu hau The New York Academy of Sciences-ek argitaratu zuen 2009an.
"Egileak hiru aditu dira, tartean Alexey V. Yablokov doktorea, Bielorrusiakoa, Sobiet Batasunean Gorbatxov presidentearen aholkulari zientifiko izana."
"Aztertu zituzten 2004 aurretik plazaratutako 5.000 txosten zientifiko baino gehiago, ondorioztatuz milioi bat jende hilgo zela istripuaren eraginez."
"Kopuru horrek 20 aldiz bikoizten du ofizialki ICRP erakundeak aipatu izan dituen ""4.000 jendeen heriotzak""."
Yablokov doktoreak ohartarazten du sudurreko odola eta guruin linfatikoen handitzea erradiazioen kalteen sintomak direla.
Ofizialki esan da Txernobylek 4.000 jenderen heriotza ekarri zuela.
Baina horretarako oinarritzen dira ICRP bezala industria nuklearrari lotutako erakundeen txostenetan.
"Ez dago garbi nork duen arrazoi [ICRPk ala Yablokovek], baina bistakoa da bien artean sekulako tartea dagoela."
Nola ulertu tarte hori?
"Begira, ICRPk izendatu zuen batzorde bat gorputz barruko erradiazioak ikertzeko, baina desegin egin zuten."
Zergatik?
Batzorde horrek hainbeste urtean behin azterketa bat egin behar zuelako.
"Baina txosten horretan egia kontatuko balute, gorputz barruko erradiazioen arriskuak azalduko lituzkete, eta ezingo lukete jarraitu energía nuklearra sustatzen."
"Jende asko kaltetu baldin baditu barruko erradiazioak, ... iruditzen zait garaia dela kontutan hartzeko erradiazio mota horren kalteak."
"Bideoan ageri denez, Interneten zabalduta zegoen martxotik ari zela zerbait berezia gertatzen."
"Baina orduan istorio horiek hutsalak edo gezurrezkoak ziruditen, zientzialari batzuek berehala esaten baitzuten aldaketok ez zutela zerikusirik erradiazioekin."
Horrelako giroan jende asko ez zen ausartu hitz egitera edo arazo horien zergaitiak ikertzera.
He plays very well.
"And he seems very friendly. yes, Julio, my best friend is very friendly and"
likes all the girls.
Sorry if I missed some chunks.
I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.

"It fills you with energy, and makes you lightheaded."
- Rascal.
Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.
Abusing in the month of 'Shravan' (pious month).
See.
Truth sounds bitter than liquor.
There's a limit to cracking jokes.
"Papa, please."
"What you did yesterday, is a sin in mummy's view."

Reason for separation/found a new love Residence/Mapo
Mr. Jung Ha-seok.
I was sent by Choi Sook-hyun.
"You know her, right?"
Sook-hyun asked me to deliver this message.
Sook-hyun wants to break up with you.
"It was too hard for her to say it, so I came instead."
You understand?
Sook-hyun said she's met somebody new.
"Of course you're a good person, and she loved you."
"But without realizing it, a new love appeared."
Please don't take it too hard.
Wish her the best with her new love.
And she hopes that... you'll find a new love too.
With all of her heart.
"You heard me, right?"
Mom!
It'll be ok.
You'll get better soon.

Mom...
"Dad, don't cry."
Mom will hear.

Just give some indication if it's right.
"A three-digit number, sir, yes?"

"I mean, when you think of sexual violence, you usually think of a woman walking down a street at night."
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!
"- Really, sir?"
Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.

Masood:
Hi.
This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #16:
"Keep it up, keep it up."
There we go.
Teenager #17:
Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.

Mummy!
- Let go of my child!
"You! come, son! seema.. seema, you are here."
"I searched for you everywhere. seema.. seema, believe me."
This separation has tormented me a lot.
"Even my life has not been smooth, shekhar."
"I don""t know for which sin I am paying the price."
"For God""s sake leave!"
"Don""t force me to get you arrested."
"Don""t give people the chance to say.. ..that for 50,000 rupees a wife got her husband arrested."
"Leave! - seema, give me my child!"
Leave him!
"Don""t remind me that I am the mother of a smuggler""s son!"
"Mother, is he my daddy?"
Your daddy is dead!
He has ruined our happiness and peace!
What are you doing?
BETH HOYT:
I am demonstrating some different ways to sit.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I love sitting.
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I have a way to sit.
BETH HOYT:
Great.
Julie Klausner is adding to the more ways to sit on chairs.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"So this is a cool way to sit on a chair if you have like, a classroom full of students."
"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
I only bought the fish!
From where did you buy the fish?
"I bought it from my boss""s company truck.. ..that delivers fishes everyday."
I am so sorry! - so sorry!
"Hello, shekhar!"
This is for you!
Thank you very much!
Bye-bye!
Bye!
ls she the girl who dropped the beer?
Why did she come here? she came to apologise!
- Apologise?
And in this room? she is a mad girl!
And she left a present for you.
lf she had got it for me.. then why did she give it to you?
"Darling, we are in Europe!"
You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.
What does this mean?
This means that you doubt me!
"You are making me doubt you, shekhar!"
"I don""t know why I feel afraid."
"Now unnecessarily you are scared. come in the bedroom! oh God! ln the morning, bedroom!"
"ln the afternoon, bedroom!"
"At night, bedroom!"
Always bedroom!
I am fed up of this place!
"Let""s go home, shekhar!"
Please!
Are you really fed up?
"- Yes! okay, darling!"
"Reporter Han, search the portals more."
Reporter Song!
"Reporter Song, check if anything has come up in the gallery."
Yes &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;[ in French ]
Did you understand?
"If I don't give orders at the office, nothing works here."
Excuse me.
This is a non-smoking section.
Yes.
What?
What?
What!!!
Why?
Why?
What is this?  &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take 1's Won Kang Hwi is Gay...
"What to do, Ga Ryeong?"
Yes.
Hello?
Hello.
"No, he isn't here."
"I'm sorry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
What's this?
Is the broadcast still not over?
It looks like I have to leave even without saying bye.
"What time is the flight? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Announcement. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Boarding Korean Air TK009,  which was scheduled to leave at 13:50, will be delayed due to sudden problems with the plane."
What?
Why problems with the plane?
Omo!
Omo!
What is this about Won Kang Hwi?
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Now we're literally playing with power.
"Come on, jump."
Jump!
"Come on, Mario, jump!"
"God, how do I jump?"
"Come on, jump!"
Ass!
"Oh, jump is over here."
"Alright, here we go."
"Get the mushroom, oh-"
"Aw, now that's assy."
"Yeah, I know I use the word ""ass"" a lot."
I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.
"And when you finally, finally think you do have something that matches customer needs, you get to the next step, which is customer validation."
An Advaita Song
Satsang with Mooji
[Mooji:]
Hari Om.
[Questioner:]
When I came to Lucknow in '96
[M:]
They want you to put the microphone more close.
[Q:]
Yes.
"When I came to Lucknow in '96, it was a little... scary for me."
and I had the great grace to meet Papaji at that time and you remind me very much of him.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
He's here you know?
[Q:]
"Yes, I do."
And so at that time I wasn't quite ready to sing for him.
So I wondered if maybe I could  sing for you just a little bit.
[M:]
Oh yes.
[Q:]
A song that was in my heart  but never made it to my mouth.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
"Oh yes, please."
[Q:]
It seemed childish and simplistic.
"It was embarassing, and I felt I just wasn't ready at that time."
"So, we go."
"Row, row, row, your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,"
Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."
"Mackers, you ready?"
Joe Perry.
James.
"Crumpets, yeah?"
"Okay, tap turning - ready, go."
"And easy, just bowside backing down, arms only"
Didn't even try!
"2, blade in"
Check your gates.. 2 and 4 tap
Easy there.
(tapping the side of the boat)
Ffwwoooaaarrr!
34
"Louis - ""Doesn't matter if it goes to 34"""
Tap on Dave
Easy
"Do you get, like, half a pip higher than I do?"
"Louis - ""Don't know"""
Mackers gently
Easy
"Okay, stern 4 rowing on."
"Just stern 4, we're just tapping up the gap"
"Ready, go"
Bowside squeeze
"One more light, easy there."
Drop
35's just gone off
"Crumpton - ""Aaah, Yeah!"""
"Louis - ""If the weather gets shit, just fucking hang off it"""
"Back it down stern pair gently, stern pair back."
"Louis, back it"
"Easy there 36 are just going, 37 are just going"
"I mean, no one really knows."

Ryan Gosling and James Franco.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, I'm done with Ryan Gosling."
"I'm done with like, girls being like, isn't it interesting that I have a crush on Ryan Gosling?"
Because I'd kill him just to get those girls to shut up.
"And then James Franco, why not?"
It would be a project.
It would be an art project.
BETH HOYT:
Absolutely.
"That's the way he would see it, too."
"Not that [INAUDlBLE] it's just, you know, his view on everything, right?"
It's all art.

"'cause I--my biggest worry is, you know, of course, my bandages and stuff."
But I've been taking a sh--
"I know I can take a shower, but I haven't."
But I thought maybe I could at least try to take a shower before you got here.
Is that okay if I just go ahead and do that?
"Oh, good."
Okay.
Bobby:
"Dad, can I come down?"
Cathy:
"Bobby, can we have a talk, though?"

Oh.
Cathy:

"Because Grandma is telling me-- all the grandmas, all the friends are saying what a great boy you are."
And of course I know that.
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.
I've never been like this before.

I must try to inform the Tuan family first.

Go to Dali Palace.
A snake!
What's going on?
Snake... there's a snake!
"Your Highness, it's the gold snake from Wanjie valley."
It must be a message from the Chief.
"""Master Tuan is in the Stonechamber"""
The Tuan family Chief is here.
Please.
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
You cut off my legs with your Yi Yang Finger then;
Your children can pay for your debt today.
Where have you imprisoned them?
In the stone chamber;
About to be food for the gorilla.
"Zhengchun, don't worry."
I believe Tuan Yu is good enough ...to take on the beast.
Wait and see then.
Shameless old thief.
Tuan Yu.
"Quick, eat up the toad."
You've sucked up the Red Python's blood;
"And after you've eaten the toad, ...you will be invincible."
We have to get out!
"C'mon, eat it!"
Hurry.
"Tuan Yu, now you have acquired super power."
So you know our guys are looking forward to it.
It's an opportunity to play at home.
And to home course call it advantage if you want to but were looking forward to playing them at home.

"(Energetic) ""Hurricane"" MV THE END!"
This is Washington D.C.
After a little break some members will get ready.
I heard Him Chan and Jong Up will be filming first.
I didn't want to waste time in the hotel.
I heard the set is near here so I came out to skateboard.
I like it here so much.
"Hi, I'm Him Chan."
"""Hurricane"" MV is over."
We were filming for a real long time.
There were many different places we went to.
"And today, we came over to Washington D.C."
"As soon as we got here, Jong Up and I had to film for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV."
So we're out here and it's pretty nice.
Zelo is here too.
Zelo seems to like America a lot.
Look at him.
But I'm a little worried about something.
L.A. and San Francisco were very natural and free cities.
Washington D.C. seems like a noble place.
I'm worried that Zelo will get scolded.
We're at the MV shooting set.
Wish us luck.
Goodbye.
We're heading to New York now.
New York is the final destination.
We'll try our best in NY too and head back safely.
We're finally in NYC.
Honestly we wanted to go to JFK airport.
We'll go to Korea from JFK.

"I could not, was arrested and I will not allow it to stay with him."
"What are you talking about?I do not understand... is not possible you understand, my daughter. he is Arrestedand they do not allowto visit him. what do we do?"

We'll get through it.

"1116 01:35:13,517 --&amp;gt; 01:35:16,158 I wanted to thank him.I thought he knows it too."
"1117 01:35:16,800 --&amp;gt; 01:35:18,300 God damn you, Sude."

"1124 01:35:36,686 --&amp;gt; 01:35:39,015 I gave it to him as loan."
"Even if it's so, you did not tell me."

This is for you.
She liked it.

Her husband died a couple years ago so she's got - her parents own a house over there.
"So what was the island like back then when you came back you rented first, right?"
"Oh yeah, I rented for years."
"It was okay, it was good."
"A little busy, like you say, all the time."
But you still knew more people.
"Now, know more up at the hill at the cemetery."
"Like I said, nine of us graduated in '59."
Threw a 50th party here in July.
Who were those nine that graduated together?
Four of us lived here.
"Eleanor Moony, O'Donnell's wife."
"And Beverly Cantwell, now."
"That's Richie's sister by the way, the fireman."
Myself.
And Loretta Slader.
All four of us lived here.
Then we have Caroline [?].
She was Johnny Paul's sister.
Next to another Johnny in my class.
Jeanie [?] lived next to Archie's place.
And Sally Martin

We're encouraging everyone to chant Hare Krishna mantra
"Q: yet we're seeing now there's one quote in Padma-purana, the sa that same, without proper initiation, the mantra received is wihout effect."
So is it that those without proper connection they're not getting any benefit from chanting the mantra?

"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does."
"The subject is a noun, that's a person, place or thing."
It's who or what the sentence is about.
"And the predicate is the verb, that's the action word that gets this subject up and out."
Mister Morton wrote Pearl a poem.
Mister Morton wrote.
Pearl replied in the afternoon.
Pearl replied by a note.
Mister Morton was very nervous.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does!"
The cat stretched.

"(""Come here kid."
"Come on!"")"
Each sentence is completed when you know what the subject did.
Mister Morton knocked on her door.
Mister Morton knocked.
Mister Morton sat on her porch.
"Yes, he just sat there and rocked."
Mister Morton was a nervous man; when she opened up the door he ran.
Mister Morton climbed up his stairs.
Mister Morton climbed.
Mister Morton rhymed pretty words.
Mister Morton rhymed.
Mister Morton was lonely.
Mister Morton was ... until Pearl showed up with a single rose.
Who says women can't propose?
"898 01:13:43,485 --&amp;gt; 01:13:46,715 Yes, you can dress up in my room, no one is upstairs."
"899 01:13:46,715 --&amp;gt; 01:13:48,000 Okay."
"900 01:13:54,342 --&amp;gt; 01:14:00,259 Mira, can you take Safari from us please?"
"901 01:14:07,638 --&amp;gt; 01:14:12,433 Okay."
"Safari, come here buddy."
Well done to you!
"902 01:14:14,700 --&amp;gt; 01:14:18,067 You won't be frowning like this all night, no?"
"903 01:14:18,067 --&amp;gt; 01:14:21,300 I am sorry but I am not in a good mood."
"904 01:14:23,000 --&amp;gt; 01:14:25,635 Do you know what is your problem ?"

"928 01:16:15,800 --&amp;gt; 01:16:20,200 I am fine, what about you?"
We got experience
New coaches new teachers

Thats one section
Alright
Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."
"El Señor Balzar of the Agency ""Fuera"" spoke with you last week about making a reservation for us."
"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
"JlN Dal-rae, from Youngbyun, Yaksan!"
"Dad, you named me, so don't forget it."
Okay?
"Dad, you're losing weight."
"Good morning! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's Ji-hwan, a friend from neighborhood.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was out exercising, brought these for you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stopped his mental age around ten.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How pitiful, so I play with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Dal-rae! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's Young-hoon, my boyfriend.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good looking, huh?"
"Master of Taekwondo as well.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Always finishing in 1st place.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Took some time, but finally found myself the one.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Hi!
Keep practicing.
I missed you.
Changed your hair.
It's pretty.
Let me walk you to the lecture hall.
That's okay.
Hey...
Took three months just to grab your hand.
Feels good!
Looking for Ji-hwan?
Yes.
I don't see him anywhere.
Hasn't come to practice.
Doesn't answer the phone either.
Hmm...
Do it for love of movies.
"Hi, how are you?"
"Good, how are you?"
"Excuse me, but..."
Can you hand me the tissues?
Damn!
Stop!
I'll kill you!

This is the doctor.
I sure know that.
I would like to ask you something.
But tell the truth.
The whole truth.
What did you use before this performance?
"Rolls with meat pie,... and green tea."
Some meat pies are good dopes.
"All right, where's the talent?"
She has something strange...
"I don't think you had to use something, you're just that kind of type."
"You have no extreme talent, but you enjoy the singing, and I wanted to see it to the end."
A lot of energy comes out of her!
- Certainly!
"- It's strange, Paľo."
Yes for me!
- Strange.
- I felt good.
Something painful.
Mournful.
The singing grobian here just wants some notes...

"You took the day off too... 1037 01:27:23,200 --&amp;gt; 01:27:26,900 It was Nerges's birthday, I swear I stayed two hours."
"YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD SAlD SOMETHlNG ABOUT SPEAKlNG BRlEFLY"
ABOUT COLLABORATlNG?
"HOW DO WE DO IT?  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S THE HARD PART. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SAD ANSWER IS,  IT'S A GlFT."
I THlNK THERE ARE SEVERAL THlNGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF.
YOU HAVE TO SURE OF YOUR OWN TALENT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD RECOGNlTION AND FEEL SECURE.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE TALENT OF THE PERSON WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WRlTING.
"AND IF YOU DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE A COLLABORATlNG KlND OF PERSON... (chuckling) IF YOU CAN GET ALONG WlTH PEOPLE,"
IF YOU CAN GlVE UP SOMETHlNG YOU THlNK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
"AND ONLY FlGHT ABOUT THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THlNGS,"
"AND YOU TRUST THE TALENT OF THE OTHER PERSON COLLABORATlNG WORKS,"
"BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE WANT IT THElR WAY."
"WE COLLABORATED WlTH A WOMAN IN CHlCAGO AND IT DlDN'T WORK AT ALL,"
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T WlLLlNG  TO GlVE AN INCH
"ON WHETHER YOU SAY THlS IS A ""TAXl""  OR THlS IS A ""CAB."""
"I MEAN, ON THE LlTTLE THlNGS-- AND IT DlDN'T WORK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WASN'T A COLLABORATlON.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO."
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHlNG TO ADD TO THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH...
NO.
"ONLY THAT, UH, THE WAY WE WORK IS..."
"ONE OF US WlLL WRlTE  SOME STUFF,"
"AND THEN, TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER"
AND THE OTHER  HAS THE OPTlON
OF IMPROVlNG ON  WHATEVER HE OR SHE GOT
AND GOlNG ON FROM THERE.
AND THAT WAY-- ONE OF THE THlNGS WE WERE TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
DEBBlE WAS TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
IS HOW NlCE IT IS  WHEN PLOTS SURPRlSE YOU.
"AND YOU KNOW, WHERE THlNGS, YOU KNOW, COME UP UNEXPECTEDLY."
"WELL, THE NlCE THlNG ABOUT COLLABORATlNG  IS YOU SURPRlSE EACH OTHER,"
"SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY SURPRlSING EACH OTHER,"
YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF SURPRlSING THE AUDlENCE.
"SO, IT'S A LlTTLE LlKE CHEATlNG..."

Without Me in 5 4 3 2 1
He's TlNY!
"Even the mythical creature he's based on, the Tsuchinoko, is typically described as around 10 to 30 inches long- tops!"
"But in the official games, little Dunsparse is- er-"
WHAT?!
4 foot 11 inches???
But. . .uh
Why you make him so little?
I-I don't understand.
"Joining Dunsparce in the things-that-are-way-longer than-you'd-think club is Dratini, another serpant like Pokémon."
He's the first pokémon in his line so I've always thought of him to be the little guy.
WRONG!
5 foot 11 inches.
Longer than the average height of humanity.
"Also, this was always weird to me."
Dratini:
6ft long.
Dragonaire:
13ft long.
Dragonite:
7ft long.
Where?
Where does it all go???
Let's check out some spherical pokémon.
"I've always pictured guys like Glalie, Fortess and Gastly to be around a foot long or a little bit bigger than a basketball."
NOPE!
These guys are actually all 4 to 5 ft long.
See this guy?
See that giant ball?
That's a 5ft beach ball! and THAT is what your Glalie is gonna look like in real life.
"And yes, It is terrifying!"
"At last, at almost 48 feet long, Wailord is by far the longest pokémon in existence- over 17 ft longer than the second longest, Steelix."
"But weight-wise, Wailord doesn't make ANY sense."

Western illinois University and University Television Present Spotlight
Beth Seaton:
Hi.
Welcome to Spotlight.
"I'm Beth Seaton, director of sponsored projects here at Western illinois University."
"We're here at Knoblauch Hall, where we are going to visit Dr. Win Phippen from the School of Agriculture."
"And hopefully, the director of the School of Agriculture, too."
We're going to talk to Win a little bit about a program that has been funded here at Western illinois University.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Win.
Win Phippen:
"Hey, Beth."
How are we doing?
Beth Seaton:
Good.
I wanted to come over and talk to you a little bit about your new project.
Tell me a little bit about your new USDA project.
It's so exciting!
"It's like a half a million dollars, right?"
Win Phippen:
Yes it is.
It's a quite a coup for the University.
Beth Seaton:
It is.
Win Phippen: ...and my research program.
I'm quite excited about it.
It's very unique.
"It's not a hard core, sort of, science research project."
"It's more plant-breeding education, and with a component of science related to it."
And the real neat thing about it is that is has
[Laughing]
Ohhh...
"-	Yeah, I just don't know if it can be done."
"ThorZaiN moving forward, eating another Psionic Storm in the hands of a High Templar."
Another High Templar!
"Doing a nice Psi Storm, but ThorZaiN is trying to dance out of that."
He has a lot of Ghosts and EMP here.
"Dropping two EMP's, checking out that Dark Templar actually."
"But MC is coming back with a scary force, that is going to sandwich.."
-	Cloak!
-	And look at this!
"The Ghost goes trying to drop EMP, and they do on the majority of the units."
"This is about as good as it can get for ThorZaiN, doing some drop ship micro actually."
Taking..
Oh My God!
-	Ohhhhhh....
I think we should just have a moment of silence and hold hands at what we just saw here.
What is going on!?
"- Alright, we have Medivacs loading."
- Oh my God.
"Watch this, he is going to drop all over the mech army, this is going to be so sick cool!"
"Oh, I am so excited."
SlayerS BoxeR!
You are the funniest player ever!
- He is moving out.
"He unsieges, he may siege up again, but when he sees that many Vikings, he is going to have to land the Vikings!"
- He is..
Here comes the Medivacs!
- Oh my God!
"- Dropping all over those Siege Tanks, just crushing trough!"
"SlayerS BoxeR has out strategized GanZi, completely!"
-	Marines really want to catch the Corruptors.

"Ikus dezakezunez, síntoma ohikoenak dira eztarriko gorabeherak, zehazkiago, eztarri minbera."
Hirutik batek aipatzen du arazo hau.
"Bigarrena da sudurreko odol jarioa, %20 inguruk daukate."
"Ez bakarrik haurrek, baina 30, 40, 50 edo 60koek ere, edozein adinetakoek."
"Hirugarren síntoma ohikoena, diarrea."
Eta ondoren neke handia.
Kausak ez dira identifikatu oraindik.
Baina kezkatu nintzen ikusi nuenean 500 jendeotatik bakoitzak antzeko sintomak zituela.
Zer uste duzu emaitz horiez?
"Begira, Txernobyl inguruetan leku kutsatuetan bizi diren haurren artean sarri ikusi ditugun sintomak dira."
Horregatik ez nintzen harritu.
"Ez da harritzekoa, zeren eta gure gainean sekulako erradiazio kopurua erori baita."
Japoniako doktoreak ez daude ohituta gorputzean arnastuta edo irentsita sartutako errazioarekin.
"Horregatik, norbait ohartzen denean zerbait ari zaiola gertatzen osasunean eta erradiazioagatik dela... ... ospitalera jotakoan doktoreek esango diote urduriegi dagoela, edo ez diote entzungo."
"Horregatik jo dute jende horiek Internetera, edo gure webgunera."
"Ospitaleko diagnostikoarekin ez bazaituzte konbentzitzen, hobe duzu sospetxatzea zure arazoak erradiazioarekin duela zerikusia."
Batez ere orain.
Ez da harrigarri guri emailak bidali dizkigutenetatik gehienak ospitalera ez joan izana.
"Sudurretik odoletan ari zarelako ez zoaz ospitalea, ala?"
Ezta jarioa handia bada ere.
Ospitalera diarrea larriarekin iritsitako askori diarrea birikoa diagnostikatu zioten.
Baina birusen testak negatibo ematen zuen.
Quite a few people came home with the cause of their problems unidentified.
"As has been the case with ""A-bomb bura bura disease"" and Chernobyl-related health problems, medical tests don't reveal any abnormalities for such symptoms."
"If you take a blood test, nothing abnormal is found."
But the medicine you got won't stop your diarrhea.
"So the doctor, not knowing what to do, keep giving you stronger medicines or antibiotics."
"But if the cause is radiation, medicines are hardly effective and the mdical tests don't reveal any abnormalities."
Dal-rae...
Yes sir?
When did you meet Ji-hwan?
Um...
It was during 2nd grade... over ten years already!
"Dal-rae, Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yes, of course."
Actually...
I thought of a novel seeing you and Ji-hwan
And?
Stories of you two may be helpful.
They're not that interesting.
"So why don't start? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;When he was young Ji-hwan was often ignored.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's now a rascal but then a quiet kid who'd fight a lot&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so other kids avoided him a lot.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As your teacher, I want to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more about my loving students.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

Hey!
LEE Ji-hwan!
Did you see them?
The drawings all over.
You have runny nose.
"Here, wipe it off."
"Keep it, or throw it away."
Thanks.
Got something for you too.
It's not coming out...
Oh god.
Smells awful.
"Uninteresting, right?"
This is a great topic.
Became friends while removing scribbles.
But... who could that been?
Scribbling high up like that...
It's insufficient as much as I would thank you.

"881 01:12:08,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:13,800 What can he say?"
He says God!
Oh I thank you my gracious God!
"882 01:12:13,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:15,300 Yaman."
"883 01:12:15,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:19,508 What can I say, of course it's great, but only if it's 100% scholarship, 884 01:12:19,508 --&amp;gt; 01:12:20,971 if I succeed in exam 885 01:12:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:12:23,758 You will succeed dot com dot tr (.com.tr)."
That's all!
"886 01:12:23,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:27,500 As school is close to here you can continue staying here now 887 01:12:27,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:30,400 No, I will come and go."
"888 01:12:31,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:35,400 Here is the possibility for you."
Work and win!
Ok?

Thanks God!
"892 01:12:46,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:49,600 God bless you..."
"893 01:13:11,000 --&amp;gt; 01:13:15,100 Everything is ok, right?"
There is nothing to be taken or given.

"896 01:13:25,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:28,200 There won't be a next time."
"897 01:13:40,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:43,485 Wow, did you dress?"

"944 01:17:30,504 --&amp;gt; 01:17:37,199 No, the problem isn't continuing."
To the contrary we're celebrating that we returned from a mistake dear Sude.

"957 01:18:33,700 --&amp;gt; 01:18:36,334 Mr. Selim ,really we need to leave."
"958 01:18:36,334 --&amp;gt; 01:18:39,800 But look, if you go like this it will be like escaping as guilty, 959 01:18:39,915 --&amp;gt; 01:18:44,962 but if we go there as a whole family, all of us they will understand that all accuses are lies, 960 01:18:45,000 --&amp;gt; 01:18:48,100 and those who were up to something behind your back will be up a gum tree(surprised)."
"961 01:18:50,588 --&amp;gt; 01:18:55,066 If I were you I wouldn't let Mert down.- I love you."
"838 01:09:07,909 --&amp;gt; 01:09:11,238 We were in the first year at university when we got married 839 01:09:11,238 --&amp;gt; 01:09:14,728 Anyway I was together with them, during school."
"840 01:09:14,757 --&amp;gt; 01:09:16,957 He's funny."
"841 01:09:17,000 --&amp;gt; 01:09:19,900 - Am I lying?"
"- No, you're right."
"842 01:09:19,966 --&amp;gt; 01:09:23,428 I was 20 years old when I gave you the birth."
"843 01:09:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:09:27,100 God bless you."
-Amin!
"844 01:09:27,200 --&amp;gt; 01:09:30,000 No, I won't drink"
"845 01:09:33,200 --&amp;gt; 01:09:35,500 It affects my mom."
"846 01:09:35,514 --&amp;gt; 01:09:40,433 When I drink It starts playing a clarion in my blood."
"847 01:09:40,433 --&amp;gt; 01:09:42,675 Everyone understood it!"
"848 01:09:43,100 --&amp;gt; 01:09:44,741 :"
"It affects my cousin too, 849 01:09:44,741 --&amp;gt; 01:09:51,400 she has an increased level of endorphin in her body or something like that, with a single glass she gets drunk."
"850 01:09:51,502 --&amp;gt; 01:09:55,303 I have that thing increased then too, right Yaman?"
"851 01:09:59,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:02,536 You're a sound artist."
"852 01:10:02,600 --&amp;gt; 01:10:06,712 Ah mister who lost the artistry so that I could find it?"
"853 01:10:06,800 --&amp;gt; 01:10:08,700 I just sing songs... 854 01:10:08,900 --&amp;gt; 01:10:14,400 I brought up my children with my voice."
I earned my honor and bread with my voice.
"855 01:10:14,500 --&amp;gt; 01:10:18,500 When you were young you won a voice competition..."
"856 01:10:20,200 --&amp;gt; 01:10:23,269 err...in your childhood...I mean when you were major 857 01:10:23,269 --&amp;gt; 01:10:26,800 Be ate ease my kid, of course in my youth, I have wrinkles now 858 01:10:26,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:31,871 Not at all!"
"You're voice is very beautiful, Yaman told me."
"859 01:10:32,951 --&amp;gt; 01:10:36,227 Whereas he doesn't like me singing but 860 01:10:36,300 --&amp;gt; 01:10:40,000 Nothing like that, I just don't want you to work at night."
"861 01:10:40,179 --&amp;gt; 01:10:43,749 There is not any night club which works during the day, son!"
"862 01:10:43,874 --&amp;gt; 01:10:47,831 Thank you very much, I bothered you .May your hands be blessed!"
- Enjoy it!
"863 01:10:50,600 --&amp;gt; 01:10:55,100 When you're done we will leave! -okay."
"864 01:10:57,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:02,500 Yaman wants to walk away from us by running."
"- What a 865 01:11:03,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:07,800 I couldn't imagine a place like this even in my dreams."
Can one escape from here?
"866 01:11:07,900 --&amp;gt; 01:11:12,300 I wish I was this wall here so I would stay here ."
"867 01:11:12,600 --&amp;gt; 01:11:14,978 We can wait as much as you want."
"868 01:11:15,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:20,200 May God bless you."
All of us.

"No, we are not filming something like that."
[Josh]
Why not?
[Julian]
It's so dark.
I don't know.
(Signing softly to the cat)
"Josh I need to call you back, man."
I'm really busy.
(Gunshot)
Hi today I am going to tell you about three different kinds of pasta.
The first pasta I am going to tell you about is capellini.
"CAP-A-LEAN-E, also known as angel hair."
This pasta is long and thin.
The second pasta I am going to tell you about is spaghetti.
"SPA-GET-EE, spaghetti is similar to capellini in that it is long and thin, but it is a little bit thicker than capellini."
The third pasta I am going to tell you about is linguini.
LlN-GEEN-EE.
Linguini also means little tongues.
Linguini is flat and long and thin.
So next time you're ordering pasta you will know just what to ask for.

[Bleep].
I got it.
I've got it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Fire.
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We've got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stand back.
Just stand back.
[Bleep].
So it doesn't...
I've got it.
I've got it.
[Bleep].
"[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I yell fire,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and chef Ramsay comes over so valiantly."
[Bleep].
"Yeah, no, I just burned my hand &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when I had the clock there.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's fine.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Like a knight in shining armor.
- Everything's fine.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Brilliant. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Very brave.
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Okay.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You set the place on fire.
"- No, it's not funny."
"- You're right, you're right."
"Trust me, you've got your neck in a noose."
Be careful. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's crazy.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I think that's just the lack of experience. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're seeing a lot of people&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;who didn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to do trying to do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a little bit of everything.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

Whoo!
[Applause]
Well done.
"(Announcer) After observing and tasting throughout the challenge, the judges now take one final look to identify three standout dishes."
"Tom Hanks, Haley Joel Osment, and Robin Williams."
I'm going to connect together actors who were in movies together with lines that represents those movies.
"So Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a movie together called,"
"""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" that seemed like it was going to be very good but it was not."
"Bruce Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a movie together called ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America""--it was not a very popular movie."
"Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""The Terminal."""
"Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were in ""The Sixth Sense."" They were the stars of that movie."
"I will not tell you the ending, but Haley Joel Osment was also in ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks."
"Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Deconstructing Harry."""
"Cloris Leachman and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Gambit""."
"Danny Devito and Robin Williams were in ""Death to Smoochy."" All right!"
"Next I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Danny Devito, who were in a movie together called ""I'm Still Here."""
"And lastly, I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, who were in a movie called ""Billy Bathgate."""
All right!
"Now that we have the diagram, I'm going to start off with one of the actors."
Let's say Bruce Willis and I'm going to move around on this structure visiting all the movies exactly once and so let's see how that goes.
So there's lot of different choices to start off.
"Let's say, I'm going to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks to Stanley Tucci,"
"Stanley Tucci back to Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis to Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again, to Robin Williams to Danny Devito to Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment, and then to Tom Hanks, and now you can see that I've visited all of the movies exactly once and I ended up at Tom Hanks."
All right!
So let's try this again with a different set of actors.
"Now we've got Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts,"
"Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, and Meryl Streep."
And then we're going to put in some of the movies again.
"Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman who were in a movie together called ""Wag the Dog."""
"Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were in a movie together called ""Marvin's Room."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were in a movie together called ""Moonlight Mile."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Hook."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""Sleepers."""
"Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Stepmom."""
"Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts were in ""Flatliners."""
Nobody can tell from some of the movies and the actors that I've picked that I watched more movies in the 80s than I watch now.
"962 01:18:56,900 --&amp;gt; 01:18:59,383 If that's so, let's go and give joy to the fair 963 01:18:59,383 --&amp;gt; 01:19:03,900 But I am in this state, I mean my clothes are not so suitable, 964 01:19:03,900 --&amp;gt; 01:19:06,200 let me not embarrass you later."
"965 01:19:06,295 --&amp;gt; 01:19:08,652 We'll take care of it."
"966 01:19:16,600 --&amp;gt; 01:19:20,400 :"
One feels their self rich inside of this .
"967 01:19:20,700 --&amp;gt; 01:19:22,800 I wrote this favor somewhere 968 01:19:23,005 --&amp;gt; 01:19:24,661 They even talk differently."
"969 01:19:25,828 --&amp;gt; 01:19:28,584 One could be accustomed easy to this richness, 970 01:19:28,623 --&amp;gt; 01:19:30,383 One from me, one from you 971 01:19:30,424 --&amp;gt; 01:19:32,891 I say we should give an end to these deeds now ."
"972 01:19:32,891 --&amp;gt; 01:19:34,608 Agreed."
"973 01:20:07,962 --&amp;gt; 01:20:10,787 Have a nice time.."
"974 01:20:23,900 --&amp;gt; 01:20:29,300 Is this what they call a fair?"
- Easy!
"975 01:20:30,000 --&amp;gt; 01:20:33,900 We have 6 fairs per year in Tozluder.. 976 01:20:34,025 --&amp;gt; 01:20:36,100 all of them are ten times better than this."
"977 01:20:38,724 --&amp;gt; 01:20:42,106 Let's take fruit's juice ."
"978 01:20:43,200 --&amp;gt; 01:20:46,100 Hello, dear Eylul, did you see your dad, he was looking for you..."
"979 01:20:50,000 --&amp;gt; 01:20:52,500 Dear Gamze let's not walk around as a joint family."
"980 01:20:53,550 --&amp;gt; 01:20:56,308 See yin side of...°"
"981 01:21:03,732 --&amp;gt; 01:21:06,438 I have never seen so many rich people together ."
"982 01:21:19,300 --&amp;gt; 01:21:25,400 Mom, you stay here, okay?"
I will be right back.
"983 01:21:50,000 --&amp;gt; 01:21:54,900 I guess you would like this one in your hands to be real now."
"984 01:21:55,000 --&amp;gt; 01:21:58,700 It wouldn't be worth to spend my bullet for you"
"985 01:22:00,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:04,600 Are you begrudging Mira because of me?- Get out of my sight."
"986 01:22:04,900 --&amp;gt; 01:22:07,300 Nothing happened between us."
"987 01:22:07,719 --&amp;gt; 01:22:09,953 Got it.. 988 01:22:09,995 --&amp;gt; 01:22:12,295 the beating you ate was not enough for you 989 01:22:12,316 --&amp;gt; 01:22:16,238 If you want we can continue in a place, where is no risk of fire."
"990 01:22:16,866 --&amp;gt; 01:22:20,904 I don't expect you to thank me because I didn't give you away 991 01:22:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:22:26,600 but I thank you because you returned and took me out."
"992 01:22:28,019 --&amp;gt; 01:22:30,393 Get out of my sight!"
"993 01:22:30,500 --&amp;gt; 01:22:36,500 Someone who owes an apology to everyone shouldn't be so aggressive Orkun!"
"994 01:22:36,600 --&amp;gt; 01:22:41,000 We are aware of what you did and asked Yaman ."
"995 01:22:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:22:44,900 I am sure your family feels like that too."
"996 01:22:45,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:52,200 If they knew the truth they would have a big disappointment."

available today in US English and they're coming pretty soon in many other languages.
I hope you enjoy that.
Let's talk about another Cloud Computing Application; this is one of my favorite demonstrations.
"It's called Google Translate, which Eric called summation earlier."
"So the Google Translate App that's available today from Google Apps in the Android Market, allows you to type or even speak a phrase in one language, and then have it immediately translated and even spoken back to you in one of 50 other languages."
So that's pretty cool and you can try it out.
But what I want to do today is I actually want to show you a preview of a feature that we've been working on for a little while--it won't be out for a few months--it's called Conversation Mode in Google Translate.
"And for that, I'm going to invite my colleague Kyle over back on stage to help me out."
"Please keep in mind this is experimental, so it may or may not work perfectly."
"Nice to see you, Kyle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
Were going to be in Germany in a second. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Hold on, it says French. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
We're in Germany. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"So--I know, yes, so Kyle, I'm a tourist and you're a salesman at a local shoe store here in Berlin."
"So we're going to start conversation mode here, and you'll notice that I have a button in English and you have a button in German."
"So, our conversation would probably go something like this."
Do you have these shoes in size 41? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try that again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try it again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What color? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Black or Brown would be fine. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have black and brown. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Can you give me a discount if I take both? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Twenty percent. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Sold. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
"That's a deal, that's a deal. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Vielen Dank. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
That--this really is history because for 50 years people have talked about being able to do what you just demoed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:

"No, but I know what they taste like individually, so..."
"- Okay, well, don't we all?"
- Good luck. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Get creative.
Cold pan.
Cold pan.
"Felix, what's going on?"
Are you gonna try to pan-roast this and get the fat rendered?
Yeah.
It works better when the pan's on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) You might run out of time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I think that's good.
- Interesting.
- Yeah.
- Definitely.
"- Very interesting indeed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Becky, I mean,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; she's going for dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A rhubarb tart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So, look, working with both&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;hands at the same time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- I love the way she's multitasking."
- Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm really concerned about Samantha.
Would you put sweet potato with rhubarb?
Ugh.
That sounds disgusting.
"So Felix says she's gonna bring her, you know, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;restaurant experience.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"But her duck, I put my whole hand in the pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not even on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It could be good if done right.
"So, Scott, I don't know what zone &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's going into.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's doing a profiterole&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;with sweet potato&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and duck breast.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Profiteroles are a dessert, and they remain dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And they shouldn't be tampered with.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Now, you should be working on your finesse &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and making sure everything&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you put on the plate&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;has a reason.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Okay, five minutes left, guys."
Five minutes.
"Right, Tali, how you feeling? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene) Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Fire."
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stand back.
Just stand back.
Now what? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Takes place in - Water!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- A small island of China.
- Got it!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

Hey!
You wanna die?!
Sleep well? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My name is JlN Dal-rae.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Take care of your skin, you!"
Wrinkles on your face already! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My dream is to be a heart-bearing actress.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Guess you don't know, that sincere actors tell the life story through these wrinkles."
Kyung-hee wonders the street she was abandoned 13 years ago.
"An empty corner of the street, where she sees an alley cat, abandoned just like her."
Perhaps...
I may not be a human being.
I may be a cat instead.
A cat disguised as a human.
What?
You're a human disguised as a cat?
"JlN Dal-rae, you fool! shouldn't be crying now."
You can't even speak lines in public yet overacting when alone!
Again! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But there's&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;one problem.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I get so nervous speaking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in front of people.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;They tell me to drop my dreams.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However!
I have a magical spell&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;granting all my wishes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's... a secret.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Good morning mom!
What gets you up so early?
Is something burning?
"Oh my, what am I thinking?"
"Dad, must be dementia."
"I'm worried, aren't you?"
She's not even 50 yet!
"Yesterday... all of sudden... she asks, 'What's your name? '"
A mother forgets her own daughter's name!
Such a unique name too.

"Well, let's go write out the answer together in the interpreter."
"I'm going to start by defining my function small_words, and it takes a list of words as input."
I definitely want to iterate over each one.
"The problem definition said that we want those involving at most 3 letters, so those are the small words that we yield."
Now I'm going to add some debugging to see if I've gotten the right answer.
I'm going to use one of these list comprehensions because I love them so much.

"They, they, uh,"
How old are your kids?

Congratulations.

Where are you from?
"Uh, originally?"
Uh-huh.

Okay.
"Um, I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country"
"but,"
I've been to Charleston.
"Charleston, West Virginia?"
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway?"
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"enjoy it, but not for profession, no."
Yeah.
And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good
I gave up.
Yeah.
"Course, my mom thought I was,"
"but, uh, you know,"
"Of course,"
parents always do.
"Oh, yeah,"
"so,"
They're nice that way.
Yes.
"Well, what else can we uh, talk about,"
"uh,"
"Uh, well, I don't,"
"so you listen to kind of church music, gospel?"
"No,"
"no,"
"I, I listen to K V I L."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So I listen to the radio,"
I like the pop music.
"Oh, yeah."
"I like people like Neil Diamond and all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like,"
but that's who I go for
"Oh, yeah,"
the jeezer music as I call it.
"Oh, the jeezer music."
Yeah.
"Right,"
"and I, I, I mean, I don't know how,  how old your mom is,"
"she's probably,"
"let's see my mother's in her early sixties,"
so.
"She's, she's about forty."
"Okay,"
"I'm thirty-eight,"
your mother's
I just turned thirty-eight.
"Um, yes"
"I'm laughing,"
oh my God.
It does start to creep up.
Uh-huh.
"No,"
"um, but it's okay,"
"don't ever let age,"
"I mean, I don't"
Okay.
nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men.
"I, I just turned twenty-three, uh,  April twentieth,"
Uh-huh.
"and I'm still going, you know, oh my God, I'm getting so old."
"I just,"
"because me, myself, I just like to move really, really quickly."
"Yeah,"
"an,"
"I like to,"
"anything I do,"
I got out of school quick.
"I'm, you know,  I'm working quick."

That's okay.
"Okay, um,"

"I, I'm twenty-three."
"Oh, okay."
Uh-huh.
Well then I can tell you that roles have changed.
I'm thirty-eight
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
and they changed quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I,"
"this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago."
Uh-huh.
"And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know,"
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.
Uh-huh.
"Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it's hard to follow.
"Right,"
"and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL."
"Oh, I've never seen that one."
THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
"Okay,"
yeah.
"She,"
"I've seen a, uh, the previews for that."
It's very good.
"It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is it, uh, HANDYMAN."
"That's not what, uh,"
HOME IMPROVEMENT.
"Oh, we never miss that,"
or we try not to miss that.
"It's hysterical, isn't it?"
"Oh, we think it is, so funny."
Did you catch the Christmas?
"Oh, just part of it"
"I thought it was, you know,"
"and it had such a good story, too."
Uh-huh.
Did you see the end of it?
No.
"IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was."
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Are, you're a real life Trekkie?"
I think so
I really like them.
"I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,"
but
Uh-huh.
"uh,"
"Well, I've gone to, you know, one for real live Trek Convention"
"but,"
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"I saw James Doohan, you know, the guy that plays, uh, Scotty."
"Huh, did you get to talk to him?"
No
It was crowded.
Not in a crowd like that.
Huh-uh.
No.
"It was like, uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours."
Yeah.
Wow.
It was a pretty crowded place.
Huh. They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I,"
"it's, it's kind of funny."
"I, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. Uh, trying to think,"
"I can't quite remember the name of the book,"
We had a house in Port Aransas.
Oh okay.
"It's a little fishing village that is, Corpus."
"That's close to, uh, South Padre."
"Well, uh, South Padre is on down the bend"
Oh Corpus.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
"it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down, it would be in that region."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Small island.
Yeah.
"Uh,"
Yeah.
"I, I've been to Port Aransas"
"but, it was when I was a child."
"Oh, okay."
"Yes,"
"because I have relatives who live in Houston,"
"so when would go, and we would go to Port Aransas or then, on down to Corpus or further,"
"yeah,"
like what your talking about.
"Because I was just wondering, we went to Galveston this, this summer, even with all the oil spills and everything,"
"I mean, I was, oh, it was horrible."
Was it bad?
"I well never, ever go back."
"I don't think. Uh,"
"Oh, I hate to hear that."

"Okay,"
"well, um, thanks for hearing me rap, I guess"
"Got to go take care of the children,"
"All right,"

"Are you calling from Texas, by the way?"
"No,"
I'm in California .
"Oh, okay,"
the first person I've talked to outside of Texas.
"Yeah,"

Well.
"Yeah,"

"well, thank you very much."
"Okay,"
"well, I'm from the ."
Bye-bye.
"All right,"

"Okay,"

"I, uh,"
"what, what would you, what would, has your experience lead you to advise, uh, if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy,"
what would you say?
"Well, I'd encourage it."
Uh-huh.
"I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California."
Did you?
"And that was, uh, California,"
"I was thrilled to death, because that's, you know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, you know,"
"and, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York"
"Oh, really."
and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning
"and I'll get people you know, from out of the, uh, out of the state."
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California."
"I don't know why I ask people on the weekends from out of state,"
"or, uh, I don't know, you know,"
"but,"
I'll be darned.
Where you from?
Not from Texas.
"Uh, originally from New Jersey."
"New Jersey,"

Yeah.
Yeah.
My wife's from New Jersey.
"Oh, really,"

"Uh, well, I, I do, uh, real rough type camping."

"Huh, rough type, huh"
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh.
"Oh, yeah,"
motor homes can be a lot of fun.
"Yeah,"
they really are.
Yeah.
They really are.
"I've, I've enjoyed it."
"I've never actually done any, uh, like tent camping,"
"Uh, that can be a lot of fun, too."
Yeah.
How about you?
"Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping."
Uh-huh.
"This summer we went to, uh, the Smokey Mountain National Park. And, uh, stayed about three or four days in there."
"Oh, how great."
It was wonderful.
"Oh, yeah."
Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable.
Um.
And the days were nice and warm
"and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days."
Uh-huh.
That's great.
"Well, of course, being raised on the water I'd never swim in it."
yeah.
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
"Swimming is for swimming, pool."
Yeah.
That's why they call them swimming pools
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's where you swim.
You do not swim in the ocean.
No.
No.
No.
Not anymore.
"I've seen what comes out of the ocean,"
"and I have no desire to share, any space with anything like that."
"But, really, but huge sharks are down there."
Uh-huh.
I mean incredibly large sharks.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night"
Uh-huh.
"it was incredible the size of them,"
Wow.
the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties
Uh-huh.
"and it, you know,"
"so, just strung up,"
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
"yeah,"
"just,"
"my family, uh, didn't like Texas,"
"and I had a chance to, uh, transfer up."
"T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in ."
That's nice.
"So I got an opportunity to transfer back,"
and I took it.
"God,"
that's great.
"Uh, I'm a native Texan."
Uh-huh.
West Texan.
Yeah.
There is a difference.
"Yeah,"
"believe me,"
I know there is.
"I lived in Plano,"
and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano
Yeah.
"but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas."
Everybody else was an import.
"Well, I'm a West Texan."
Uh-huh.
"Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle."
Yes.
Yeah.
A different world from down there.
Yeah.
"So, uh, Colorado's been fun."
But they have a real problem.
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.
"And every time you look at a, look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar."
"But, that is God's country,"
it has to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?"
"Uh, no,"
"they don't,"
"they,"
"the last one, well,"
"the first time I was there, the, the tree was still standing,"
but it has since come down.
Okay.
Yeah.
"But, they are huge."
"If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe inspiring."
"No,"
"so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. Well, New Orleans and, uh, Minneapolis."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"well, there is lots of pretty country further west."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to be trailing out quickly.
Yeah
because there is lots to see
And she really enjoys it.
She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
"and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives"
Uh-huh.
and she's really enjoying herself.
She really likes it.
"Well, that's great."
"Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree."
Oh thanks
Hope you'll like it.
Yeah.
"Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?"
"Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas."
"Right now I'm in Utah, of course."
"Oh, uh-huh"
"So, um,"
"but, my family's there,"
"so,"
"yeah,"
I'd like to go back.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh, base of hospitals."
"Uh, I don't know about Dallas."
I think Dallas is pretty scattered.
Are you in San Antonio?
"No,"
"I'm, I'm in Dallas"
"Oh, okay."
but I'm originally from San Antonio
Um.
"and they've got large medical, uh, center down there."
They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.
"Let me see,"
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"
all right.
"Well, that sounds pretty good."
"Does, uh,"
"I guess the weather,"
does that stay pretty constant there
"or,"
"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"
that's not too bad.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"have you done, uh, any other boating then"
"or,"
"No,"
"I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,"
"but that's all,"
"I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop."
Yeah?
"And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about."
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah,"
"I,"
And we had a different boat every day.
"Uh, audiology."
Okay.
Fantastic. Uh
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.
Oh really?
"Uh, yeah."
Neat.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"It's, it's an interesting issue."
"There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few"
"and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot."
"I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures"
"but, uh,"
Yeah.
"I just,"
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
Uh-huh.
"So, I think it,"
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what
"Oh, is that right?"
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
Okay.
"Yeah,"
"I, I kind of,"
"yeah, I've heard things about that."
I've heard that they don't mess around very much.
Yeah.
"so,"
"Yeah,"
right.
And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
"Oh, I do, too"
"Oh, I do, too,"
"but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs."
I don't know why.
"I just,"
"if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember."
"Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch."
"But, uh, now I do,"
"before I go to work, I tape my soap opera."
"Oh, yeah."
I watch one
"and,"
"Well, I watch two,"
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
"and, and they lead into each other."
Oh.
And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
"Oh, okay."
"And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl"
"Yeah,"
that's been on for years.
"So it's just, you know,"
"it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years."
"Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them"
"Yes,"
"and I don't have anyone else at home,"
so I have freedom to watch whatever I want.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows"
and I like the comedies
"and you know, and I, I do like good movies."
Uh-huh.
"I prescribed, subscribe to H B O."
Yeah
"well, we,"
So I can get some of the movies.
"Yeah,"
that's a good idea.
"We did have H B O,"
"but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know."
It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Everybody
Yeah.
Yep.
That would have to be a blast.
"Yeah,"
"it really was, it was great."
"What,"
"well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area?"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"We went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon, again"
"and we stopped at, uh, uh, Las Vegas for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into Malibu in California over on the coast."
Yeah.
"And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, to, uh, Sequoia National Park."
Okay.
"Oh, wow."
"Okay,"
"Big Sur Highway, that's, uh, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, um,"
do you have any pets now?
"Well, we don't right now,"
no.
"We've, uh,"
"I grew up with, uh, with pets."
"My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,  some,  birds,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, right now we don't have anything."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, that,"
What about you?
"a matter of choice, or compulsion?"
"I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,"
"but that was years,"
"Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors."
Yeah.
"Some that, she had to, uh, label everything"
She had to label everything.
Yeah
"because,"
What was she driving?
It was a Cadillac.
Uh-huh.
"And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
and they quit making it.
Yeah.
They rebuilt it
"and it never did, never did run right again."
"Yeah,"
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
Yeah.
"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"
"Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that."
Yeah.
"Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?"
"Uh, the,"
"I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler."
Yeah.
"They,"
The starters are kind of fragile.
Yeah
"and the,"
"and, uh,"
"Oh yeah,"
that's right.
"It, it might have one best picture, too."
Yes
"it did,"
yes
it did.
Yeah.
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
"That was,"
"yeah,"
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
"but, uh."
"Yes,"
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
"Yeah,"
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
Yeah
"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
Oh.
"Is, is the Kmart there?"
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
you better believe it.
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
"That was, that was so funny,"
"he had to,"
or was it Kmart.
Yes.
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
"Right,"
right
"Yeah,"
"But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that."
"Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"
we like that.
Yeah.
"That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too."
Yeah.
"My son's getting to be a, a real good cook"
"so, uh,"
"Oh, neat."
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
"Oh, wow, that's great"
"Yeah,"
"I like it,"

How old is he?
He's eleven.
"Eleven,"
"wow, that's good."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
so
Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning
"or,"
"Uh, not every morning, uh,"
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss
"and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son."
Um. What kind of
"It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess."
pine?
But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
"and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,"
"the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard"
Uh-huh.
I guess he's young.
"and then,"
yes
He's about five and a half years old.
"Oh, he'll be delighted."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Now I just have to finish it though.
"I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work"
"and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,"
"because I've got it all cut out,"
"it's all, uh,"
I've done most of the coloring
but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
Did you do it with a jigsaw
"or do you have powered, you know, a,"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it."
Um.
So yeah.
"to do the, uh, the turn cut."
"Uh, how about yourself?"
"Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking."
I don't have lots of tools.
Uh-huh.
"and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, Vermont."
Vermont.
"So,"
So they wanted to make their homes there.
"Yeah,"
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
"Are they, are those two married?"
No.
"They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?"
"Well, uh, let's see,"
"yeah,"
"I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school."
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
"Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think."
Yeah.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
"I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T"
"and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself"
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
"Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late."
Right.
"And,"
"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
and have a happy Thanksgiving.
"Thank you,"

"the way I work, uh, the way I dress for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie,"
Uh-huh.
"or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day."
Uh-huh.
"A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day."
"I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, it was very different before."
How do you dress?
"Well, I'm a drafter,"
so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and I have sweatshirt on today.
Uh-huh.
And that's pretty much the norm for me.
"If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked"
"Yeah,"
I understand.
"They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress"
and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately
Once every five years?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, you have got a pretty big family."
Yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.
"Oh, yeah."
And you?
"Yeah,"
"we have a pretty big family,"
"but most of us,"
"well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia."
Uh-huh.
"Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania."
Yeah.
Most everybody is right in that area.
That makes it a lot easier.
A lot more convenient.
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.
Yeah.
because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
Yeah.
They put one together for our family about once every June.
"It was on my grandmother's birthday,"
"but she is, she is gone now."
"Yeah,"
see that is kind of what happened with ours.
That is why we have not had one in a long time.
Yeah.
Uh.
"So, so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do."
"There is, course, the the Grand Canyon"
"and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way."
Yes.
"And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
"and, uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too."
I imagine.
"Yeah,"
I would imagine they are.
"Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country."
Yeah.
I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now
"I think it's called a job,"
I don't know
"Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?"
No
not around here.
Oh.
Not around here
Place is forested with with those concrete trees.
"Uh-huh,"
"lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, I guess that's God's place, too."
"Anyway, Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?"
Yeah.
"Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California"
"I took, uh, three weeks."
Three weeks.
And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
"Yeah,"
"the whole family, then, was in on this?"
Uh-huh.
"It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six months pregnant."
Uh-huh.
"So I don't know,"
it worked pretty well.
"It was one of those, uh, those, dome type pop up tents."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Nice and quick and easy to put up.
Yeah.
Packs away nice and small
"and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto."
"Well, that's true,"
that's true.
It was a lot of fun.
"I guess the last real, uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years ago."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias."
"Wow,"
that's got to be beautiful territory.
"Yeah,"
"it's gorgeous,"
I love the big trees.
"Just, just the drive up through, uh, up the coast line and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though."
Yeah.
"What, like, Sequoia National Park?"
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had been there before when I lived in California,"
"but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe"
Yeah.
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"
Golly.
"and the other one is in Everett, Washington."
How did they end up so far away?
"Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh,"
Those are the youngest ones?
"Yeah,"
"well, the"
"the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that."
Uh-huh.
"Boy, that's, those are a long way."
"And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,"
"How,"
"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it was a wonderful environment.
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
Uh-huh.
I see.
"So, it worked well."
Oh.
How about you?
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
Yeah.
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
Uh-huh.
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
"Right,"
like half day programs.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
and this is one of the few churches that did it.
There were a couple downtown Dallas
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
and you can do a
it makes things very convenient.
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I've never tried using that,"
I don't know too much about it.
"What about,"
"have you, did you use commercially available software"
"or,"
"I have, I have used Lotus."
"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I,"
not heavy use.
"I've used, uh, D Base"
"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
I've been through three classes
Uh-huh.
and I have a great deal of respect for it.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
I do some
Uh-huh.
"and I,"
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
"I've never used D Base, um,"
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
"Yeah,"
Isabelle Chang.
"Okay,"
"thanks for that, uh, reference."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Okay,"
Gene
"So, it's nice to talk with you"
"and, um, food is a very intriguing thing."
"Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, nutritionally good for us."
"Yes, sir."
What kind of dining out do you like?
"Well, there is two kinds."
"One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant."
Oh.
"Uh, you know, something nice."
Yeah.
"And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy"
"Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up."
It's a local Mexican restaurant.
Uh-huh.
"because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and everything."
"Pancho's, that's,  a new one."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it's a chain down uh,"
it goes up into Colorado and down here.
I don't know where else it is.
What about you?
We have one called Chi Chi's in in our area.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba"
"but it's just, it closed recently."
"But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think."
Isn't it Mexican?
"I think,  think it might be."
And the same way with those calls.
"What is it,"
"oh M C I, M C I really does."
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back."
M C I
what's that?
M C I
it's the long distance telephone company.
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up."
"Uh-huh,"
well they they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.
They just keep calling back.
"I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,"
Uh-huh.
"so, uh, I'm very polite"
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely"
"and I hang up and, don't bother me after that."
Uh
Yeah.
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me.
Uh-huh.
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau."
Oh yeah.
That bothered me.
Uh-huh.
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
Right.
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
and I don't understand what their need to know is.
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
"Okay,"
what kind of dinner parties have you had?
"Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and I had help with them."
"Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it,"
"I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers"
"and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres"
"and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,"
Uh-huh.
"you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to."
"Whatever you like, huh?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh, you put that in"
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
"and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes"
Um.
and they are so good.
"Oh, that sounds delicious."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
"You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,"
"but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick."
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
"in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania"
Uh-huh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
Uh-huh
"Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting."
"So it's really up north in the country, really, ."
"Yeah,"
I guess so.
yeah.
"It's,"
"well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far."
Gosh.
I see.
"So,"
It's pretty nice country up there?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Hills, or what?"
"Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops."
Uh-huh
Is it farmland?
"Um, not a lot of farmland there."
"Mostly it's, uh,"
"I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own uh, growing their own food."
"Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle."
"Oh, yes."
"And even that's, you know, small time mostly."
Sure.
"Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry."
Uh-huh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
"wait a minute,"
we bought one in ninety.
"We've got three cars, of all things."
Uh-huh.
"So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan."
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
"Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,"
"we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have"
Uh-huh.
"and then, of course, we look into the prices."
Yeah.
"And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted"
"because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time."
"Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"So, uh,"
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,"
"and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they, they, uh,"
"I've been extremely,"
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles."
"uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years"
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
Oh.
"Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B"
"Oh the,"
"Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top."
"Ooh, boy."
"And, uh, I drove it mostly."
I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
"And,"
"Yeah,"
it really was.
My husband was in the Air Force
and we got transferred to Okinawa.
Oh.
"So, uh, we had to sell it."
which really tore me up
"Oh, yeah."
"Because, uh, it, it it was great fun."
"And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,"
"we, uh, we decided that, uh,"
"we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile"
"and it, and it was just too big,"
"so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States"
"and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan."
Oh.
So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?
"Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for."
Uh-huh.
They've got a lot of special needs
"and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have."
"Right,"
Right.
"Well ,"
"You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise."
"My mother, oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, we we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels"
"and they're very high strung animals to begin with,"
"but, uh,"
Okay.
How do you get your news mostly?
"Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio."
"And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and just fall off on the articles that I like."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come."
Uh-huh
So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.
"It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines"
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news."
Um.
It's really weird.
"Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long."
"But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news"
"and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper"
Um.

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."

The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Jain calendar is known as Vira Nirvana Samvat and their year 2501 started with Diwali of year 1974. The Jain business people traditionally start their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:<br>
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया|<br>
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया||
Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.
"On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples across the world. The most important principle of Jains is Ahinsa or non violence, thus they tend to avoid firecrackers during Diwali as they cause harm to living organisms. Diwali is celebrated in atmosphere of austerity, simplicity, serenity, equity, calmness, charity, philanthropy and environment-consciousness. Jain temples, homes, offices, shops are decorated with lights and diyas. Relatives distribute sweets to each other. The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Swetambar jains observe two days of fasting in remembrance of the penance and sacrifice of Mahavira. In temples and homes, devotees sing and chant hymns and mantras from Jain religious texts in praise of the Tirthankar and congregate for a prayer and recite verses from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which contain the last teachings of Mahavira. Jains pay visit to Pawapuri,Nalanda in Bihar on this special day to offer their prayers. The Jain year starts with Pratipada, next day of Diwali."

It was part of the traditional region of Upper Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region."
"Kašelj Hill () rises east of the settlement, across the Ljubljanica River. Below the hill to the north, Spodnji Kašel extends to the Cold Valley (), so called because the winter snow lies there late into the spring. The soil in Spodnji Kašel is sandy and there are fields to the west."
"Spodnji Kašelj was mentioned in written sources together with neighboring Zgornji Kašelj in 1360 as ""Niederchaeschel"" and ""Kaeschel"" (and as ""Geschel"" in 1421, ""(Ober) Kassel"" in 1436, and ""Kaschell"" in 1496).

"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

"The History of German football is one that has seen many changes. Football was a popular game from early on, and the German sports landscape was dotted with hundreds of local sides. Local sports associations or clubs are a longtime feature of the culture of German athletics. Each club would participate in, and field teams from, one or more sports, depending on local interest and resources."
"Prior to the formation of the Bundesliga, German football was played at an amateur level in a large number of sub-regional leagues (until 1945) which, in post-war times, had a top layer of semi-professional regional Oberligen (""Premier Leagues""). Regional champions and, from 1925 onwards, runners-up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship. On 28 January 1900, a national association, the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) was founded in Leipzig with 86 member clubs. From the start, the DFB was – and still is – a federation of regional associations. The first recognised national championship team was VfB Leipzig, who beat DFC Prague 7–2 in a game played in Altona on 31 May 1903."

= = = Thomas Rede = = =
"Thomas Rede (c. 1390– c. 1455) was a merchant, landholder, knight and public official of Roche Castle near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire."
"He was the son of William Rede and Jonet Wirriot. His father was born about 1370, the bastard son of Thomas Rede, a wealthy merchant of Carmarthen and Bristol. His mother was the daughter of Sir Wilcock Wirriot of Orielton in Pembrokeshire."
"Thomas was closely associated with Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a powerful figure in South Wales in the mid-15th century, as well as being Thomas’ father-in-law. In 1446 Thomas and Gruffudd farmed part of Cockmill in Carmarthen, and in 1449 they were involved together in a lease of the town. While not nearly as prominent in politics as his father-in-law, father or grandfather, Thomas did serve as beadle in Widigada from 1451 to 1452, and he was apparently knighted."
"Thomas married as his second wife Margred Dwnn, the cousin of his first wife, and daughter of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. By these two wives, and others, he had at least nine children."
"Thomas Rede, knight, was buried in Grey Friars church in Carmarthen, along with his father-in-law Gruffudd ap Nicholas and other members of the family. Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."
"The coat of arms for Rede of Roche is a pun on the name. It always contains three reeds (golden or silver) on a sable field, and sometimes carries the pun further by adding three roaches (a type of fish) on a red field. The red field might even be considered a pun of the name Rede - one Welsh homonym for Rede being “rhudd,” which means red."

The Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal system cost, with a lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game."
"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."
"To complement the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed high-capacity secondary storage devices such as the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES-CD. The company had always intended to do likewise with this generation. In a 1994 interview, Nintendo summarized its analysis of the continued advantages of cartridges for its upcoming console, eventually known as the Nintendo 64."
Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."
"The distinction with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do not conform to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers."

Irisa and Nolan, seeing the object, realize that it was part of an approaching razor rain storm, a storm that endangers Defiance. They have to inform everyone in town that the storm is not a simple one. Nolan returns to Defiance but Irisa stays back for Sukar's sinking ritual (his body will be consumed in an acid bath)."
"Sukar, right after they sink his body in the acid, rises fully healed and the Spirit Riders are confused because they do not know what happened. Sukar says that he is driven by God Irzu and he is on a mission but the other Irathients have doubts about it.

"Kemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros.

Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first. After further review, they announced the catch as confirmed, meaning the MLB replay crew in New York saw conclusive evidence of the catch. In game four, Kemp hit a fourth inning solo home run off Rick Porcello after only hitting six homers during the regular season."
"On July 26, 2019, the Astros designated Kemp for assignment to activate Carlos Correa."
"His 2019 season with the Astros ended with a disappointing .227/.308/.417 line over 163 at-bats, while setting a career high with 7 homeruns in just 66 games, prior to being traded."

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

"Anita Baldwin sold the land to the County of Los Angeles for $92,000 in 1918. A sand green golf course appeared following the closure of the school and Arcadia citizens took it over and operated it as a highly successful club."
"In 1935, through an act of Congress, the United States Department of War deeded 185 acres to Los Angeles County with the provision that it be used as a park and recreation center. The redevelopment of Ross Field was a Works Progress Administration project that included not just the golf course but a swimming pool, tennis courts, two baseball fields, a children's playground, and a lawn bowling complex."
"The Santa Anita Golf course opened in two stages. Nine holes were opened in April 1938 and the complete 18 opened on October 12, 1938."
"1938 also saw the birth of the Santa Anita Open—held each year until 1955, in the middle of October, to celebrate the opening of the Golf Course and to start the official Winter Golf Tournament season in Southern California. Prize money that first year was $1,000. Frank Moninger personally underwrote the first two tournaments. The Santa Anita Golf Club with the help of a few individual golfers underwrote the next few events. The County donated the Golf Course for the Santa Anita Open. The Course Record established in the days of ""The Open"" is 62 - held by Ellsworth Vines. Lloyd Mangrum won the first and second Opens with 274 and 278. Par at that time was 70."
In the 1960s the 9th hole was altered to make way for the construction of a baseball field at Arcadia Park. The original tee box was re-positioned to the South West of its original location and the hole was lengthened and turned into a par 5 thus changing par at the course to 71. The original dog leg left configuration and chute of trees has been lost and the hole now plays due east and relatively straight. Additionally significant changes were made to the short 281 yard par 4 17th hole where the large expanse of sand on the left side (south) was replaced with grass. The hole retains its name from the time (Desert) but has lost much character and altered the strategic challenge of its original configuration. Other changes from the era include the removal of several bunkers on the Par 5 Third hole and the sandy waste area between the 10th and 18th holes.
As part of the change in management in 1986 commitments were made to increase secondary facilities (clubhouse and dining) as well as substantive changes to the course itself during 1990-1991. The first hole and the driving range were swapped for safety reasons as errant shots from the range threatened cars on Santa Anita Avenue. The original dog leg left 1st hole was shortened from 409 yards to the current 367 yards. The 18th Green was moved forward to make way for clubhouse construction but the total yardage remained the same as the tee box was lengthened.
"During the 2000-2010 period small modifications were made to return a single bunker to the right of the 3rd hole (where the original design had three) and a large bunker in the center of the fairway of that same hole. Tee boxes on the 4th, 7th and 17th holes were modified. The detached tee boxes on 7th and 17th are seldom if ever used in open play though are occasionally used in tournament play."
"The current record is held by Blake Moore of Monrovia, California who shot a 9 under par 62 on Sunday, July 20, 2003. Moore is attributed with the current record as mentioned above several holes have been changed since ""The Open"" era and the course is now a par 71 rather than the original par 70."
