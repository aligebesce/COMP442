I went to that  at Jasons'  I think I'll go and find that erm
"But there was to be  Norman Lamont and a tr and treasury ministers, three or four of them."
"And there was to be the big industrialists, three or four of them."
Same as labour was done the other day.
But the tories
but the tories have scrapped agreed plans claiming the panel is not politically balanced.
The B B C two programme is regularly pr presented by Peter Jay who's Panorama Special on the slump was controversially axed last week .
"They're not willing to stand up  see erm  er what's it, Richard Dimbleby  was it Richard  or the other one?"
Was
Jonathon.
Richard's dead.
"No the boy, the other boy."
"Jonathon, Dick"
No.
What's his name?
The other boy.
There's two boys alive.
David?
Mm.
I don't know one from the other  by name.
"But the one was at him yesterday and he, well he didn't know what to say next."
He did quiz him.
That's David.
Is it?
On a Sunday.
"Well  And, and er  Lamont even said  that er unemployment would get higher."
He even said so yesterday
Can't get no bloody higher can it?
Oh it could.
Twenty two percent VAT if the tories get back.
Mm.
Jobless er tory jobless figures were exposed yesterday as a fraud.
The official unemployment total of  two  two million six hundred  and four thousand one hundred  is more than a million short of the real figure  because the tories have found  thirty ways not to count jobless people .
it's a road that goes through there to Swingdale Road  and there's a little place in there.
Little blue and white wooden hut.
Mhm.
It was.
I dunno.
Over  my uncle er  old Harry   he had a house around Clarendon Road  er  oh I dunno!
There wasn't many houses there at that time.
Mm mm.
We built our house there.
Mm?
Erm  it was meant to be the oldest house in erm  Broadstone
Ah?
"and we built our hou , not, bought the plot of land and built our own house on it."
"Well  old Harry  shared with my uncle  he had his house and he bought a piece of land on the bottom of his garden  and he built wall on  his  or this piece along the bottom of his garden, but er  I couldn't tell you, it wasn't very far up the road."
But er  yeah I know.
But I haven't been up to cla Clarendon Road for some time now.
Er  ha!
"There used to be a  a house on the end of the common up at Clarendon Road, the opposite side  oh!"
"Er  old Mrs   I dunno, but th , anyway there was  only this one old house up in the common and er  I went up there one time with  horse and   take a couple of pigs from there down to Wimborne market."
But I suppose the old house has pulled down under pressure and built on now but  that was the only house going up through there in them days.
That was a very old house!
Wimborne market's supposed to be old.
Mm?
Wimborne market must be very old!
"Oh Lord, yes!"
"Course  we , Wimborne cattle market is finished now isn't it?"
I went to a cattle market in
Mm.
Devon
Mm.
with my aunt.
Ah yeah.
"So  we're still hoping it int the bottom, bottom playing  all the chip shop there."
And all
Yeah.
.
Er er  I'll want this conversation
I know.
We're having a conversation though.
You got plenty of tapes.
So far
the bleeding .
"No because my  I've got erm  a letter  don't know whether it was Friday or Saturday now, on from Tamgrams."
Have you heard of Tamgrams?
And it was about  Tampax .
"In in you know, internal"
Mm mm.
"sanitary  sort of, asking you what you use  what size  ha you know, how comfortable did you feel with them, you know, did you wear one at night?"
Did you wear a pad?
Did you wear a pad when you were er heavy?
"Is there anybody else in the family, you know, a daughter, sister"
Mm mm.
all that.
So I put Lianne's name down and what she  used for her age.
"Anyway, it said er  you will receive  free samples  soon  and then er er  incentive bonus."
"So I thought well, I'll fill it in and send it back."
"And I thought well, even if it was a voucher  for pads or owt, I mean, they'll come in  for either Lianne"
Mm.
or me she said.
"Oh but I said, oh owt for nowt nowadays Lianne."
"So  that'll be  stood here looking at my jacket, it wants washing, and Andrew's does, and our Lianne's does ."
Seems a bit silly washing mine and Andrew's today don't it?
And when er  .
"Have to get a mo a move on and, oh I must ask her"
"You shouldn't take that word, well"
What you unkind?
No
I do
No Lary.
Rude?
Yeah.
No I'm sure he didn't mean rude.
"Not unkind, it's like  you shouldn't take that from him that's  bad  get him out   ding da ding ding ding ding ding  boo boo diddle erm, doo doo doo doo diddle erm  dum dum dum diddle erm   ding ding diddle er er  diddle er  yeah yeah  doo diddle erm  doo doo dee dee  dee   boom boom diddle erm boom  ."
Hurry up!
"I'm moving, I'm scrooving, I'm dooving  this is hard, got to take all these notes and just put them into all  sort of  a summary."
Spell summary.
S u m m a r y  today is Saturday.
Is there any connection  why have you coloured it in red biro!
And  oh   I don't really know.
That doesn't show anything!
"Yet the January, February, March the temperature is  high  which is temperature  I can't tell by looking at that, which one's temperature and which one's rainfall."
That's temperature and that's rainfall.
"Yeah but which line refers to which, how can I tell?"
You need to put the dotted line there  and square there
No you can look like that.
How?
"Rain, ten millimetres of rain equals one millimetre  ten of rain equals one millimetre and this one  one degrees  celsius  equals"
Well I'm sorry  I don't think that is very clever  for you!
there and
"one degrees, how can temperature"
What?
one degree celsius equals one millimetre
Yes.
So it's twenty five degrees celsius in January?
No.
Well I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to put some sort of  clue on it.
Yeah they
they were  that had bigger to ones
The winners got
Who supplied those then?
Out of the money that we gave them.
Oh!
The
Yes.
"I see, it was, and that was what Rotaract did?"
Yes.
Yes.
"They had big eggs, well, you know, sort of the"
Aha.
Smarties type egg so about so big
for the prizes
Ah.
and the others got little Cadbury's
Ah.
Creme Eggs.
"Which remi reminds me, I've got to get some for all they  spare children  before"
Yes.
well
before they ran out.
"It's surprising actually cos th the more, the more  common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a bit pricey."
The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round  and then they run out at Easter.
"That's happened, I couldn't get any  one year  I took the triplets to the erm  Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola  and one of them  won a Creme Egg"
"but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag  and er  it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some  I, I can't remember what we were doing afterwards  so I gave it to his mother, I thought she could share it."
"Mind, by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between  those three and their older brother"
Yeah.
There's not much of it left.
"No, but I could have seen a, there'd be an  almighty tantrums from the other two if Ji er"
Aha.
Because I'm because John Gummer's responsibilities extend a long way into things like housing and stuff as well don't they?
Whereas Robert Atkins has more specific responsibility perhaps for getting this area.
People of one
I don't know that's what I imagine.
people of one  of the environment and the other's Secretary of State for the Environment.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
It's just bizarre rules of procedure.
There are more Ministers of State that there are Secretaries of State.
Yeah.
To be honest I think we should be grateful they don't have to have the court magician come in
Wave their wand and recite the Lords Prayer.
Fair enough.
I assumed there would be a reason  assume there was going to be a good reason.
Erm so who else was on your  list of people we ought to write to
South East Cambridgeshire who's the Parl Parliamentary Secretary to John Gummer.
Who's the sorry your  and I can't
Sorry.
Erm
Garry  was Robert Atkins
Parliamentary Private Secretary.
And
And
And James Paice  P A I C E
P A I C E
Yes.
Of
MP for South East Cambridgeshire  and he's P P S to John Gummer.
and these people are erm unpaid helpers to Ministers and Secretaries of State it says here.
Unpaid.
So
They're they're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to  find something for them  to report basically.
Who's the nineteen ninety three Channel Four racing personality of the year?
It is  Mary Reevley who polled twenty percent.
Just as successful on the flat or over jumps I think this is a very very worthy winner our congratulations to Mary Reevley and I'm gonna get her on the show and present the prize to her.
If we get her on the show that really will be something cos I know she's shy but well done.
Ling Dell can be proud of her up in  North Yorkshire.
"Charity bets twenty five pounds and we came down in the car from Newmarket she had the she had the post out the light everything, now what's what's it going on?"
Exactly.
"I've not, Alastair accused me of being topical because of a member of the royal family this week this is not the reason but I've gone for Leotard in the one twenty five at Cheltenham."
Could  a lot fitter than it did
ah
I love it.
Oakes what are you going for?
Mm.
Ballasarly I'm going for.
Ballasarly?
There's a slight I mean over hurdles there's a doubt about his stamina
Mm.
but erm he won at  a huge long was it the er Queen Alexandra
Yeah.
at Royal Ascot erm so that I'm confident he will stay and Mr Pipe is not dead yet.
That's true.
And Alastair what do you fancy?
What's your ?
Er Front Street in a small race at Nottingham.
Small prize big chance.
Cor blimey.
I haven't heard of that one.
General Pershing is the one to be on at the big race.
That's mine let's check it out.
"Oakes is going for Ballasarly in the two thirty five Cheltenham, Leslie's going for Leotard that's the top weight in the first at one twenty five  er oh in the second."
"Alastair's going for Front Street at Nottingham number five in the two twenty, Thomo's going for General Pershing in the two o'clock at Cheltenham."
Picture puzzle.
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
"`` The dog is mine , and I shall do with him as I think fit ."
"He is sold , and that is all there is about it ."
Go on with your dinner . ''
But Ernest for the first time did not obey .
"He snatched his cap from the back of his chair , dashed it down over his eyes , and ran from the kitchen with a sob choking his breath ."
"Uncle Richard looked angry , but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him ."
"`` Do n't be vexed with the boy , Richard , '' she said ."
`` You know he is very fond of Laddie .
"He 's had to do with him ever since he was a pup , and no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him ."
I 'm rather sorry myself that you have sold the dog . ''
"`` Well , he is sold and there 's an end of it ."
I do n't say but that the dog is a good dog .
"But he is of no use to us , and twenty dollars will come in mighty handy just now ."
"He 's worth that to Bob , for he is a good watch dog , so we 've both made a fair bargain . ''"
Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie .
"I had taken no part in the discussion , for I felt no great interest in the matter ."
"Laddie was a nice dog ; Ernest was a quiet , inoffensive little fellow , five years younger than myself ; that was all I thought about either of them ."
I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard 's farm on the Nova Scotian Bay of Fundy shore .
"I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard , partly because he had been much attached to my mother , his only sister , partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son , who had died several years before ."
"Uncle Richard was a stern , undemonstrative man , but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me , and I always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place ."
"`` What are you going to do this afternoon , Ned ? ''"
"he asked , after the disturbance caused by Ernest 's outbreak had quieted down ."
"`` I think I 'll row out to Island Rock , '' I replied ."
`` I want to take some views of the shore from it . ''
Uncle Richard nodded .
He was much interested in my new camera .
"`` If you 're on it about four o'clock , you 'll get a fine view of the ` Hole in the Wall ' when the sun begins to shine on the water through it , '' he said ."
`` I 've often thought it would make a handsome picture . ''
"`` After I 've finished taking the pictures , I think I 'll go down shore to Uncle Adam 's and stay all night , '' I said ."
"`` Jim 's dark room is more convenient than mine , and he has some pictures he is going to develop tonight , too . ''"
I started for the shore about two o'clock .
"Ernest was sitting on the woodpile as I passed through the yard , with his arms about Laddie 's neck and his face buried in Laddie 's curly hair ."
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"Some of them quite costly , too ; that is , they will cost me something , but I know I 'll be better off and richer after I 've paid the price ."
"That is what Mr. Grierson would call a paradox , is n't it ?"
I 'll explain all about it to you on Christmas Day . ''
"On Christmas Day , Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy 's ."
"It was a faded brown Christmas after all , for the snow had not come ."
But Clorinda did not mind ; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned .
She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor before she went into the sitting room .
"Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire , and Clorinda sat down beside her ."
"`` I 've come to tell you all about it , '' she said ."
Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own .
"`` From your face , dear girl , it will be pleasant hearing and telling , '' she said ."
Clorinda nodded .
"`` Aunt Emmy , I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy ."
"And then one evening it just came to me , without any thinking at all , and I knew that I could give some gifts after all ."
I thought of something new every day for a week .
"At first I did n't think I could give some of them , and then I thought how selfish I was ."
"I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it , but I was n't willing to pay what I had ."
"I got over that , though , Aunt Emmy ."
Now I 'm going to tell you what I did give .
"`` First , there was my teacher , Miss Mitchell ."
I gave her one of father 's books .
"I have so many of his , you know , so that I would n't miss one ; but still it was one I loved very much , and so I felt that that love made it worth while ."
"That is , I felt that on second thought ."
"At first , Aunt Emmy , I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book , worn with much reading and all marked over with father 's notes and pencillings ."
I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present .
And yet somehow it seemed to me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed -- that old book which father had loved and which I loved .
"So I gave it to her , and she understood ."
"I think it pleased her so much , the real meaning in it ."
She said it was like being given something out of another 's heart and life .
"`` Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope , my dear Sunday School teacher ."
"She married a home missionary , and they are in a lonely part of the west ."
"Well , I wrote her a letter ."
"`` I take care of myself and Boo , and she looks after you ."
The house goes any way . ''
`` I should think so !
I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall to-night .
What is it there for ? ''
Molly laughed .
"`` That 's the joke , sir , Miss Bat is cleaning house , and I 'm sure it needs cleaning , for it is years since it was properly done ."
I thought you might have told her to . ''
`` I 've said nothing .
Do n't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it .
I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint .
Is she going to upset the whole place ? ''
"asked Mr. Bemis , looking alarmed at the prospect ."
"`` I hope so , for I really am ashamed when people come , to have them see the dust and cobwebs , and old carpets and dirty windows , '' said Molly , with a sigh , though she never had cared a bit till lately ."
"`` Why do n't you dust round a little , then ?"
No time to spare from the books and play ? ''
"`` I tried , father , but Miss Bat did n't like it , and it was too hard for me alone ."
"If things were once in nice order , I think I could keep them so ; for I do want to be neat , and I 'm learning as fast as I can . ''"
"`` It is high time someone took hold , if matters are left as you say ."
"I 've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was , to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town , and wondering what I could give the old lady ."
"Now I find you are the one to be thanked , and it is a very pleasant surprise to me . ''"
"`` Give her the present , please ; I 'm satisfied , if you like what I 've done ."
"It is n't much , and I did n't know as you would ever observe any difference ."
"But I did try , and now I guess I 'm really getting on , '' said Molly , sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks , for she , too , found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes ."
"`` You certainly are , my dear ."
"I 'll wait till the house-cleaning is over , and then , if we are all alive , I 'll see about Miss Bat 's reward ."
"Meantime , you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need , and send the bills to me ; '' and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar , as if that matter was settled ."
"`` Oh , thank you , sir !"
That will be splendid .
"Merry always has pretty things , and I know you will like me when I get fixed , '' said Molly , smoothing down her apron , with a little air ."
`` Seems to me you look very well as you are .
Is n't that a pretty enough frock ? ''
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
"`` It is the ruin of this kind land , '' a woman said ."
"`` If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . ''"
"`` If they live , '' returned the woman , `` that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? ''"
"`` They can not better die than for their natural lord , '' said Dick ."
"`` No natural lord of mine , '' said the man in the smock ."
"`` I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas ."
And now I must side with Brackley !
It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ?
"But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver -- that knows more of law than honesty -- I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him !"
-- the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . ''
"`` Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , '' answered Dick , `` to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel ."
But King Harry -- praised be the saints !
"-- has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained ."
"And as for Sir Daniel , y ' are very brave behind his back ."
But I will be no tale-bearer ; and let that suffice . ''
"`` I say no harm of you , Master Richard , '' returned the peasant ."
"`` Y ' are a lad ; but when ye come to a man 's inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket ."
"I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel 's neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! ''"
"`` Clipsby , '' said Richard , `` you speak what I can not hear with honour ."
"Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . ''"
"`` Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? ''"
returned Clipsby .
`` On whose side is Sir Daniel ? ''
"`` I know not , '' said Dick , colouring a little ; for his guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of that period , and every change had brought him some increase of fortune ."
"`` Ay , '' returned Clipsby , `` you , nor no man ."
"For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . ''"
"Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron , and the party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping -- a brown-faced , grizzled fellow , heavy of hand and grim of mien , armed with sword and spear , a steel salet on his head , a leather jack upon his body ."
"He was a great man in these parts ; Sir Daniel 's right hand in peace and war , and at that time , by his master 's interest , bailiff of the hundred ."
"`` Clipsby , '' he shouted , `` off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate ."
Bowyer will give you jack and salet .
We must ride before curfew .
"cried I. `` Rum , '' he repeated ."
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
"I ran to fetch it , but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and I broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while I was still getting in my own way , I heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor ."
"At the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me ."
Between us we raised his head .
"He was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour ."
"`` Dear , deary me , '' cried my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !"
And your poor father sick ! ''
"In the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger ."
"I got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron ."
"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in , on his visit to my father ."
"`` Oh , doctor , '' we cried , `` what shall we do ?"
Where is he wounded ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
said the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
"The man has had a stroke , as I warned him ."
"Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it ."
"For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''"
"When I got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain 's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm ."
It was tattooed in several places .
"`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it -- done , as I thought , with great spirit ."
"`` Prophetic , '' said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger ."
"`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood ."
"Jim , '' he said , `` are you afraid of blood ? ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein ."
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
"First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved ."
"But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''"
`` Never mind .
Please push up my table .
"I must write a letter , and I want you to post it for me to-night , and never say a word till I give you leave . ''"
"`` Oh , now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious , and get into a mess , are you ? ''"
"and Frank looked down at her with a suspicious air , though he was intensely curious to know what she was about ."
`` Go away till I 'm done .
"You will have to see the outside , but you ca n't know the inside till the answer comes ; '' and propping herself up , Jill wrote the following note , with some hesitation at the beginning and end , for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing , except by sight , and it was rather awkward : -- `` Robert Walker ."
"`` Dear Sir , I want to ask if Jack Minot came to see you last Friday afternoon ."
He got into trouble being seen with Jerry Shannon .
He paid him some money .
"Jack wo n't tell , and Mr. Acton talked to him about it before all the school ."
"We feel bad , because we think Jack did not do wrong ."
"I do n't know as you have anything to do with it , but I thought I 'd ask ."
Please answer quick .
"Respectfully yours , `` Jane Pecq '' To make sure that her despatch was not tampered with , Jill put a great splash of red sealing-wax on it , which gave it a very official look , and much impressed Bob when he received it ."
`` There !
"Go and post it , and do n't let any one see or know about it , '' she said , handing it over to Frank , who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand ."
"When his eye fell on the address , he laughed , and said in a teasing way , -- `` Are you and Bob such good friends that you correspond ?"
What will Jack say ? ''
"`` Do n't know , and do n't care !"
"Be good , now , and let 's have a little secret as well as other folks ."
"I 'll tell you all about it when he answers , '' said Jill in her most coaxing tone ."
`` Suppose he does n't ? ''
`` Then I shall send you up to see him .
"I must know something , and I want to do it myself , if I can . ''"
`` Look here ; what are you after ?
"I do believe you think -- '' Frank got no farther , for Jill gave a little scream , and stopped him by crying eagerly , `` Do n't say it out loud !"
"I really do believe it may be , and I 'm going to find out . ''"
`` What made you think of him ? ''
"and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter , as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that Jill 's quick wits had jumped at ."
`` Come here and I 'll tell you . ''
"Holding him by one button , she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim , with a look at the rug , -- `` No !"
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
"When I left the man , I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer , but I thrashed his boy , and then the old man thrashed me , and I ran off again and walked here . ''"
`` All the way ? ''
"`` Yes , the man did n't pay me , and I would n't ask for it ."
"Took it out in beating the boy , '' and Dan laughed , yet looked ashamed , as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands ."
`` How did you live ?
"It was a long , long tramp for a boy like you . ''"
"`` Oh , I got on well enough , till I hurt my foot ."
"Folks gave me things to eat , and I slept in barns and tramped by day ."
"I got lost trying to make a short cut , or I 'd have been here sooner . ''"
"`` But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us , what were you going to do ? ''"
"`` I thought I 'd like to see Teddy again , and you ; and then I was going back to my old work in the city , only I was so tired I went to sleep on the hay ."
"I 'd have been gone in the morning , if you had n't found me . ''"
`` Are you sorry I did ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry , half reproachful look , as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot ."
"The color came up into Dan 's face , and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate , as he said very low , `` No , ma'am , I 'm glad , I wanted to stay , but I was afraid you -- '' He did not finish , for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity , as she saw his foot , for it was seriously hurt ."
`` When did you do it ? ''
`` Three days ago . ''
`` And you have walked on it in this state ? ''
"`` I had a stick , and I washed it at every brook I came to , and one woman gave me a rag to put on it . ''"
"`` Mr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once , '' and Mrs. Jo hastened into the next room , leaving the door ajar behind her , so that Dan heard all that passed ."
"`` Fritz , the boy has come back . ''"
`` Who ?
Dan ? ''
"`` Yes , Teddy saw him at the window , and he called to him , but he went away and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn ."
"I found him there just now fast asleep , and half dead with weariness and pain ."
"He ran away from Page a month ago , and has been making his way to us ever since ."
"He pretends that he did not mean to let us see him , but go on to the city , and his old work , after a look at us ."
"It is evident , however , that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing , and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back . ''"
`` Did he say so ? ''
"`` His eyes did , and when I waked him , he said , like a lost child , ` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . '"
"I had n't the heart to scold him , and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold ."
"I may keep him , Fritz ? ''"
"They were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them , and he had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse ."
"` George , Nana is a treasure . '"
"` No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies . '"
"` Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ' '"
"I wonder , ' Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , ' I wonder . '"
"It was an opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy ."
"At first he pooh-poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow ."
"` It is nobody I know , ' he said , examining it carefully , ` but he does look a scoundrel . '"
"` We were still discussing it , you remember , ' says Mr. Darling , ` when Nana came in with Michael 's medicine ."
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault ."
"Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine ."
"If he had a weakness , it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly ; and so now , when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , ` Be a man , Michael . '"
"` Wo n't ; wo n't , ' Michael cried naughtily ."
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him , and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness ."
"` Mother , do n't pamper him , ' he called after her ."
"` Michael , when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur ."
"I said `` Thank you , kind parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . '' '"
"He really thought this was true , and Wendy , who was now in her night-gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage Michael , ` That medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? '"
"` Ever so much nastier , ` Mr. Darling said bravely , ` and I would take it now as an example to you , Michael , if I had n't lost the bottle . '"
He had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there .
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it , and put it back on his wash-stand . '"
"I know where it is , father , ' Wendy cried , always glad to be of service ."
"` I 'll bring it , ' and she was off before he could stop her ."
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way .
"` John , ' he said , shuddering , ` it 's most beastly stuff ."
"It 's that nasty , sticky , sweet kind . '"
"` It will soon be over , father , ' John said cheerily , and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass . '"
"I have been as quick as I could , ' she panted ."
"` You have been wonderfully quick , ' her father retorted , with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her ."
"` Michael first , ' he said doggedly ."
"` Father first , ' said Michael , who was of a suspicious nature . '"
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
Subject : ` Is summer or winter best fun ? '
A lively pow-wow .
About evenly divided .
J. Flint fined five cents for disrespect to the Chair .
A collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the door-step .
"E. Devlin was chosen Secretary for the coming year , and a new book contributed by the Chairman . ''"
`` That 's all . ''
`` Is there any other business before the meeting ? ''
"asked Frank , as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table ."
"Ed rose , and glancing about him with an appealing look , said , as if sure his proposition would not be well received , `` I wish to propose the name of a new member ."
"Bob Walker wants to join , and I think we ought to let him ."
"He is trying to behave well , and I am sure we could help him ."
Ca n't we ? ''
"All the boys looked sober , and Joe , otherwise Brickbat , said , bluntly , `` I wo n't ."
"He 's a bad lot , and we do n't want any such here ."
Let him go with chaps of his own sort . ''
`` That is just what I want to keep him from !
"He 's a good-hearted boy enough , only no one looks after him ; so he gets into scrapes , as we should , if we were in his place , I dare say ."
"He wants to come here , and would be so proud if he was let in , I know he 'd behave ."
"Come now , let 's give him a chance , '' and Ed looked at Gus and Frank , sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point ."
"But Gus shook his head , as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan , and Frank said gravely : `` You know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight , and we can not break it . ''"
`` You need n't .
"I ca n't be here half the time , so I will resign and let Bob have my place , '' began Ed , but he was silenced by shouts of `` No , no , you sha n't ! ''"
`` We wo n't let you off ! ''
"`` Club would go to smash , if you back out ! ''"
"`` Let him have my place ; I 'm the youngest , and you wo n't miss me , '' cried Jack , bound to stand by Ed at all costs ."
"`` We might do that , '' said Frank , who did object to small boys , though willing to admit this particular one ."
"`` Better make a new rule to have ten members , and admit both Bob and Tom Grant , '' said Ralph , whereat Grif grinned and Joe scowled , for one lad liked Merry 's big brother and the other did not ."
`` That 's a good idea !
"Put it to vote , '' said Gus , too kind-hearted to shut the door on any one ."
"`` First I want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by Bob , out of the club as well as in , for it wo n't do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street , '' said Ed , heartily in earnest about the matter ."
`` I will ! ''
"cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement , `` I 'm going to stay . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched , for Nan was a kindred spirit , and he foresaw `` larks '' in the future ."
"`` I can bat ; let me play , '' said Nan , who could turn her hand to any thing , and did not mind hard knocks ."
"`` We ai n't playing now , and our side beat without you . ''"
"`` I can beat you in running , any way , '' returned Nan , falling back on her strong point ."
`` Can she ? ''
asked Nat of Jack .
"`` She runs very well for a girl , '' answered Jack , who looked down upon Nan with condescending approval ."
`` Will you try ? ''
"said Nan , longing to display her powers ."
"`` It 's too hot , '' and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted ."
`` What 's the matter with Stuffy ? ''
"asked Nan , whose quick eyes were roving from face to face ."
"`` Ball hurt his hand ; he howls at every thing , '' answered Jack scornfully ."
"`` I do n't , I never cry , no matter how I 'm hurt ; it 's babyish , '' said Nan , loftily ."
`` Pooh !
"I could make you cry in two minutes , '' returned Stuffy , rousing up ."
`` See if you can . ''
"`` Go and pick that bunch of nettles , then , '' and Stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall ."
"Nan instantly `` grasped the nettle , '' pulled it up , and held it with a defiant gesture , in spite of the almost unbearable sting ."
"`` Good for you , '' cried the boys , quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex ."
"More nettled than she was , Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow , and he said tauntingly , `` You are used to poking your hands into every thing , so that is n't fair ."
"Now go and bump your head real hard against the barn , and see if you do n't howl then . ''"
"`` Do n't do it , '' said Nat , who hated cruelty ."
"But Nan was off , and running straight at the barn , she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat , and sounded like a battering-ram ."
"Dizzy , but undaunted , she staggered up , saying stoutly , though her face was drawn with pain , `` That hurt , but I do n't cry . ''"
"`` Do it again , '' said Stuffy angrily ; and Nan would have done it , but Nat held her ; and Tommy , forgetting the heat , flew at Stuffy like a little game-cock , roaring out , `` Stop it , or I 'll throw you over the barn ! ''"
and so shook and hustled poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels .
"`` She told me to , '' was all he could say , when Tommy let him alone ."
"`` Never mind if she did ; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl , '' said Demi , reproachfully ."
`` Ho !
"Finally Mr. Barry shook his head , with a relieved air ."
`` She ca n't be down there .
"It 's a mighty curious thing where she could have got to , though ."
"Look here , young man , are you sure you 've no idea where your sister is ? ''"
"`` I 've told you a dozen times that I have n't , '' said Davy , with an injured air ."
`` Maybe a tramp come and stole her . ''
"`` Nonsense , '' said Marilla sharply , relieved from her horrible fear of the well ."
"`` Anne , do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr. Harrison 's ?"
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over . ''
"`` I ca n't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I 'll go over and see , '' said Anne ."
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face .
"He quietly slipped off the gate and ran , as fast as his fat legs could carry him , to the barn ."
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind .
"The house was locked , the window shades were down , and there was no sign of anything living about the place ."
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly .
"Ginger , in the kitchen behind her , shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness ; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a toolhouse ."
"Anne flew to the door , unhasped it , and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg ."
"`` Oh , Dora , Dora , what a fright you have given us !"
How came you to be here ? ''
"`` Davy and I came over to see Ginger , '' sobbed Dora , `` but we could n't see him after all , only Davy made him swear by kicking the door ."
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door ; and I could n't get out .
"I cried and cried , I was frightened , and oh , I 'm so hungry and cold ; and I thought you 'd never come , Anne . ''"
`` Davy ? ''
But Anne could say no more .
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart .
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy 's behavior .
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned .
But Davy had told falsehoods ... downright coldblooded falsehoods about it .
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it .
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment .
She had grown to love Davy dearly ... how dearly she had not known until this minute ... and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood .
Marilla listened to Anne 's tale in a silence that boded no good Davy-ward ; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with .
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
"`` Well , all our men folk have gone now -- Jem and Walter and Shirley and Jerry and Carl ."
And none of them had to be driven to it .
So we have a right to be proud .
But pride -- '' Susan sighed bitterly -- `` pride is cold company and that there is no gainsaying . ''
"The moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west , the Glen went out in an eclipse of sudden shadow -- and thousands of miles away the Canadian boys in khaki -- the living and the dead -- were in possession of Vimy Ridge ."
Vimy Ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the Canadian annals of the Great War .
"`` The British could n't take it and the French could n't take it , '' said a German prisoner to his captors , `` but you Canadians are such fools that you do n't know when a place ca n't be taken ! ''"
So the `` fools '' took it -- and paid the price .
"Jerry Meredith was seriously wounded at Vimy Ridge -- shot in the back , the telegram said ."
"`` Poor Nan , '' said Mrs. Blythe , when the news came ."
She thought of her own happy girlhood at old Green Gables .
There had been no tragedy like this in it .
How the girls of to-day had to suffer !
When Nan came home from Redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had meant to her .
"John Meredith , too , seemed to have grown old suddenly in them ."
"Faith did not come home ; she was on her way across the Atlantic as a V.A.D. Di had tried to wring from her father consent to her going also , but had been told that for her mother 's sake it could not be given ."
"So Di , after a flying visit home , went back to her Red Cross work in Kingsport ."
The mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of Rainbow Valley .
Rilla was watching for them .
"Jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers ; Walter brought them to her when Jem was gone ; last spring Shirley had sought them out for her ; now , Rilla thought she must take the boys ' place in this ."
"But before she had discovered any , Bruce Meredith came to Ingleside one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays ."
He stalked up the steps of the veranda and laid them on Mrs. Blythe 's lap .
"`` Because Shirley is n't here to bring them , '' he said in his funny , shy , blunt way ."
"`` And you thought of this , you darling , '' said Anne , her lips quivering , as she looked at the stocky , black-browed little chap , standing before her , with his hands thrust into his pockets ."
"`` I wrote Jem to-day and told him not to worry ` bout you not getting your mayflowers , '' said Bruce seriously , '' 'cause I 'd see to that ."
"And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now , so it wo n't be very long before I 'll be eighteen , and then I 'll go to help him fight , and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place ."
"I wrote Jerry , too ."
"Jerry 's getting better , you know . ''"
`` Is he ?
Have you had any good news about him ? ''
`` Yes .
"Mother had a letter to-day , and it said he was out of danger . ''"
"`` She 's bound to be across now , '' I whispered ."
"`` Na , '' said Alan , `` her foot still sounds boss * upon the bridge . ''"
* Hollow .
And just then -- `` Who goes ? ''
"cried a voice , and we heard the butt of a musket rattle on the stones ."
"I must suppose the sentry had been sleeping , so that had we tried , we might have passed unseen ; but he was awake now , and the chance forfeited ."
"`` This 'll never do , '' said Alan ."
"`` This 'll never , never do for us , David . ''"
"And without another word , he began to crawl away through the fields ; and a little after , being well out of eye-shot , got to his feet again , and struck along a road that led to the eastward ."
"I could not conceive what he was doing ; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment , that I was little likely to be pleased with anything ."
"A moment back and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor 's door to claim my inheritance , like a hero in a ballad ; and here was I back again , a wandering , hunted blackguard , on the wrong side of Forth ."
`` Well ? ''
"said I. `` Well , '' said Alan , `` what would ye have ?"
They 're none such fools as I took them for .
"We have still the Forth to pass , Davie -- weary fall the rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it ! ''"
`` And why go east ? ''
"said I. `` Ou , just upon the chance ! ''"
said he .
"`` If we cannae pass the river , we 'll have to see what we can do for the firth . ''"
"`` There are fords upon the river , and none upon the firth , '' said I. `` To be sure there are fords , and a bridge forbye , '' quoth Alan ; `` and of what service , when they are watched ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` but a river can be swum . ''"
"`` By them that have the skill of it , '' returned he ; `` but I have yet to hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise ; and for my own part , I swim like a stone . ''"
"`` I 'm not up to you in talking back , Alan , '' I said ; `` but I can see we 're making bad worse ."
"If it 's hard to pass a river , it stands to reason it must be worse to pass a sea . ''"
"`` But there 's such a thing as a boat , '' says Alan , `` or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` Ay , and such a thing as money , '' says I. `` But for us that have neither one nor other , they might just as well not have been invented . ''"
`` Ye think so ? ''
said Alan .
"`` I do that , '' said I. `` David , '' says he , `` ye 're a man of small invention and less faith ."
"But let me set my wits upon the hone , and if I cannae beg , borrow , nor yet steal a boat , I 'll make one ! ''"
`` I think I see ye ! ''
"said I. `` And what 's more than all that : if ye pass a bridge , it can tell no tales ; but if we pass the firth , there 's the boat on the wrong side -- somebody must have brought it -- the country-side will all be in a bizz -- '' `` Man ! ''"
"`` Wake me up when she comes , '' said rob , and was fast asleep in five minutes with his head in Nan 's lap under the pinafore ."
"The little girl sat for some fifteen minutes , staring about her with anxious eyes , and feeling as if each second was an hour ."
"Then a pale light began to glimmer over the hill-top and she said to herself , `` I guess the night is over and morning is coming ."
"I 'd like to see the sun rise , so I 'll watch , and when it comes up we can find our way right home . ''"
"But before the moon 's round face peeped above the hill to destroy her hope , Nan had fallen asleep , leaning back in a little bower of tall ferns , and was deep in a mid-summer night 's dream of fire-flies and blue aprons , mountains of huckleberries , and Robby wiping away the tears of a black cow , who sobbed , `` I want to go home !"
I want to go home ! ''
"While the children were sleeping , peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes , the family at home were in a great state of agitation ."
"The hay-cart came at five , and all but Jack , Emil , Nan , and Rob were at the bars ready for it ."
"Franz drove instead of Silas , and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood , he said , looking ill-pleased , `` They ought to have left Rob to ride , he will be tired out by the long walk . ''"
"`` It 's shorter that way , and they will carry him , '' said Stuffy , who was in a hurry for his supper ."
`` You are sure Nan and Rob went with them ? ''
"`` Of course they did ; I saw them getting over the wall , and sung out that it was most five , and Jack called back that they were going the other way , '' explained Tommy ."
"`` Very well , pile in then , '' and away rattled the hay-cart with the tired children and the full pails ."
"Mrs. Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party , and sent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home ."
"Supper was over , and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual , when Franz came trotting back , hot , dusty , and anxious ."
`` Have they come ? ''
he called out when half-way up the avenue .
`` No ! ''
and Mrs. Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every one jumped up and gathered round Franz .
"`` I ca n't find them anywhere , '' he began ; but the words were hardly spoken when a loud `` Hullo ! ''"
"startled them all , and the next minute Jack and Emil came round the house ."
`` Where are Nan and Rob ? ''
"cried Mrs. Jo , clutching Emil in a way that caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits ."
`` I do n't know .
"They came home with the others , did n't they ? ''"
"he answered , quickly ."
`` No ; George and Tommy said they went with you . ''
"`` Well , they did n't ."
Have n't seen them .
"We took a swim in the pond , and came by the wood , '' said Jack , looking alarmed , as well he might ."
"`` Call Mr. Bhaer , get the lanterns , and tell Silas I want him . ''"
"That was all Mrs. Jo said , but they knew what she meant , and flew to obey her orders ."
"I do n't mind ; I ai n't a little girl , I 'm older than you and Daisy ; so now , '' cried Nan , ungratefully ."
"`` Do n't preach , Deacon , you bully Posy every day of your life , '' called out the Commodore , who just then hove in sight ."
"`` I do n't hurt her ; do I , Daisy ? ''"
"and Demi turned to his sister , who was `` pooring '' Nan 's tingling hands , and recommending water for the purple lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead ."
"`` You are the best boy in the world , '' promptly answered Daisy ; adding , as truth compelled her to do , `` You hurt me sometimes , but you do n't mean to . ''"
"`` Put away the bats and things , and mind what you are about , my hearties ."
"No fighting allowed aboard this ship , '' said Emil , who rather lorded it over the others ."
"`` How do you do , Madge Wildfire ? ''"
"said Mr. Bhaer , as Nan came in with the rest to supper ."
"`` Give the right hand , little daughter , and mind thy manners , '' he added , as Nan offered him her left ."
`` The other hurts me . ''
`` The poor little hand !
what has it been doing to get those blisters ? ''
"he asked , drawing it from behind her back , where she had put it with a look which made him think she had been in mischief ."
"Before Nan could think of any excuse , Daisy burst out with the whole story , during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and milk ."
"When the tale was finished , Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table towards his wife , and said with a laugh in his eyes , `` This rather belongs to your side of the house , so I wo n't meddle with it , my dear . ''"
"Mrs. Jo knew what he meant , but she liked her little black sheep all the better for her pluck , though she only said in her soberest way , `` Do you know why I asked Nan to come here ? ''"
"`` To plague me , '' muttered Stuffy , with his mouth full ."
"`` To help make little gentlemen of you , and I think you have shown that some of you need it . ''"
"Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again , and did not emerge till Demi made them all laugh by saying , in his slow wondering way , `` How can she , when she 's such a tomboy ? ''"
"`` That 's just it , she needs help as much as you , and I expect you set her an example of good manners . ''"
`` Is she going to be a little gentleman too ? ''
asked Rob .
"`` She 'd like it ; would n't you , Nan ? ''"
added Tommy .
"`` No , I should n't ; I hate boys ! ''"
"said Nan fiercely , for her hand still smarted , and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in some wiser way ."
"`` I am sorry you hate my boys , because they can be well-mannered , and most agreeable when they choose ."
"Kindness in looks and words and ways is true politeness , and any one can have it if they only try to treat other people as they like to be treated themselves . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan , but the boys nudged one another , and appeared to take the hint , for that time at least , and passed the butter ; said `` please , '' and `` thank you , '' `` yes , sir , '' and `` no , ma'am , '' with unusual elegance and respect ."
"Nan said nothing , but kept herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi , though strongly tempted to do so , because of the dignified airs he put on ."
"She also appeared to have forgotten her hatred of boys , and played `` I spy '' with them till dark ."
Rilla 's fear lifted .
Dog Monday howled no more and resumed his routine of train meeting and watching .
When five days had passed the Ingleside people began to feel that they might be cheerful again .
"Rilla dashed about the kitchen helping Susan with the breakfast and singing so sweetly and clearly that Cousin Sophia across the road heard her and croaked out to Mrs. Albert , '' ` Sing before eating , cry before sleeping , ' I 've always heard . ''"
But Rilla Blythe shed no tears before the nightfall .
"When her father , his face grey and drawn and old , came to her that afternoon and told her that Walter had been killed in action at Courcelette she crumpled up in a pitiful little heap of merciful unconsciousness in his arms ."
Nor did she waken to her pain for many hours .
"CHAPTER XXIII `` AND SO , GOODNIGHT '' The fierce flame of agony had burned itself out and the grey dust of its ashes was over all the world ."
Rilla 's younger life recovered physically sooner than her mother .
For weeks Mrs. Blythe lay ill from grief and shock .
"Rilla found it was possible to go on with existence , since existence had still to be reckoned with ."
"There was work to be done , for Susan could not do all ."
"For her mother 's sake she had to put on calmness and endurance as a garment in the day ; but night after night she lay in her bed , weeping the bitter rebellious tears of youth until at last tears were all wept out and the little patient ache that was to be in her heart until she died took their place ."
"She clung to Miss Oliver , who knew what to say and what not to say ."
So few people did .
"Kind , well-meaning callers and comforters gave Rilla some terrible moments ."
"`` You 'll get over it in time , '' Mrs. William Reese said , cheerfully ."
"Mrs. Reese had three stalwart sons , not one of whom had gone to the front ."
"`` It 's such a blessing it was Walter who was taken and not Jem , '' said Miss Sarah Clow ."
"`` Walter was a member of the church , and Jem was n't ."
I 've told Mr. Meredith many a time that he should have spoken seriously to Jem about it before he went away . ''
"`` Pore , pore Walter , '' sighed Mrs. Reese ."
"`` Do not you come here calling him poor Walter , '' said Susan indignantly , appearing in the kitchen door , much to the relief of Rilla , who felt that she could endure no more just then ."
`` He was not poor .
He was richer than any of you .
"It is you who stay at home and will not let your sons go who are poor -- poor and naked and mean and small -- pisen poor , and so are your sons , with all their prosperous farms and fat cattle and their souls no bigger than a flea 's -- if as big . ''"
"`` I came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted , '' said Mrs. Reese , taking her departure , unregretted by anyone ."
"Then the fire went out of Susan and she retreated to her kitchen , laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time ."
Then she went to work and ironed Jims 's little rompers .
Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it .
"`` I am not going to have you kill yourself working for any war-baby , '' Susan said obstinately ."
"`` Oh , I wish I could just keep on working all the time , Susan , '' cried poor Rilla ."
"Rilla , be awfully good to mother while I 'm away ."
It must be a horrible thing to be a mother in this war -- the mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts have the hardest times .
"Rilla , you beautiful little thing , are you anybody 's sweetheart ?"
"If you are , tell me before I go . ''"
"`` No , '' said Rilla ."
"Then , impelled by a wish to be absolutely frank with Walter in this talk that might be the last they would ever have , she added , blushing wildly in the moonlight , `` but if -- Kenneth Ford -- wanted me to be -- '' `` I see , '' said Walter ."
"`` And Ken 's in khaki , too ."
"Poor little girlie , it 's a bit hard for you all round ."
"Well , I 'm not leaving any girl to break her heart about me -- thank God for that . ''"
Rilla glanced up at the Manse on the hill .
She could see a light in Una Meredith 's window .
She felt tempted to say something -- then she knew she must not .
"It was not her secret : and , anyway , she did not know -- she only suspected ."
Walter looked about him lingeringly and lovingly .
This spot had always been so dear to him .
What fun they all had had here lang syne .
"Phantoms of memory seemed to pace the dappled paths and peep merrily through the swinging boughs -- Jem and Jerry , bare-legged , sunburned schoolboys , fishing in the brook and frying trout over the old stone fireplace ; Nan and Di and Faith , in their dimpled , fresh-eyed childish beauty ; Una the sweet and shy , Carl , poring over ants and bugs , little slangy , sharp-tongued , good-hearted Mary Vance -- the old Walter that had been himself lying on the grass reading poetry or wandering through palaces of fancy ."
They were all there around him -- he could see them almost as plainly as he saw Rilla -- as plainly as he had once seen the Pied Piper piping down the valley in a vanished twilight .
"And they said to him , those gay little ghosts of other days , `` We were the children of yesterday , Walter -- fight a good fight for the children of to-day and to-morrow . ''"
"`` Where are you , Walter , '' cried Rilla , laughing a little ."
`` Come back -- come back . ''
Walter came back with a long breath .
"He stood up and looked about him at the beautiful valley of moonlight , as if to impress on his mind and heart every charm it possessed -- the great dark plumes of the firs against the silvery sky , the stately White Lady , the old magic of the dancing brook , the faithful Tree Lovers , the beckoning , tricksy paths ."
"`` I shall see it so in my dreams , '' he said , as he turned away ."
They went back to Ingleside .
"Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were there , with Gertrude Oliver , who had come from Lowbridge to say good-bye ."
"Everybody was quite cheerful and bright , but nobody said much about the war being soon over , as they had said when Jem went away ."
They did not talk about the war at all -- and they thought of nothing else .
"At last they gathered around the piano and sang the grand old hymn : `` Oh God , our help in ages past Our hope for years to come ."
Our shelter from the stormy blast And our eternal home . ''
"`` We all come back to God in these days of soul-sifting , '' said Gertrude to John Meredith ."
`` There have been many days in the past when I did n't believe in God -- not as God -- only as the impersonal Great First Cause of the scientists .
"I told him not at all ; that I had seen much to admire among the Highlanders ; and if he came to that , Mr. Campbell himself was a Highlander ."
"`` Ay , '' said he , `` that 's true ."
It 's a fine blood . ''
`` And what is the King 's agent about ? ''
I asked .
`` Colin Campbell ? ''
says Henderland .
`` Putting his head in a bees ' byke ! ''
"`` He is to turn the tenants out by force , I hear ? ''"
"said I. `` Yes , '' says he , `` but the business has gone back and forth , as folk say ."
"First , James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh , and got some lawyer -LRB- a Stewart , nae doubt -- they all hing together like bats in a steeple -RRB- and had the proceedings stayed ."
"And then Colin Campbell cam ' in again , and had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer ."
And now they tell me the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow .
"It 's to begin at Duror under James 's very windows , which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of it . ''"
`` Do you think they 'll fight ? ''
I asked .
"`` Well , '' says Henderland , `` they 're disarmed -- or supposed to be -- for there 's still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places ."
And then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming .
"But for all that , if I was his lady wife , I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again ."
"They 're queer customers , the Appin Stewarts . ''"
I asked if they were worse than their neighbours .
"`` No they , '' said he ."
`` And that 's the worst part of it .
"For if Colin Roy can get his business done in Appin , he has it all to begin again in the next country , which they call Mamore , and which is one of the countries of the Camerons ."
"He 's King 's Factor upon both , and from both he has to drive out the tenants ; and indeed , Mr. Balfour -LRB- to be open with ye -RRB- , it 's my belief that if he escapes the one lot , he 'll get his death by the other . ''"
"So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day ; until at last , Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company , and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell 's -LRB- `` whom , '' says he , `` I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion '' -RRB- , proposed that I should make a short stage , and lie the night in his house a little beyond Kingairloch ."
"To say truth , I was overjoyed ; for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore , and since my double misadventure , first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper , I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger ."
"Accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain , and came in the afternoon to a small house , standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch ."
"The sun was already gone from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side , but shone on those of Appin on the farther ; the loch lay as still as a lake , only the gulls were crying round the sides of it ; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth ."
"We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland 's dwelling , than to my great surprise -LRB- for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders -RRB- he burst rudely past me , dashed into the room , caught up a jar and a small horn-spoon , and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive quantities ."
"Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing , and looked round upon me with a rather silly smile ."
"`` It 's a vow I took , '' says he ."
"`` God bless you , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' he said softly and tenderly ."
After all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this .
He stood on the rear platform and waved to them as the train pulled out .
"Rilla was standing by herself , but Una Meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and held each other 's cold hands as the train rounded the curve of the wooded hill ."
Rilla spent an hour in Rainbow Valley that morning about which she never said a word to anyone ; she did not even write in her diary about it ; when it was over she went home and made rompers for Jims .
In the evening she went to a Junior Red Cross committee meeting and was severely businesslike .
"`` You would never suppose , '' said Irene Howard to Olive Kirk afterwards , `` that Walter had left for the front only this morning ."
But some people really have no depth of feeling .
I often wish I could take things as lightly as Rilla Blythe . ''
"CHAPTER XVI REALISM AND ROMANCE `` Warsaw has fallen , '' said Dr. Blythe with a resigned air , as he brought the mail in one warm August day ."
"Gertrude and Mrs. Blythe looked dismally at each other , and Rilla , who was feeding Jims a Morganized diet from a carefully sterilized spoon , laid the said spoon down on his tray , utterly regardless of germs , and said , `` Oh , dear me , '' in as tragic a tone as if the news had come as a thunderbolt instead of being a foregone conclusion from the preceding week 's dispatches ."
"They had thought they were quite resigned to Warsaw 's fall but now they knew they had , as always , hoped against hope ."
"`` Now , let us take a brace , '' said Susan ."
`` It is not the terrible thing we have been thinking .
I read a dispatch three columns long in the Montreal Herald yesterday that proved that Warsaw was not important from a military point of view at all .
"So let us take the military point of view , doctor dear . ''"
"`` I read that dispatch , too , and it has encouraged me immensely , '' said Gertrude ."
`` I knew then and I know now that it was a lie from beginning to end .
"But I am in that state of mind where even a lie is a comfort , providing it is a cheerful lie . ''"
"`` In that case , Miss Oliver dear , the German official reports ought to be all you need , '' said Susan sarcastically ."
`` I never read them now because they make me so mad I can not put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them .
Even this news about Warsaw has taken the edge off my afternoon 's plans .
Misfortunes never come singly .
I spoiled my baking of bread today -- and now Warsaw has fallen -- and here is little Kitchener bent on choking himself to death . ''
"Jims was evidently trying to swallow his spoon , germs and all ."
Rilla rescued him mechanically and was about to resume the operation of feeding him when a casual remark of her father 's sent such a shock and thrill over her that for the second time she dropped that doomed spoon .
"`` Kenneth Ford is down at Martin West 's over-harbour , '' the doctor was saying ."
"`` His regiment was on its way to the front but was held up in Kingsport for some reason , and Ken got leave of absence to come over to the Island . ''"
"`` I hope he will come up to see us , '' exclaimed Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` He only has a day or two off , I believe , '' said the doctor absently ."
Nobody noticed Rilla 's flushed face and trembling hands .
Even the most thoughtful and watchful of parents do not see everything that goes on under their very noses .
"`` Oh , thank God , '' murmured Mrs. Blythe , in a half-whisper ."
Bruce looked at her curiously .
`` That is what father said when mother told him .
"But when l said it the other day when I found out Mr. Mead 's dog had n't hurt my kitten -- I thought he had shooken it to death , you know -- father looked awful solemn and said I must never say that again about a kitten ."
"But I could n't understand why , Mrs. Blythe ."
"I felt awful thankful , and it must have been God that saved Stripey , because that Mead dog had ` normous jaws , and oh , how it shook poor Stripey ."
And so why could n't I thank Him ?
"` Course , '' added Bruce reminiscently , `` maybe I said it too loud -- 'cause I was awful glad and excited when I found Stripey was all right ."
"I ` most shouted it , Mrs. Blythe ."
Maybe if I 'd said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right .
"Do you know , Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce dropped to a `` whispery '' tone , edging a little nearer to Anne -- `` what I would like to do to the Kaiser if I could ? ''"
"`` What would you like to do , laddie ? ''"
"`` Norman Reese said in school to-day that he would like to tie the Kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to worrying him , '' said Bruce gravely ."
`` And Emily Flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him .
And they all said things like that .
But Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on Anne 's knee -- `` I would like to turn the Kaiser into a good man -- a very good man -- all at once if I could .
That is what I would do .
"Do n't you think , Mrs. Blythe , that would be the very worstest punishment of all ? ''"
"`` Bless the child , '' said Susan , `` how do you make out that would be any kind of a punishment for that wicked fiend ? ''"
"`` Do n't you see , '' said Bruce , looking levelly at Susan , out of his blackly blue eyes , `` if he was turned into a good man he would understand how dreadful the things he has done are , and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way ."
He would feel just awful -- and he would go on feeling like that forever .
"Yes '' -- Bruce clenched his hands and nodded his head emphatically , `` yes , I would make the Kaiser a good man -- that is what I would do -- it would serve him ` zackly right . ''"
"CHAPTER XXVI SUSAN HAS A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE An aeroplane was flying over Glen St. Mary , like a great bird poised against the western sky -- a sky so clear and of such a pale , silvery yellow , that it gave an impression of a vast , wind-freshened space of freedom ."
"The little group on the Ingleside lawn looked up at it with fascinated eyes , although it was by no means an unusual thing to see an occasional hovering plane that summer ."
Susan was always intensely excited .
"Who knew but that it might be Shirley away up there in the clouds , flying over to the Island from Kingsport ?"
"But Shirley had gone overseas now , so Susan was not so keenly interested in this particular aeroplane and its pilot ."
"Nevertheless , she looked at it with awe ."
"`` I wonder , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she said solemnly , `` what the old folks down there in the graveyard would think if they could rise out of their graves for one moment and behold that sight ."
"I am sure my father would disapprove of it , for he was a man who did not believe in new-fangled ideas of any sort ."
He always cut his grain with a reaping hook to the day of his death .
A mower he would not have .
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."
"So, when the Lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his mother."
"""Now,"" said he, ""I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort of food I please."""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but seeing is believing, and I shan't believe it till I see it."""
"So the Lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
"""Well,"" said the Lad ""there's no help for it but to go to the North Wind again;"" and away he went."
So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.
"""Good evening!"" said the Lad."
"""Good evening!"" said the North Wind."
"""I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,"" said the Lad; ""for, as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny."""
"""I've got no meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"So the Lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before."
"Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the Lad had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the two."
"Next morning off went the Lad; and when he got home to his mother, he said:"
"""After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but I shan't believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."""
"""Ram, ram! make money!"" said the Lad; but if the ram made anything, it wasn't money."
"So the Lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."
"""Well!"" said the North Wind; ""I've nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its a stick of that kind that if you say: 'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say: 'Stick, stick! now stop!'"""
"So, as the way was long, the Lad turned in this night too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep."
"Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the Lad bawled out:"
"""Stick, stick! lay on!"""
"So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:"
"""Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram."""
"When the Lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:"
"""Stick, stick! now stop!"""
"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost."
THE THREE PRINCESSES OF WHITELAND
"Once on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for the King's table. One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. Do what he would however he tried with bait and angle there was never a sprat on his hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:"
"""If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough."""
"So the man answered boldly, ""Yes;"" for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. After that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, ""I bear a babe under my girdle."""
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""
Loving Laili
"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade."
"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the Babes in the Wood, or the Norfolk Tragedy, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad and he will come to no good."
"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom."
"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master."
"""What is it, Fido good little elephant then?"" said Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood."
"""Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the lookout."" And he was."
"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole perhaps just behind them or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!"
"A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a speech. He said: ""Friends fellow citizens I cannot disguise from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a is no end of a dragon."""
"The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, ""Hear, hear."""
"Uncle James went on: ""Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless member of our community. We don't know what has happened."""
"Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned."
"""The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"" said Uncle James."
Everyone thought of the poor army.
"""There is only one thing to be done."" Uncle James was warming to his subject. ""Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits or even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect nothing, however sacred."""
"Everyone thought of themselves and they said, ""What is the simple precaution?"""
"Then Uncle James said: ""Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and never come back."""
The crowd cheered wildly and the Princess from her balcony clapped her hands.
"""The present the dragon expects,"" said Uncle James, cheerfully, ""is rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess will only show how generous you are."""
"The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted."
"The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday present especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he was so angry."
He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.
Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the downs there were hardly any rabbits playing there now and then he gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and looked out.
"""Come up and kiss me,"" she said."
"So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the window, and said: ""Many happy returns of the day."""
"Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: ""Oh, Tom how can you? When you know quite well """
"""Oh, don't,"" said Tom. ""Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess what do you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything. You've only got to do as you are told."""
"""Is that all?"" said the Princess. ""Oh that's easy I've often done that!"""
"Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and again. ""Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"" she said. ""How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"""
"The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it he was a magician, and he had a bright taste in vests and he called with a cab to take the Princess out."
"""Come, little birthday present,"" he said tenderly. ""The dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon, far from his home and friends."""
The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.
"""YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT IS,"" said the North Wind; ""once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn't blow a puff for ever so many days, after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither."""
"Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn't be at all afraid."
"""Very well, then,"" said the North Wind, ""but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get thither at all."""
"Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world's end."
"Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds."
"So they tore on and on no one can believe how far they went and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels."
"""Are you afraid?"" said the North Wind."
"""No!"" she wasn't."
"But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again."
"Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have the Prince."
"""What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?"" said the Long-nose, and threw up the window."
"""It's not for sale, for gold or money,"" said the lassie."
"""If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,"" said the Princess."
"""Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,"" said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought."
"Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again."
"So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince and be with him that night, the Princess should have it."
"But when she went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with the long nose, and chased her out again."
"So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under the castle window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it."
"Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running, and they told that to the Prince."
"That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither."
"""Ah,"" said the Prince, ""you've just come in the very nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it."""
"So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said:"
"""First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."""
"""Yes!"" said the step-mother, with all her heart."
"""Well,"" said the Prince, ""I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she can't, she's not worth having."""
"Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew."
"""Ah!"" said the old hag, her mother, ""you can't wash; let me try."""
"But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand before it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt."
"Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney."
"""Ah!"" said the Prince, ""you're none of you worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie, I'll be bound she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN, LASSIE!"""
he shouted.
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."
"But alas! he went out to die. In one battle, a small band of the English bravely attacked a large army of their enemies. The horse which Sidney was riding was killed under him, and as he mounted another, he was shot in the leg, and his thigh-bone was broken. The horse took fright and galloped away from the fight, but its wounded and bleeding rider held to his seat, and when he reached a place of safety was lifted from his horse, and gently laid upon the ground. He was faint from loss of blood, and in great pain, and his throat was parched with thirst."
"""Bring me water,"" said he to a friend."
"This was not easy to do, for there was not a stream near at hand, and in order to get to one it would be necessary to pass where the shot from the enemy's cannons was falling fast. But his friend was brave and went through the danger. Then he found some water, and brought it to him."
"Sidney eagerly held out his hand for the cup, and as he was preparing to drink, another poor wounded soldier was carried past. This man was dying; he could not speak, but he looked with longing eyes at the water."
"Sir Philip saw the look, and taking the cup from his own lips, passed it to the soldier, saying: ""Thy need is greater than mine."" The poor man quenched his thirst, and blessed him as he died."
"Sir Philip lived on for a few weeks, growing weaker every day, but he never came back to his own land, and the many friends who loved him."
"Sidney was great in many ways; very fair to see, very wise and good, and very clever and witty. He was one of the bravest fighters, one of the finest poets, and one of the best gentlemen who ever lived. He will always be remembered for his brave deeds, and his wise sayings, but most of all do men bless his name for this act of kindness to his poor dying comrade."
"The ""Revenge"""
"In the days of Queen Elizabeth, English sailors first began to find their way across the seas to new lands, from which they brought home many strange, and rich, and beautiful things. The Spaniards sailed across the seas too, to fetch gold and silver from the mines in Mexico, which belonged to the King of Spain. Sometimes the English ships met the Spanish ones, and robbed them of their gold, for it was thought quite right and fair in those days to take every chance of doing harm to the enemies of England. Of course the Spaniards hated the English for this, and whenever they met English ships which were weaker than theirs they attacked them, and robbed them, killing the sailors, or taking them prisoners."
"Once, a small ship, called the Revenge, was sailing home to England, when it met with fifty great Spanish vessels. The captain of the Revenge was Sir Richard Grenville, and he had a great many sick men on board. There was no time to escape from the Spanish ships, which soon surrounded the little Revenge. So there were only two courses which Sir Richard could take. One was to give up his ship to the Spaniards; the other was to fight with them till his men were all killed, or his ship sank."
"Some of the sailors wished him to take the first course, but the others, and all the sick men, said: ""Nay, let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of Spain."" This they said because they thought it better to die, than to be made prisoners by the cruel Spaniards."
"Sir Richard made up his mind to fight. It was after noon when the firing began, and all night long, until daylight came, the little English ship kept the fifty Spanish vessels at bay. Then it was found that all the powder was gone, and all the English were dead or dying."
"And then only was the flag of the Revenge pulled down, to show that she surrendered to her enemies."
"The brave Sir Richard was taken on board a Spanish ship, where he soon died of his wounds."
"These were his last words: ""Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind, for I have ended my life as a good soldier ought. I have fought for my country and my queen, for honour, and for God."""
The Pilgrim Fathers
"There was a time when the people of England were not allowed to pray to God in the way they thought right, but were punished if they did not worship as the king ordered. This was very hard, and when James I was king, a little band of brave people, who found that they could not obey the king, left their country to make a new home across the sea, where they could be free. They are called the ""Pilgrim Fathers""."
"A hundred people men, women, and children set sail in a little ship called the Mayflower for the new world which a great explorer called Columbus had discovered away in the west, and which we now call America."
"They had a long and stormy voyage, but at last, in mid-winter, they landed on the shores of North America, and set up their huts."
"At first they had much trouble, for the ground was frozen and barren."
"They suffered from hunger and sickness, and the wild Indians who lived in that land came down upon them and tried to drive them away. But the Pilgrim Fathers did not lose courage. They were free, and they worked hard, and waited in patience for brighter days. By and by other ships from England brought food to keep them alive, and more people to help them. Then they made friends with the Indians, and when spring came they planted seeds and grew crops for themselves."
"After a time many other Englishmen, who wished to be free, followed the Pilgrim Fathers, and settled in America. They founded the colonies of New England, which are now a part of the United States."
Guy Fawkes
"In the time of James I, many of the English people were very hardly treated because of their religion. At last they could bear the ill-usage no longer, and they thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen and their eldest son."
"Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a cellar under the Parliament House, where James was to meet his lords and commons on November 5; and a man named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at the right time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it."
"All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that a friend of his would be at the meeting next day. As he did not wish him to be killed, he sent him a letter, without signing his name, saying: ""Do not go to the House, for there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not see who hurts them""."
"The lord who received this letter took it to the King's Council, and when King James saw it, he guessed what the ""sudden blow"" would be. Men were sent to search the cellars, and there, on the very night before the deed was to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time should come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly tortured to make him tell all he knew, but he was a brave man, and he died without betraying his friends."
"Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November, bonfires have been lighted in many places in England, and ""guys"" burned, to remind people how an English king was once saved from a great danger."
"At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find the Princesses, and if they have not yet done feasting and drinking they must be at it still."
THE CAT ON THE DOVREFELL
"Once on a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a great white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. Now, it so fell out, that he came to the Dovrefell just about Christmas Eve, and there he turned into a cottage where a man lived, whose name was Halvor, and asked the man if he could get house-room there for his bear and himself."
"""Heaven never help me, if what I say isn't true!"" said the man; ""but we can't give anyone house-room just now, for every Christmas Eve such a pack of Trolls come down upon us, that we are forced to flit, and haven't so much as a house over our own heads, to say nothing of lending one to anyone else."""
"""Oh?"" said the man, ""if that's all, you can very well lend me your house; my bear can lie under the stove yonder, and I can sleep in the side-room."""
"Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got leave to stay there; so the people of the house flitted out, and before they went, everything was got ready for the Trolls; the tables were laid, and there was rice porridge, and fish boiled in lye, and sausages, and all else that was good, just as for any other grand feast."
"So, when everything was ready, down came the Trolls. Some were great, and some were small; some had long tails, and some had no tails at all; some, too, had long, long noses; and they ate and drank, and tasted everything. Just then one of the little Trolls caught sight of the white bear, who lay under the stove; so he took a piece of sausage and stuck it on a fork, and went and poked it up against the bear's nose, screaming out:"
"""Pussy, will you have some sausage?"""
"Then the white bear rose up and growled, and hunted the whole pack of them out of doors, both great and small."
"Next year Halvor was out in the wood, on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, cutting wood before the holidays, for he thought the Trolls would come again; and just as he was hard at work, he heard a voice in the wood calling out:"
"""Halvor! Halvor!"""
"""Well,"" said Halvor, ""here I am."""
"""Have you got your big cat with you still?"""
"""Yes, that I have,"" said Halvor; ""she's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she has now got seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself."""
"""Oh, then, we'll never come to see you again,"" bawled out the Troll away in the wood, and he kept his word; for since that time the Trolls have never eaten their Christmas brose with Halvor on the Dovrefell."
ONE'S OWN CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS PRETTIEST
"A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe."
"""Dear friend,"" said the Snipe, ""don't shoot my children!"""
"""How shall I know your children?"" asked the Sportsman. ""What are they like?"""
"""Oh!"" said the Snipe, ""mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."""
"""Very well,"" said the Sportsman, ""I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."""
"But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot."
"""Oh, oh!"" said the Snipe, ""why did you shoot my children after all?"""
"""What! these your children!"" said the Sportsman; ""why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"""
"""Woe is me!"" said the Snipe; ""don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"""
AMONG THE FOREST PEOPLE
MR. RED SQUIRREL COMES TO LIVE IN THE FOREST
"Life in the forest is very different from life in the meadow, and the forest people have many ways of doing which are not known in the world outside. They are a quiet people and do not often talk or sing when there are strangers near. You could never get acquainted with them until you had learned to be quiet also, and to walk through the underbrush without snapping twigs at every step. Then, if you were to live among them and speak their language, you would find that there are many things about which it is not polite to talk. And there is a reason for all this."
"In the meadow, although they have their quarrels and their own troubles, they always make it up again and are friendly, but in the forest there are some people who can never get along well together, and who do not go to the same parties or call upon each other. It is not because they are cross, or selfish, or bad. It is just because of the way in which they have to live and hunt, and they cannot help it any more than you could help having eyes of a certain color."
"These are things which are all understood in the forest, and the people there are careful what they say and do, so they get on very well indeed, and have many happy times in that quiet, dusky place. When people are born there, they learn these things without thinking about it, but when they come there from some other place it is very hard, for everybody thinks it stupid in strangers to ask about such simple matters."
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
And to each of them the little slyboots replied:
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;     Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
"At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin! Tum-pa  """
"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: ""Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?"
"Just you come out of that!"""
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.
Punchkin
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
"They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them."
"The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation."
"About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, ""Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day."""
"But the other sisters would answer, ""Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes."" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja's dinner."
"Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days."
"At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall."
"There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, ""Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."""
"Then the eldest sister answered, ""Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm."" But Balna replied, ""If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day."""
"The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes."
"At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace."
"Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry and say:"
"""Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?"""
"One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree."
"Then the Ranee said to her daughter, ""I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how it is."" And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat."
"So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit."
"""Of corse he will,"" said the hairy boy to the right of Whomsoever J."
"Opper, who afterwards became the father of a lad who grew up to be editor of the Persiflage column of the Atlantic Monthly."
Thus the boys of America impressed General Gage with their courage and patriotism and grew up to be good men.
"An expedition to Canada was fitted out the same winter, and an attack made on Quebec, in which General Montgomery was killed and Benedict Arnold showed that he was a brave soldier, no matter how the historian may have hopped on him afterwards."
"The Americans should not have tried to take Canada. Canada was, as Henry Clay once said, a persimmon a trifle too high for the American pole, and it is the belief of the historian, whose tears have often wet the pages of this record, that in the future Canada will be what America is now, a free country with a national debt of her own, a flag of her own, an executive of her own, and a regular annual crisis of her own, like other nations."
"In 1776 Boston was evacuated. Washington, in order to ascertain whether Lord Howe had a call to fish, cut bait, or go ashore, began to fortify Dorchester Heights, March 17, and on the following morning he was not a little surprised to note the change. As the weather was raw, and he had been in-doors a good deal during the winter, Lord Howe felt the cold very keenly. He went to the window and looked at the Americans, but he would come back chilly and ill-tempered to the fire each time. Finally he hitched up and went away to Halifax, where he had acquaintances."
"On June 28 an attack was made by the English on Fort Moultrie. It was built of palmetto logs, which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again."
"Palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years, and are therefore good for forts."
"When the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave Charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral's face, they turned loose with everything they had, grape, canister, solid shot, chain-shot, bar-shot, stove-lids, muffin-irons, newspaper cuts, etc., etc., so that the decks were swept of every living thing except the admiral."
"General Clinton by land tried to draw the attention of the rear gunners of the fort, but he was a poor draughtsman, and so retired, and both the land and naval forces quit Charleston and went to New York, where board was not so high."
July 4 was deemed a good time to write a Declaration of Independence and have it read in the grove.
"Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that ""the United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and Independent states."" John Adams, of Massachusetts, seconded the resolution. This was passed July 2, and the report of the committee appointed to draw up a Declaration of Independence was adopted July 4."
"The Declaration was dictated by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the most melodious English of any American of his time."
"Jefferson had a vocabulary next to Noah Webster, with all the dramatic power of Dan. He composed the piece one evening after his other work. We give a facsimile of the opening lines."
"Philadelphia was a scene of great excitement. The streets were thronged, and people sat down on the nice clean door-steps with perfect recklessness, although the steps had just been cleaned with ammonia and wiped off with a chamois-skin. It was a day long to be remembered, and one that made George III. wish that he had reconsidered his birth."
"In the steeple of the old State-House was a bell which had fortunately upon it the line ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It was rung by the old man in charge, though he had lacked faith up to that moment in Congress. He believed that Congress would not pass the resolution and adopt the Declaration till after election."
"Thus was the era of good feeling inaugurated both North and South. There was no North then, no South, no East, no West; just one common country, with Washington acting as father of same. Oh, how nice it must have been!"
Washington was one of the sweetest men in the United States. He gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in Virginia.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
"The British army now numbered thirty thousand troops, while Washington's entire command was not over seven thousand strong. The Howes, one a general and the other an admiral, now turned their attention to New York. Washington, however, was on the ground beforehand."
"Howe's idea was to first capture Brooklyn, so that he could have a place in which to sleep at nights while engaged in taking New York."
"The battle was brief. Howe attacked the little army in front, while General Clinton got around by a circuitous route to the rear of the Colonial troops and cut them off. The Americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. The prisoners were confined in the old sugar-house on Liberty Street, where they suffered the most miserable and indescribable deaths."
"The army of the Americans fortunately escaped by Fulton Ferry in a fog, otherwise it would have been obliterated. Washington now fortified Harlem Heights, and later withdrew to White Plains. Afterwards he retired to a fortified camp called North Castle."
"Howe feared to attack him there, and so sent the Hessians, who captured Fort Washington, November 16."
"It looked scaly for the Americans, as Motley says, and Philadelphia bade fair to join New York and other cities held by the British. The English van could be seen from the Colonial rear column. The American troops were almost barefooted, and left their blood-stained tracks on the frozen road."
"It was at this time that Washington crossed the Delaware and thereby found himself on the other side; while Howe decided to remain, as the river was freezing, and when the ice got strong enough, cross over and kill the Americans at his leisure. Had he followed the Colonial army, it is quite sure now that the English would have conquered, and the author would have been the Duke of Sandy Bottom, instead of a plain American citizen, unknown, unhonored, and unsung."
"The forts, now threatened in the rear by Butler's army, surrendered, and Farragut went up to Baton Rouge and took possession of it. General Butler's occupation at New Orleans has been variously commented upon by both friend and foe, but we are only able to learn from this and the entire record of the war, in fact, that it is better to avoid hostilities unless one is ready to accept the unpleasant features of combat. The author, when a boy, learned this after he had acquired the unpleasant features resulting from combat which the artist has cleverly shown on opposite page."
"General Butler said he found it almost impossible to avoid giving offence to the foe, and finally he gave it up in despair."
"The French are said to be the politest people on the face of the earth, but no German will admit it; and though the Germans are known to have big, warm, hospitable hearts, since the Franco-Prussian war you couldn't get a Frenchman to admit this."
"In February Burnside captured Roanoke Island, and the coast of North Carolina fell into the hands of the Union army. Port Royal became the base of operations against Florida, and at the close of the year 1862 every city on the Atlantic coast except Charleston, Wilmington, and Savannah was held by the Union army."
"The Merrimac iron-clad, which had made much trouble for the Union shipping for some time, steamed into Hampton Roads on the 8th of March."
"Hampton Roads is not the Champs-Elysées of the South, but a long wet stretch of track east of Virginia, the Midway Plaisance of the Salted Sea. The Merrimac steered for the Cumberland, rammed her, and the Cumberland sunk like a stove-lid, with all on board. The captain of the Congress, warned by the fate of the Cumberland, ran his vessel on shore and tried to conceal her behind the tall grass, but the Merrimac followed and shelled her till she surrendered."
"The Merrimac then went back to Norfolk, where she boarded, night having come on apace. In the morning she aimed to clear out the balance of the Union fleet. That night, however, the Monitor, a flat little craft with a revolving tower, invented by Captain Ericsson, arrived, and in the morning when the Merrimac started in on her day's work of devastation, beginning with the Minnesota, the insignificant-looking Monitor slid up to the iron monster and gave her two one-hundred-and-sixty-six-and-three-quarter-pound solid shot."
"The Merrimac replied with a style of broadside that generally sunk her adversary, but the balls rolled off the low flat deck and fell with a solemn plunk in the moaning sea, or broke in fragments and lay on the forward deck like the shells of antique eggs on the floor of the House of Parliament after a Home Rule argument."
"Five times the Merrimac tried to ram the little spitz-pup of the navy, but her huge iron beak rode up over the slippery deck of the enemy, and when the big vessel looked over her sides to see its wreck, she discovered that the Monitor was right side up and ready for more."
"The Confederate vessel gave it up at last, and went back to Norfolk defeated, her career suddenly closed by the timely genius of the able Scandinavian."
"The Peninsular campaign was principally addressed toward the capture of Richmond. One hundred thousand men were massed at Fort Monroe April 4, and marched slowly toward Yorktown, where five thousand Confederates under General Magruder stopped the great army under McClellan."
"After a month's siege, and just as McClellan was about to shoot at the town, the garrison took its valise and went away."
"On the 5th of May occurred the battle of Williamsburg, between the forces under ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker and General Johnston. It lasted nine hours, and ended in the routing of the Confederates and their pursuit by Hooker to within seven miles of Richmond. This caused the adjournment of the Confederate Congress."
"But Johnston prevented the junction of McDowell and McClellan after the capture of Hanover Court-House, and Stonewall Jackson, reinforced by Ewell, scared the Union forces almost to death. They crossed the Potomac, having marched thirty-five miles per day. Washington was getting too hot now to hold people who could get away."
It was hard to say which capital had been scared the worst.
"The Governors of the Northern States were asked to send militia to defend the capital, and the front door of the White House was locked every night after ten o'clock."
"But finally the Union generals, instead of calling for more troops, got after General Jackson, and he fled from the Shenandoah Valley, burning the bridges behind him. It is said that as he and his staff were about to cross their last bridge they saw a mounted gun on the opposite side, manned by a Union artilleryman. Jackson rode up and in clarion tones called out, ""Who told you to put that gun there, sir? Bring it over here, sir, and mount it, and report at head-quarters this evening, sir!"""
"The artilleryman unlimbered the gun, and while he was placing it General Jackson and staff crossed over and joined the army."
"One cannot be too careful, during a war, in the matter of obedience to orders. We should always know as nearly as possible whether our orders come from the proper authority or not."
"No one can help admiring this dashing officer's tour in the Shenandoah Valley, where he kept three major-generals and sixty thousand troops awake nights with fifteen thousand men, saved Richmond, scared Washington into fits, and prevented the union of McClellan's and McDowell's forces. Had there been more such men, and a little more confidence in the great volume of typographical errors called Confederate money, the lovely character who pens these lines might have had a different tale to tell."
"May 31 and June 1 occurred the battle of Fair Oaks, where McClellan's men floundering in the mud of the Chickahominy swamps were pounced upon by General Johnston, who was wounded the first day. On the following day, as a result of this accident, Johnston's men were repulsed in disorder."
"General Robert E. Lee, who was now in command of the Confederate forces, desired to make his army even more offensive than it had been, and on June 12 General Stuart led off with his cavalry, made the entire circuit of the Union army, saw how it looked from behind, and returned to Richmond, much improved in health, having had several meals of victuals while absent."
"Hooker now marched to where he could see the dome of the court-house at Richmond, but just then McClellan heard that Jackson had been seen in the neighborhood of Hanover Court-House, and so decided to change his base. General McClellan was a man of great refinement, and would never use the same base over a week at a time."
"He had hardly got the base changed when Lee fell upon his flank at Mechanicsville, June 26, and the Seven Days' battle followed. The Union troops fought and fell back, fought and fell back, until Malvern Hill was reached, where, worn with marching, choked with dust, and broken down by the heat, to which they were unaccustomed, they made their last stand, July 1. Here Lee got such a reception that he did not insist on going any farther."
"But the Union army was cooped up on the James River. The siege of Richmond had been abandoned, and the North felt blue and discouraged."
"Three hundred thousand more men were called for, and it seemed that, as in the South, ""the cradle and the grave were to be robbed"" for more troops."
"Lee now decided to take Washington and butcher Congress to make a Roman holiday. General Pope met the Confederates August 26, and while Lee and Jackson were separated could have whipped the latter had the Army of the Potomac reinforced him as it should, but, full of malaria and foot-sore with marching, it did not reach him in time, and Pope had to fight the entire Confederate army on that historic ground covered with so many unpleasant memories and other things, called Bull Run."
"For the second time the worn and wilted Union army was glad to get back to Washington, where the President was, and where beer was only five cents per glass."
"Oh, how sad everything seemed at that time to the North, and how high cotton cloth was! The bride who hastily married her dear one and bade him good-by as the bugle called him to the war, pointed with pride to her cotton clothes as a mark of wealth; and the middle classes were only too glad to have a little cotton mixed with their woollen clothes."
"Lee invaded Maryland, and McClellan, restored to command of the Army of the Potomac, followed him, and found a copy of his order of march, which revealed the fact that only a portion of the army was before him. So, overtaking the Confederates at South Mountain, he was ready for a victory, but waited one day; and in the mountains Lee got his troops united again, while Jackson also returned. The Union troops had over eighty thousand in their ranks, and nothing could have been more thoughtful or genteel than to wait for the Confederates to get as many together as possible, otherwise the battle might have been brief and unsatisfactory to the tax-payer or newspaper subscriber, who of course wants his money's worth when he pays for a battle."
"The first year of the war had taught both sides a few truths, and especially that the war did not in any essential features resemble a straw-ride to camp-meeting and return. The South had also discovered that the Yankee peddlers could not be captured with fly-paper, and that although war was not their regular job they were willing to learn how it was done."
"In 1862 the national army numbered five hundred thousand men, and the Confederate army three hundred and fifty thousand. Three objects were decided upon by the Federal government for the Union army and navy to accomplish, viz., 1, the opening of the Mississippi; 2, the blockade of Southern ports; and 3, the capture of Richmond, the capital of the Southern Confederacy."
"The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson was undertaken by General Grant, aided by Commodore Foote, and on February 6 a bombardment was opened with great success, reducing Fort Henry in one hour. The garrison got away because the land-forces had no idea the fort would yield so soon, and therefore could not get up there in time to cut off the retreat."
"Fort Donelson was next attacked, the garrison having been reinforced by the men from Fort Henry. The fight lasted four days, and on February 16 the fort, with fifteen thousand men, surrendered."
"Nashville was now easily occupied by Buell, and Columbus and Bowling Green were taken. The Confederates fell back to Corinth, where General Beauregard (Peter G. T.) and Albert Sidney Johnston massed their forces."
"General Grant now captured the Memphis and Charleston Railroad; but the Confederates decided to capture him before Buell, who had been ordered to reinforce him, should effect a junction with him. April 6 and 7, therefore, the battle of Shiloh occurred. Whether the Union troops were surprised or not at this battle, we cannot here pause to discuss."
"Suffice it to say that one of the Federal officers admitted to the author in 1879, while under the influence of koumys, that, though not strictly surprised, he believed he violated no confidence in saying that they were somewhat astonished."
"It was Sunday morning, and the Northern hordes were just considering whether they would take a bite of beans and go to church or remain in camp and get their laundry-work counted for Monday, when the Confederacy and some other men burst upon them with a fierce, rude yell. In a few moments the Federal troops had decided that there had sprung up a strong personal enmity on the part of the South, and that ill feeling had been engendered in some way."
"All that beautiful Sabbath-day they fought, the Federals yielding ground slowly and reluctantly till the bank of the river was reached and Grant's artillery commanded the position. Here a stand was made until Buell came up, and shortly afterwards the Confederates fell back; but they had captured the Yankee camp entire, and many a boy in blue lost the nice warm woollen pulse-warmers crocheted for him by his soul's idol. It is said that over thirty-five hundred needle-books and three thousand men were captured by the Confederates, also thirty flags and immense quantities of stores; but the Confederate commander, General A."
"S. Johnston, was killed. The following morning the tide had turned, and General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated unmolested to Corinth."
"General Halleck now took command, and, as the Confederates went away from there, he occupied Corinth, though still retaining his rooms at the Arlington Hotel in Washington."
"The Confederates who retreated from Columbus fell back to Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River, where Commodore Foote bombarded them for three weeks, thus purifying the air and making the enemy feel much better than at any previous time during the campaign. General Pope crossed the Mississippi, capturing the batteries in the rear of the island, and turning them on the enemy, who surrendered April 7, the day of the battle of Shiloh."
"May 10, the Union gun-boats moved down the river. Fort Pillow was abandoned by the Southern forces, and the Confederate flotilla was destroyed in front of Memphis. Kentucky and Tennessee were at last the property of the fierce hordes from the great coarse North."
"General Bragg was now at Chattanooga, Price at Iuka, and Van Dorn at Holly Springs. All these generals had guns, and were at enmity with the United States of America. They very much desired to break the Union line of investment extending from Memphis almost to Chattanooga."
"Bragg started out for the Ohio River, intending to cross it and capture the Middle States; but Buell heard of it and got there twenty-four hours ahead, wherefore Bragg abandoned his plans, as it flashed over him like a clap of thunder from a clear sky that he had no place to put the Middle States if he had them. He therefore escaped in the darkness, his wagon-trains sort of drawling over forty miles of road and ""hit a-rainin'."""
"September 19, General Price, who, with Van Dorn, had considered it a good time to attack Grant, who had sent many troops north to prevent Bragg's capture of North America, decided to retreat, and, General Rosecrans failing to cut him off, escaped, and was thus enabled to fight on other occasions."
"The two Confederate generals now decided to attack the Union forces at Corinth, which they did. They fought beautifully, especially the Texan and Missouri troops, who did some heroic work, but they were defeated and driven forty miles with heavy loss."
"October 30, General Buell was succeeded by General Rosecrans."
"The battle of Murfreesboro occurred December 31 and January 2. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the whole conflict, and must have made the men who brought on the war by act of Congress feel first-rate. About one-fourth of those engaged were killed."
"An attack on Vicksburg, in which Grant and Sherman were to co-operate, the former moving along the Mississippi Central Railroad and Sherman descending the river from Memphis, was disastrous, and the capture of Arkansas Post, January 11, 1863, closed the campaign of 1862 on the Father of Waters."
"General Price was driven out of Missouri by General Curtis, and had to stay in Arkansas quite a while, though he preferred a dryer climate."
"General Van Dorn now took command of these forces, numbering twenty thousand men, and at Pea Ridge, March 7 and 8, 1863, he was defeated to a remarkable degree. During his retreat he could hardly restrain his impatience."
"Some four or five thousand Indians joined the Confederates in this battle, but were so astonished at the cannon, and so shocked by the large decayed balls, as they called the shells, which came hurtling through the air, now and then hurting an Indian severely, that they went home before the exercises were more than half through. They were down on the programme for some fantastic and interesting tortures of Union prisoners, but when they got home to the reservation and had picked the briers out of themselves they said that war was about as barbarous a thing as they were ever to, and they went to bed early, leaving a call for 9.30 A.M. on the following day."
The red brother's style of warfare has an air about it that is unpopular now. A common stone stab-knife is a feeble thing to use against people who shoot a distance of eight miles with a gun that carries a forty-gallon caldron full of red-hot iron.
CHAPTER XXVI.
SOME MORE FRATRICIDAL STRIFE.
"The effort to open the Mississippi from the north was seconded by an expedition from the south, in which Captain David G. Farragut, commanding a fleet of forty vessels, co-operated with General Benjamin F. Butler, with the capture of New Orleans as the object."
"Mortar-boats covered with green branches for the purpose of fooling the enemy, as no one could tell at any distance at all whether these were or were not olive-branches, steamed up the river and bombarded Forts Jackson and St. Philip till the stunned catfish rose to the surface of the water to inquire, ""Why all this?"" and turned their pallid stomachs toward the soft Southern zenith. Sixteen thousand eight hundred shells were thrown into the two forts, but that did not capture New Orleans."
"Farragut now decided to run his fleet past the defences, and, desperate as the chances were, he started on April 24. A big cable stretched across the river suggested the idea that there was a hostile feeling among the New Orleans people. Five rafts and armed steamers met him, and the iron-plated ram Manassas extended to him a cordial welcome to a wide wet grave with a southern exposure."
"Farragut cut through the cable about three o'clock in the morning, practically destroyed the Confederate fleet, and steamed up to the city, which was at his mercy."
"""How soon will you be leaving?"" she asked."
"""The wound was superficial. I really didn't need to be hospitalized. I'm"
"being released tomorrow morning. I'll probably leave immediately."""
"""You'll make a fine doctor, Frank."""
"""Thank you, I'll try."""
"""Good-bye, Frank."""
"""Good-bye--darling."""
She turned and fled.
"And judging by the deep sadness in his soul, he knew he had hit bottom."

They reached the hotel and Cæsar introduced his friend to Laura.
“He is an admirer of yours.”
"“A respectful admirer... from a distance,” explained Kennedy."
"“But are there admirers of that sort?” asked Laura, laughing."
"“Here you have one,” said the Englishman. “I have known you by sight"

“And have you been here a long time?”
“Nearly two years.”

_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.

Suddenly Entman got to his feet. He walked to the edge of the patio and

"""Brent! It's such a helpless feeling. What do we do?"""
"Brent Taber got up and went over and stood beside Entman. He, too,"
"looked up into the velvet night; the beautiful, quiet, impersonal night."
The sinister night.

"We are two ghosts that had their chance to live,"
"And lost it, she and I."
SECOND THOUGHTS.
"WHEN you were here, ah foolish then!"
"I scarcely knew I loved you, dear."
"I know it now, I know it when"
You are no longer here.
"him at the top of the low steps, and said:"
"""I want to talk to you, Dad."""
"He gave her a quick look, selected his hat, and followed to the door.  In"
"the cab, he put his hand on hers and said:"
"""Now, my dear?"""
But all she could get out was:
"""I want to come back to you.  I can't go on there.  It's--it's--I've come"
"to an end."""
"His hand pressed hers tightly, as if he were trying to save her the need"
for saying more.  Gyp went on:
"""I must get baby; I'm terrified that he'll try to keep her, to get me"
"back."""
"""Is he at home?"""
"""I don't know.  I haven't told him that I'm going to leave him."""
Winton looked at his watch and asked:
"""Does the baby ever go out as late as this?"""
"""Yes; after tea.  It's cooler."""
"""I'll take this cab on, then.  You stay and get the room ready for her."
"Don't worry, and don't go out till I return."""
Good to be roaming;
"Even in London, even at midnight,"
Lover-like in a lover’s gloaming.
"You the dancer and I the dreamer,"
"Children together,"
"Wandering lost in the night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
DURING MUSIC.
"THE music had the heat of blood,"
A passion that no words can reach;
"We sat together, and understood"
Our own heart’s speech.
"We had no need of word or sign,"
"The music spoke for us, and said"
All that her eyes could read in mine
Or mine in hers had read.
ON THE BRIDGE.
MIDNIGHT falls across hollow gulfs of
"MANDOLINE,"
THE singers of serenades
Whisper their faded vows
Unto fair listening maids
Under the singing boughs.
"Tircis, Aminte, are there,"
"Clitandre is over-long,"
And Damis for many a fair
Tyrant makes many a song.
"Their short vests, silken and bright,"
"Their long pale silken trains,"
"Their elegance of delight,"
Twine soft blue silken chains.
"And the mandolines and they,"
"Faintlier breathing, swoon"
Into the rose and grey
Ecstasy of the moon.
DANS L’ALLÉE.
"AS in the age of shepherd king and queen,"
"Painted and frail amid her nodding bows,"
"Under the sombre branches, and between"
"""Maybe there isn't a seat."""
"""Wouldn't that be terrible?"""
"""Then we'll have to wait over."""
"""Why don't you go and see?"""
Five minutes later they were walking down the west tunnel to gate
twenty-six.
"Frank Corson grinned. ""Come on, woman, I'm going to take you across"
"state lines for immoral purposes."""
"""How wonderful,"" she breathed."

Brent Taber was human and his triumph had been a thing of satisfaction
to him--but only momentarily. Now it had a slightly sour taste.
Not that he was unhappy. He was content and almost relaxed as he sat in
Doctor Entman's patio and worked on a Scotch and soda.
"""A nice night,"" Entman said."
"""Beautiful. Those stars are about ready to fall into our laps."""
"""Menace out there? It seems unthinkable."""
"""Doesn't it?"""
"promise."""
His hand touched her foot through the soft eiderdown.  Gyp thought: 'Why
does he come and whine to me like this?  He has no dignity--none!'  And
she said:
"""How can you promise?  You have made the girl love you.  I saw her face."""
He drew his hand back.
"""You saw her?"""
"""Yes."""
"He was silent, staring at her.  Presently he began again:"
"""She is a little fool.  I do not care for the whole of her as much as I"
care for your one finger.  What does it matter what one does in that way
"if one does not care?  The soul, not the body, is faithful.  A man"
"satisfies appetite--it is nothing."""
Gyp said:
"""Perhaps not; but it is something when it makes others miserable."""
"""Has it made you miserable, my Gyp?"""
"His voice had a ring of hope.  She answered, startled:"
"""I?  No--her."""
"""Her?  Ho!  It is an experience for her--it is life.  It will do her no"
AFTER LOVE.
"O TO part now, and, parting now,"
Never to meet again;
"To have done for ever, I and thou,"
"With joy, and so with pain."
"It is too hard, too hard to meet"
"As friends, and love no more;"
Those other meetings were too sweet
That went before.
"And I would have, now love is over,"
"An end to all, an end:"
"I cannot, having been your lover,"
Stoop to become your friend!
ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.
"IF I bid you, you will come,"
"If I bid you, you will go,"
"You are mine, and so I take you"
"To my heart, your home;"
"Well, ah, well I know"
I shall not forsake you.
A sleepy old forgotten song.
"Softly the stealthy night descends,"
The black sails fade into the sky:
"Is this not, where the sea-line ends,"
The shore-line of infinity?
I cannot think or dream: the grey
"Unending waste of sea and night,"
"Dull, impotently infinite,"
Blots out the very hope of day.
RAIN ON THE DOWN.
"NIGHT, and the down by the sea,"
And the veil of rain on the down;
And she came through the mist and the rain to me
From the safe warm lights of the town.
"The rain shone in her hair,"
And her face gleamed in the rain;
And only the night and the rain were there
As she came to me out of the rain.
BEFORE THE SQUALL.
"""I wish this confounded thing hadn't happened. It spoils our win."""
"The Chief Justice nodded, and whistled a bar or two of some sad ditty."
"""I'm glad she's dead, poor soul, Perry,"" he said."
"""There's the girl,"" said Sir Robert."
"""Ay, there's the girl."""
"They did not speak again till they were just parting, when the Chief"
"Justice broke out,"
"""Why the deuce couldn't the fellow take his beastly photograph with"
"him?"""
"""It's very absurd,"" answered Sir Robert, ""but I feel just the same about"
"it."""
"""I'm hanged if you're not a gentleman, Perry,"" said the Chief Justice,"
"and he hastened away, blowing his nose."

"To F. V. WHITE, ESQUIRE."
"MY DEAR WHITE,"
The publication of this book is a business arrangement between you and
me. Its dedication however has nothing to do with the relations of
"author and publisher in those capacities, but is merely an expression"
of friendship and esteem. This then is to remind you of pleasant hours
"we have spent together on the other side of the channel, in your house"
"at London, and my house in Kent."
"Yours ever sincerely,"

"heard it, for he stood up and forced a smile upon his long sad face."
Noll went close to him hurriedly:
"“One word, Netherby--quick, before she comes--do you know where Betty"
is?” he asked hoarsely.
Netherby smiled a sad smile:
"“Ah, Noll, that _you_ should have to ask _me_ that!”"
Noll passed Julia at the stair-head and left them together.
"As he stepped across the hall he hesitated, turned, and went into the"
"old lady’s room. She was sitting in the window, looking out; and she"
turned at his footfall.
Noll bent down and kissed the old face; and he saw that the harsh light
had gone out of her eyes:
“Won’t you be a little lonely here to-night?” Noll asked her.
"“No,” she said--“she has taken seats for all three of us.”"
CHAPTER LXXXVIII
"_Wherein it is suspected that, on Occasion, the Trumpet of Fame is not"
Wholly Immaculate of the Hiccup_
"""Speak to me!"""
"""Ilaria!"""
"""Raniero?"""
"""Dead!"""
A great silence held for a moment. The woman's head sank upon the
man's shoulder. Madness had passed. Her eyes were fixed upon his with
"a wonderful earnestness, a splendid calm."
"""Is this a dream?"""
"""It is the truth!"""
Through the forest aisles rode the Duke of Spoleto.
He saw and paused.
"""I return beyond the Alps to join the forces of Rudolf of Hapsburg. My"
"men are at your disposal. I shall wait for you on yonder hillock."""
He wheeled about and was gone.
Again silence held for a pace.
Presently Ilaria gave a great sigh and looked strangely at the sun.
"""I have dreamed a dream,"" she crooned, ""and all was dark and fearful."
"Death seemed near; lurid phantoms,--things from hell! I knew not what"
"I did, nor where I wandered, nor what strange stupor held my soul. All"
"go on when one was tired--tired of her--and wanting only Gyp, only his"
"own wife?  That was a funny thing!  And now, when, for an hour or two, he"
"had shaken free of worry, had been feeling happy--yes, happy--this fellow"
"must come, and stand there with his face of a sphinx!  And he said"
pettishly:
"""Well, Paul! sit down.  What troubles have you brought?"""
Rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down.  He struck even Fiorsen by
his unsmiling pallor.
"""You had better look out for Mr. Wagge, Gustav; he came to me yesterday."
"He has no music in his soul."""
Fiorsen sat up.
"""Satan take Mr. Wagge!  What can he do?"""
"""I am not a lawyer, but I imagine he can be unpleasant--the girl is"
"young."""
"Fiorsen glared at him, and said:"
"""Why did you throw me that cursed girl?"""
"Rosek answered, a little too steadily:"
"""I did not, my friend."""
"""What!  You did.  What was your game?  You never do anything without a"
"game.  You know you did.  Come; what was your game?"""
"A frolic Faun that must be hid,"
"Shyly, in some fantastic shade,"
Where pity droops a tender lid
On laughter of itself afraid.
MORBIDEZZA.
"WHITE girl, your flesh is lilies"
"Grown ’neath a frozen moon,"
So still is
The rapture of your swoon
"Of whiteness, snow or lilies."
"The virginal revealment,"
"Your bosom’s wavering slope,"
"Concealment,"
"’Neath fainting heliotrope,"
"Of whitest white’s revealment,"
"Is like a bed of lilies,"
"A jealous-guarded row,"
Whose will is
"Simply chaste dreams:—but oh,"
The alluring scent of lilies!
PASTEL.
THE light of our cigarettes
Went and came in the gloom:
It was dark in the little room.
"Dark, and then, in the dark,"
"Sudden, a flash, a glow,"
And a hand and a ring I know.
"And then, through the dark, a flush"
"Ruddy and vague, the grace—"
A rose—of her lyric face.
HER EYES.
BENEATH the heaven of her brows’
"Unclouded noon of peace, there lies"
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs
In the seclusion of her eyes;
Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;
And there’s a little flame that dances
(A firefly in a grassy nest)
In the green circle of her glances;
"""Yes--Cagliari is _so-so_--Cagliari is very fair,"" said the black cap."
"""_Cagliari è discreto._"" He was evidently proud of it."
"""And is Mandas nice?"" asked the q-b."
"""In what way nice?"" they asked, with immense sarcasm."
"""Is there anything to see?"""
"""Hens,"" said the _maialino_ briefly. They all bristled when one asked if"
Mandas was nice.
"""What does one do here?"" asked the q-b."
"""_Niente!_ At Mandas one does _nothing_. At Mandas one goes to bed when"
"it's dark, like a chicken. At Mandas one walks down the road like a pig"
that is going nowhere. At Mandas a goat understands more than the
"inhabitants understand. At Mandas one needs socialism...."""
They all cried out at once. Evidently Mandas was more than flesh and
blood could bear for another minute to these three conspirators.
"""Then you are very bored here?"" say I."
"""Yes."""
And the quiet intensity of that naked yes spoke more than volumes.
"""You would like to be in Cagliari?"""
"""Yes."""
LOVE’S DISGUISES.
LOVE IN SPRING.
"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then"
"Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!"
"Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men?"
"Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife."
"Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid,"
Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring.
"Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,"
Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.
Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!
GIPSY LOVE.
"THE gipsy tents are on the down,"
The gipsy girls are here;
And it’s O to be off and away from the town
The floor was crowded now. The press and the visitors' galleries were
packed as Senator Crane's words continued to boom forth.
And in the press gallery a reporter from the Sioux City _Clarion_ looked
"at a representative of the London _Times_, and said, ""Good God! He's"
"gone off his rocker!"""
"The Englishman, aloof but definitely enthralled, touched his mustache"
"delicately and answered, ""Quite."""

Frank Corson rang the bell and waited at the door of Rhoda Kane's
apartment. The door opened. She wore a pale blue brunch coat. Her hair
"glowed in the light of midmorning, but her face was pale and a little"
drawn.
"Her eyes were slightly red, as though she might have been crying."
"""Hello, Rhoda."""
"""Hello, Frank."""
"""I really didn't expect to find you. I was going to write a note and"
"slip it under the door."""
"""I didn't feel well today so I didn't go to work."""
"""May I come in?"""
"""Of course."""
unconquerable.
"""I should have climbed that peak long ago if you, Miss Torsen, hadn't"
"forbidden me,"" said the lawyer."
"""You'd never have made it,"" said Mrs. Molie in an indifferent tone. This"
was probably her revenge. She turned to the Dane again as though ready to
believe him capable of anything.
"""I shouldn't want anyone to think of climbing that peak,"" said Miss"
"Torsen. ""It's as bare as a ship's mast."""
"""What if I tried it, Gerda?"" the manufacturer asked his wife with a smile."
"""After all, I'm an old sailor."""
"""Nonsense,"" she said, smiling a little."
"""Well, I climbed the mast of a schooner last spring."""
"""Where?"""
"""In Iceland."""
"""What for?"""
"""I don't know, though--all this mountain climbing--I haven't much use for"
"it,"" said the manufacturer."
"""What did you do it for? What did you climb the mast for?"" his wife"
repeated nervously.
The manufacturer laughed.
"""I don't know, Rhoda. I should know but I don't. I should have known"
what was wrong so I could have done something about it. It just went
"sour, I guess."""
She turned and walked to the window. He wondered if there were tears in
her eyes.
"""Good-bye, Rhoda."""
"""Good-bye, Frank. I'm sorry."""
"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"
open. A man stood there--a man in a blue suit with empty eyes.
Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.
"""Sit down,"" he said."
dragged her with them up the ladder. Lav was at the side of the boat
tearing off his blouse.
"""Oh, Lav, what'll we do! What are you going to do now?"" cried Sidney."
"""It's so black,"" wailed Pola. ""I'm--sick!"""
"""I'm going to swim ashore. It's the only way. I don't know how long"
"this old tub'll stand a sea and the wind's rising. We got to get help."""
"""You shan't swim alone, Lavender Green. We'll _all_ swim. That's"
"nothing of a swim--"""
"""You can't! You forget--Pola."""
"Sidney wheeled in consternation. ""Pola's complex!"" The girl was"
"crouched, now, on the deck, an abject, wailing figure."
"""You go with Lav, Mart,"" said Sidney in a quiet voice. ""I'll stay with"
"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""
"""Oh, gran'ma!"" Mart's voice choked. ""But she'd be the one to _tell_ me"
"to stay--"""
"""It's no use our all trying it,"" muttered Lav. ""I'll get there or I"
"won't get anywhere."""
"""Maybe it's too far for you to swim!"" Sidney was at Lavender's side,"
"""You like pleasure, I believe."""
Fiorsen said violently:
"""Look here: I have done with your friendship--you are no friend to me.  I"
"have never really known you, and I should not wish to.  It is finished."
"Leave me in peace."""
Rosek smiled.
"""My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like"
"that.  Moreover, you owe me a thousand pounds."""
"""Well, I will pay it.""  Rosek's eyebrows mounted.  ""I will.  Gyp will"
"lend it to me."""
"""Oh!  Is Gyp so fond of you as that?  I thought she only loved her"
"music-lessons."""
"Crouching forward with his knees drawn up, Fiorsen hissed out:"
"""Don't talk of Gyp!  Get out of this!  I will pay you your thousand"
"pounds."""
"Rosek, still smiling, answered:"
"""Gustav, don't be a fool!  With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man."
"Without--you are a child.  Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr. Wagge."
But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the
"moment.  Calm yourself.""  And, flipping the ash off his cigarette on to"
"the tray by Fiorsen's elbow, he nodded and went."
AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
"IT was a day of sun and rain,"
Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.
This was the welcome that you had
Among the woods of Fontainebleau.
ON THE HEATH.

from her eyes.

"looked down quickly, then slowly raised her head."

It was the rather pompous superintendent's way of saying he was happy to

Moulton was a handsome man of past fifty with a youthful face against

"“It is rumored,” began Kennedy, “that an attempt was made on your safe"

"""Let me look at it, Lav,"" pleaded Sidney, for Lav, a curious expression"
"on his face, had covered the knife with his hand."
"""It's funny, that's all I got to say. I mean--how it come here."""
"""Lavender Green, show me that knife this minute! You act so mysterious"
"and I have a right to know why."""
Slowly Lavender placed the knife in Sidney's eager hands. It was an
"ordinary case knife such as the fishermen carried, but Lavender pointed"
to two initials that had been carved on the case.
"""J.S."""
"""J.S."" repeated Sidney; then she cried: ""Why--J.S.! That's Jed Starrow!"""
"""Sure it's Jed Starrow!"""
"""But how did it get on the _Arabella_?"""
"""That's what I'd like to know."""
"""He's _been_ on the _Arabella_, Lav!"""
"""Or someone of his gang."""
"""Isn't that _funny_? What would he come here for?"""
"Lavender was silent. And Sidney, staring at him as though to read from"
"his face some explanation, suddenly fell silent, too. The secret that"
Cap'n Davies had laid upon her weighed heavily. She _wished_ she could
tell.
"_T. Trusty._ Nay, weep not, woman, but tell me what your cause is."
As concerning my friend is anything amiss?
"_C. Custance._ No, not on my part; but here was Sim. Suresby--"
"_T. Trusty._ He was with me, and told me so."
_C. Custance._ And he stood by
"While Ralph Roister Doister, with help of Merrygreek,"
For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.
"_C. Custance._ And of a ring and token,"
"That Suresby, I spied, did more than half suspect"
That I my faith to Gawin Goodluck did reject.
"_T. Trusty._ But was there no such matter, Dame Custance, indeed?"
"_C. Custance._ If ever my head thought it, God send me ill speed!"
Wherefore I beseech you with me to be a witness
That in all my life I never intended thing less.
And what a brainsick fool Ralph Roister Doister is
Yourself knows well enough.
“But I am already married!” cried Yvonne.
“Thinking me dead?”
“Yes.”
"He looked at her for a few seconds, then slapped his thigh and, rising"
"from his chair, bent himself double and gave vent to a roar of laughter."
The tears stood in Yvonne’s eyes.
"“Oh, but it’s comic. You don’t find it so?”"
He leant back against the railings and laughed again in genuine
merriment.
"“Why, it’s all the more reason to come back to me. _Ça y met du salé_."
Have you any children?”
Yvonne shook her head.
"“_Eh bien!_” he exclaimed, triumphantly, stepping towards her with"
"outstretched hands. But she shrank from him, outraged and bewildered."
"“Never, never!” she cried. “Go away. Have pity on me, for God’s sake!”"
Amédée Bazouge shrugged his shoulders carelessly.
"“It’s a comedy, not a tragedy, _ma chère_. If you are happy, I am not"
going to be a spoilsport. It is not my way. Be tranquil with your good
fat Englishman--I bet he’s an Englishman--In two years--bah! I can amuse
myself always till then--my poor little Yvonne. No wonder I frightened
"""Good Lord!"" moaned the Superintendent, ""and what's your salary?"""
The sergeant's good-humour was impregnable.
"""Give me time,"" he said, and the sentence was almost drowned in a loud"
knock at the door. An instant later Kilshaw rushed in.
"""What's this, Dawson?"" he cried to the Superintendent; ""what's this"
"about the murder?"""
"""You haven't heard, sir?"""
"""I went out of town to avoid this infernal row to-day, and am only just"
"back."""
Dawson smiled discreetly. He could understand that the proceedings of
the day would not attract Mr. Kilshaw.
"""But is it true,"" Kilshaw went on eagerly, ""that Mr. Benham has been"
"murdered?"""
"""Well, it looks like it, sir,"" and Dawson gave a full account of the"
circumstances.
"""And the motive?"" asked Kilshaw."
"""Robbery, I suppose. His pockets were empty, and according to our"
"information he was generally flush of money; where he got it, I don't"
"know."""
"""Ah!"" said Kilshaw meditatively; ""his pockets empty! And have you no"
"man who does not play whist lays up a sad old age for himself.” And,"
"turning on his heel impatiently, “The devil take the man!” said he, and"
walked away.
"Ffolliott espying the two newly-arrived ladies across the room, made"
his way to them:
"“Do you know, Miss Foljambe Pfinch,” he said--“I feel such an ass; they"
told me it was a--fancy--dress--affair.”
The lorgnettes were turned upon him:
"“It’s that ridiculous Mr. Ffolliott,” said she; and laughed"
immoderately.
"Ffolliott sighed, and turned away:"
"“Everybody seems to think I am an ass to-night,” he said wearily. “Oh,"
there’s Fosse. I don’t like Fosse--but I’ll talk to _him_. No--he’s
"talking to another man. I think I’ll go home. No, I won’t, I’ll sit"
down.”
He sat down.
"“Every fellow does something idiotic in his life,” he said."
He watched Fosse button-hole Gomme; and he saw Gomme’s lips smile
"amusedly as he gazed at the floor, listening to him."
He bent all his attention to hear what passed between the two.
"“Now, you know, Mr. Gomme,” said the fussy little man--“in"
And very soon the French and English skippers were talking to each
"other at the rate of knots, while Hart sat in a crowd of Frenchmen"
and told them all about everything.
It was close on sundown when Jones returned to the _Potluck_.  He had
to be helped up the side by some of the crew.
"""Ain't we under arrest?"" they asked.  ""Does we dare come out?"""
Jones hiccupped.
"""I releases you on your own recognition,"" he said.  ""So down you come"
"and 'elp."""
"When he put his foot on the deck, he mustered all hands aft."
"""And you, Lampert, and you, Simcox!"""
The two mates came out of their cabins.
"""And where's Hart?"""
"""If you please, sir, he's drunk,"" said Billy."
"""Arrest 'im,"" said the skipper; ""what's 'e mean by it?  Now, look"
"'ere, you bally lot, what does you think of yourselves?"""
The crew appeared uneasy.
"""I went all by my lone,"" said the skipper, hanging on to the poop"
"ladder, ""all by my lone I went, and I brings back peace!  Do you"
"other's twin--elderly, soberly dressed, his only distinction a sword"
and pistol in his girdle and a white shoulder sash.
'Herr Krapp?' I said.
"'The same,' he answered, eying me gravely."
"'I am the Countess of Heritzburg's steward,' I said. I began to see"
the need of explanation. 'Doubtless you have heard that she is in the
city?'
"'Certainly,' he answered. 'In the Ritter Strasse.'"
"'Yes,' I replied. 'A fortnight ago she missed a young woman, one of"
"her attendants. She was lost in a night adventure,' I continued, my"
throat dry and husky. 'A few minutes ago I saw her looking from one of
your windows.'
'From one of my windows?' he exclaimed in a tone of surprise.
"'Yes,' I said stiffly."
He opened his eyes wide. 'Here?' he said. He pointed to his house.
I nodded.
"'Impossible!' he replied, shutting his lips suddenly. 'Quite"
"impossible, my friend. My household consists of my two sons and"
"myself. We have a housekeeper only, and two lads. I have no young"
women in the house.'
"'Yet I saw her face, Herr Krapp, at your window,' I answered"
"The Princess looked puzzled.  ""But it wasn't your fault, dear, that"
"mother died."""
"""Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that.  As you know, a dragon carried her"
"off and--well, there it was.  But supposing""--he looked at her"
"shyly--""I had married again."""
The Princess was startled.
"""Who?"" she asked."
"The King peered into his flagon.  ""Well,"" he said, ""there _are_"
"people."""
"""If it had been somebody _very_ nice,"" said the Princess wistfully,"
"""it might have been rather lovely."""
The King gazed earnestly at the outside of his flagon.
"""Why 'might have been?'"" he said."
"The Princess was still puzzled.  ""But I'm grown up,"" she said; ""I"
"don't want a mother so much now."""
The King turned his flagon round and studied the other side of it.
"""A mother's--er--tender hand,"" he said, ""is--er--never----"" and then"
the outrageous thing happened.
"It was all because of a birthday present to the King of Barodia, and"
the present was nothing less than a pair of seven-league boots.  The
"King being a busy man, it was a week or more before he had an"
"""Play me the 'Carnival,'"" he said.  ""We shall soon see!"""
"Gyp played.  Twice he nodded; once he tapped his fingers on his teeth,"
"and showed her the whites of his eyes--which meant: ""That will have to be"
"very different!""  And once he grunted.  When she had finished, he sat"
"down beside her, took her hand in his, and, examining the fingers, began:"
"""Yes, yes, soon again!  Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler!"
"Trop sympathique!  The back-bone, the back-bone--we shall improve that."
"Now, four hours a day for six weeks--and we shall have something again."""
Gyp said softly:
"""I have a baby, Monsieur Harmost."""
Monsieur Harmost bounded.
"""What!  That is a tragedy!""  Gyp shook her head.  ""You like it?  A baby!"
"Does it not squall?"""
"""Very little."""
"""Mon Dieu!  Well, well, you are still as beautiful as ever.  That is"
"something.  Now, what can you do with this baby?  Could you get rid of it"
"a little?  This is serious.  This is a talent in danger. A fiddler, and a"
"baby!  C'est beaucoup!  C'est trop!"""
"Gyp smiled.  And Monsieur Harmost, whose exterior covered much"
"sensibility, stroked her hand."
"""You have grown up, my little friend,"" he said gravely.  ""Never mind;"
"and rather looking on than taking part. 'What is it?' I said, shaking"
him roughly by the arm. 'What is the matter here?'
"'Hallo!' he answered, starting as he turned to me. 'Is it you again,"
my friend?'
I had hit on Herr Krapp!' Yes!' I cried breathlessly. 'What is it?
what is amiss?'
"He shrugged his shoulders. 'They are hanging a spy,' he answered."
"'Nothing more. Irregular, but wholesome.'"
I drew a deep breath. 'Is that all?' I said.
"He eyed me curiously. 'To be sure,' he said. 'What did you think it"
was?'
"'I feared that there might be something wrong at my lady's,' I said,"
beginning to get my breath again. 'I left her alone at sunset. And
when I saw this crowd before the house I--I could almost have cut off
"my hand. Thank God, I was mistaken!'"
"He looked at me again and seemed to reflect a moment. Then he said,"
'You have not found the young woman you were seeking?'
I shook my head.
"'Well, it occurred to me afterwards--but at which window did you see"
her?'
"'At a window on the first floor; the farthest from the door,' I"
answered.
Upon the mounts of Paradise.
"Her dark face, calm as carven stone."
"The face that twilight shows the day,"
"Brooded, mysteriously alone,"
And infinitely far away.
Inexplicable eyes that drew
"Mine eyes adoring, why from me"
"Demand, new Sphinx, the fatal clue"
That seals my doom or conquers thee?
PATTIE.
"COOL comely country Pattie, grown"
"A daisy where the daisies grow,"
No wind of heaven has ever blown
Across a field-flower’s daintier snow.
Gold-white among the meadow-grass
The humble little daisies thrive;
"I cannot see them as I pass,"
But I am glad to be alive.
"And so I turn where Pattie stands,"
A flower among the flowers at play;
"I’ll lay my heart into her hands,"
And she will smile the clouds away.
you.”
The affair seemed to cause him intense amusement. A ray of light
appeared to Yvonne.
"“You won’t interfere with me at all, Amédée--not claim anything?”"
"“Oh, don’t be afraid. _Dès ce moment je vais me reflanquer au sapin!_ I"
shall be as dead as dead can be for you. _Suis pas méchant va!_”
"“Thank you,” said Yvonne. “You were always kind-hearted, Amédée--oh,"
it was a horrible mistake--it can’t be altered. You see that I am
helpless.”
"“Why, my child,” said he, seating himself again, “I keep on telling you"
it is a farce--like all the rest of life. I only laugh. And now let us
talk a little before I pop into the coffin again. What is the name of
the thrice happy being?”
"“Oh, don’t ask me, I beg you,” said Yvonne shivering. “It is all"
so painful. Tell me about yourself--your voice--Is it still in good
condition?”
“Never better. I am singing here this afternoon.”
“In the Kursaal?”
"“Why, yes. That’s why I am here. Oh, _ca marche--pas encore paralysée,"
celle-là_. Come and hear me. _Et ton petit organe à toi?_”
“I am out of practice. I have given up the profession.”
"with him, and going alone was such a bore. He did not conceal that the"
young woman meant something to him.
"Solem approached, and lifted his cap in greeting. Then he looked round"
"quickly and began to talk to the lawyer--politely, as became his position"
of a servant:
"""The Danish gentleman is going to climb the peak tomorrow. I'm to take a"
"rope and go with him."""
The lawyer was startled.
"""Is he--?"""
"The blankness of the lawyer's face was a remarkable sight. His small,"
athletic brain failed him. A moment passed in silence.
"""Yes, early tomorrow morning,"" said Solem. ""I thought I'd tell you."
"Because after all it was your idea first."""
"""Yes, so it was,"" said the lawyer. ""You're quite right. But now he'll be"
"ahead of me."""
Solem knew how to get round that.
"""No, I didn't promise to go,"" he said. ""I told him I had to go to the"
"village tomorrow."""
"""But we can't deceive him. I don't want to do that."""
"""Pity,"" said Solem. ""Everybody says the first one to climb the Blue Peak"
"will be in all the papers."""
due at rehearsal at twelve.”
"“I'll go and tell her now,” said John."
“Let me just say how d' ye do to her first. I won't stay a minute.”
The two men entered the sea-chamber together. Stella welcomed her Great
High Favourite and chatted gaily for a while. Then she commanded him to
sit down.
"“I 'm afraid I can't stay, Stellamaris. I have to go back to London.”"
Stella glanced at the clock. “Your train does n't go for an hour.” She
was jealously learned in trains.
“I think John wants to talk to you.”
"“He has been talking to me quite beautifully for a long time,” said"
"Stella, “and I want to talk to you.”"
"“He has something very particular to say, Stellamaris.”"
"“What is it, Belovedest?” Her eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands"
over her childish bosom. “You are not going to marry Belinda Molyneux?”
"“No, dear,” said John; “I'm not going to marry anybody.”"
“I'm so glad.” She turned to Herold. “Are you going to get married?”
"“No,” smiled Herold."
"Stella laughed. “What a relief! People do get married, you know, and I"
I 'll grind his bones to make my bread.”
“Why do people frighten children with stories of ogres and wicked
"fairies and all the rest of it, when the real world they live in is so"
beautiful?”
"“Pure cussedness,” answered John, unable otherwise to give a"
satisfactory explanation.
"“Cussedness is silly,” said Stellamaris."
There was a little pause. Then she put both her hands on his and pressed
it.
"“Oh, it's lovely to have you here again, Great High Belovedest; and I"
have n't thanked you for your letter. It's the most heavenly one you've
ever written to me.”
It might well have been. He had taken two hours to write it.
CHAPTER IV
"THE most heavenly of all letters,” Stellamaris repeated, as Risca made"
no reply. “I loved it because it showed me you were very happy.”
“Have you ever doubted it?” he asked.

GALSWORTHY PLAYS--SERIES 3
By John Galsworthy
Contents:
The flush that eloquently speaks.
The blue-grey smoke of cigarettes
Curls from the lessening ends that glow;
"The men are thinking of the bets,"
"The women of the debts, they owe."
"Then their eyes meet, and in their eyes"
"The accustomed smile comes up to call,"
A look half miserably wise.
Half heedlessly ironical.
IN THE HAYMARKET.
"I DANCED at your ball a year ago,"
"To-night I pay for your bread and cheese,"
"“And a glass of bitters, if you please,"
"For you drank my best champagne, you know!”"
"Madcap ever, you laugh the while,"
As you drink your bitters and munch your bread;
"The face is the same, and the same old smile"
Came up at a word I said.
"A year ago I danced at your ball,"
I sit by your side in the bar to-night;
"And the luck has changed, you say: that’s all!"
"And the luck will change, you say: all right!"
"The rain on my garret roof is falling,"
And I am cold and in pain.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And my heart is wild with delight;
"I hear her voice through the midnight calling,"
As I lie awake in the night.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And I see her bright eyes gleam;
"She smiles, she speaks, and the world is ended,"
And made again in a dream.
MUSIC AND MEMORY.
To K.W.
"ACROSS the tides of music, in the night,"
"Her magical face,"
A light upon it as the happy light
Of dreams in some delicious place
Under the moonlight in the night.
"Music, soft throbbing music in the night,"
Her memory swims
"Into the brain, a carol of delight;"
The cup of music overbrims
"With wine of memory, in the night."
"here.' And again she tried to shut the door, but I prevented her."
'Where is he?' I asked sternly.
"'He is at morning drill, if you must know,' she snapped; 'and his two"
"sons. Now, will you let me shut my door? Or must I cry out?'"
"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"
thoughtlessly moved my foot. I heard the woman chuckle and go slipshod
"down the passage, and though I knocked again in a rage, the door"
remained closed.
"I fell back and looked at the house. An elderly man in a grave, sober"
"dress was passing, among others, and I caught his eye."
'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of
"Safety,' he said dryly. 'His brother is prefect of this ward. But here"
is Herr Krapp. Doubtless he has been at St. Sebald's drilling.'
"I thanked him, and made but two steps to Herr Krapp's side. He was the"
Something in his tones brought to his hostess one of those swift fits of
repentance that were apt to wait for her whenever she allowed herself to
treat this visitor with friendliness. He was so very prompt in
responding!
"""She is not very well,"" she answered, rather coldly."
"""I--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing her?"""
Mr. Coxon's wishes were fulfilled to the moment. The door opened and
Alicia came in. On seeing him she stopped.
"""Come in, Alicia,"" said Lady Eynesford. ""Here's Mr. Coxon come to be"
"congratulated."""
Coxon stood up with a propitiatory smile.
"""How do you do, Mr. Coxon?"" said Alicia, giving him a limp hand. ""Shall"
"I ring for tea, Mary?"""
"""They'll bring it. You haven't wished him joy."""
"""Oh, are you in the new Ministry?"""
"""I have that honour, Miss Derosne. I hope you are on our side?"""
"""I don't quite know which side you are on--now,"" observed Alicia, in"
slow but distinct tones.
Coxon grew red.

And if in Vain down on the Stubborn Floor
"Of Earth you lie. And weary, cramped and sore,"
You gaze to-day; you may be jolly sure
To-morrow ’twill be worse than ’twas before!
Yesterday’s Troubles made you Mad for fair.
"To-morrow’s Trials too, will make you Swear."
Crank! For you know not What’s the hitch nor Why!
"Crank! For you know not When you go, nor Where!"
Each Morn a Thousand Troubles cause Delay.
Yes: but you left Some unfixed Yesterday;
And this first Impulse that should bring the Spark—
"Confound this old Igniter, Anyway!"
You Thaw your Freezeless Circulation first;
Then mend your Puncture Proof Tire where it Burst.
"Helpless you Skid upon your Anti-Skids,"
But Starting a Self-Starter is the Worst!
"Perhaps you get out your Repairing-Kit,"
And try to Regulate the Thing a bit;

"beginning; a few carriages, and groups of soldiers and seminarians,"
"crowded around the bandstand; Laura didn’t care for brass bands, they"
"were too noisy for her, and she gave the coachman orders to drive to the"
Corso.
_MEETING MARCHMONT_
"They passed in front of the Villa Medici, and when they got near the"
"Piazza, della Trinitá de’ Monti they met a man on horseback, who, on"
"seeing them, immediately approached the carriage. It was Archibald"
"Marchmont, who had just arrived in Rome."
"“I thought you had forgotten us,” said Laura."
"“I forget you, Marchesa! Never.”"
“You say you came to Rome....”
"“From Nice I had to return to London, because my father was seriously"
ill with an attack of gout.”
“He is well again?”
"“Yes, thank you. You are coming back from a drive?”"
“Yes.”
“Don’t you want to come and have tea with my wife and me?”
“Where?”
They walked to the Piazza del Popólo and through the Via Babuino to the
Piazza di Spagna.
“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling
"rosaries and photographs who spoke scarcely any Italian or French, but"
did speak Spanish. Probably he was a Jew.
"Cæsar asked him where they manufactured those religious toys, and the"
pedlar told him in Westphalia.
"Frank Corson sat down. He saw the man and he saw Rhoda, but they seemed"
unimportant. Something had happened to his mind and he was busy
struggling with it. That was all that was important.
The strange lethargy that came like a cloud over his mind was beyond
understanding.

Captain Abrams looked into the closet and back at Brent Taber. His lips
"were back a little off his teeth. With Abrams, this indicated anger."
"""All right. What does Washington do about this one? Does Washington tell"
"us to be good little boys and go hand out parking tickets?"""
"""It wasn't like that,"" Taber said."
"""It doesn't much matter how it was. The thing is--how is it going to be"
"now?"""
"""You got a murder, friend. Plain and simple. What do the New York police"
"do when they get a murder?"""
"Abrams spoke bitterly. ""Sometimes they let a panel truck drive in and"
"haul the body away and that's that."""
"""Let's save the sarcasm until later. I called you in. It's your case."
"What do you want me to do?"""
"""Talk a little, maybe. The other one--now this one. The same killer?"""
"""Oh, I'm--I'm--sick!"" broke in Pola."
"""Sit up straight and talk and you won't think about it,"" commanded"
"Mart, so sternly that Pola straightened, her white face wan in the"
darkness.
"""I don't see how you _can_ talk when you're--may be--going--to die!"""
"""Well, talking helps you more than crying."""
"""But I--I don't _want_ to--die."""
"""Who does?"" retorted Mart roughly. Nevertheless, touched by Pola's"
"helplessness, she found Pola's hand and held it close in hers. ""But"
"let's face whatever happens with our heads up!"""
"""To the wind,"" breathed Sidney, shivering."
"""I--I just can't be brave like you two. I--I'm an awful coward. I can't"
help it. I've always been afraid to even try to swim. I'm afraid of
"lots of things. Oh, I'm afraid to--to--"""
Sidney caught Pola's other hand.
"""Don't say it, Pola. Maybe someone will find us. And probably you can't"
"help feeling afraid."""
Mart suddenly remembered the cookies she had brought. She found them
where she had hidden them at the back of one of the bunks.
"""Here, eat a cookie and you'll forget things. I'm hungry, aren't you,"
"too?"""
"sunny and carefree soul of yours?"""
"""Nobody! _Nobody!_"""
"""Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand--"""
"""I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me"
"Ford."""
"""Ford? _Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand...."""
After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few

"Flying forty-two miles above Kansas, something phenomenal had happened"
“Well?”
“Does it not seem odd to you?”
"“Not at all. A relation of her first husband’s, I suppose. In fact"
Yvonne said as much.”
"“I could not help being struck by the name, Everard. It is so peculiar."
I remembered it from the publication of the banns.”
"“I compliment you on your memory, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"Mrs. Winstanley drew herself up, offended."
"She walked from the window where they were standing to a table, and"
fetched from it a newspaper.
“Do you remember the Christian name of Yvonne’s first husband?”
"The Canon drew himself up too, and frowned."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Emmeline? What are you trying to"
insinuate?”
"“If I thought you were going to adopt this tone, Everard, I should have"
kept my suspicions to myself.”
"“I certainly wish that you had,” said he, growing angry. “It is an"
insult to Yvonne which I cannot permit. My wife is above suspicion.”
"“Like Caesar’s,” said the lady with a curl of the lip. “Do you know that"
"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....

individuality like herself!
The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"
"""I came to see Gustav.  He's not up yet, it seems.  I thought I would"
"speak to you first.  Can we talk?"""
"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"
"""Of course!  Here?  Or in the drawing-room?"""
Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""
"A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated"
herself where she could see Betty and the baby.  Rosek stood looking down
"at her; his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his"
spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
"""What is it?"" she said."
"""Bad business, I'm afraid.  Something must be done at once.  I have been"
"trying to arrange things, but they will not wait.  They are even"
"threatening to sell up this house."""
"With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:"
"Under our feet as we walked in the night,"
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze
In the magical light;
"And the moon was a silver fire,"
"And the stars were flickers of flame,"
Golden and violet and red;
"And the night-wind sighed my desire,"
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said
In her ear her adorable name.
"But her heart would not hear what I heard,"
"The pulse of the night as it beat,"
"Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,"
In its murmurous repeat;
"She heard not the night-wind’s sigh,"
"Nor her own name breathed in her ear,"
"Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,"
"A speechless, a clamorous cry:"
“Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?”
"O heart, she will hear, by and by,"
"When we part, when for ever we part."

AFTER PAUL VERLAINE.
"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—
"columns of smoke close together, and you ought to know what that means.”"
“Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means ‘Help is wanted’!” exclaimed Harry.
“We’ve got to go and see what it is.”
"“It may be Jimmie,” Jack suggested."
"“It’s either Jimmie or that messenger boy,” Frank said. “If it’s Jimmie,"
"he’s really in trouble, and if it’s the messenger boy, he’s doing it to"
get more of us into his clutches.”
"“Then we’d better go well armed and ready for any kind of a reception,”"
Jack advised. “No knowing what we’ll find.”
“What’ll we do with Gilroy?” asked Frank.
"“Aw, let him sleep,” advised Harry."
"“Sure, let him sleep,” Jack put in. “He’ll be all right ’till we get"
back. No one will molest the camp in daytime.”
"“Seems to me that we ought to leave someone here,” Frank said."
"“All right, you can stay if you want to!” Jack declared. “Harry and I"
are going down there to see what the trouble is about.”
"“Aw, come on, Frank!” Harry urged. “There won’t anything happen to"
"Gilroy! He may have a bad dream, but that’s about all.”"
“How far do you suppose that signal is from here?” asked Frank.
"“Not more than half a mile,” Harry explained."

The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:
“Eh?” said he--“borrow? Why borrow?”

borrow--I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.”

"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"

Kilshaw nodded again.

Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.

"""Ow!""  The sound of his breathing could be heard distinctly; he twisted a"
chair round and said:
"""Take a seat, won't you?"""
Gyp shook her head.
In Mr. Wagge's face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more
"primitive emotion.  Taking out a large, black-edged handkerchief, he blew"
"his nose, passed it freely over his visage, and turning to his daughter,"
muttered:
"""Go upstairs."""
"The girl turned quickly, and the last glimpse of her white face whipped"
"up Gyp's rage against men.  When the door was shut, Mr. Wagge cleared his"
throat; the grating sound carried with it the suggestion of enormously
thick linings.
He said more gruffly than ever:
"""May I ask what 'as given us the honour?"""
"""I came to see your daughter."""
"His little piggy eyes travelled from her face to her feet, to the walls"
"of the room, to his own watch-chain, to his hands that had begun to rub"
"The old man became all the more frightened, and glanced at his face."
"""You are lying!"" he said scornfully, when the teacher had finished."
"""What lie have I told?"" asked the teacher."
"""You mentioned tribes that are not mentioned in the Bible."""
"He got up and walked away, angry and deeply insulted."
"""You will go mad, Tyapa,"" called the teacher after him with conviction."
"Then the old man came back again, and stretching out his hand,"
threatened him with his crooked and dirty finger.
"""God made Adam--from Adam were descended the Jews, that means that all"

"""Well?"""
"""Tartars are descended from Ishmael, but he also came of the Jews ..."""
"""What do you want to tell me all this for?"""
"""Nothing!  Only why do you tell lies?""  Then he walked away, leaving"
his companion in perplexity.  But after two days he came again and sat
by him.
"""You are learned ...  Tell me, then, whose descendants are we? Are we"
"Babylonians, or who are we?"""
"""We are Slavs, Tyapa,"" said the teacher, and attentively awaited his"
"""Come and help us!"" he called excitedly to the group of guests."
"""What's happened?"" somebody asked."
"""He fell off."""
How tired Solem was and drenched to the skin! But what could we do? Rush
up the mountainside and look at the accident too?
"""Can't he walk?"" somebody asked."
"""No, he's dead,"" said Solem, looking from one to another of us as though"
"to read in our faces whether his message seemed credible. ""He fell off; he"
"didn't want me to help him."""
A few more questions and answers. Josephine was already halfway across the
field; she was going to the village to telephone for the doctor.
"""We shall have to get him down,"" said the Danish mountaineer."
So he and I improvised a stretcher; Solem was instructed to take brandy
"and bandages to the site of the accident, and the Bergensians, the"
"Associate Master, Miss Torsen, and Mrs. Molie went with him."
"""Did you really say nothing to Solem about climbing the peak today?"" I"
asked the Dane.
"""No,"" he replied. ""I never said a word about it. If I had meant to go, I"
"should certainly not have wanted company...."""
Later that afternoon we returned with the lawyer on the stretcher. Solem
"""A mother's tender hand,"" said the King of Euralia,"
"""is--er--never--good gracious!  What's that?"""
There was a sudden rush of air; something came for a moment between
his Majesty and the sun; and then all was quiet again.
"""What was it?"" asked Hyacinth, slightly alarmed."
"""Most extraordinary,"" said the King.  ""It left in my mind an"
impression of ginger whiskers and large boots.  Do we know anybody
"like that?"""
"""The King of Barodia,"" said Hyacinth, ""has red whiskers, but I don't"
"know about his boots."""
"""But what could he have been doing up there?  Unless----"""
There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction; once more
"the sun was obscured, and this time, plain for a moment for all to"
"see, appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia"
on his way home to breakfast.
Merriwig rose with dignity.
"""You're quite right, Hyacinth,"" he said sternly; ""it _was_ the King of"
"Barodia."""
Hyacinth looked troubled.
"""He oughtn't to come over anybody's breakfast table quite so quickly"
"as that.  Ought he, Father?"""
"“Cheer up, Andrew,” he cried."
Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was very pale:
“Where’s the bar?” he asked gloomily.
Rippley laughed:
"“Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,” he said. “We’re"
all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:
"“No--I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with the gods"
to-night.”
He came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it
on the after capstan.
"""I guess I'll have a boy,"" said Jones.  ""'Ere, you scum, send me"
"Billy.""  And Billy came aft."
"""I releases you temp'ry without bail,"" said the skipper fiercely, ""so"
"puckalow that case and foller me.  No, you wait till I gets a"
"tablecloth as a signal I'm willin' to 'ave peace."""
When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the
"hill, followed by the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He"
"found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the crest, and heard them talk."
"""Say, Johnny French,"" said old Jones, ""if you wants war, prepare for"
"peace.  Who's the captain?"""
"""Sapristi!"" said the French captain."
Jones nodded.
"""Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault, if relyin' on the"
discretion of ambassadors ain't a fault: and maybe you can swaller
the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in.  And is your
"name Sapristi?"""
"""Nom de Dieu----"" began the Frenchman, but Jones waved his hand with"
dignity.
"""Call yourself what you like, but 'ave you got anythin' in the way of"
"a marlinspike or a splice bar as'll open this yer case?"""
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"One of Captain Gow's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock, Wapping, in June,"

"ROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate."
Born 1682. Died 1722.
If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the
number of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should
"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"
"""Charmed to see you in London, _mon confrère_,"" said he. ""Have you yet"
"discovered your man?"""
"""I am hard at his heels,"" the detective answered, his eyes searching"
"Slyne's as if, Sallie thought, for some sign that that shaft had hit"
home.
"But Slyne's expression was one of ingenuous simplicity. He bowed, as if"
with deep respect.
"""I caught a glimpse of some one most amazingly like myself, one day on"
"the Faubourg St. Honoré, as I was passing through Paris,"" he mentioned"
reflectively.
"""Thanks,"" returned Dubois. ""It was he, no doubt. And--he's in London"
"now."""
"Slyne did not wince, even at that."
"""He was dining at the Savoy to-night,"" said Dubois indifferently. ""How"
"does your own affair progress?"""
"""_Assez bien_,"" Slyne answered in an even voice. ""I have followed my"
"quarry home and am awaiting developments."""
"""You will be in London for a little, then?"""
"""For the next week or ten days, I expect,"" Slyne lied with perfect"
aplomb.
"""We shall meet again, in that case,"" declared the detective, glancing at"
"Sallie; and, ""_Au plaisir de vous revoir, monsieur_,"" Slyne returned"
never accepts my invitations.  I cannot tell why.  I don't fancy he
"considers me his friend."""
"""Sibyl was at your reception the other evening,"" I remarked suddenly."
"""She told me she met a man who was a stranger in Paris.  His name, I"
"think she said, was Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf.  Who is he?"""
"""He was introduced by de Wolkenstein, the Austrian Ambassador,"" she"
"replied quickly.  ""I did not know him."""
"""Have you never met him before?""  I asked, looking sharply into her"
eyes.
"""Once, I think, but I am not certain,"" she said, with a palpable effort"
to evade my question.
I smiled.
"""Come, madame,"" I said good-humouredly, ""you know Rodolphe Wolf quite as"
"well as I do.  When you last met, his name was not Wolf.  Is not that"
"so?"""
"""Well,"" she answered, ""now that you put it in that manner I may as well"
"admit that your suggestion is correct."""
"""And what is the object of his sudden visit to Paris?"""
"""I cannot make out,"" she replied in a more confidential tone.  ""As I"
"tell you, de Wolkenstein introduced him, but, as m'sieur knows, I am"
"very quick to detect a face that I have once seen, and I recognised him"
"in an instant."""

"""If we don't take it off tonight Lav Green may find it--or that girl--"""
"At that someone laughed, horribly. ""Huh--_him_! Why we could twist"
"every crooked bone in his body until he wouldn't know 'em. Him--ha,"
"that's a joke! Why, a look 'ud scare him to a pulp. The girl, too."""
"Sidney, reaching her hand out instinctively, caught Lavender's and held"
it tight. She felt the writhing of his body.
"A new voice broke in above them. ""I got a better scheme. Listen."
"We'll--"" But the voices suddenly died to silence; the footsteps moved"
away.
"The four, huddled in the darkness of the cabin, drew long trembling"
breaths.
"""Lav, those diamonds are on this boat!"""
"""Sh--h. I know it. But we got to be careful. They haven't gone yet. We"
got to wait. And we'll wait until we find 'em. Damn them _I'll_ show
"them who's crooked!"""
"""Hush,"" implored Sidney. ""Of course you will"""
"""Isn't it most morning? I--I wish I was home,"" quavered Pola; but no"
one paid any heed to her.

"""It's the next hand that tells, Jack, ain't it?"""
"""Yes."""
"""It's the next hand that tells me,--I'm awfully sorry,--"" the words"
"seemed to come awkwardly; her glance was troubled, almost contrite, ""at"
"any rate, I want to say jest now that no matter how it comes out--"""
"""Cut!"" interjected Rance mechanically."
"""--that I'll always think of you the best I can,"" completed the Girl"
"with much feeling. ""An' I want you to do the same for me."""
"Silently, inscrutably, the gambler dealt the ten cards, one by one. But"
"as the Girl started to draw hers toward her, his long, thin fingers"
reached across once more and closed not ungently upon hand and cards.
"""The last hand, Girl!"" he reminded her. ""And I've a feeling that I"
"win,--that in one minute I'll hold you in my arms."" And still covering"
"her fingers with his own, he stole a glance at his cards."

"The woman opened the door and they went into the church. It was small,"
overcharged with ornaments. They saw the tomb of Bishop Spinelli and
"Giotto’s Virgin, and then went into a hall gay with red flags with a"
"white cross, on whose walls they could read the names of the Grand"
Masters of the Order of Malta. The majority of the names were French and
"Polish. Two or three were Spanish, and among them that of Cæsar Borgia."
"“Your countryman and namesake was also a Grand Master of Malta,” said"
Kennedy.
"“So it seems,” replied Cæsar with indifference. “I see that you speak"
with contempt of that extraordinary man. Is he not congenial to you?”
“The fact is I don’t know his history.”
“Really?”
"“Yes, really.”"

240 miles on the mainland of America.

Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"
French newspapers.”
Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"
with affected drawl:
"“D’you know, I feel such an awful ass--and I don’t get used to it.”"
Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:
"“Young fellow,” said he--“you must not be egotistical--it’s bad for the"
morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.”
"“I can’t,” drawled Ffolliott miserably--“I am quite angry with"
Rippley--he told me it was a fancy-dress affair--and----”
Fosse turned his back upon him impatiently:

"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"
problem of M. l'Abbé du Boise. Presently I discovered the cue. The
"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"
"which could be nothing more nor less than the Dunkirk affair, and"
"should be discovered, there would be a public entertainment on Tyburn"
"Hill, with George as the central figure."
"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"
"good Doctor among the stars, as usual. There was a letter for me from"
Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--

will be the guest of M. Comte de Grammont.
"""You do not know him. Please call on him when he arrives. Tell the"

"""You know,"" she began, ""there's more to marriage than just--"""
"""So there is,"" he cut in. ""Well, we can try each other for taste."" And"
"he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her"
"slim, straight back."
Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up
first.
"""Now, me,"" he said, ""I'd vote yes."""
Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side
of her mouth. Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if
she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving
"backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more"
"impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and"
jumped out.

"""Enter Pollyanna! She is the daintiest, dearest, most irresistible"
maid you have met in all your journeyings through Bookland. And you
"forget she is a story girl, for Pollyanna is so real that after your"
first introduction you will feel the inner circle of your friends has
"admitted a new member. A brave, winsome, modern American girl,"
Pollyanna walks into print to take her place in the hearts of all
"members of the family."""
"_Of ""Miss Billy"" the critics have written as follows:_"
"""To say of any story that it makes the reader's heart feel warm"
"and happy is to pay it praise of sorts, undoubtedly. Well,"
"that's the very praise one gives 'Miss Billy.'""--_Edwin L."
Shuman in the Chicago Record-Herald._
"""The story is delightful and as for Billy herself--she's _all"

character and plenty of romance of the most unusual

"""Stop press--Latest news and appointments,"" he read. ""The Admiralty"
has approved of the following transfer. From R.N.R. to R.N.:
"Lieutenant Terence Aubyn, to date 3rd of June, 1915."""
For a moment Terence looked incredulously at the torpedo-lieutenant.
"""Torps,"" he knew, was fond of a practical joke, but if he were"
playing a prank it was carrying the game a little too far.
"""Here you are,"" continued Oswestry, noting the expression on"
"Terence's face. ""Read it for yourself."""
"""It's worth getting this,"" said Aubyn, indicating the position of his"
"wound. ""All I want now is to be afloat again."""
"""Young fire-eater!"" exclaimed ""Torps"" facetiously. ""Don't you"
"worry--you'll have a look-in before The Day comes. By Jove, Aubyn,"
you'll have to ask the surgeon if he'll allow you to hold a
"fête----"""
The crunching of boots upon the gravel path caused both officers to
turn. Standing at attention was a Marine orderly; behind him a
telegraph boy.
"""Congratulations pouring in already,"" remarked ""Torps."""
Terence took the buff envelope and opened it.
"""Great Scott!"" he exclaimed brokenly, and without another word he"
handed the telegram to his companion.
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
There was a titter.
“Sharles ze Foorst--risen from ze dead!” announced Rippley.
“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"
beginning to move at last. This _is_ going to be a unique night.”
“Hush!”
"They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon the room."
"Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He roused:"
"“Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the guests"
arriving--all the clever fellows that have made the world a
delight--and with them come the dear dead companions that worked with
"us, and sang with us, and drank with us--in Paris.... I know them--they"

Lovegood laughed:
"“No--by omnibus,” said he. “Let us all be winged asses to-night. Fosse"

From the great doorway:
“Mistair and Mrs. Nezzerbie Gomme!” announced Rippley; and as the pair
"were greeted by all near them, Rippley stepped to the head of the great"
"stairs, and going up to a pompous man as that worthy set foot on the"
"topmost step, he said to him confidentially:"
"“I say, mister, would you mind running down the stairs and telling the"
fellar with the red hair that I want him?”
Sir Tankerton Wollup swelled slowly:
"“Pooh--pooh!” said he, drawing himself up; and he strutted to the door."
“Poof--poof!” said Rippley. “Giddy old thing!”
"He glanced over the balustrade down to the next landing, and caught"
Doome’s eye:
“Beelzebub!” he growled--“the whole town’s coming to this silly
"theatrical affair.... I say, we ought to go and see that Andrew"

Don’t break the butterfly.
Tell him also that both of you have much of my heart.
"Yours,"
NOLL.
P.S.--I am tired of myself. I am off to find Betty.”
Noll sealed the letter and wrote a third--to the concierge:
"“MADAME,"
I am called away to England. Mademoiselle Madelaine Le Trouvé has
been good enough to take charge of the rooms until madame and
myself return. Pray give the enclosed to your little ones ‘from the
Englishman who knows how to laugh.’
"Agréez, etc.,"
OLIVER BADDLESMERE.”
"He stole to where Madelaine slept, and on the chair by her bed he put"
her letter and some banknotes.
"He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his large"
"leather kit-bag, and carried it to where the candle gave light. From"
"the walls he took down the portraits of Betty and one or two trinkets,"
and very carefully wrapped them up. They too went into the bag.
"He returned on board the wreck of the _Potluck_, and in company with"
"a bottle of brandy strove with the situation, while the crowd and"
"their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons."
"""It ain't any good talkin',"" said Jack, ""and hevery one knows that"

"mule's 'ind leg off.  'Hout of this,' is the on'y hargument a"

"""But they seems to be a good many more of 'em than us,"" suggested the"
crowd.
"""Come to that,"" said Hart, ""it's the on'y just ground we 'as to go"
"for 'em.  For if they was on'y ekal numbers, it'd be cowardly to"
"whack 'em, and I for one would be on the side of just goin' down"
there and shovin' them out peaceful.  I'm for the hultimatum right
"off.  I wonder 'ow the Guffin will put it.  Say, boys, 'ere 'e comes!"""
"The ""old man"" staggered up with a sheet of paper in his hand."
"""Have you done it, sir?"" asked Simcox.  ""Let's hear it."""
"""Yes, read it out,"" said Lampert, with half a sneer, which the"
skipper did not notice.
The crowd gathered round as the captain squatted on a rock.
"""On board the British barque _Potluck_, belonging to the British port"
"Liverpool; owners, McWattie & Co.; Captain Abednego Jones."
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir----"""
"""Never!"""
Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""you think!  No, that is impossible!""  He walked twice"
"very quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said"
"sharply: ""Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work."""
Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
"""Nice old chap!"""
"At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid.  Going to do the"
"music-room that morning, she had ""found the master sitting on the sofa,"
"holding his head, and groaning awful.  He's not been at home, ma'am,"
"since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do.  I ran"
"for cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am,"
"I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and"
he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
"go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am.  So I didn't know what to do."""
"Gyp, pale to the lips, said:"
"""Wait here a minute, Ellen,"" and went into the dining-room.  Winton"
"followed.  She turned to him at once, and said:"
"""Oh, Dad, what am I to do?  His brain!  It would be too awful to feel I'd"
"brought that about."""
Winton grunted.  Gyp went on:
"""I must go and see.  If it's really that, I couldn't bear it.  I'm afraid"
"""You needn't believe _me_,"" he answered her. ""Ask Mr. Jobling. He'll"
"tell you."""
"Mr. Jobling coughed importantly. ""I'll tell you all I know myself, Lady"
"Josceline,"" he promised her, and proceeded to repeat in part what he had"
"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"
"long."""
Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.
"""And before that--?"" he suggested, politely patient."
"""Before that she was--what she still is so far's I'm concerned--Saleh"
"Harez, my adopted daughter."""
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his
"room, I know."""
"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""
"""In case,"" Kilshaw read, ""of my death or disappearance, please deliver"
"this parcel to Mr. Kilshaw, Legislative Assembly, Kirton."""
"""I'm sorry to say, sir,"" said the Superintendent, ""that the detective"
sergeant conducting the search took upon him to open this packet in the
presence of one or two persons. It ought to have been opened by no one
"but----"""
"""Myself."""
"""Pardon me, but myself,"" said the Superintendent, with a slight smile."
"""Owing to the inexcusable blunder, I'm afraid something about what it"
"contains may leak out prematurely. Those pests, the reporters, are"
"everywhere; you can't keep 'em out."""
"""Well, what does it contain?"" asked Kilshaw. He was annoyed at this"
"unsought publicity, but he saw at once that he must show no sign of"
vexation.
"""That, for one thing,"" and the Superintendent handed Kilshaw a"
"photograph of two persons, a young woman and a young man. ""Look at the"
"back,"" he added."
"Kilshaw looked, and read--""My wife and M."""
"""That's the deceased's handwriting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And you know the persons?"""
"""I've no doubt about them. It's the Premier--and--and Mrs. Medland."""
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
The last sheet of notations was covered. Then John Dennis sat motionless
"for a minute, his frown and uncertainty returning. ""It's hard to project"
"the details,"" he said. ""All this detail. Difficult."""
He dropped the last sheet and got up and poured himself another Scotch.
"""They will make an army now,"" he said. The Scotch went down smoothly. He"
"went to the window and looked out. ""This planet is different. The sun"
"there is blue and the air is very thin. Their bodies are nothing, but"
their heads are very big. Now they will create an army and take this
"planet."""
Frank Corson was shaking his head slowly like a groggy fighter. Rhoda
"sat huddled on the sofa, her mind such a mixture of tumbling emotions"
that it seemed to be trying to tear itself out of her head. John Dennis
"came back and stood in the middle of the room. He swayed drunkenly. ""So"
many things I don't understand. I see people I know--or I should know.
"I--"" He turned his eyes--eyes no longer empty--on Rhoda."
"""I want to make love!"""
Frank Corson got up from his chair and hurled himself on Dennis.
Rhoda screamed.

Senator Crane sat at his desk. There were a pile of newspapers in front
of him. The first one carried a front page story with the headline:

“How strange! We must go tomorrow to the Borgia Apartment in the
Vatican.”
“Good.”
"They saw the model of an ancient galley which was in the same hall, and"
went out through the church into the garden planned by Piranesi.
"The woman showed them a very old palm, with a hole in it made by a"
hand-grenade in the year ‘49. It had remained that way more than half
"a century, and it was only a few days since the trunk of the palm had"
broken.
"From the garden they went, by a path between trees, to the bastion of"

"Cæsar and Kennedy met in the Piazza di San Pietro, went into the"
"Vatican museum, and walked by a series of stairs and passageways to the"
Gallery of Inscriptions.
"Then they went down to a hall, at whose door there were guards dressed"
"Rippley clasped his hands together unctuously, bowed, smiled a large"
"Italian smile. He advanced a step, and said with a strong foreign"

There was a loud ringing of the door-bell.
Pangbutt put his hand over his eyes:
"“I must be going mad,” he said."
Rippley bowed:
"“Sir Pangboot--me and me friends, we speak not very well ze"
Engleesh--but we much understand it well--and----”
"“Yes, yes.” Pangbutt dismissed them impatiently. “Get to your"
business.... Curse it! I wonder what on earth ails Dukes.”
"As the four comic-looking foreign waiters left the room, he hesitated,"
"bewildered. And Rippley, as they passed out, nearly burst a bloodvessel"
as the tragic Blotte’s moustache fell off. But Pangbutt had suddenly
remembered that he was host; and advancing into the room he turned to
the others:
"“I beg your pardon, I am late I fear.”"

Kennedy entered. But through the door which he left ajar I could hear
what passed.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he began, “something terrible has happened—”"
"He broke off, and I gathered that her pale face and agitated manner"
told him that she knew already.
"“Where is Mr. Moulton?” he went on, changing his question."
"“Mr. Moulton is at his office,” she answered tremulously. “He"
"telephoned while I was out that he had to work to-night. Oh, Mr."
Kennedy—he knows—he knows. I know it. He has avoided me ever since I
missed the replica from-”
“Sh!” cautioned Craig. He had risen and gone to the door.
"“Winters,” he whispered, “I want you to go down to Lynn Moulton’s"
office. Meanwhile Jameson can take care of Muller. I am going over to
that place of Stein’s presently. Bring Moulton up there. You will wait
"here, Walter, for the present,” he nodded."
He returned to the room where I could hear her crying softly.
"Commodore Littleton, and apparently gave up his wicked ways thereafter."
"SHUTFIELD, WILLIAM."
Of Lancaster.
"Hanged at Rhode Island in July, 1723, at the age of 40."
"SICCADAM, JOHN."
Of Boston.
"One of Captain Pound's crew. Found guilty of piracy, but pardoned."
"SIMMS, HENRY, _alias_ ""GENTLEMAN HARRY."" Pickpocket, highwayman, pirate,"
and Old Etonian.
Born in 1716 at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. Sent while quite young to
"school at Eton, where he ""shewed an early inclination to vice,"" and at the"
age of 14 was taken from school and apprenticed to a breeches-maker. No
"Old Etonian, either then or now, would stand that kind of treatment, so"
"Simms ran away, becoming a pickpocket and later a highwayman. After"
"numerous adventures and escapes from prison, he was pressed on board"
"H.M.S. _Rye_, but he deserted his ship at Leith. After an ""affair"" at"
"Croydon, Simms was transplanted with other convicts to Maryland, in the"
"_Italian Merchant_. On the voyage he attempted, but without success, to"
raise a mutiny. On his arrival in America he was sold to the master of the
"_Two Sisters_, which was taken a few days out from Maryland by a Bayonne"
"pirate. Carried to Spain, Simms got to Oporto, and there was pressed on"
"free from distinct irritating qualities, it should be taken on an empty"
"stomach; as when digestion is going on, the contents of the stomach are"
acid in reaction and if alkalies are given combinations take place and
"salts are formed. If alkalies are given before digestion begins,"
"diffusion of the acid-forming constituents of the blood takes place, and"
in this way the acidity of the gastric juice is promoted; likewise acids
given before meals increase the diffusion of the alkaline constituents
of the blood.

"Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took"
over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me--and a
girl besides--she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
husbands in the one place they're still to be had--the planet
Venus--and you know I'll be in trouble.
"Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into."
"Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled"
out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.
Myre went suddenly dumb....
"Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was wetting his"
"lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre’s yawing should give"
"opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man, the deaf old"
gentleman asked him:
"“You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?”"
"“No, Sir Gilders--I said that the man who does not play whist is laying"
up a sad old age----”
The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”
"PHILLIPS, WILLIAM."
Born at Lower Shadwell.
"Boatswain in the _King Solomon_, a Guinea merchant ship. This ship, while"
"lying at anchor in January, 1721, was attacked by a boatful of pirates"
"from Bartholomew Roberts's ship, the _Royal Fortune_. The captain of the"
"_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his"
"crew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the"
rest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips
"eagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was ""very forward"
"and brisk"" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores."
"At his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners"
"did, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were"
"offered to him on a dish, on which lay a loaded pistol beside the copy of"
the articles.
"Found guilty and hanged in April, 1722, within the flood marks at Cape"
"Coast Castle, in his 29th year."
"PHIPS, RICHARD."
"An English soldier who deserted from Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine, in 1689."
"Wounded by a bullet in the head at Tarpaulin Cove. Taken to Boston Prison,"
where he died.
"PICKERING, CAPTAIN CHARLES."

ACT I
The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"
"drawn, the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a"
summer sunset; a grand piano stands across one corner.  The
"man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and discreet, is arranging two"
tables for Bridge.
"BURNEY, the maid, a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian"
"faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained"
"door, which she leaves open, disclosing the glimpse of a white"
"wall.  PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her head, with an"
expression of concern.
PAYNTER.  Where's she gone?
"BURNEY.  Just walks about, I fancy."
PAYNTER.  She and the Governor don't hit it!  One of these days
she'll flit--you'll see.  I like her--she's a lady; but these
thoroughbred 'uns--it's their skin and their mouths.  They'll go till
"they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but"
jib--jib--jib.  How was it down there before she married him?

ENCOUNTER
By J. Hunter Holly Author of THE GREEN PLANET
"It came plummeting out of the sky--a soundless, streaking, purple glow,"
"moving faster and faster until it ripped at the trees, crashed through"
them and struck sickeningly against a hill. Momentarily it flared
"brightly, then went out."
"It was not long after that the murders began--strange, inexplicable"
"deaths, all the victims found with their heads crushed as if their"
skulls had exploded outward.
"The trail of victims lead from Arkansas to Tennessee, to Kentucky,"
Illinois and Michigan--sixteen unrelated people who had only one thing
"in common: All of their brains were withered, as if sucked dry of their"
contents ...
"And somewhere wandered an evil stranger from another planet, his"
"personality expanding, his brain power increasing, preparing for the"
inevitable encounter that could make him master of the world!

"June, 1717."
"MOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER."
"A notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two"
ships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal
"Fortune_, being one of his chief men or ""Lords."" Taken prisoner, and tried"
"at Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28."
MOORE. Gunner.
A gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous
"crew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,"
"and Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on"
"the head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in"
"killing this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he"
was hanged in London.
"MORGAN, CAPTAIN."
"This pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Little is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French"
"pirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several"
Danish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of
"their plunder and separated into two companies, the English following"
Captain Morgan in one of the prizes.
Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."
"""What the blazes--"" A man ran forward. Two others came at his heels."
"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."

"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"

"""I still should know you,"" answered Frances."
"""Not I!"" exclaimed Bettina."
"Presently Lilly came in, and I presented him to Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise"
and explained the presence of Frances and Bettina by saying:--
"""A friend of ours in France has asked Mistress Jennings to render what"
"aid she can to Monsieur l'Abbé, and she is here at my request to receive"
"his commands."""
"""It is good!"" exclaimed Lilly. ""She has the king's ear if any one has,"
and the ear is very close to the mind. What may I do to serve Monsieur
"l'Abbé?"""
"""If I may see you privately---the baron and me--I shall tell you how you"
"may serve me,"" answered the Abbé."
"The Abbé and I excused ourselves to Frances and Bettina, and went with"
"the Doctor to the room which he called his observatory, where we came to"
the point very quickly:--
"""I want to buy Dunkirk for my master for the sum of one hundred thousand"
"pounds,"" said the Abbé, by way of starting the consultation."
"""But London has already offered that sum,"" returned Lilly, ""and stands"
"ready to pay more."""
"""In payments,"" suggested the Abbé."
"""Yes,"" returned Lilly. ""But I see no way of bringing the king to accept"
"the sum you offer unless--unless Mistress Jennings can persuade him."""

"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.

THE POWER OF EVIL
"""You might call it a fight,"" Elizabeth said, ""but they never actually"
"laid a hand on each other."""
"Dr. Carew stared at her in puzzlement as she went on. ""They threw every"
"hard thing in the room at each other, without ever touching anything. It"
"was like some ghastly, murderous game. A clock flew through the air like"
"a cannonball, straight at Joseph's head, and some unseen force seemed to"
stop it. For a second it hung there and trembled in the air--_with
nothing under it_; then it turned and flew like lightning at Quincy; he
barely dodged it.
"""Finally a vase did find its mark and Quincy fell to the floor. Joseph"
"stepped over him and came toward me. I ran, slamming the door in his"
"face, locking him in. He laughed evilly and called after me, 'Why waste"
"time running away, Elizabeth? I'll come to get you, and you won't be"
"able to resist me now!'"""

thriller--

The Girl turned upon him with eyes flashing and retorted:
"""Well, it's my throat, ain't it?"""
"""Well I'll be!--"" The Sheriff's sentence was left unfinished, for Nick,"
"quickly pulling him to one side, whispered:"
"""Say, Rance, the Girl's cut up because she vouched for 'im. Don't rub it"
"in."""
"Notwithstanding, Rance, to the Girl's query of ""How did this Nina"
"Micheltoreña know it?"" took a keen delight in telling her:"
"""She's his girl."""
"""His girl?"" repeated the Girl, mechanically."
"""Yes. She gave us his picture,"" went on Rance; and taking the photograph"
"out of his pocket, he added maliciously, ""with love written on the back"
"of it."""
"A glance at the photograph, which she fairly snatched out of his hands,"
convinced the Girl of the truthfulness of his assertion. With a movement
"of pain she threw it upon the floor, crying out bitterly:"
"""Nina Micheltoreña! Nina Micheltoreña!"" Turning to Ashby with an abrupt"
"change of manner she said contritely: ""I'm sorry, Mr. Ashby, I vouched"
"for 'im."""
The Wells Fargo Agent softened at the note in the Girl's voice; he was

"“Now, Mrs. Moulton,” he said gently, “I’m afraid I must trouble you to"
go with me. I am going over to a pawnbroker’s on the Bowery.”
"“The Bowery?” she repeated, with a genuinely surprised shudder. “Oh,"
"no, Mr. Kennedy. Don’t ask me to go anywhere to-night. I am—I am in no"
condition to go anywhere—to do anything—I—”
"“But you must,” said Kennedy in a low voice."
“I can’t. Oh—have mercy on me. I am terribly upset. You—”
"“It is your duty to go, Mrs. Moulton,” he repeated."
“I don’t understand.” she murmured. “A pawnbroker’s?”
"“Come,” urged Kennedy, not harshly but firmly, then, as she held back,"
"added, playing a trump card, “We must work quickly. In his hands we"
found the fragments of a torn dress. When the police—”
"She uttered a shriek. A glance had told her, if she had deceived"
"herself before, that Kennedy knew her secret."
"Antoinette Moulton was standing before him, talking rapidly."
“Some one has told Lynn. I know it. There is nothing now that I can
conceal. If you had come half an hour later you would not have found

"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"
"at my feet!"""
"""You only went in for robbing, not murder, I suppose?"" asked the"
"Captain.  Petunikoff turned pale, and hastily changed the subject."
"""You are a bad host.  You sit while your guest stands."""
"""Let him sit, too,"" said Kuvalda."
"""But what am I to sit on?"""
"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
again.
"""I s'pose they had one o' them little lovers' quarrels an' that made 'er"
"tell you, eh?"" She laughed a forced little laugh, though her heart was"
"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"
"polkas with every girl he meets."" And at this she began to laugh almost"
hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.
"""What are you laughing at?"" he questioned."
"""Oh, nothin', Jack, nothin',"" half-cried, half-laughed the Girl. ""Only"
"it's kind o' funny how things come out, ain't it? Took in! Nina"
Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."

CHAPTER XVII
ERASMUS AT BASLE
1521-9
Basle his dwelling-place for nearly eight years:
1521-9--Political thought of Erasmus--Concord and
peace--Anti-war writings--Opinions concerning princes and
government--New editions of several Fathers--The
"_Colloquia_--Controversies with Stunica, Beda, etc.--Quarrel"
with Hutten--Eppendorff
It is only towards the evening of life that the picture of Erasmus
acquires the features with which it was to go down to posterity. Only at
Basle--delivered from the troublesome pressure of parties wanting to
"enlist him, transplanted from an environment of haters and opponents at"
"Louvain to a circle of friends, kindred spirits, helpers and admirers,"
"emancipated from the courts of princes, independent of the patronage of"
"“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s sake,” said Severance. “It is"
enough to have read them.”
"“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed Teddy, “if you could have been at the"
"yacht race! Such excitement, such—”"
"“To change the subject,” said Trent, with determination in his eye,"
"“Mrs. Pendleton, did you receive all the marked papers I sent you"
"containing my speeches, especially the one on Jesuitism in Politics?”"
"“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose"
own egotism was kicking against its bars. “You did not think my book too
"long, did you? One purblind critic said—”"
"“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said Severance, rising abruptly. “Good"
"evening,” and he bowed to Miss Decker and to the men. Jessica rose"
suddenly and went with him to the door.
"“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”"
"she said, as she gave him her hand. “This may be unconventional, but _I_"
choose to do it.”
He bowed over her hand. “Mrs. Pendleton will only have set one more
"fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”"
"As he left the room by one door, Jessica crossed the room and opened"
another.
"“Good night,” she said to the astounded company, and withdrew."

PROCEDURE
"Having settled upon a definite plan, the indexer seats himself at a"
"""When it gets dark I'm coming out to the _Arabella_ and stay all night."
Maybe they'll come back and I'll find out why. That fellow said
something 'bout Rockman's not being safe. They'll learn the _Arabella_
"isn't safe either!"""
"""But Lav, I'm coming with you!"""
"""You can't. And this isn't any work for a girl to get mixed up in."""
Sidney drew herself to her full height.
"""Lavender Green, if you think you're going to lose me _now_ you're"
mistaken. I guess we went into this in a sort of partnership and it's
going to hold. I found out just as much as you did! And if you come out
"to the _Arabella_, _I'm_ coming, and Mart, too, if she's home."""
Lav still hesitated.
"""Aunt Achsa won't let you. How'd you get away?"""
"This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she thought of a ""way."" This"
was Wednesday night and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night she
was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney might go with her. From
Truro Miss Letty was going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think
Sidney wanted to see Cap'n Davies again. She explained all this
"breathlessly to Lavender. ""This is important enough to warrant a fib."
And when it's all over Aunt Achsa will understand. Let's go home now
"and find Mart."""
Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney's right to share with him his
night's vigil at any cost. Again they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.
"""Proceed, count."""
"""Monsieur le Comte Hamilton begs me to say that he was called away from"
"London early to-day on the king's business, but that he will return"
in four weeks. When he returns he will do himself the honor to send
"me again, asking you to name a friend, unless you prefer to apologize,"
"which no gentleman would do in a case of this sort. You said, I am told,"
"that Monsieur le Comte lied. If you admit that he did not lie, of course"
"you admit that you did. So, im-pos-si-ble! There must be to fight!"""
"""Do you know, count, the cause of my having given Count Hamilton the"
"lie?"" I asked."
"""I did not inquire,"" he answered smilingly. ""To me it was to carry the"
"message."""
"""George Hamilton is your friend, is he not?"" I asked."
"""Yes, but far more, he is the friend of my king, and will make entreaty"
"with my monarch for my return to France,"" answered De Grammont."
"""It was because of Count Hamilton's insulting reference to his brother"
"that I used the ugly word,"" I returned."
"""A-ah, that is different!"" Then recovering himself quickly: ""But I"
undertook the mission. It is to finish. Monsieur George Hamilton? My
friend? My king's friend? If it had been known to me! But you have the
"message of 'Sieur le Comte."""
"After a short silence he said, ""When Monsieur le Comte Hamilton returns,"
"I shall ask him to relieve me of this duty."""
and looking-glasses from the French pirates to give to their faithful
Indian guides as parting gifts.
"TRYER, MATTHEW."
"A Carolina pirate, accused and acquitted on a charge of having captured a"
"sloop belonging to Samuel Salters, of Bermuda, in 1699."
"TUCKER, ROBERT."
Of the Island of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at"
"Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not"
"defended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still"
"deemed it ""a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward."" We"
understand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded
"themselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the"
"famous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the"
"Court of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and"
all but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.
"TUCKERMAN, CAPTAIN."
Sailed with Captain Porter in the West Indies. Captain Johnson gives an
account of the meeting between these two pirate novices and the great
Captain Roberts at Hispaniola.
"‘What does this mean, Pa?’ cried I."
"They gathered themselves up, shamelessly--laughed--ye gods, twittingly,"
"at _me_! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself into comfort in his"
"clothes, slapped me upon the back:"
"‘Horace, my son----’"
"‘Don’t be familiar, Sir Pompey,’ said I. ‘You are speaking to the heir"
to a baronetcy.’
The baronet laughed vulgarly:
"‘Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,’ he said--‘allow me to introduce to you"
"Horace, my son--at least, my reputed son.’"
"Bows, chassées, and greetings."
"‘Horace--the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and Master Oliver"
Doome----’
The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with mighty hand that
near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.
He dug me in the ribs:
"‘The rogue’s been married this seven years,’ cried he; ‘and now he’s"
"signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and you’re just in"
"the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs--only--look here,"
"Horace, you must, like Doome, sign a bond not to touch the business"
arrangements--you and he would wreck the counting-house in six
months....’
"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"
"Lon-don!"""
Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.
"""Oh, _Lav_,"" cried Sidney. She leaned far over the side of the boat."
"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."
"Mrs. Marchmont arrived, accompanied by an old man who evidently was her"
"sir?"""
Jones shook his head.
"""You interferin' galoot, it serves you right.  And as for that, the"
"'ole crew's under arrest, where I put 'em for mut'ny, and I don't see"
as I should so pick and choose among 'em as to use my hinfluence to
"'ave you let go.  At any rate, bide a bit, and I'll see."""
For it was obvious that the drinking was going to begin.  The French
"captain served the liquor out in a small glass to every one, and"
presently some of his melancholy disappeared.  He gave an order to
"one of his men who brought two more glasses, one for the English"
"captain, and one for himself."
"""I looks towards you,"" said Jones."
"""À votre santé,"" cried the Frenchman.  ""Monsieur, vous êtes un homme"
"de coeur quand mêne."""
"""I don't savvy, but I dessay you means well,"" said the captain."
"""Now, if I'd thought to bring along the signal book we might 'ave 'ad"
quite a talk.  But time enough; I dessay afore we're took off I shall
"patter your lingo like blazes.  Shall I cut my man loose there?"""
"He pointed to Hart, and though two of the Frenchmen, who had black"
"eyes, remonstrated against the deed of mercy, Hart was unlashed and"
given a drink.
"""Here's to you, old cocklywax,"" said Hart, with a scrape of his leg."
"""I bears no grudge, not me."""

"“Among the San Blas Indians, who are at a far higher level of"
"civilization, the exclusion of aliens is the result of well-founded"
political reasons. Their respected traditions are a long record of proud
independence; they have maintained the purity of their race and enjoyed
freely for hundreds of years every inch of their territory. They feel
that the day the negro or the white man acquires a foothold in their
"midst these privileges will become a thing of the past. This is why,"

REVENGE IN AN ALIEN WORLD
When Gail Loring chose Bill Drake to be her husband--in name only--for
"the duration of the flight to Mars, she didn't know that she had just"
signed his death warrant.
"Jealous Dr. Spartan, leader of the expedition, swore to get revenge and"
force Gail to share his maniacal plan for power.
"Bound together in space, five men and a woman strained against the"
powerful tug of twisted emotions and secret ambitions.
But all plans were forgotten when they landed on the Red Planet and
"encountered the Martians--half animal, half vegetable, with acid for"
blood and radar for sight.
"Thus died a monster of cruelty, who would, had he lived to-day, have been"
confined in an asylum for lunatics.
NEAL.
A fisherman of Cork.
"Mutinied in a French ship sailing from Cork to Nantes in 1721, and, under"
"the leadership of Philip Roche, murdered the captain and many of the crew"
and became a pirate.
"NEFF, WILLIAM."
"Born at Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1667."
"A soldier, one of the guard at Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine. Deserted in"
1689 and went to sea with the pirate Captain Pound.
"NELSON, CAPTAIN."
"Born on Prince Edward Island, where his father had a grant of land for"
"services rendered in the American war. He was a wealthy man, a member of"
the Council and a Colonel of the Militia. In order to set his son up in
"life he bought him a captaincy in the Militia and a fine farm, where young"
"Nelson married and settled down. Buying a schooner, he used to sail to"
Halifax with cargoes of potatoes and fruit. He seems to have liked these
"trips in which he combined business with pleasure, for we learn that on"
"these visits to Halifax he ""was very wild, and drank and intrigued with"
"the girls in an extravagant manner."" Getting into disgrace on Prince"
Of London.
One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy at
"Charleston on November 8th, 1718, and found ""not guilty."""
"NONDRE, PEDRO."
"Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. At the time of execution"
it was observed that he was covered with the marks of deep wounds. On the
"scaffold he wept bitterly. An immensely heavy man, he broke the rope, and"
had to be hanged a second time.
"NORMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"Served under Morgan in 1670, and after the fall of Chagres Fort, Norman"
"was left in charge with 500 men to hold it, while Morgan crossed the"
"isthmus to attack Panama. Norman soon ""sent forth to sea two boats to"
"exercise piracy."" These hoisted Spanish colours and met a big Spanish"
"merchant ship on the same day. They chased the ship, which fled for safety"
"into the Chagres River, only to be caught there by Norman. She proved a"
"valuable prize, being loaded with all kinds of provisions, of which the"
garrison was in sore need.
"NORTH, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL."
"Born in Bermuda, and by profession a lawyer, Captain North was a man of"
"remarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great"
"notoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written"
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""
"commented Sonora, still smarting under the Girl's reprimand."
"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"
"we've got him,"" said Rance, triumphantly. ""But the last seen of"
"Johnson,"" he went on with a hasty movement towards the Girl and eyeing"
"her critically, ""he was heading this way. You seen anything of him?"""
The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."
"""One o' our dollar Havanas! Good Lord, he's here!"" he muttered to"
himself.

"knowed each other standin' on the road to Monterey. I said that day,"
"he's good, he's gran' an' he can have me."""
"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""
At those clear words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide his
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my
"family--never!  It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!"""
Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"

CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.
"Asiatic countries. We are said to be the successors of the Tartars, at"
one time the disturbers of the world's peace. Nothing of the kind.
Russia would be more fittingly the successor of the Tartars. The Tartar
races have been merged in the Russian Empire.
"'I am sure,' added Baron Suyematsu, in a final word, 'that Europe will"
"soon find its fears about the ""spectre of Japan"" are all ill-founded."
"England, I am glad to believe, never had those fears, and before long I"
hope to see her colonies in the same frame of mind. I hope the
Commonwealth Parliament will lead the way.'

THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
"“Now, now,” said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs. “Chuck it,"
Blotte--you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker.... Lor!” he
"yawned, “this is precious slow.” He yawned again: “Paul Pangbutt’s a"
"confounded long time, ain’t he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!”"
"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily
"locks,” he cried--“no more grease-spots on dingy grey tablecloths that"
hide their offences under smiling napkins!... To-night I shall be
waited upon by the gods.... Never again the boiled potato; never again
"the homely bun, damn them!... This is the night of life--a night for"
"music and gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain----”"
"Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:"
"“Stop it, Blotte. Aren’t you well, old man?”"
Blotte laughed:
“Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives to-night. And I
go off--to sup with the gods.... The world has forgotten Andrew Blotte.”
"Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:"
"“I say, boys,” said he--“as it’s to be a unique night, and Blotte"
"about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the morning----”"
"Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:"
"“Oh, yes,” he growled--“I shall be in the papers to-morrow. Have no"
fear of it.”
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
the better for it.

of coming to India on better terms. It was a mystery to him. He thought
it was either sheer ignorance or the spread of the commercial spirit.
"83,673. All the students coming to his side of the University, were, as"
"a rule, keen and anxious to learn; he could not wish for better"
students.
"83,674. (Mr. Gupta). He desired one service, because he thought it was"
"most degrading that certain men, although they were doing the same work,"
"should be classed in a Provincial Service, while others should be"
classed in an Imperial Service. The prospect of the members of the
"Provincial Service were not at all what they ought to be, and that was"
the reason why the best men were not attracted to it.
PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.
"confidence, all these fellows take themselves too seriously to-day."
Look at Rippley! he’s utterly uncultured--he hasn’t an aitch in his
composition.”
Gomme nodded:
"“But there isn’t an aitch in composition,” he said demurely."
"“N-no.” Fosse stammered, becoming nervous. “But he can’t even pronounce"
the names of the ancients whose gods he models!”
Gomme smiled:
“No--but he can model ’em.”
Fosse was puzzled for an answer:

"ANTIRHEUMATIC.--A medicine that prevents or cures rheumatism, as Sodium"
"Salicylates, etc."
"ANTIPYRETIC.--A medicine which reduces body temperature in fever, as"
"Quinine Sulphate, Salicylic Acid, etc."
"ANTISEPTIC.--A medicine which arrests putrefaction on or in the body, or"
hinders septic decomposition by killing the germs that produce it or by
"checking their development, as Carbolic Acid, Zinc Sulphocarbolates,"
etc.
ANTISPASMODIC.--A medicine which prevents or removes spasmodic
"contraction of voluntary or involuntary muscles, as Belladonna,"
"Valerian, Chloral Hydrate, etc."

of the kind which give sound and helpful advice in a bright and
interesting manner. Of course there is a splendid young man who also

"suggested for Joy Kent with profit and pleasure, and, perhaps, with"

The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
"""They was here first,"" said Lampert obstinately."
"""But the hisland is British ground,"" urged Simcox, ""and where our"
flag flies no Frenchman can have the best.  We gives 'em liberty to
"trade, and they can take what's left.  What for have we always beat"
"'em if we're to give in now?"""
"""Continuosity of foreign politics is my motter,"" said the skipper."
"""With continuosity and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'"
"this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and evacuate.  I shall send"
"hin my hultimatum this very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be"
"hambassador."""
Simcox looked anxious.
"""Well, captain, I was thinking it would be judicious policy to send"
in the Dutchman.  It will remind them that Europe is more or less
"agin them, and to have a Dutchman here will make 'em think twice"
"afore they elects for war."""
The skipper shook his head.
"""No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the surface, but takin' deeper"
"thought it ain't.  It would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy."
"We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin' anythin' unpleasin'"
more'n askin' for our rights.  And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to
remind 'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat 'em.  And
moreover it's accordin' to no tradition I've heard of to send a
"furriner as hambassador.  No, Simcox, you shall go.  I'll draw up the"
"hultimatum at once."""
"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS."
Sailed with Colonel Edward Morgan to attack St. Eustatius and Saba
THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the
west.
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"""Butt's trying to decide whether he wants him fried or scrambled,"" the"
"Computer's Mate said, pulling her back. ""Hey, purse, remember when the"
whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue
"with Colonel Leclerc?"""
"""Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,"" the purser answered mechanically."
"""And no more army stationed south of Icebox."" His right ear twitched"
"irritably. ""But what're they saying?"""
"Suddenly we heard. ""By authority vested in me under the Pomona College"
"Treaty,"" the Captain was saying very loudly, ""I arrest you for"
violation of Articles Sixteen to Twenty-one inclusive of the Space
"Transport Code, and order your person and belongings impounded for"
the duration of this voyage as set forth in Sections Forty-one and
"Forty-five--"""
"""Forty-three and Forty-five,"" Sis groaned. ""Sections Forty-three and"
"Forty-five, I told him. I even made him repeat it after me!"""

"Directives."""
*       *       *       *       *
We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"
flesh.
Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"
"the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a funny, thoughtful look"
"know--"""
"""Daphne Wing?"""
"""Yes.  A child is coming.  They have made her tell.  It means the"
"cancelling of her engagements, of course--and other things."""
Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
"""Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.--Wagge can do?"""
Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""He is rabid--a rabid man of his class is dangerous.  A lot of money will"
"be wanted, I should think--some blood, perhaps."""
"He moved swiftly to her, and said very low:"
"""Gyp, it is a year since I told you of this.  You did not believe me"
"then.  I told you, too, that I loved you.  I love you more, now, a"
"hundred times!  Don't move!  I am going up to Gustav."""
"He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came"
back past the line of the window.  The expression of his face was quite
"changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him.  And that"
"must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to"
"kiss her lips; she wrenched back, and he could only reach her throat, but"
"that he kissed furiously.  Letting her go as suddenly, he bent his head"
and went out without a look.
"Gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand,"
"dumbly, mechanically thinking: ""What have I done to be treated like this?"
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"
Sam Doolittle start for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
"a blow for Sam didn't waste steps. ""'Tisn't likely Letty Vine'll _go_"
"to Truro tonight."""
"""But I'll _see_ if she's going, anyway,"" Sidney had cried and had raced"
"off, a sweater over her arm."
"""I wish I could tell her how very important it is and then she'd"
"understand, but I can't for maybe she wouldn't understand,"" Sidney"
thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
"would go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit"
large sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had
"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"
girls.
For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"
"built himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from"
"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.
"TOMKINS, JOHN."
Of Gloucestershire.
Hanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's
crew.
"TOPPING, DENNIS."
"He shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company"
with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"
"Sawney."""
"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"
their ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of
Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."
"SCOT, ROGER."
"occasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab"
"village, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,"
"as, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by"
"a treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this"
"cold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:"
thus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable
"man, who had always been the natives' best friend."
"NORTON, GEORGE."
"One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the"
Star Tavern at Boston.
"NUTT, JOHN."
One of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the
_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.
OCHALI. Barbary renegade.
In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.
"ODELL, SAMUEL."
"""Solem has gone now,"" Josephine replied."
"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.
Why should I listen to him still pleading with her?
"""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow."""
"Gunner on board ""Blackbeard's"" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on"
"November 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant"
Maynard.
"MULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet"
played havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New
England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"

Tennyson and read aloud the idyll of Lancelot and Elaine. And the
"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.
*       *       *       *       *
"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"
"theological works dear to the hearts of his sect. I gave him the box,"
telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.
George translated it thus:--

"""DE CATANET."""

"SWAN, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."
"SWITZER, JOSEPH."
Of Boston in New England.

"addressing him without any pretensions, as if he were his own brother,"
"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"
"being only a soldier.  Looking at him, he grew fonder and fonder of"
"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred
"roubles and signed the paper, he threw the pen down on the table and"
"said, bitterly:"
"""Now I will have a nice time!  They will laugh at me, they will cry"
"shame on me, the devils!"""
King Merriwig of Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls.  He
"lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him, selected a"
trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.
"""Ah,"" said the King, ""here you are, my dear.""  He searched for his"
"napkin, but the Princess had already kissed him lightly on the top of"
"the head, and was sitting in her place opposite to him."
"""Good morning, Father,"" she said; ""I'm a little late, aren't I?  I've"
"been riding in the forest."""
"""Any adventures?"" asked the King casually."
"""Nothing, except it's a beautiful morning."""
"""Ah, well, perhaps the country isn't what it was.  Now when I was a"
"young man, you simply couldn't go into the forest without an adventure"
"of some sort.  The extraordinary things one encountered!  Witches,"
"giants, dwarfs----.  It was there that I first met your mother,"" he"
added thoughtfully.
"""I wish I remembered my mother,"" said Hyacinth."
The King coughed and looked at her a little nervously.
"""Seventeen years ago she died, Hyacinth, when you were only six months"
old.  I have been wondering lately whether I haven't been a little
"remiss in leaving you motherless so long."""

"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.
Greek Hymns in the Hymnary
“But if it will kill you?”
"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”
"""What is your name, Girl--your real name?"""
"""Min--Minnie; my father's name was Smith,"" she told him, her eyes cast"
down under delicately tremulous lids.
"""Oh, Minnie Sm--"""
"""But 'twa'n't his right name,"" quickly corrected the Girl, and"
"unconsciously both rose to their feet. ""His right name was Falconer."""
"""Minnie Falconer--well, that is a pretty name,"" commented Johnson; and"
raising her hand to his lips he pressed them against it.
"""I ain't sure that's what he said it was--I ain't sure o' anythin' only"
"jest you,"" she said coyly, burying her face in his neck."
"""You may well be sure of me since I've loved--"" Johnson's sentence was"
"cut short, a wave of remorse sweeping over him. ""Turn your head away,"
"Girl, and don't listen to me,"" he went on, gently putting her away from"
"him. ""I'm not worthy of you. Don't listen but just say no, no, no, no."""
"The Girl, puzzled, was even more so when Johnson began to pace the"
floor.
"""Oh, I know--I ain't good enough for you !"" she cried with a little"
"tremour in her voice. ""But I'll try hard, hard . . . If you see"
"anythin' better in me, why don't you bring it out, 'cause I've loved you"
"ever since I saw you first, 'cause I knowed that you--that you were the"
"right man."""
"""The right man,"" repeated Johnson, dismally, for his conscience was"
"fine--it made me ashamed of my silly standards, my fears."""
"""And Lavender is best of all--"""
Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.
"""I'm cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted something different but I"
didn't want all _this_ to happen! You see I _made_ Lavender and Mart
believe it was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was probably
"only a case of rum--"""
"Suddenly Trude straightened. ""I almost forgot. A boy came here and said"
a Captain Davies wanted you to come down to Rockman's wharf as soon as
you could. That was two hours ago. You see it is nearly noon now. You'd
"better dress quickly and I'll go out and fix you some breakfast."""
Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's
support for Sunset Lane was thronged with curious men and women; as
"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?"
Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”
"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell"
over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his
youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was
"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not"
for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone
rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of
"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"
I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”
"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."
Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"
"eye to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed his horses to"
his ancient cab and had them ready for an emergency.
After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.
"""Now give me some inkling of what started this crazy adventure. Thank"
God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still
"fighting for his life! Answer me, Sidney."""
But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"
"when she spoke, came with a childish tremor."
"""Oh, Lavender _can't_ die. If he does--it will be all my fault! I"
"started everything. I--I told him about the diamonds--"""
"""_Diamonds_--"""
"“What very stupid and false ideas,” exclaimed Laura. “Really I"
appreciate having a brother who talks in such a vulgar way.”
“You are an aristocrat and the truth doesn’t please you. But such are
the facts. I can see the chief of the bureau of Papal titles. What fun
he must have thinking up the most appropriate title for a magnate of
Yankee tinned beef or for an illustrious Andean general! How magnificent
it would be to gather all the Bishops _in partibus infidelium_ and all
the people with Papal titles in one drawing-room! The Bishop of Nicaea
discussing with the Marquis of the Holy Roman Empire; the Marchioness of
"Easter Sunday flirting with the Bishop of Sion, while the Patriarchs"
"of Thebes, Damascus, and Trebizond played bridge with the sausage"
"manufacturer, Mr. Smiles, the pork king, or with the illustrious General"
"Pérez, the hero of Guachinanguito. What a moving spectacle it would be!”"
“You are a clown!” said Laura.
"“He is a finished satirist,” added Kennedy."
_CÆSAR’S PLAN_
"After lunch, Laura, Kennedy, and Cæsar went into the salon, and Laura"
introduced the Englishman to the San Martino girls and the Countess
"Brenda. They stayed there chatting until four o’clock, at which time the"
"San Martinos got ready to go out in a motor car, and Laura, with the"
"Countess and her daughter, in a carriage."
Cæsar and Kennedy went into the street together.
"“You are awfully well fixed here,” said Kennedy, “with no Americans, no"

"Type sizes in the present day are determined by the point system, the"
fundamental unit of which is the point. This is obtained by dividing
"a length of 13⅘ inches into 996 equal parts, each one being called a"
point. One point is therefore .0138 of an inch or 72.46 points are
equal to 1 inch.
"For purposes of convenience, a point is expressed as being 1/72 of an"
"inch. Thus 6-point type occupies 6/72 of an inch of space, 12-point"
"12/72 and so on. This does not mean, however, that the actual printed"
"face occupies six points on the paper, but that it is six points from"
the base to the top of the body carrying the face.
"In other words, one may say that it is 12 points from the bottom of"
one line of 12-point type to the _bottom_ of the next line of 12-point
"type, etc."
"The pica is the standard of measurement of the old system, and is equal"
Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.
CHAPTER XXI
"""WHAT THE NIGHT HELD"""
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.
"TYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN."
A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some
"time he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the"
Indian Ocean.
Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"
"David Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months"
before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"
"ship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the"
Welsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the
"_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on"
"the Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and"
"her cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns."
"Alves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor"
"of Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but"
by way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a
Scotch one and not a Portuguese.
"PHILLIPS, CAPTAIN."
"In 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the"
Banks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by
"Phillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John"
"Fillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,"
"Edward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and"
"the two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was"
taken to Boston.
"PHILIPS, JAMES."
Of the Island of Antigua.
"Formerly of the _Revenge_, and afterwards in the _Royal Fortune_ (Captain"
Roberts). When the _Royal Fortune_ surrendered in 1722 to H.M.S.
"_Swallow_, Philips seized a lighted match and attempted to blow up the"
"ship, swearing he would ""send them all to Hell together,"" but was"
"prevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35."
to Test Pilot Fayburn. A space egg had smashed through the cockpit
Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"
a madman. What had brought about the change? Was he still human or was
he now OUT OF THIS WORLD?
Only time would tell as he daringly laid siege to an important air base
and began using his frightening power to force men and women to serve
his evil purpose.

Each one was the exact replica of the other--from the tips of his
fingers down to the beating of his twin hearts.
"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's

"instant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables"
and sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship
"commenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was"
still aboard her.
"In the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,"
"but nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and"
landing and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by
a Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight
"Rackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal."
"On November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,"
convicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed
"as men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate"
"fashion, to Rackam."
"On the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,"
"to visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was ""that she was"
"sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have"
"been hanged like a Dog."""
"Rackam was hanged on November 17th, 1720, at Gallows Point, at Port Royal,"
Jamaica.

"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”

"because his conscience troubled him, and though with difficulty, he got"
"up and left. Kennedy, Cæsar, and the two Spaniards went toward the"
"Piazza, del Campidoglio, and Buonacossi marched off in the opposite"
direction.
"On reaching the Via Nazionale, Kennedy took his leave and Cæsar"
"remained with the two Spaniards. The red, fleshy one, who had the air of"
"a bully, started in to make fun of the Italians, and to mimic their bows"
and salutes; then he said that he had an engagement with a woman and
made haste to take his leave.
"When he had gone, the grave Spaniard with the sour face, said to Cæsar:"
“That chap is like the dandies here; that’s why he imitates them so
well.”
Afterwards Cortés talked about his studies in painting; he didn’t get
"on well, he had no money, and anyway Rome didn’t please him at all."
"Everything seemed wrong to him, absurd, ridiculous."
"Cæsar, after he had said good-bye to him, murmured: “The truth is that"

he speaks with La Giralda in a tongue which neither I nor Don Rollo
"understand."""
"""But I thought,"" said El Sarria, astonished for the first time, ""that"
both you and Don Rollo understood the crabbed gipsy tongue! Have I not
"heard you speak it together?"""
"""As it is commonly spoken--yes,"" she replied, ""we have talked many a"
time for sport. But this which is spoken by the Sergeant and La Giralda
"is deep Romany, the like of which not half a dozen in Spain understand."
"It is the old-world speech of the Rom, before it became contaminated by"
"the jargon of fairs and the slang of the travelling horse-clipper."""
"""Then,"" said El Sarria, slowly, ""it comes to this--'tis you and not I"
"who mistrust these two?"""
"""No, that I do not,"" cried Concha, emphatically; ""I have tried La"
"Giralda for many years and at all times found her faithful, so that her"

"But the Sergeant is a strong man and a secret man----"""
"""Well worth the watching, then?"" said El Sarria, looking her full in the"
face.
Concha nodded.
"""Carlist or no, he works for his own hand,"" she said simply."
"""Shall ye mention the matter to Don Rollo?"" asked El Sarria."
"""Nay--what good?"" said Concha, quickly; ""Don Rollo is brave as a bull of"
"Jaen, but as rash. You and I will keep our eyes open and say nothing."
"""Waynsford, by Jove!"" ejaculated Terence. ""Bless you, Dick, I never"
"expected to see you here and in this rig. What has happened?"""
"""Oh, I chucked the Motor Boat Reserve,"" declared Waynsford. ""It was a"
"bit too dull. They sent me to Southampton, and that was the limit. A"
"superannuated postman could have done my job, which was delivering"
letters to transports. So I applied for the Naval Air Service. It's
"more in my line."""
"""Been across yet?"" asked Terence, indicating the twenty odd mile"
strip of water that separated Great Britain from the scene of land
hostilities.
"""Dunkirk twice,"" replied Waynsford. ""Was there when the Germans"
started shelling the place. But we're off again early to-morrow
"morning."""
"""Yes, I heard,"" said Aubyn. ""Big operations. We are to engage the"
Zeebrugge and Ostend batteries while the Allied airmen play with the
"German lines of communication. So I may see something of you."""
"""I hope so--after the fun is over,"" replied the young airman. ""Well,"
I must be moving. Early hours and a good night's rest are essential
"to this sort of work."""
"The two friends parted, Terence making for the hotel, while Waynsford"
"walked off in the direction of the castle, in which the airmen"
detailed for the great raid were temporarily quartered.
Precisely at one hour before sunrise the first British waterplane
rose from the surface of Dover Harbour. Almost simultaneously an Army
"aeroplane ""kicked off"" from the sloping ground beyond the chalk"

Vivie then went on to read with eyes that could hardly take in the
words a list of other names of men and women condemned to long terms
of hard labour for the same offence--assisting young Belgians to
"leave the Belgium that was under German occupation. And further,"
"the information that of the five condemned to death, _Philip Bauck_"
and _Edith Cavell_ had already been _executed_.
*       *       *       *       *
The monsters! Oh that von Bissing. How gladly she would die if she
might first have the pleasure of killing him! That pompous old man
"of seventy-one with the blotched face, who had issued orders that"
wherever he passed in his magnificent motor he was to be saluted
"with Eastern servility, who boasted of his ""tender heart,"" so that"
he issued placards about this time punishing severely all who split
the tongues of finches to make them sing better. Edith Cavell--she
did not pause to consider the fate of patriotic Belgian women--but
"Edith Cavell, directress of a nursing home in Brussels, known far"
"and wide for her goodness of heart. She had held aloof from Vivie,"
but was that to be wondered at when there was so much to make her
"suspect--living, seemingly, under the protection of a German"
"""It ain't,"" said the crew suspiciously."
"""And even if it's all right, we bein' strangers might be led into"
makin' a treaty without knowin' all there is to know.  I vote waitin'
"till the officers comes up."""
They squatted down on rocks and on the lumps of tussac grass till the
captain and the two mates came along with the rest of the Frenchmen.
"Hart communicated his suspicions to the skipper, who was decidedly"
under the influence of alcohol.
"""That's all right,"" said the Guffin thickly.  ""_We_ can manage"
Frenchmen.  They ain't goin' to make no French Shore question on no
more of our islands.  One Newfoundland's enough for me.  I'll show
"you n'gotiations--'gotiashuns is my forte!""  And he led the way over"
the hill.  Below them they saw the wreck of a French barquantine.
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, with a frown, ""if they 'aven't got the best"
"part of our hisland!"""
"It was not to be endured by any lot of Englishmen under the sun, that"
"the best part of this rock should be occupied by their natural foes,"
and soon there was evidence that in any attempt to turn the Frenchmen
out the British leader would have a united nation at his back.
"The Guffin and the two mates argued it, and Lampert was the"
Opposition.
"""W'y, wot's this you're sayin'?"" asked the disgusted skipper; ""did I"
think to 'ave shipped a Verning 'Arcourt among my lot?  You're a
"Little Englander, and nothin' but it, Lampert."""
"The Frenchmen ""jabbered"" a bit among themselves."
"""Quoi donc?  Marcher?"" asked their skipper."
"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"
quit.  We gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do you
"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.
"""Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"" he bellowed.  ""What's"
their captain say to the _statues quo_?  Don't they know the first
thing about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare for peace we makes
"war."""
"""War it is,"" said Hart, and he launched himself at a crowd of"
"Frenchmen, as his mates came tumbling down the hill."
"The fight was short, sharp, and pretty decisive, for the _Potluck's_"
"crowd numbered ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two boys, or"
"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?

"listened to Sonora, who shouted through the door: ""Say, Girl, you all"

that she was safe did she turn to the man at her side and whisper in a
voice that showed plainly her agitation and fear:

tracked him!

Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America

launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast
roomful of newspapermen--the Senator invented a race of creatures called
"androids. These androids, it seems, look exactly like Tom Smith down the"
block except that they'd just as soon cut your throat as not.
We fear the Senator must have been watching the wrong television
"shows--knives yet, ugh!--possibly _Jim Bowie_, because there wasn't a"
ray gun nor a disintegrator in his whole bag of exhibits.
"All in all, it would appear that the project was pointed toward making"
the people Senator Crane-conscious rather than aiming their attention at
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""

"""I'm not a dryleg,"" I told him proudly. ""_We're_ from Undersea."""
"""_Dryhorn_, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?"""
"""Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just"
"like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns."" And then I told him"
"how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when"
the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers
figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.

He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were
bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just
about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.
He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the
first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I
told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood
listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked
"disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World"

soon re-emerged. It grew smaller and smaller. Our eyes lost it for a

remained save the whitish blurs in the blue sky and a hardly audible
booming in the far distance.

commissions were to attack only Spanish and French ships. The two

A native of Massachusetts Colony.
"In 1703 was one of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_, eighty tons,"
"owned by some leading citizens of Boston, and fitted out to go"
privateering off the coasts of Arcadia and Newfoundland. On leaving
"Marblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected"
"Quelch their commander. They sailed to the south, and shortly afterwards"
"threw the captain overboard. They hoisted a flag, the ""Old Roger,"""
"described as having ""in the middle of it an Anatomy with an Hourglars in"
"Encouraged by these assurances, one of the newcomers said to the other:"
"""Come on, let's sit down here and have a coffee--we needn't stop long."""
"All the smaller tables were occupied, but there was one long table that"
stretched across the room and only a few men were sitting at the far end
of it. The officers sat down at the near end and ordered coffee. They
"seemed a little embarrassed at first, but they soon began to talk freely"
to each other:

The civilians of the village had received orders to leave immediately.
Through the window we could see groups of people standing in the street
without Martyanoff because he could not play honestly. After cheating
"several times, he openly confessed:"
"""I cannot play without cheating ... it is a habit of mine."""
"""Habits do get the better of you,"" assented Deacon Taras.  ""I always"
"used to beat my wife every Sunday after Mass, and when she died I"
cannot describe how extremely dull I felt every Sunday.  I lived
"through one Sunday--it was dreadful, the second I still controlled"
"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the
"fourth Sunday, I beat her just as if she were my own wife!  After that"
"I gave her ten roubles, and beat her according to my own rules till I"
"married again!"" ..."

"""Ay, just so...  She looked after my house...."""
"""Did you have any children?"" asked the teacher."
"""Five of them....  One was drowned ... the oldest ... he was an amusing"

"in Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught"
"by the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed."
Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and
"painstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he"
"writes: ""My ingenious friend Ringrose had no mind to this voyage, but was"
"necessitated to engage in it or starve."""

almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
"""I don't know, dearie. He used to take to spells like that when he was"
little. But lately he's got over them. I followed him once and I found
him out in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin' awful--out loud
and beatin' his arms. I let him be. I stole home and I never let on I
knew. When he came back all white lookin' I had a nice cake ready--roll
"jell, his favorite."""
"""Do--do you think he was out in the sand dunes--last night?"""
"""I don't know. He come in about nine o'clock, awful quiet and I didn't"
"ask him anything, but I just set his breakfast before him as though the"
morning wa'n't half over. And then he went off again and I ain't seen
"him sense. I thought mebbe it was these folks of Mr. Dugald's--"""
"""What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?"" But Sidney knew what she meant."
"""Like as not Lav's plain jealous. Mr. Dugald hasn't had any time for"
anything but toting this Pola round everywhere and Lav notices it. He
hasn't any right to be jealous as I can see for Miss Pola is Mr.
"Dugald's own cousin, but Lav thinks the sun rises and sets in Mr."
"Dugald. And like as not he misses you--"""
"""I've missed Lav dreadfully. I didn't know how much I missed him and"
Mart until today when it came over me suddenly that the things I was
doing with Pola weren't really much fun--just at first they were
"because they were different. I'm afraid, Aunt Achsa, that I love"
different things! But tomorrow I am going to play all day long with Lav
"and Mart, see if I don't. I can't wait for tomorrow to come!"""
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.
"""Why, that's from Laura Craig--a cousin of mine. I remember now she"
said she was going to study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the
"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"
jade-handled cane has joined the ancestors.

"She went on to explain, whilst the doctors occupied themselves with"
"their gruesome task, and Vivie was being persuaded to take some"
"nourishment, that her great grandfather had been a soldier servant"
who had married a Belgian woman and settled down on the site of this
very shop a hundred years ago. He and his wife had even then
"made a specialty of tea for English tourists. She, his great"

7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.
"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"
"one against the other!  Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides--besides,"
were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"
music-lessons.  Music-lessons!  Nearly three o'clock.  If he went for

"An attention.  It might please her.  Better, anyway, than waiting here"
until she chose to come in with her face all closed up.  He drank a
little more brandy--ever so little--took his hat and went.  Not far to
"walk, but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy."
A maid-servant opened the door to him.
"""I am Mr. Fiorsen.  Mrs. Fiorsen here?"""
"""Yes, sir; will you wait?"""
Why did she look at him like that?  Ugly girl!  How hateful ugly people
"were!  When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and"
listened.

"about great trouble afterwards between the French and English Governments,"
because he had stolen the ship on the high seas. He was sent from Jamaica

“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
"College libraries go under the name of the college: e.g., _Harvard"
"College, University Library_. But the Bodleian Library may be put"
under _Bodleian_.
Local college societies go under the name of the college;
intercollegiate societies and Greek letter fraternities under
"their own names: e.g., Φ B K _A, of Harvard_."
Alumni and Alumnæ associations go under the name of the school or
"college: e.g., _Harvard Alumni Association of New York_."
Schools supported by public taxation go under the name of the city
"or town maintaining them, whether they have an individual name or"
not.
When a corporation is much less known by the first words of its
"name than by a later part, enter under the later part: e.g.,"
"_Christian Endeavor, Young People's Society of_."
"Enter guilds under the name of the trade: e.g., _Stationers"
"Company_, not _Master and Keepers or Wardens and Commonality of"
"the Mystery and Art of Stationers of the City of London_, which"
is the corporate title.
"Enter bodies whose legal name begins with such words as _Board_,"
"_Corporation_, _Trustees_ under that part of the name by"
"which they are usually known: e.g., Trustees of the _Eastern"
Dispensary_; President and Fellows of _Harvard College_;
Proprietors of the _Boston Athenæum_; Contributors to the
_Asylum for the Relief of Persons Deprived of their Reason_.

and those of the German patriotic historians the Hansa is seen in a
rather delusive abstract. The useful monograph of Miss Zimmern (_The
Hansa Towns_: Story of the Nations Series) gives a good idea of the
"reality. See in particular pp. 82-147. It should be noted, however, that"
Lübeck is credited with being the first northern town to adopt the
"Oriental usage of water-pipes (Macpherson, _Annals of Commerce_, 1802,"

Chapter IV
HOLLAND
NOTE ON LITERATURE
The special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led
in past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was
given to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low
"Countries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,"
"folio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;"
"in Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of"
the kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon
the United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers
further foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions
of the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century
many English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An
English translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously
"known as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,"
"immediately recognized Colonel-General of Aviation Anatoly Savitsky,"
whose humorless face appeared almost weekly in Soviet Military Review;
"Major- General Igor Mikhailov, whose picture routinely graced the pages"
"of Air Defense Herald; and also Colonel-General Pavel Ogarkov, a"
marshal of the Soviet air force before that rank was abolished by the
general secretary.
What are those Air Force neanderthals doing here? They're all notorious
"hardliners, the ""bomb first, ask questions later"" boys. And _Daedalus_"
"is supposed to be for space research, right? Guess the bullshit is"
about to be over. We're finally getting down to the real scenario.
"And there in the middle, clearly the man in charge, was a tall, silver-"
haired Japanese in a charcoal silk suit. He was showing off the
"vehicles as though he owned them, and he carried himself with an"
authority that made all the hovering Soviet generals look like bellboys
waiting for a tip.
"Well, Yuri Andreevich thought, for the time being he does own them."
"They're bought and paid for, just like us."
"""_Tovarisch_, Major Androv, _kak pazhavatye_,"" came a voice behind him."
"He turned and realized it belonged to General Valentin Sokolov,"
commander of the MiG 31 wing at the Dolinsk air base on Sakhalin.
"Sokolov was three star, top man in all the Soviet Far East. Flanking"
him were half a dozen colonels and lieutenant colonels.
"""Comrade General Sokolov."" He whipped off a quick salute. Brass. Brass"
everywhere. Shit. What in hell was this all about?
"Now the project director, Taro Ikeda, had broken away from the Soviet"
"group and was approaching. ""Yuri Andreevich, thank you for coming."" He"
"Defoe is uncertain, though the character of Robinson Crusoe was certainly"
"founded on his adventures in Juan Fernandez. In 1712 he returned to Largo,"
"living the life of a recluse, and we must be forgiven for suspecting that"
"he rather acted up to the part, since it is recorded that he made a cave"
in his father's garden in which to meditate. This life of meditation in an
artificial cave was soon rudely interrupted by the appearance of a certain
"Miss Sophia Bonce, with whom Selkirk fell violently in love, and they"
"eloped together to Bristol, which must have proved indeed a sad scandal to"
the elders and other godly citizens of Largo. Beyond the fact that he was
"charged at Bristol with assaulting one Richard Nettle, a shipwright, we"
"hear no more of Selkirk until his first will was drawn up in 1717, in"
"which he leaves his fortune and house to ""my loving friend Sophia Bonce,"
"of the Pall Mall, London, Spinster."" Shortly after this, Alexander basely"
"deserted his loving friend and married a widow, one Mrs. Francis Candis,"
at Oarston in Devon.
"In 1720 he was appointed mate to H.M.S. _Weymouth_, on board of which he"
died a year later at the age of 45.
"Selkirk is immortalized in literature, not only by Defoe, but by Cowper in"
"his ""Lines on Solitude,"" beginning: ""I am monarch of all I survey."""
"SHARP, ROWLAND."
Of Bath Town in North Carolina.
One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried for piracy at Charleston in 1718
"and found ""not guilty."""
"SHASTER, ROGER."
"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though"
"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water"
can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little
red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old
"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched"
"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,"
"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward"
to take the pin out of his tie.
"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very"
pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear
"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,"
"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the"
"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,"
"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”"
"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he"
"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard"
"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and"
spectacle case.
"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...."
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were"
"like a spider’s—thin, withered."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”"
"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why"

CHAPTER XXIII.
AN ORATOR'S RIVAL.
"The House was crowded, and every gallery full. Lady Eynesford and"
"Eleanor Scaife, attended by Captain Heseltine, occupied their appointed"
seats; the members of the Legislative Council overflowed from their
proper pen and mingled with humbler folk in the public galleries;
"reporters wrote furiously, and an endless line of boys bearing their"
slips came and went. The great hour had arrived: the battle-field was
reached at last. Sir Robert Perry sat and smiled; Puttock played with
the hair chain that wandered across his broad waistcoat; Coxon
"restlessly bit his nails; Norburn's face was pale with excitement, and"
he twisted his hands in his lap; the determined partisans cheered or
groaned; the waverers looked important and felt unhappy; all eyes were
"steadily fixed on the Premier, and all ears intent on his words."
For the moment he had forgotten everything but the fight he was
"fighting. No thought of the wretched Benham, who lay dead, no thought of"
"his daughter, who watched him as he spoke, no thought of Alicia"
"Derosne, who stayed away that she might not see him, crossed his brain"
"reversed, and then ended. This was the last answer of the plants."
Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was one. There was no
"difference of any kind between sunshine plants, and those which had"
hitherto been regarded as insensitive or ordinary. It had also been
shown that all the varied and complex responses of the animal were
foreshadowed in the plant. An impressive spectacle was thus revealed of
"that vast unity in which all living organisms, from the simplest plant"
"to the highest animal, were linked together and made one."
"--_Amrita Bazar Patrika_, 5-3-1913."
EVIDENCE BEFORE THE PUBLIC SERVICES COMMISSION
"The following is the evidence given by Dr. J. C. Bose, C. S. I., C. I."
"E., Professor of Physics, Presidency College, Calcutta, on the 18th"
"December, 1913, before the Royal Commission on the Public Services in"
"India, presided over by Lord Islington, and published, in the Minutes of"
"Evidence relating to the Education Department, at pages 135 to 137, in"
"volume XX, Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners:"
WRITTEN STATEMENT RELATING TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
"83, 627 (I) _Method of recruitment._--The first question on which I have"
been asked to give my opinion is as regards the method of recruitment. I
think that a high standard of scholarship should be the only
"qualification insisted on. Graduates of well-known Universities,"
"Dagoes, and Dutchmen and Calashees, I'd 'ave showed you and Salisbury"
"'ow to 'andle mixed sweets.  Vig'lance, difficulties, bright"
"look-out, and the rule o' the road.  And look at the chart!  That's"
"me!"""
"And very shortly afterwards the triple conversation ceased, for the"
captain lay snoring in his cabin.
"The _Potluck_ was a barque of eleven hundred tons' register, and was"
"bound for Adelaide, with a general cargo of all mixed things under"
heaven and on earth.  Now she was engaged in running down her
"easting, and, as her skipper believed, was somewhere about Lat. 44°"
"30' S., Long. 50° E., and not far off the Crozets.  The westerly"
"winds were blowing hard, but had the worst chill of winter off, for"
"the month was September.  Nevertheless, as old Jones, the skipper,"
"was on a composite track, with a maximum latitude of 45° S., and was"
bound farther south still it might have been to the advantage of all
"concerned if he had drunk less, talked little, and minded his own"
business instead of arguing foreign politics.
But to each man Fate often gives his chance of proving what he boasts
to be his particular skill in the universe.
"When Lampert relieved Simcox at midnight, the weather was thick, and"
"neither man's temper was of the sweetest, so they had a bit of a"
breeze.
"""What kind of a relief d'ye call this?' growled Simcox."
"""I call it a very good relief,"" replied Lampert, ""and a darned sight"
"better one than you deserve.  You owe me ten minutes even now."""
he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front
"of the car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw"
the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind
"a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away."
"Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile."
He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale
about having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach
"lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a more"
interesting sight than this?
"“My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,” he said kindly,"
so that they would not be too greatly mortified. “I have letters here
that will show—”
"“You’ll come with us, please,” announced the plainclothes man. “‘Pinky’"
McGuire’s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A
detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and ’phoned down
to take you in. Do your explaining at the station-house.”
James Williams’s wife—his bride of two weeks—looked him in the face
"with a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks,"
looked him in the face and said:
"“Go with ’em quietly, ‘Pinky,’ and maybe it’ll be in your favour.”"
And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw
a kiss—his wife threw a kiss—at some one high up on the seats of the
Rubberneck.
"“Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,” said Donovan. “Come on,"
now.”
"Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:"
"“We _are_ a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,” said he, going up to the"
dignified old man--“but if Mr. Rippley _will_ insist on sitting between
"the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby drives hard to escape the"
"inquisitive attention of the police--a body of men, Dukes, that live"
feverishly anxious to catch something and are bored with the greyness
of the popular virtue.”
He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.
"The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew."
Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and surveyed
it:
"“I say,” said he--“portrait painting seems to pay, eh?”"
Lovegood coughed:
"“H’m--n’yes,” he grunted; and added tragically: “When you can paint"
portraits.”
"“Get out!” said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair."
Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights; his
hands itching to be at any devilment:
“Oho!” said he--“so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover the
real Anthony Bickersteth--the man of mystery--the writer of _the_
book!... I suppose it ain’t Pangbutt himself!”
"'ear?  But when I sent you, what use was you?  I released 'Art, who's"
repaid me by bein' unable to see an 'ole in a ladder; and I've
concluded a treaty of peace and friendship with the French.  Next
time (if so be a German ship comes ashore) I'll go out as my own
"hambassador.  No, Simcox, never more!  No, Lampert, never, never"
"more!  I just speaks to that French crowd, and they are civil and"
drink fair.  They recognised they'd met their match.  Their skipper
"says, says he, 'Captain Jones, I owns fair and square I'm not your"
"ekal at diplomatics.'  He adds, moreover, 'Captain Jones, damn me if"
"I believe your match is to be found.'  And I says, with dignity (with"
"dignity, Simcox), 'Right you are!'  That's what I says.  And as for"
"you, you ratty galoots, you'll treat 'em when you meets 'em just the"
same as if they wasn't French.  Do you 'ear me?  That's my
"hultimatum.  Now you can go.  That'll do the watch."""
He turned to the mates.
"""I thought better of you two, so I did,"" he remarked sadly.  ""But"
"there, you 'aven't 'ad my experience, and when I gets 'ome I shall"
see as them that is in power at the Furrin Office 'ears 'ow I done
"it.  Salisbury ain't my stiffness of backbone, and 'e ain't my tact."
"If so be as 'e was to invite them Frenchmen to dinner, it would be"
different.  They knows (as the French captain owned to me; fair and
square 'e owned it) they don't 'ave no nat'ral right to hislands and
col'nies.  Make the Frenchmen's 'omes 'appy and they'll stay at 'ome.
"Think it hout; you'll see 'ow it could be done.  There now, that'll"
"do you.  I disarrest you!"""
"And the ""old man"" rolled cheerfully for his cabin."
"""By my lone I done it!"" said the Guffin."
"answer, wishing to understand him."
"""Speak to me from the Bible.  There are no such men there."""
"Then the teacher began criticising the Bible.  The old man listened,"
and interrupted him after a long while.
"""Stop ...  Wait!  That means that among people known to God there are"
no Russians?  We are not known to God?  Is it so?  God knew all those
"who are mentioned in the Bible ... He destroyed them by sword and fire,"
He destroyed their cities; but He also sent prophets to teach them.
That means that He also pitied them.  He scattered the Jews and the
"Tartars ...  But what about us?  Why have we prophets no longer?"""
"""Well, I don't know!"" replied the teacher, trying to understand the old"
"man.  But the latter put his hand on the teacher's shoulder, and slowly"
"pushed him backwards and forwards, and his throat made a noise as if he"
were swallowing something....
"""Tell me!  You speak so much ... as if you knew everything.  It makes"
me sick to listen to you ... you darken my soul....  I should be better
"pleased if you were silent.  Who are we, eh? Why have we no prophets?"
"Ha, ha! ...  Where were we when Christ walked on this earth?  Do you"
"see?  And you too, you are lying....  Do you think that all die out?"
The Russian people will never disappear....  You are lying....  It has
"been written in the Bible, only it is not known what name the Russians"
are given.  Do you see what kind of people they are?  They are
numberless....  How many villages are there on the earth? Think of all
"the people who live on it, so strong, so numerous! And you say that"
"they will die out; men shall die, but God wants the people, God the"
Creator of the earth!  The Amalekites did not die out.  They are either
"German or French....  But you, eh, you!  Now then, tell me why we are"
"In the streets, the lamps were lighted, but daylight was not quite gone."
"He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly.  A girl of the town passed and"
"looked up at him.  Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a"
"word; it steadied him, and they walked on thus together.  Suddenly he"
said:
"""Well, girl, are you happy?""  The girl stopped and tried to disengage her"
arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
"Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm.  ""When the unhappy meet, they walk"
together.  Come on!  You are just a little like my wife.  Will you have a
"drink?"""
"The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out"
of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
traffic.  Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back.  The
second time to-day.  SHE had slipped from his grasp.  Passers looked at
"him, amazed.  The ugly devils!  And with a grimace, he turned out of"
"Piccadilly, past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street.  They"
"wouldn't let him in, of course--not they!  But he would look at the"
"windows; they had flower-boxes--flower-boxes!  And, suddenly, he groaned"
aloud--he had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home.
"Missing the right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street.  A"
fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin.  Fiorsen
"stopped to listen.  Poor devil!  ""Pagliacci!""  Going up to the man--dark,"
"lame, very shabby, he took out some silver, and put his other hand on the"
man's shoulder.
"""Brother,"" he said, ""lend me your fiddle.  Here's money for you. Come;"
"lend it to me.  I am a great violinist."""
"""Vraiment, monsieur!"""
The Further Adventures of Peggy of Spinster Farm
_By Helen M. Winslow_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated, net $1.25; postpaid $ 1.40_"
Miss Winslow calls us again away from the strenuous and noisy
"confusion of modern cities to the charm and contentment of life ""under"
"the greenwood tree."" Peggy's adventures had only just begun in the"
"first book. In this new record of life at Spinster Farm and ""Elysium,"""
"""At the Sign of the Town Pump,"" there is plenty of romantic adventure"
of the kind that proves truth to be stranger sometimes than fiction.
"There is humor, too, in even greater quantities than in the preceding"
"book, sparkling humor that places the author well up in the list of"
"our New England humorists. ""At the Sign of the Town Pump"" will be"
welcomed not only by those who enjoyed making the acquaintance of
"Spinster Farm, but by thousands of new readers who appreciate a clever"
story and a fascinating heroine.
"_On ""Peggy at Spinster Farm"" the Press opinions are as follows_:"

"sunsets, and--or it would not be Helen Winslow--the"

such a wicked delight in adding to his father's discomfiture.  He did
not even once look in their direction.
"""The young spider has himself well in hand,"" remarked Abyedok, watching"
young Petunikoff's every movement and action.  Having taken all the
"measurements he desired, Ivan Andreyevitch knit his brows, got into the"
"cart, and drove away.  His son went with a firm step into Vaviloff's"
"eating-house, and disappeared behind the door."
"""Ho, ho!  That's a determined young thief! ...  What will happen next,"
"I wonder ...?"" asked Kuvalda."
"""Next?  Young Petunikoff will buy out Egor Vaviloff,"" said Abyedok with"
"conviction, and smacked his lips as if the idea gave him great pleasure."
"""And you are glad of that?"" Kuvalda asked him, gravely."
"""I am always pleased to see human calculations miscarry,"" explained"
"Abyedok, rolling his eyes and rubbing his hands with delight.  The"
Captain spat angrily on the ground and was silent. They all stood in
"front of the tumble-down building, and silently watched the doors of"
the eating-house.  More than an hour passed thus.  Then the doors
opened and Petunikoff came out as silently as he had entered.  He
"stopped for a moment, coughed, turned up the collar of his coat,"
"glanced at the men, who were following all his movements with their"
"eyes, and then went up the street towards the town."
"The Captain watched him for a moment, and turning to Abyedok said,"
smilingly:

"problems of the living nature shall not urge Croce himself, or one of"
"his successors, as powerfully as the problems of human history have"
"moved him. At present, with very rare exceptions, the students of"
the history of nature are occupied in transforming their historical
experience into classes and types and laws; but a time may come when
from the naturalistic constructions we shall be able more frequently
"to recreate the life of which these are but the dead spoils, the"
"accumulated vestiges, by the same process by which history re-kindles"
"the old chronicles into new, contemporary life. That such a development"
"is implied in Croce's own theory of history can hardly be questioned,"
"though, when realized, it will undoubtedly react on more than one point"
of Croce's logic.

"DE SOTO, CAPTAIN BENITO."
A Portuguese.
A most notorious pirate in and about 1830.
"In 1827 he shipped at Buenos Ayres as mate in a slaver, named the"
"_Defenser de Pedro_, and plotted to seize the ship off the African coast."
"The pirates took the cargo of slaves to the West Indies, where they sold"
"them. De Soto plundered many vessels in the Caribbean Sea, then sailed to"
"the South Atlantic, naming his ship the _Black Joke_. The fear of the"
_Black Joke_ became so great amongst the East Indiamen homeward bound that
they used to make up convoys at St. Helena before heading north.
"In 1832 de Soto attacked the _Morning Star_, an East Indiaman, and took"
"her, when he plundered the ship and murdered the captain. After taking"
"several more ships, de Soto lost his own on the rocky coast of Spain, near"
"Cadiz. His crew, although pretending to be honest shipwrecked sailors,"
"were arrested, but de Soto managed to escape to Gibraltar. Here he was"
recognized by a soldier who had seen de Soto when he took the _Morning
"Star_, in which he had been a passenger. The pirate was arrested, and"
"tried before Sir George Don, the Governor of Gibraltar, and sentenced to"
death. He was sent to Cadiz to be hanged with the rest of his crew. The
"gallows was erected at the water's edge, and de Soto, with his coffin, was"
"conveyed there in a cart. He died bravely, arranging the noose around his"
"own neck, stepping up into his coffin to do so; then, crying out, ""Adios"
"todos,"" he threw himself off the cart."
"This man must not be confused with one Bernado de Soto, who was tried for"
cold fury:
"""You better stop that laughin', Jack Rance, or I'll send you to finish"
"it in some place where things ain't so funny."""
Something in the Girl's altered tone so struck the Sheriff that he
"obeyed her. He said nothing, but on his lips were the words, ""By Heaven,"
"the Girl means it!"" and his eyes showed a smouldering admiration."
"""He doesn't hear you,--he's out of it. But me--me--I hear you--I ain't"
"out of it,"" the Girl went on in compelling tones. ""You're a gambler; he"
"was, too; well, so am I."" She crossed deliberately to the bureau, and"
"laid her pistol away in the drawer, Rance meanwhile eyeing her with"
"puzzled interest. Returning, she went on, incisively as a whip lash:"
"""I live on chance money, drink money, card money, saloon money. We're"
"gamblers,--we're all gamblers!"" She paused, an odd expression coming"
"over her face,--an expression that baffled Rance's power to read."
"Presently she resumed: ""Now, you asked me to-night if my answer was"
"final,--well, here's your chance. I'll play you the game,--straight"
"poker. It's two out o' three for me. Hatin' the sight o' you, it's the"
"nearest chance you'll ever get for me."""
"""Do you mean--"" began Rance, his hands resting on the table, his"
hawk-like glance burning into her very thoughts.
"""Yes, with a wife in Noo Orleans all right,"" she interrupted him"
"feverishly. ""If you're lucky,--you'll git 'im an' me. But if you"
"lose,--this man settin' between us is mine--mine to do with as I please,"
"an' you shut up an' lose like a gentleman."""
"""You must be crazy about him!"" The words seemed wrung from the Sheriff"
against his will.
"The end of Roberts's career was now in sight. A King's ship, the _Swallow_"
"(Captain Chaloner Ogle), discovered Roberts's ships at Parrot Island, and,"
"pretending to fly from them, was followed out to sea by one of the"
"pirates. A fight took place, and after two hours the pirates struck,"
"flinging overboard their black flag ""that it might not rise in Judgement"
"over them."" The _Swallow_ returned in a few days to Parrot Island to look"
"for Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Roberts being at breakfast, enjoying a"
"savoury dish of solomongundy, was informed of the approach of the ship,"
"but refused to take any notice of it. At last, thoroughly alarmed, he cut"
"his cables and sailed out, but most of his crew being drunk, even at this"
"early hour, the pirates did not make as good a resistance as if they had"
been sober. Early in the engagement Roberts was hit in the throat by a
"grape-shot and killed; this being on February 10th, 1722. His body, fully"
"dressed, with his arms and ornaments, was thrown overboard according to"
"his repeated request made during his lifetime. Thus the arch-pirate died,"
"as he always said he wished to die, fighting. His motto had always been ""A"
"short life and a merry one."" One good word can be said for Roberts, that"
he never forced a man to become a pirate against his wish.
"ROBERTS, OWEN. Welsh pirate."
"Carpenter in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_, and killed on November 22nd, 1718,"
off the North Carolina Coast.
"ROBINSON, EDWARD."
Of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
"Hanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1718."
"me to see Doctor Lilly, and I suggested that I return for him in three"
hours.
"I went back to Whitehall, where I found Frances, and told her to be at"
"Lilly's house on the Strand within three hours, to meet the French king's"
"ambassador, and to receive the instructions which George's letter had"
"intimated the Abbé would give. I told her, also, that the Abbé was not"
the person we had expected to see.
"The evening before, she was ready to die of fright because we believed"
"that the Abbé was George Hamilton, and now, since I had found he was not,"
she was ready to die of disappointment--so she assured me.
"At the appointed time, De Grammont, the Abbé, and I took the count's"
"barge and went down to the water stairs nearest Temple Bar, where the"
Abbé and I left De Grammont and walked up through the crowded streets to
"Lilly's house. Owing to the crowded condition of the street, the Abbé and"
I found no opportunity to exchange words until we were before Lilly's
house.
"Lilly was at home, I having sent word of our coming, so when we knocked,"
"the servant opened and directed us to the waiting parlor, saying that the"
Doctor would soon come down.
"We started upstairs, I in the lead, the Abbé following ten paces behind."
"When I entered the room, I found Bettina and Frances sitting by the"
"street window. They came to me quickly, and Frances explained Bettina's"
presence.
"""I did not like to come here alone, so I asked Betty to come with me. She"
"is to be trusted."""
"Taken prisoner by the pirate Captain Teach on November 21st, 1718, and on"
the very next day retaken by Lieutenant Maynard. Odell received no less
"than seventy wounds in the fight, but recovered, and was carried to"
"Virginia to stand his trial for piracy, and was acquitted."
"OUGHTERLAUNEY, THOMAS."
Acted as pilot in the _Royal Fortune_. Took an active part in taking and
plundering the _King Solomon_ on the West Coast of Africa in 1721.
"Was tried for piracy with the rest of Roberts's crew, when one witness,"
"Captain Trahern, deposed that the prisoner dressed himself up in the"
"captain's best suit of clothes, his new tye wig, and called loudly for a"
"bottle of wine, and then, very arrogantly, gave orders as to the steering"
of the captured ship.
Hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722.
"PAIN, CAPTAIN."
A Bahaman privateer who in 1683 turned pirate and attacked St. Augustine
"in Florida under French colours. Being driven off by the Spaniards, he had"
to content himself with looting some neighbouring settlements. On
"returning to New Providence, the Governor attempted, but without success,"
"to arrest Pain and his crew. Pain afterwards appeared in Rhode Island, and"
"when the authorities tried to seize him and his ship, he got off by"
exhibiting an old commission to hunt for pirates given him a long while
"before by Sir Thomas Lynch. When the West Indies became too hot for him,"
Pain made the coast of Carolina his headquarters.
"TOWNLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
A buccaneer who in the year 1684 was one of the mixed English and French
"fleet blockading Panama. On this occasion, he commanded a ship with a crew"
of 180 men. By the next year the quarrels between the English had reached
such a pitch that Townley and Swan left Davis and sailed in search of
"their French friends. In May, 1685, Townley was amongst the company that"
"took and sacked Guayaquil. In January, 1686, Townley rescued the French"
"pirate Grogniet and some 350 Frenchmen who, when attacking the town of"
"Quibo, were surprised by a Spanish squadron, which burnt their vessels"
while the crews were on shore. Townley then sailed north with his French
comrades and sacked Granada.
"His next adventure was to take the town of Lavelia, near to Panama, where"
he found a rich cargo which the Viceroy had placed on shore because he was
afraid to send it to sea when so many pirates were about.
"In August of the same year, Townley's ship was attacked by three Spanish"
"men-of-war. A furious fight took place, which ended by two of the Spanish"
ships being captured and the third burnt. In this action the gallant
"Townley was gravely wounded, and died shortly afterwards."
"TRISTRIAN, CAPTAIN. French buccaneer."
"In the year 1681 Dampier, with other malcontents, broke away from Captain"
Sharp and marched on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. After undergoing
"terrible hardships for twenty-two days, the party arrived on the Atlantic"
"seaboard, to find Captain Tristrian with his ship lying in La Sounds Cay."
"The buccaneers bought red, blue, and green beads, and knives, scissors,"
With the greatest diffidence I have at last made up my mind to write
the story of my small campaign with the Sarhad Raiders in 1916.
This campaign sinks into utter insignificance when compared with the
great deeds done in other theatres of war by men who said nothing
"about them. But, insignificant as it was, it forms part of the mosaic"
"of the Great War, and for this reason may be of some general interest."
I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to all the officers who
"took part in this little campaign. Their untiring devotion to duty,"
and their efforts to do their utmost under conditions that were often
"more than trying, accounts for its success."
"I would like, in particular, to mention Major Landon of the 35th"
"Scinde Horse, whose great knowledge of the people and their country"
was invaluable; Major Sanders of the 36th Sikhs; Colonel Claridge of
"the 28th Light Cavalry; Captain Brownlow and Captain Hirst, both of"
the 28th Light Cavalry; Major Lang; Captain Moore-Lane; Lieutenant
"Bream of the Hazara Pioneers, and Captain English, R.A."
"In addition I would mention how much, not only I, but the old country"
"owes to Khan Bahadur, the Sarhad-dar, and to Idu, non-commissioned"
officer of the Chagai Levies.
The photographs are from snapshots taken by various officers during
the campaign.

"I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at"
each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.
Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the
nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very
"interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat"
of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and
tripped over me.
I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons.
"When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing"
"very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face"
"and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis"
"does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me"
up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.
"Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief"
"Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of"
wide-eyed female passengers.

"Commanded in 1831 a small gaff-topsail schooner, the _General Morazan_,"
armed with a brass eight-pounder and carrying a mixed crew of forty-four
"men, French, Italian, English, and Creoles of St. Domingo."
"VANCLEIN, CAPTAIN MOSES. Dutch filibuster."
Was serving with L'Ollonais's fleet off the coast of Yucatan when a mutiny
"broke out, of which Vanclein was the ringleader. He persuaded the"
malcontents to sail with him along the coast till they came to Costa Rica.
"There they landed and marched to the town of Veraguas, which they seized"
"and pillaged. The pirates got little booty, only eight pounds of gold, it"
proving to be a poor place.
"VANE, CAPTAIN CHARLES."
"Famous for his piratical activities off the coast of North America,"
specially the Carolinas.
"In 1718, when Woodes Rogers was sent by the English Government to break up"
"the pirate stronghold in the Bahama Islands, all the pirates at New"
Providence Island surrendered to Rogers and received the King's pardon
"except Vane, who, after setting fire to a prize he had, slipped out of the"
bay as Rogers with his two men-of-war entered. Vane sailed to the coast of
"Carolina, as did other West Indian pirates who found their old haunts too"
warm for them.
Vane is first heard of as being actively engaged in stealing from the
Spaniards the silver which they were salving from a wrecked galleon in the
moment a German soldier on leave came up and spat in his face. The
Frenchman felled the German with a resounding box on the ear.
Alarums! Excursions! A German officer rushed up to enquire while the
Frenchman was struggling with two colossal German military policemen
and the Englishman was striving to free him. Vivie explained to the
officer what had occurred. He bowed and saluted: seized the
soldier-spitter by the collar and kicked him so frightfully that
Vivie had to implore him to cease.
Moreover the Red Placards of von Bissing were of increasing
frequency. As a rule Vivie only heard what other people said of
"them, and that wasn't very much, for German spies were everywhere,"
inviting you to follow them to the dreaded Kommandantur in the Rue
de la Loi--a scene of as much in the way of horror and mental
anguish as the Conciergerie of Paris in the days of the Red Terror.
But some cheek-blanching rumour she had heard on a certain Monday in
October caused her to look next day on her way home at a fresh Red
Placard which had been posted up in a public place. The daylight had
"almost faded, but there was a gas lamp which made the notice"
legible. It ran:

CHAPTER VI
AVIATION IN DREAMS
Dreams of Flying and Falling--Their Peculiar Vividness--Dreams of
Flying an Alleged Survival of Primeval Experiences--Best explained
as based on Respiratory Sensations combined with Cutaneous
Anaesthesia--The Explanation of Dreams of Falling--The Sensation
of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic Saints--Also
experienced at the Moment of Death.
"Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are sometimes associated"
"with, may fairly be considered the best known and most frequent type of"
dream. They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention. Ruths
"argues that the Greek conception of the flying Hermes, the god who"
"possessed special authority over dreams, was based on such experiences."
"Lucretius, in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,"
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;[100] Cicero appears to refer
to dreams of flying; St. Jerome mentions that he was subject to them;
Synesius remarked that in dreams we fly with wings and view the world
from afar; Cervantes accurately described the dream of falling.[101] From
type of singing.
Since the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is
considerably below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in
"secular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches"
should seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.
It is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing
"better. Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special"
"services and revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total"
work and worship of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess
the strength and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of
the Eternal.
The principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:
"_Authors._ Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine"
"Hankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though not"
"all, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth"
century. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all and many
of her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations that use
"this type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became the leader of the"
"gospel song movement, composing words and music, publishing numerous"
"song books, and serving as song leader in great revival meetings."
"_Music._ William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip Philips,"
"James McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W. Towner, Wm. J."
"Kirkpatrick, and others."
"_Song Leaders._ P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C."
"Stebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver."
It should be noted that there is no absolute line of demarcation between
"Petunikoff and his kind tremble and perspire before me!"""
"""Ah!  You have a courageous tongue!"" jeered Abyedok."
"""Yes ...  You miser!""  And Kuvalda looked at him contemptuously.  ""What"
do you understand?  What do you know?  Are you able to think?  But I
have thought and I have read ... books of which you could not have
"understood one word."""
"""Of course!  One cannot eat soup out of one's hand ... But though you"
"have read and thought, and I have not done that or anything else, we"
"both seem to have got into pretty much the same condition, don't we?"""
"""Go to the Devil!"" shouted Kuvalda.  His conversations with Abyedok"
"always ended thus.  When the teacher was absent his speeches, as a"
"rule, fell on the empty air, and received no attention, and he knew"
"this, but still he could not help speaking.  And now, having quarrelled"
"with his companion, he felt rather deserted; but, still longing for"
"conversation, he turned to Simtsoff with the following question: ""And"
"you, Aleksei Maksimovitch, where will you lay your grey head?"""
"The old man smiled good-humouredly, rubbed his hands, and replied, ""I"
"do not know ...  I will see.  One does not require much, just a little"
"drink."""
"""Plain but honourable fare!"" the Captain said.  Simtsoff was silent,"
"only adding that he would find a place sooner than any of them, because"
"women loved him.  This was true.  The old man had, as a rule, two or"
"three prostitutes, who kept him on their very scant earnings.  They"
"very often beat him, but he took this stoically.  They somehow never"
"beat him too much, probably because they pitied him.  He was a great"
"lover of women, and said they were the cause of all his misfortunes."
"_Elizabeth and Katherine_, off the coast of West Africa. Fitting her out"
"for a pirate, they named her the _Flying King_, and Sample was put in"
"command. In company with Captain Low, he sailed to Brazil and did much"
mischief amongst the Portuguese shipping. In November of the same year the
two pirate ships were attacked by a very powerful man-of-war. Lane got
"away, but Sample was compelled to run his ship ashore on the coast. Of his"
"crew of seventy men, twelve were killed and the rest taken prisoners, of"
"whom the Portuguese hanged thirty-eight. Of these, thirty-two were"
"English, three Dutch, two French, and one Portuguese."
"SANDERS, THOMAS."
An Elizabethan mariner who was taken prisoner by the Moors. He wrote a
narrative of his life as a slave on a Barbary pirate galley.
"""I and sixe more of my fellowes,"" he wrote, ""together with four-score"

"and three to an oare, and we rowed naked above the girdle, and the"
"Boteswaine of the Galley walked abaft the masts, and his Mate afore the"
"maste ... and when their develish choller rose, they would strike the"
Christians for no cause. And they allowed us but halfe a pound of bread a
"man in a day without any other kind of sustenance, water excepted.... We"
"were then so cruelly manackled in such sort, that we could not put our"
"hands the length of one foote asunder the one from the other, and every"
"night they searched our chains three times, to see if they were fast"

happy and far lonelier even than in London. She did not like to send
"all that way for the Adams children, she had a parlour suite all to"

"outside, since everybody now-a-days wanted you to subscribe to"
"something, and it was so disagreeable having to say ""no."" She was"
not a great walker so she could not enjoy the Talbot woods; the sea
"made her feel sad, remembering that Michael was the other side and"
"the submarines increasingly active: in short, air-raids or no"
"air-raids, she returned home in March, and her maid, who had been"
"with her ten years, gave her warning."
But then she had an inspiration! She engaged Mrs. Albert Adams to
"take her place, and although the parlour-maid at this took offence"
"and cut the painter of domestic service, went off to the munitions"

basis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were
"adapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the"
"vernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely"
"recognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as"
"for instance, the tune “Hamburg.” Some of the music in the Amish church"
services is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.
The singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and
confined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The
"laity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so."
"Congregational singing, so important in our worship today, had for"
centuries been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was
inevitable and it came in due time.
"While only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the Western"
Church have been translated from the Latin and a few choice ones have
found their way into the _Hymnary_.

Kennedy related the history of the Farnese Palace to Cæsar. They went
through the Via del Mascherone and came out into the Via Giulia.
"“This Via Giulia is a street in a provincial capital,” said Kennedy;"
“always sad and deserted; a Cardinal or two who like isolation are still
living here.”
"At the entrance to the Via dei Farnesi, Cæsar stopped to look at two"
marble tablets set into the wall at the two sides of a chapel door.
"Cut on the tablets were skeletons painted black; on one, the words:"
"“Alms for the poor dead bodies found in the fields,” and on the other:"
“Alms for the perpetual lamp in the cemetery.”
“What does this mean?” said Cæsar.
“That is the Church of the Orison of the Confraternity of Death. The
tablets are modern.”
"They passed by the “Mascherone” again, and went rambling on until they"
reached the Synagogue and the Theatre of Marcellus.
They went through narrow streets without sidewalks; they passed across
"tiny squares; and it seemed like a dead city, or like the outskirts of a"
village. In certain streets towered high dark palaces of blackish stone.
These mysterious palaces looked uninhabited; the gratings were eaten
"with rust, all sorts of weeds grew on the roofs, and the balconies were"
"covered with climbing plants. At corners, set into the wall, one saw"
"niches with glass fronts. A painted madonna, black now, with silver"
"jewels and a crown, could be guessed at inside, and in front a little"
lantern swung on a cord.
sulky self-respect which would have carried him creditably to the altar

"Etienne faced his death like the son of an ancient race, and a good"
"Catholic. He could not have a confessor, but he said his prayers,"
"committed his soul to God and the Virgin, and faced the black muzzles"
not greatly abashed.
"As for El Sarria, death was his _métier_, his familiar friend. He had"
"lived with him for years, as a man with a wife, rising up and lying"
"down, eating and breathing in his company. ""The fortune of war,"" as"
Cabrera said. El Sarria was ready. Dolóres and her babe were safe. He
asked no more.
And not less readily fell into line Rollo Blair. A little apart he stood
as they made ready to march out of the presence of the Carlist general.
"John Mortimer was already on his way, carefully and conscientiously"
"ordering his going, that he might not in these last things disgrace his"
nation and his upbringing. Etienne and Ramon were following him. Still
"the young Scot lingered. Cabrera, nervously fingering his accoutrement"
"and signing papers at a folding table, found time to eye him with"
curiosity.
"""Did he mean to make a last plea for mercy?"" he thought."
Cabrera smiled contemptuously. A friend of Nogueras might know Ramon
Cabrera of Tortosa better. But Rollo had no such thought. He had in his
"fingers Etienne's last slip of Alcoy paper, in which the cigarette of"
"Spain, unfailing comforter, is wrapped. To fill it he had crumbled his"
last leaf of tobacco. Now it was rolled accurately and with lingering
"particularity, because it was to be the last. It lay in his palm featly"
"made, a cigarette worthy to be smoked by Don Carlos himself."

"In company with three other mariners--Cullen, Wife, and Neale--this Irish"
"pirate shipped himself on board a French snow at Cork in November, 1721,"
"for a passage to Nantes. Owing to Roche's briskness, genteel manners, and"
"knowledge of navigation, the master used occasionally to place him in"
charge of the vessel. One night a few days out a pre-arranged mutiny took
"place, the French crew being butchered and thrown overboard. The captain,"
"who pleaded for mercy, was also thrown into the sea. Driven by bad weather"
"to Dartmouth, the new captain, Roche, had the ship repainted and"
"disguised, and renamed her the _Mary_. Then sailing to Rotterdam he sold"
"the cargo of beef and took on a fresh cargo with the owner, Mr. Annesly."
"The first night out of port they threw Mr. Annesly overboard, and he swam"
alongside for some while pleading to be taken in. On going into a French
"port, and hearing that an enquiry was being made about his ship, Roche ran"
"away. The crew took the ship to Scotland, and there landed and"
"disappeared, and the ship was seized and taken to the Thames."
"Later on Roche was arrested in London and committed to Newgate Prison,"
"found guilty of piracy, and hanged on August 5th, 1723, at Execution Dock,"
"at the age of 30. The hanging was not, from the public spectators point of"
"view, a complete success, for the culprit ""was so ill at the time that he"
could not make any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for
"which he suffered."""

"Mr. Coxon may be forgiven for being, on this same important Monday, in a"
state of some nervous excitement. He had a severe attack of what are
"vulgarly called ""the fidgets,"" and Sir John, who was spending the"
"morning at the Club (for his court was not sitting), glanced at him over"
his eye-glasses with an irritated look. The ex-Attorney-General would
"not sit still, but flitted continually from window to table, and back"
"from table to window, taking up and putting down journal after journal."
"Much depended, in Mr. Coxon's view, on the event of that day, for Sir"
"John spoke openly of his approaching retirement, and an appointment"
sometimes thought worthy of a Premier's acceptance might be in Coxon's
"grasp before many weeks were past, if only Medland and his noxious idea"
of getting a first-class man out from England could be swept together
into limbo.
"""What's the betting about to-night?"" asked the Chief Justice, as in one"
of his restless turns the brooding politician passed near.
"""We reckon to beat him by five,"" answered Coxon."
"""Unless any of your men turn tail, that is? I hear Fenton's very"
wobbly--says he daren't show his face in the North-east Ward if he
"throws Medland over."""
"""Oh, he's all right."""
"""Been promised something?"""
"""You might allow some of us to have consciences, Chief Justice,"" said"
"Coxon, with an attempt at geniality."
"""Oh, some of you, yes. But I'll pick my men, please,"" remarked Sir John,"
"with a pleasant smile. ""Perry's got a conscience, and Kilshaw--well,"
dismay. For some reason she could not understand she had offended Mart.
And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a cruel fate that had
brought Pola out on the wharf at that precise moment!
"She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too miserable to even pour"
"out her heart to ""Dorothea."" Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper"
"and after supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender nor Mr."
"Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing up the dishes while Aunt"
Achsa went down to Tillie Higgins'.
Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney pondered sadly the things
she had longed to learn of Pola. Her name--why she hadn't even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that theme she had written
on her visit to the Romley house? Where did Pola live? Of course she
might see her again--Pola had said that they'd be in Provincetown for a
"few days, but she did not _want_ to see her; she did not want Pola to"
see Sunset Lane and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and
Lavender. Pola would laugh at them and she would hate her!
At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of the path and a shadow
fell across the kitchen door. Sidney turned from the table. There stood
Mr. Dugald and with him--Pola.
"""I've brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out to the Cape with that"
ill-wind we felt this morning. If you know what we can do with her I'll
"be your slave for life."""
Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola walked into the kitchen.
"""Isn't he horrid? You wouldn't dream that he's really crazy about me,"
"would you? I told him how we'd met, even before this morning. He'd"
written home that Miss Green's cousin was here but I never dreamed it

5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.
"The followers of John Hus who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren,"
"and later as the Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce"
congregational singing into their worship. They also published the first
"Protestant hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and"
"400 hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts"
to introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman
hierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at the
"stake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing of"
hymns in the churches. It decreed:
"If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much"
more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.
"As a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out"
messengers to search for true Christian people into whose communion they
"might apply for admission—one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,"
and one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No such
"Christians had been found. They therefore remained in their own country,"
giving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of the
Bible.
In 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and ask
his advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their
fellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had
"published, and later used some of the hymns in his own work."
"Upon my insistence, he accepted the gold and gave me the ten guineas he"
"had borrowed from Lilly, asking me to return them."
Frances was making an entire failure of her effort to hold herself in
"check, and George was having difficulty in restraining himself, so, to"
"bring the interview to an end, he gave me his hand, saying:--"
"""Thank you, Ned, and good-by. I wish I could hope ever to see you again,"
"but if Le Grand fails me, I shall go to the new world and lose myself in"
"the Canadian woods."""
"""No, no!"" cried Frances, imploringly."
"""I hope not,"" began George, but he could not finish, so he took Frances"
"in his arms for a moment, and when he released her, thrust us both out"
"the door, saying: ""Please leave me at once. If you do not, I fear I shall"
"never let her go. Take care of her, Ned. Good-by!"""
"The door closed on us, and when Frances had put on her vizard, she"
followed me upstairs to see Betty.
"I was not admitted to Betty's room, so I went back to the printing shop"
"for a moment, and George gave me the key to the cipher, in which we were"
"to write to each other. His letters were to be sent under cover to Lilly,"
and mine were to go to an address in Paris which George would send to me.
"Long afterwards George told me of his adventures in making his escape,"
but I shall give them now in the order of their happening rather than in
the order of time in which I learned them.
"Leaving the Old Swan within ten minutes after I had said good-by to him,"
from above.  No sound of the dogs.  He would go up and see the baby.
"While he was crossing the hall, there came a ring.  He opened the door"
himself.  A telegram!  He tore the envelope.
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
"He gave a short laugh, shut the door in the boy's face, and ran upstairs;"
why--heaven knew!  There was nobody there now!  Nobody! Did it mean that
she had really left him--was not coming back?  He stopped by the side of
"Gyp's bed, and flinging himself forward, lay across it, burying his face."
"And he sobbed, as men will, unmanned by drink.  Had he lost her?  Never"
to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them!  Never to soak
"his senses in her loveliness!  He leaped up, with the tears still wet on"
"his face. Lost her?  Absurd!  That calm, prim, devilish Englishman, her"
father--he was to blame--he had worked it all--stealing the baby!
He went down-stairs and drank some brandy.  It steadied him a little.
"What should he do?  ""Letter follows.""  Drink, and wait? Go to Bury"
Street?  No.  Drink!  Enjoy himself!
"He laughed, and, catching up his hat, went out, walking furiously at"
"first, then slower and slower, for his head began to whirl, and, taking a"
"cab, was driven to a restaurant in Soho.  He had eaten nothing but a"
"biscuit since his breakfast, always a small matter, and ordered soup and"
a flask of their best Chianti--solids he could not face.  More than two
"hours he sat, white and silent, perspiration on his forehead, now and"
"then grinning and flourishing his fingers, to the amusement and sometimes"
"the alarm of those sitting near.  But for being known there, he would"
"have been regarded with suspicion.  About half-past nine, there being no"
"more wine, he got up, put a piece of gold on the table, and went out"
without waiting for his change.
"Panama is divided into seven provinces, Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon,"
"Chiriqui, Los Santos, Panama and Veragua. Its total population by the"
"census of 1911 was 386,749, a trifle more than the District of Columbia"
"which has about one five-thousandth of its area, and almost precisely"
the same population as Montana which has less than half its size. So it
"is clearly not over-populated. Of its population 51,323 are set down by"
"its own census takers as white, 191,933 as mestizo, or a cross between"
"white and Indian, 48,967 as negro; 2313 Mongol, and 14,128 Indian. The"
"census takers estimated that other Indians, living in barbarism remote"
"from civilization and unapproachable by the enumerators, numbered"
"36,138."
[Illustration: NATIVE FAMILY IN CHORRERA]
All these figures have to be qualified somewhat. The mestizos are
"theoretically a cross between whites and Indians, but the negro blood is"
"very generally present. It is doubtful, too, whether those classed as"
white are not often of mixed blood.
A singularly large proportion of the population lives in the towns. In
"12 towns, exceeding 7000 inhabitants each, are more than 150,000 people."
"More than one-third of the people therefore are town dwellers, which is"
to say they are unproductive citizens. Meanwhile more than five-eighths
of the arable land in the country is not under cultivation.
The five chief towns of Panama with their population in 1911 are:
"Panama             37,505"
"Colon              17,748"
"David              15,059"
"Santiago           13,081"
"Bocas del Toro      9,759"
"returned to their owners. To prevent Searle's doing such things again, he"
"was deprived of his ship's rudder and sails. In 1666, Searle, in company"
"with a Captain Stedman and a party of only eighty men, took the Island of"
"Tobago, near Trinidad, from the Dutch, destroying everything they could"
not carry away.
"SELKIRK, ALEXANDER. The original Robinson Crusoe."
"Born in 1676 at Largo in Fifeshire, he was the seventh son of John"
"Selcraig, a shoemaker. In 1695 he was cited to appear before the Session"
"for ""indecent conduct in church,"" but ran away to sea. In 1701 he was back"
"again in Largo, and was rebuked in the face of the congregation for"
"quarrelling with his brothers. A year later Selkirk sailed to England, and"
in 1703 joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas. Appointed
"sailing-master to the _Cinque Ports_, commanded by Captain Stradling."
"In September, 1704, he arrived at the uninhabited island of Juan"
"Fernandez, in the South Pacific. Selkirk, having quarrelled with the"
"captain, insisted on being landed on the island with all his belongings."
"He lived alone here for nearly four years, building himself two cabins,"
"hunting the goats which abounded, and taming young goats and cats to be"
his companions.
"On the night of January 31st, 1709, seeing two ships, Selkirk lit a fire,"
and a boat was sent ashore. These ships were the _Duke_ and _Duchess_ of
"Bristol, under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, while his old friend"
Dampier was acting as pilot. Selkirk was at once appointed sailing-master
"of the _Duchess_, and eventually arrived back in the Thames on October"
"14th, 1711, with booty worth £800, having been away from England for eight"
"years. While in England he met Steele, who described Selkirk as a ""man of"
"good sense, with strong but cheerful expression."" Whether Selkirk ever met"

"RINGROSE, BASIL. Buccaneer, pirate, and author."
Sailed in 1679 to the West Indies. A year later Ringrose had joined the
"buccaneers at their rendezvous in the Gulf of Darien, where they were"
preparing for a bold enterprise on the Spanish Main. They landed and
"marched to the town of Santa Maria, which they plundered and burnt."
Thence they travelled in canoes down the river to the Bay of Panama. After
"attacking the Spanish fleet and laying siege to the city, the buccaneers"
"cruised up and down the West Coast of South America for eighteen months,"
sacking towns and attacking Spanish ships. All this while Ringrose kept a
"very full and graphic journal, in which he recorded not only their"
"exploits, but also their hardships and quarrels, and gave descriptions as"
"well of the various natives and their customs, and drew charts and"
sketches.
"In 1681 Ringrose was still with Captain Sharp, and sailed through the"
"Straits of Magellan, and on January 30th of the same year anchored off"
"Antigua. Here he got a passage in a ship to England, landing safely at"
Dartmouth on March 26th.
"A year later he published an account of his voyage, as a second volume to"
"Esquemeling's, ""Bucaniers of America."" In 1684 he went to sea again in the"
"_Cygnet_ (Captain Swan), to traffic with the Spanish colonies. But the"
"Spaniards refused to trade with them. In October, 1684, they met the"
"famous Captain Edward Davis at that favourite haunt of the buccaneers, the"
Isle of Plate. The two captains agreed to join forces and to go together
"""on the account,"" so all the cargo was thrown overboard the _Cygnet_, and"
the ships set out to make war on any Spanish ships they might meet with.
"The Girl felt the colour leave her cheeks, though she made a gesture for"
him to proceed.
"""Pedro not 'ere any longer,"" smiled the Mexican. ""Me senda 'im to the"
"devil. Serva 'im right."""
"""An' the woman?"" gasped the Girl."
"""She gone--got away--Monterey by this time,"" replied Castro with evident"
"disappointment. ""But Meester Ashby 'e know too much--'ees men everywhere"
"searched the camp--no safa 'ere now. To-norrow--"" Castro stopped short;"
the next instant with a joyful gleam in his eyes he cried out:
"""_Maestro_!"""
"""Castro's right, Girl,"" said Johnson, who had waked and heard the"
"Mexican's last words; ""it is not safe a moment more here, and I must"
"go."""
With a little cry of loving protest the Girl abruptly left the men to
"talk over the situation and sought the opposite side of the room. There,"
her eyes half-closed and her lips pressed tightly together she gave
herself up to her distressing fears. After a while it was made plain to
"her that she was being brought into the conversation, for every now and"
"then Castro would look curiously at her; at length, as if it had been"
"determined by them that nothing should be undertaken without her advice,"
"Johnson, followed by his subordinate, came over to her and related in"
detail all the startling information that Castro had brought.
"Quietly the Girl listened and, in the end, it was agreed between them"
"that it would be safer for the men not to leave the cabin together, but"
that Castro should go at once with the understanding that he should
procure horses and wait for the master at a given point across the
9. English Hymnody.
"The youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748, an ardent dissenter,"
pioneered the movement which resulted in a flood of hymns and hymnbooks
in the English churches. Watts was not satisfied with the psalm singing
"of his time, which by now had become formal and lifeless. Parts of the"
"psalter, he pointed out, were obviously not written in the spirit of the"
"Gospel. “By keeping too close to David,” he wrote in one of his"
"Prefaces, “the vail of Moses is thrown over our hearts.” Watts removed"
"that “vail,” Christianizing the psalms and composing during his lifetime"
"more than 600 original hymns, expressing in the language of the time,"
"the thoughts of the worshippers. Through his influence, his age, the"
"18th century, became the first age of hymn singing in England."
"John and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of hymn"
"singing in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for"
congregational singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have
"composed over 6,000 hymns."
"From the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers in"
England became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing had
been broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms resulted in a
vast number of original religious lyrics and the publication of hundreds
of hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here only in outline
form.

Now Aunt Achsa hesitated. One tear separated itself from its fellows
and rolled down her withered cheek and dropped upon her withered hand.
"She looked at it, startled, then lifted her hand and dashed it across"
her eyes.

"cryin' before I have anything as I can see to cry for. But Sidney, I"
set such a lot on that boy--it's like I was his mother and his father
"and his brothers and his sisters all mixed up in one--gran'ma, too. He"
"was such a little mite when I took him, y'see and then he's not like"
other boys and I've had to do a heap of lovin' to make up to him. I've
prayed every day of my life for the Lord to keep him happy in spite of
things and that was a pretty big prayer for I don't suppose the Lord

"us up. But I thought He might make an exception for Lav. Land sakes,"

Sidney blinking back something glistening from her own eyes.

"shut away in his heart and he _is_ happy--"""

She bit off the words. Her lips trembled.
"""Aunt Achsa, it doesn't matter what one's like on the outside!"" Now"
Sidney floundered for the second time in one day under the pressure of
"her own thoughts. ""I mean--Lav can do anything he wants to do, anyway."

10. American Hymns.
The English speaking colonists who settled in America during the 17th
century continued the psalm singing traditions of their forebears in
England. The practice prevailed in their churches for two hundred years.
"The first book printed by them was the _Bay Psalm Book_, in 1640, at"
"Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no original hymns. The singing of"
"psalms, and later of hymns borrowed from England made up nearly the"
entire repertory of church music until the middle of the 19th century.
"On the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the"
"Mennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran"
tradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.
"The two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales, went"
"their independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing each"
other.
In the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in
"America, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their"
"brief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and"
"tunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until"
"recently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight’s hymn on the church, “I"
"love Thy Kingdom, Lord” (275) is probably the earliest American hymn"
still in use.
After the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers became
"large and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples"
finding their way into English hymnbooks. America’s original

"Accompanied by Kennedy, Cæsar called repeatedly on the most auspicious"
"members of the French clerical element living in Rome, and found persons"
"more cultivated than among the rough Spanish monks; but, as was natural,"
nobody gave him any useful information offering the possibility of his
putting his financial talents to the proof.
"“Something must turn up,” he used to say to himself, “and at the least"
opening we will dive into the work.”
Cæsar kept gathering notes about people who had connections in Spain
with the Black party in Rome; he called several times on Father
"Herreros, despite his uncle’s prohibition, and succeeded in getting the"

"expect to, sometime--"" But here her voice broke with a tremble. ""I--I"
was thinking of gran'ma. I wish I'd been better to her. I talk back to
"her lots of times when I shouldn't."""
"""But you _are_ good to her, Mart. And--_I_ was thinking of Aunt Achsa."
I shouldn't have deceived her--about coming out here. I fooled myself
into thinking that even a lie didn't matter considering what we were
trying to do. But the honor of Cape Cod isn't worth anything happening
to Lav. And if anything does happen there won't be anyone to tell about
"Jed Starrow, anyway! Oh, Mart, I can't bear to _think_ about Lav. Why"
"did we let him do it? Dear old Lav. I've been mean to him, too. He"
adores poetry and I--I never even told him that my father was a poet
and that I know lots and lots of poems and--and--that I've written most
"a book myself."""
"""Honest, Sid, was your father a poet? And you can write it yourself?"
"Gee,"" softly. ""I wish I could do something like that. I'd rather be"
like that than anything else. I just pretend that I hate school and
books and such things--it's because I had to stop going to school to
stay with gran'ma that I've put on that I didn't have any use for it.
"Even when I was sort of laughing at you, Sid, down in my heart I was"
feeling aw'fly proud that you'd want to fool 'round with anyone like
"me--I'll _always_ be proud."""

Dugald taught me when I first came here. That it's the big inside
things that really count. He told me so's I'd see Aunt Achsa and Lav as

afterwards English--I speak and write all three equally well; which of
the three I shall use when I come to die and one reverts to the speech

Tiverton. Whenever--and it has happened more than once--I have met as
Trehayne old schoolfellows of Blundell's they have accepted without
"comment or inquiry my tale that I had become an Englishman, and had"

11. Gospel Songs.
"During the latter part of the 19th century there came into use, both in"
"the United States and in England, a type of religious song known as the"
"Gospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales or the English hymns,"
these songs made a popular appeal and were widely used in prayer
meetings and revivals.
The words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily
remembered and concern themselves largely with the individual’s
salvation. The personal pronouns “I” and “my” predominate. The tunes are
rhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies are
"largely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords. The"
masses of the people readily learned to sing these tunes and experienced
a thrill in singing them which the use of the more stately and solid
hymns failed to effect.
The great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the latter
half of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large mass
"meetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the 1870’s,"
"1880’s, and 1890’s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence and"
the Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every country in the
world. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions of copies and
"every denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by this"
The gross rapacity of the Flemings in Spain under Philip I is
"admitted by Motley (_Rise_, as cited, pp. 31, 75); but on the same"
score feeling was passionately strong in Spain in the earlier years
"of the reign of Charles. Cp. Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. i (Works,"
"ed. 1821, iv, 37, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52, 53, 55, 77 78); and van"
"Kampen, _Geschichte der Niederlande_, i, 277, 278. It took more"
than ten years to bring Charles in good relations with the
Spaniards. See Mr. E. Armstrong's _Introduction_ to Major Martin
"Hume's _Spain_, 1898, pp. 31-37, 57, 76. Even in his latter years"
"they are found protesting against his customary absence from Spain,"
"and his perpetual wars. Robertson, bk. vi, p. 494. Cp. bk. xii,"
"vol. v, p. 417, as to the disregard shown him after his abdication."
"While it lasted, the Flemish exploitation of Spain was as shameless"
as the Spanish exploitation of Italy. The Italian Peter Martyr
"Angleria, residing at the court of Spain, reckoned that in ten"
months the Flemings there remitted home over a million ducats
"(Robertson, bk. i, p. 53). A lad, nephew of Charles's Flemish"
"minister Chievres, was appointed to the archbishopric of Toledo, in"
defiance of general indignation. The result was a clerico-popular
insurrection. Everything goes to show that but for the Emperor's
"prudence his Flemings would have ruined him in Spain, by getting"
"him to tyrannise for their gain, as Philip II later did for the"
Church's sake in the Netherlands.
It is not unwarrantable to say that had not Charles had the sagacity to
"adapt himself to the Spanish situation, learning to speak the language"
and even to tolerate the pride of the nobles[764] to a degree to which
"he never yielded before the claims of the burghers of the Netherlands,"
and had he not in the end identified himself chiefly with his Spanish
"interests, the history of Spain and the Netherlands might have been"
"entirely reversed. Had he, that is, kept his seat of rule in the"
thirty-one thousand five hundred dollars. But it cost the Romish Church
far more than money--it cost her the loss of all the leading nations
"of the world, which had been under her dominion till that time. For"
"the expense of the vast structure, with its ""insolent opulence of"
"marbles,"" was so great that Julius II. and Leo X. were obliged to meet"
"the enormous outlay by the sale of indulgences, and that, as is well"
"known, precipitated the Reformation. So that Protestants may well feel"
a peculiar interest in this mighty cathedral.
[Sidenote: The Column against which Christ Leaned in the Temple.]
It goes without saying that the popes would not allow the chief church
"of Roman Catholicism to go begging in the matter of relics. And, sure"
"enough, we have no sooner pushed aside the heavy padded screen and"
"stepped within than we find on our right the Chapel of the Holy Column,"
so called because it contains a pillar which is declared to have been
that against which our Lord leaned when he prayed and taught in the
"temple at Jerusalem. The pillar contains this inscription: ""Haec est"
illa columna in qua DNS N{r} Jesus XPS appodiatus dum populo prædicabat
"et Deo pno preces in templo effundebat adhaerendo, stabatque una"
cum aliis undecim hic circumstantibus. De Salomonis templo in
triumphum hujus Basilicæ hic locata fuit: demones expellit et immundis
spiritibus vexatos liberos reddit et multa miracula cotidie facit.

his violin with a feeling of actual sickness.  Why not?  That deep and
fearful whipping of the sexual instinct which makes the ache of jealousy
so truly terrible was at its full in such a nature as Fiorsen's.  He drew
"a long breath and shuddered.  The remembrance of her fastidious pride,"
"her candour, above all her passivity cut in across his fear.  No, not"
Gyp!
"He went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus, tumblers, and a"
"syphon, and pouring out some brandy, drank.  It steadied him.  And he"
began to practise.  He took a passage from Brahms' violin concerto and
"began to play it over and over.  Suddenly, he found he was repeating the"
same flaws each time; he was not attending.  The fingering of that thing
was ghastly!  Music-lessons!  Why did she take them?  Waste of time and
"money--she would never be anything but an amateur!  Ugh!  Unconsciously,"
he had stopped playing.  Had she gone there to-day?  It was past
lunch-time.  Perhaps she had come in.
He put down his violin and went back to the house.  No sign of her! The
maid came to ask if he would lunch.  No!  Was the mistress to be in?  She
"had not said.  He went into the dining-room, ate a biscuit, and drank a"
"brandy and soda.  It steadied him.  Lighting a cigarette, he came back to"
the drawing-room and sat down at Gyp's bureau.  How tidy!  On the little
"calendar, a pencil-cross was set against to-day--Wednesday, another"
"against Friday.  What for? Music-lessons!  He reached to a pigeon-hole,"
"and took out her address-book.  ""H--Harmost, 305A, Marylebone Road,"" and"
"against it the words in pencil, ""3 P.M."""
Three o'clock.  So that was her hour!  His eyes rested idly on a little
"old coloured print of a Bacchante, with flowing green scarf, shaking a"
"tambourine at a naked Cupid, who with a baby bow and arrow in his hands,"
was gazing up at her.  He turned it over; on the back was written in a
Is _Alice in Wonderland?_  Is _Treasure Island?_  These are
"masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how"
much more pleasure when we are grown-up.  In any case what do we mean
"by ""children""?  A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of"
fourteen--are they all to like the same thing?  And is a book
"""suitable for a boy of twelve"" any more likely to please a boy of"
twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;
"even if the novel be described truly as ""suitable for a man of"
"thirty-seven""?  I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult"
problems.
But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which
"children will like, unless he write it for himself first.  That being"
"so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups.  How"
grown-up I did not realise until I received a letter from an unknown
reader a few weeks after its first publication; a letter which said
"that he was delighted with my clever satires of the Kaiser, Mr. Lloyd"
"George and Mr. Asquith, but he could not be sure which of the"
characters were meant to be Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Bonar Law.
Would I tell him on the enclosed postcard?  I replied that they were
thinly disguised on the title-page as Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton.  In
"fact, it is not that sort of book."
"But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what"
sort of book it is.  Perhaps no explanation is necessary.  Read in it
what you like; read it to whomever you like; be of what age you like;

or you won't.
It is that sort of book.

action to repel Spanish rule during a chronic struggle of eighty
"years. Cp. Van Kampen (i, 304), who points out (p. 306) that the"

"him thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young"

"""Your daughter is desperately unhappy; and that can't be good for her"

"Mr. Wagge's thick figure seemed to writhe.  ""Pardon me, ma'am,"" he"
"spluttered, ""but I must call your husband a scoundrel.  I'm sorry to be"
"impolite, but I must do it.  If I had 'im 'ere, I don't know that I"
"should be able to control myself--I don't indeed.""  Gyp made a movement"
"of her gloved hands, which he seemed to interpret as sympathy, for he"
"went on in a stream of husky utterance: ""It's a delicate thing before a"
"lady, and she the injured party; but one has feelings.  From the first I"
said this dancin' was in the face of Providence; but women have no more
sense than an egg.  Her mother she would have it; and now she's got it!
"Career, indeed! Pretty career!  Daughter of mine!  I tell you, ma'am, I'm"
angry; there's no other word for it--I'm angry.  If that scoundrel comes

"mark 'im.  An' what to say to you, I'm sure I don't know. That my"
"daughter should be'ave like that!  Well, it's made a difference to me."
An' now I suppose her name'll be dragged in the mud.  I tell you frankly

"improvement in my fortune soon, and perhaps may write you more fully"
thereof before the week is spent.

beg you to say to one that a letter from her hand would give me greater
"joy than she can know, and that I would now send one to her if I felt"

"rest, the one serious oversight in Buckle's theory of Spanish"
"civilisation is his assumption (cp. 3-vol. ed. ii, 455-61; 1-vol."

"household, and shows it to have condemned the king's excessive"
"expenditure in very strong terms, saying the expense of his"
"household was ""as great as would be required for the conquest of a"
"kingdom."" At the same time the Cortes petitioned against"

England might claim a large section of Persia as her sphere of
"influence, and Egypt likewise and a fourth part of Africa, much of"
"Arabia, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, why might not Germany and"
Austria expect to have their little spheres of influence in the
"Balkans, in Asia Minor, in Mesopotamia? We had helped France to"
Morocco and Italy to Tripoli; why should we bother about Servia? It
"might be unkind, but then were we not unkind towards her father's"
"country, Ireland? Were we very tender towards national independence"
"in Egypt, in Persia?"
"Yet this brutal invasion of France, this unprovoked attack on Liège"
were ugly things. France had shown no disposition to egg Servia on
"against Austria, and Sir Edward Grey in the last days of June--she"
"now learnt for the first time, for she had seen no newspapers in"

information about current events--Sir Edward Grey had clearly shown
Great Britain did not approve of Servian intrigues in Bosnia. Well:
let the best man win. Germany was just as likely to give the Vote to
her women as was Britain. The Germans were first in Music and in
"Science. She for her part didn't wish to become a German subject,"
but once the War was over she would willingly naturalize herself
Belgian or Swiss.
And the War must soon be over. Europe as a whole could not allow
this devastation of resources. America would intervene. Already the
Germans realized their gigantic blunder in starting the attack.
Their men were said to be--she read--much less brave than people had
expected. The mighty German Armies had been held up for ten days by
a puny Belgian force and the forts of Liège and Namur. There would
"theirs. They suspect me of being a spy in German pay. Besides, your"
"von Bissing has ordered now that all Belgian, British, and French"
wounded shall be taken to the German Red Cross. Well: if you want
"to be kind, give me an introduction there. Surely it would be bare"
humanity on your part to let an Englishwoman be with some of those
"poor lads who are sorely wounded, dying perhaps""--she broke"
"down--""The other day I followed two of the motor ambulances along"
"the Boulevard d'Anspach. Blood dripped from them as they passed, and"
"I could hear some English boy trying to sing 'Tipperary--'"""
"""My _tear_ Miss Warren--I will try to do all that you want--You will"
"not do _anything I_ want, but never mind. I will show you that"
Germans can be generous. I will speak about your mother. I am sorry
that there are bad-mannered Germans in the hotel. There are
"some--what-you-call 'bounders'--among us, as there are with you. It"
"is to be regretted. As to our Red Cross hospitals, I know of a"
person who can make things easy for you. I will write a letter to my
cousin--like me she is a Saxon and comes from Leipzig--Minna von
"Stachelberg. She is but a few months widow, widow of a Saxon"
"officer, Graf von Stachelberg who was killed at Namur. Oh! it was"
very sad; they were but six months married. Afterwards she came here
"to work in our Red Cross--I think now she is in charge of a ward..."""
So Vivie found a few months' reprieve from acute sorrow and bitter
humiliation. Gräfin von Stachelberg was as kind in her way as her
"cousin the Colonel, but much less sentimental. In fact she was of"
"that type of New German woman, taken all too little into account by"
our Press at the time of the War. There were many like her of the
"upper middle class, the professorial class, the lesser nobility to"
"be found not only in Leipzig but in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfort,"
"Halle, Bonn, München, Hannover, Bremen, Jena, Stuttgart,"
"Cologne--nice to look at, extremely modern in education and good"
"men-of-war as a petty officer. Until July, 1723, when 40 years of age,"
"Upton lived a perfectly honest life, but his wife dying, Upton found she"
had contracted various debts and that he was in danger of being arrested
"by the creditors. Leaving his four orphans, Upton hurried to Poole in"
"Dorsetshire, and was taken on as boatswain in the _John and Elizabeth_"
"(Captain Hooper), bound for Bonavista in Newfoundland. He seems to have"
"continued to sail as an honest seaman until November 14th, 1725, when"
"serving as boatswain in the _Perry_ galley, on a voyage between Barbadoes"
"and Bristol, the vessel was taken by a pirate, Cooper, in the _Night"
Rambler_. At his subsequent trial witnesses declared that Upton willingly
"joined the pirates, signed their articles, and was afterwards one of their"
most active and cruel men.
"Upton kept a journal, which was his only witness for his defence, in which"
he described how he was forced to sign the pirates' articles under threats
"of instant death. If his journal is to be believed, Upton escaped from the"
"pirates at the first opportunity, landing on the Mosquito coast. After"
"being arrested by the Spaniards as a spy, he was sent from one prison to"
"another in Central America, at last being put on board a galleon at Porto"
"Bello, to be sent to Spain. Escaping, he got aboard a New York sloop and"
"arrived at Jamaica in December, 1726. While at Port Royal he was pressed"
"on board H.M.S. _Nottingham_, serving in her for more than two years as"
"quartermaster, until one day he was accused of having been a pirate. Under"
"this charge he was brought a prisoner to England in 1729, tried in London,"
"and hanged, protesting his innocence to the last."

"VALLANUEVA, CAPTAIN."
"Fiorsen, who had leaped out of bed, put his hand to his head.  The cursed"
"fellow!  Cursed be every one of them--the father and the girl, Rosek and"
all the other sharks!  He went out on to the landing.  The house was
"quite still below.  Rosek had gone--good riddance!  He called, ""Gyp!""  No"
answer.  He went into her room. Its superlative daintiness struck his
fancy.  A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden.  There was
"the baby at the end, and that fat woman.  No Gyp!  Never in when she was"
"wanted.  Wagge!  He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a"
brandy-bottle from a locked cupboard and drank some.  It steadied him; he
"locked up the cupboard again, and dressed."
"Going out to the music-room, he stopped under the trees to make passes"
with his fingers at the baby.  Sometimes he felt that it was an adorable
"little creature, with its big, dark eyes so like Gyp's. Sometimes it"
"excited his disgust--a discoloured brat.  This morning, while looking at"
"it, he thought suddenly of the other that was coming--and grimaced."
Catching Betty's stare of horrified amazement at the face he was making
"at her darling, he burst into a laugh and turned away into the"
music-room.
"While he was keying up his violin, Gyp's conduct in never having come"
there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust.  The girl--who cared
about the wretched girl?  As if she made any real difference!  It was all
"so much deeper than that.  Gyp had never loved him, never given him what"
"he wanted, never quenched his thirst of her!  That was the heart of it."
No other woman he had ever had to do with had been like that--kept his
thirst unquenched. No; he had always tired of them before they tired of
him.  She gave him nothing really--nothing!  Had she no heart or did she
give it elsewhere?  What was that Paul had said about her music-lessons?
"And suddenly it struck him that he knew nothing, absolutely nothing, of"
where she went or what she did.  She never told him anything.
"Music-lessons?  Every day, nearly, she went out, was away for hours.  The"
It was quite dark outside. The duckboards were lit up by rows of
hurricane lamps. The bombardment was still going on.
When I got back to the waiting-room all the prisoners were gone and
English wounded were taking their places. Soon the benches round the
stove were crowded with dark figures whose hands and faces were lit up
by the glow.
A man with haggard features and a bandage round his head began to talk
in a mournful voice:
"""Oh, it's 'ard ter lose yer mates. There was three of us--we was always"
together--we couldn't bear the idea o' separatin'. One of us copped a

That part of a body which belongs to any place should be entered
"under the name of the body, not the place: e.g., _Congregationalists"
"in New England_, _Congregationalists in Massachusetts_, not _New"
"England Congregationalists_, _Massachusetts Congregationalists_. But"
cross-references must be made from the place (indeed in cases like
"_Massachusetts Convention_, _Essex Conference_, it may be doubted"
whether those well-known names should not be the headings).

"Netherlands. ""The engrained habit of municipal isolation,"" says"
"one, ""was the cause why the general liberties of the Netherlands"

"risk and difficulty, even in the face of the most serious perils"""
"(Thorold Rogers, _Holland_, p. 26. Cp. pp. 35, 43; Motley, pp. 29,"
"30, 43; Grattan, pp. 39, 50, 51). Van Kampen avows (_Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 131) that throughout the Middle Ages Friesland was"
unprogressive owing to constant feuds. Even as late as 1670 Leyden
"refused to let the Harle Maer be drained, because it would"
advantage other cities; and Amsterdam in turn opposed the reopening
of the old Rhine channel because it would make Leyden maritime
"(Temple, _Observations_, i, 130, ch. iii)."
"As regards the early factions of the ""Hooks"" and the ""Codfish"" in"
"the Dutch towns, the historic obscurity is so great that historians"
are found ascribing the names in contrary ways. Grattan (p. 49)
"represents the Hooks as the town party, and the Codfish as the"
"party of the nobles; Motley (p. 21) reverses the explanation,"
"noting, however, that there was no consistent cleavage of class or"
"of principle (cp. M'Cullagh, pp. 99, 100). This account is"
"supported by Van Kampen, i, 170, 171. The fullest survey of the"
"Hook and Cod feud is given by Wenzelburger, _Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 210-42. As to feuds of other parties in some of"
"the cities see Van Kampen, i, 172. They included, for example, a"
class feud between the rich _Vetkooper_ (fat-dealers) and the poor
"_Schieringer_ (eel-fishers). See Davies, i, 180."
"Thus dissident, and with feudal wars breaking out in every generation,"
the cities and provinces could win concessions from their feudal chiefs
"when the latter were in straits, as in the famous case of the ""Great"
"Privilege"" extorted from the Duchess Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold"
"Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement to _Psychological Review_, June 1903). The"
"pleasure is especially marked, as MacDougall remarks, when there is 'a"
coincidence of subjective and objective change.' In dreams of flying we
"have this coincidence, the real subjective rhythm being transformed in"
consciousness to an objective rhythm.]

"Médecine_, September 10, 1905.]"
[Footnote 119: Sir W. R. Gowers has on several occasions (_e.g._ 'The
"Borderland of Epilepsy,' _British Medical Journal_, July 21, 1906) argued"
"that dreams of falling have an aural origin, and are caused by contraction"
"of the stapedius muscle, leading to a change in the ampullae which might"
suggest descent; he has himself suddenly awakened from such a dream and
caught the sound of the muscular contraction. The opinion of so acute an
investigator deserves consideration.]
"[Footnote 120: Such sensations are, indeed, a recognised result of"
"morphia. Morphinomaniacs, Goron remarks (_Les Parias de l'Amour_, p. 125),"
are apt to feel that they are flying or floating over the world.]
"[Footnote 121: Jewell states that 'certain observers, peculiarly liable"
"to dreams of falling or flying, ascribe these distinctly to faulty"
"circulation, and say their physicians, to regulate the heart's action,"
have given them medicines which always relieve them and prevent such
"dreams' (_American Journal of Psychology_, January 1905, p. 8).]"

of such visions is furnished by Silberer's observations on his own
symbolic hypnagogic visions which are certainly allied to dream visions.
"He found (_Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische Forschungen_, Bd. 1., 1909, p."
"523) that on drawing a deep breath, and so raising the chest wall, the"
agitation which had by that time attained its end. So when Vivie had
come out of prison and had promised to write to all the wardresses
and to meet them some day on non-professional ground; had found
Rossiter waiting for her in his motor and Honoria in hers; had
"thanked them both for their never-to-be-forgotten kindness, and had"
insisted on walking away in her rather creased and rumpled clothes
of the previous year with Bertie Adams; she sought the hospitality
"of Praddy at Hans Place. The parlour-maid received her sumptuously,"
and Praddy's eyes watered with senile tears.
"But Vivie would have no melancholy. ""Oh Praddy! If you only knew."
It's worth going to prison to know the joy of coming out of it! I'm
so happy at thinking this is my last day in England for ever so
"long. When the War is over, I think I shall settle in Switzerland"
"with mother--or perhaps all three of us--you with us, I mean--in"
Italy. We'll only come back here when the Women have got the Vote.
Now to-night you shall take me to the theatre--or rather I'll take
"_you_. I've thought it all out beforehand, and Bertie Adams has"
"secured the seats. It's _The Chocolate Soldier_ at the Adelphi, the"
only war piece they had ready; there are two stalls for us and
Bertie and his wife are going to the Dress Circle. My Cook's ticket
"is taken for Brussels and I leave to-morrow by the Ostende route."""
"""To-morrow"" was the 12th of August, and Dora was not yet in being to"
interpose every possible obstacle in the way of the civilian
"traveller. Down to the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, very"
"little difficulty was made about crossing the Channel, especially"
off the main Dover-Calais route.
So in the radiant noon of that August day Vivie looked her last on
"the brown-white promontories, cliffs and grey castle of Dover,"
"scarcely troubling about any anticipations one way or the other, and"
"Captain Johnson, in his ""Lives of the Pirates,"" when Porter and his friend"
"""addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of Sheba did Solomon, to wit, That"
"having heard of his Fame and Achievements, they had put in there to learn"
"his Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same"
honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his
"Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of"
Necessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity
"and Bluntness of these two Men and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever"
"else they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and"
"at parting, said, he hoped the L---- would Prosper their handy Works."""
"POUND, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"On August 8th, 1689, this pirate, with five men and a boy, sailed out of"
"Boston Harbour as passengers in a small vessel. When off Lovell's Island,"
five other armed men joined them. Pound now seized the craft and took
"command, and declared his intention of going on a piratical cruise. The"
first vessel they met with they decided to take. It was a fishing boat.
"Pound ran his craft alongside, but at the last moment his heart failed"
"him, and he merely bought eight penn'o'th of mackerel from the surprised"
fishermen.
"He then sailed to Falmouth, Maine, where the corporal and soldiers of the"
guard at the fort deserted in the night and sailed off with Pound and his
"crew. Fortified by this addition to his crew, the pirate attacked a sloop,"
"the _Good Speed_, off Cape Cod, and a brigantine, the _Merrimack_, and"
"several other prizes. By this time, the Governor at Boston had heard of"
"Pound's escapades, and sent an armed sloop, the _Mary_, to search for him."
"The pirate was discovered in Tarpaulin Cove, and a fierce and bloody fight"
"took place before the pirates struck their ""Red flagg."" The prisoners were"
"cast into Boston Gaol to await their trial. Pound had been wounded, being"
"Edward Island, and losing his commission, he went to live near Halifax,"
"and became a lieutenant in the Nova Scotia Fencibles, while his wife"
"remained on the island to look after his estates, which brought him in"
"£300 a year. Meeting with a Scotchman called Morrison, together they"
"bought a ""pretty little New York battleship,"" mounting ten guns. Manning"
"this dangerous toy with a crew of ninety desperate characters, the"
"partners went ""on the account,"" and began well by taking a brig belonging"
"to Mr. Hill, of Rotherhithe, which they took to New York, and there sold"
both ship and cargo.
"They next cruised in the West Indies, taking several English and Dutch"
"ships, the crews of which they treated with the greatest brutality."
"Landing on St. Kitts Island, they burnt and plundered two Dutch"
"plantations, murdering the owners and slaves. Sailing north to"
"Newfoundland they took ten more vessels, which they sold in New York."
After further successful voyages in the West Indies and off the coast of
"Brazil, Nelson felt the call of home ties becoming so strong that he"
"ventured to return to Prince Edward Island to visit his wife and family,"
where no one dared to molest him.
"By this time Nelson had been a pirate for three years and had, by his"
"industry, won for himself a fortune worth £150,000, but his Scotch"
"partner, Morrison, being a frugal soul, had in the meantime saved an even"
larger sum. Eventually their ship was wrecked in a fog on a small barren
"island near Prince Edward Island, and Morrison and most of the crew were"
"drowned, but Nelson and a few others were saved. At last he reached New"
"York, where he lived the rest of his life in peaceful happiness with his"
wife and family.

"the unstable progressive stage of popular well-being, though probably"
suffering less from it than either Germany or England.
"Here, then, is a group of kindred peoples apparently at least as capable"
"of reaching a solution of the social problem as any other, and visibly"
prospering materially and morally in proportion as they bring reason to
"bear on the vital lines of conduct, though still in the stage of curing"
over-population by emigration. Given continued peaceful political
"evolution in the direction first of democratic federation, and further"
"of socialisation of wealth, they may reach and keep the front rank in"
"civilisation, while the more unmanageably large communities face risks"
of dire vicissitude.
FOOTNOTES:
"[Footnote 638: As in Carlyle's _Early Kings of Norway_, the _caput"
mortuum_ of his historical method. Much more instructive works on
Scandinavian history are available to the English reader. The two
volumes on _Scandinavia_ by Crichton and Wheaton (1837) are not yet
"superseded, though savouring strongly of the conservatism of their"
"period. Dunham, who rapidly produced, for Gardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia"
"series, histories of _Spain and Portugal_ (5 vols.), _Europe during the"
"Middle Ages_ (4 vols.), and the _Germanic Empire_ (3 vols.), compiled"
"also one of _Denmark, Sweden, and Norway_ (3 vols. 1839-40), of inferior"
"quality. But Geijer's _History of Sweden_, one of the standard modern"
"national histories of Europe, is translated into English as far as the"
period of Gustavus Vasa (3 vols. of orig. in one of trans. 1845); and
the competent _History of Denmark_ by C.-F. Allen is available in a
"French translation (Copenhagen, 2 tom. 1878). Otté's _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, is an unpretending and unliterary but well-informed"
"work, which may be used to check Crichton and Wheaton. The more recent"
"work of Mr. R. Nisbet Bain, _Scandinavia: a Political History of"
"grown to piracy, the northern League gave its main strength to trade by"
sea.
Its special interest for us to-day lies in the fact that it was
"ultra-racial, beginning in 1241 in a pact between the free cities of"
"Lübeck and Hamburg,[715] and finally including Wendish, German, Dutch,"
"French, and even Spanish cities, in fluctuating numbers. The motive to"
"union, as it had need be, was one of mercantile gain. Beginning,"
"apparently, by having each its separate authorised _hansa_ or"
"trading-group in foreign cities, the earlier trading-towns of the group,"
perhaps from the measure of co-operation and fraternity thus forced on
"them abroad,[716] saw their advantage in a special league for the common"
good as a monopoly maintained against outsiders; and this being
"extended, the whole League came to bear the generic name."
See Kohlrausch for the theory that contact in foreign cities is the
"probable cause of the policy of union (_History of Germany_, Eng."
"tr., p. 260; cp. Ashley, _Introd. to Economic History_, i, 104,"
"110). As to the origin of the word, see Stubbs, i, 447, _note_. The"
_hans_ or _hansa_ first appears historically in England as a name
"apparently identical with _gild_; and, starting with a _hansa_ or"
"hanse-house of their own, English cities in some cases are found"
"trading through subordinate _hansas_ in other cities, not only of"
Normandy but of England itself. Thus arose the Flemish Hansa or
"""Hansa of London,"" ignored in so many notices of the better-known"
Hanseatic League. Early in the thirteenth century it included a
number of the towns of Flanders engaged in the English wool-trade;
"and later it numbered at one time seventeen towns, including"
"Chalons, Rheims, St. Quentin, Cambray, and Amiens (Ashley, _Introd."

"(née Walcker), distressed and unusually moved at the sad"
"circumstances of Mrs. Warren's death, had called in her uncle the"
Baptist pastor (who also in some unexplained way seemed to hold a
brief for the Salvation Army). He prayed silently by the death-bed
"which, under the circumstances, was more tactful than open"
intercession. He helped greatly over all the formalities of the
"funeral, and he took upon himself the arrangement of the ceremony,"
"so that everything was done decorously, and certainly to the"
"satisfaction of the Belgians, who attended. Such people would be"
"large-minded in religion--you might be Protestant, if you were not"
"Catholic, or you might be Jewish; but a funeral without some outward"
sign of faith and hope would have puzzled and distressed them.
"To Vivie's great surprise, there was a considerable attendance at"
the ceremony. She had expected no more than the company of Minna--an
"unprofessing but real Christian, if ever there were one, and the"
equally Christian if equally hedonist Mme. Trouessart. But there
"came in addition quite a number of shopkeepers from the Rue Royale,"
"the Rues de Schaerbeek, du Marais, de Lione, and de l'Association,"
"with whom Mrs. Warren had dealt in years gone by. ""C'etait une dame"
"_très_ convenable,"" said one purveyor, and the others agreed. ""Elle"
"me paya écus sonnants,"" said another, ""et toujours sans"
"marchander."" There was even present a more distinguished"
acquaintance of the past: a long-retired Commissaire de Police of
the Quartier in which Mrs. Warren's hotel was situated.
"He appeared in the tightly-buttoned frock-coat of civil life, with a"
"minute disc of some civic decoration in his button hole, and an"
incredibly tall chimney-pot hat. He came to render his _respectueux

"Provided also, that where a Ship after being so taken is set forth or"

"after the summer of 1915, she lived very much alone, except that she"
had the Adams children from Marylebone to spend the day with her
occasionally.
"Poor Mrs. Adams, though a valiant worker, was very downcast and"
unhappy. She confided to Mrs. Rossiter that although she dearly
"loved her Bert--""and a better husband I defy you to find""--he never"
"seemed all hers. ""Always so wrapped up in that Miss Warren or 'er"
"cousin the barrister."" And no sooner had war broken out than off he"
"was to France, as a kind of missionary, she believed--the Young"
"Men's Christian Something or other; ""though before the War he didn't"
"seem particular stuck on religion, and it was all she could do to"
get him sometimes to church on a Sunday morning. Oh yes: she got 'er
money all right; and she couldn't say too much of Mr. and Mrs.
"Rossiter's kindness. There was Bert, not doin' a stroke of work for"
"the Professor, and yet his pay going on all the same. Indeed she was"
"putting money by, because Bert was kep' out there, and all found."""
However his two pretty children were some consolation to Mrs.
"Rossiter, whom they considered as a very grand lady and one that was"
lavishly kind.
Mrs. Rossiter tried sometimes in 1915 having working parties in her
house or in the studio; and if she could attract workers gave them
such elaborate lunches and plethoric teas that very little work was
"done, especially as she herself loved a long, aimless gossip about"
the Royal Family or whether Lord Kitchener had ever _really_ been in
"love. Or she tried, since she was a poor worker herself--her only"
jersey and muffler were really finished by her maid--reading aloud
"to the knitters or stitchers, preferably from the works of Miss"
Charlotte Yonge or some similar novelist of a later date. But that
was found to be too disturbing to their sense of the ludicrous. For
"which these occasioned"" (Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. v, ed. cited"
"of _Works_, vol. iv, p. 387). ""It was only tanners, dyers, and"
apostate priests who were Protestants at that day in the
"Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 124). The same conditions would have had"
"similar results in Spain, where many Catholics thought Philip much"
"too religious for his age and station (Motley, p. 76)."
It seems necessary to insist on the elementary fact that it was
Netherlanders who put Protestants to death in the Netherlands; and
that it was Spaniards who were burnt in Spain. In the Middle Ages
"""nowhere was the persecution of heretics more relentless than in"
"the Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 36; cp. p. 132). Grenvelle, most"
"zealous of heresy-hunters, was a Burgundian; Viglius, an even"
"bitterer persecutor, was a Frisian. The statement of Prescott"
"(_Philip II_, Kirk's ed. 1894, p. 149) that the Netherlanders"
"""claimed freedom of thought as their birthright"" is a gratuitous"
"absurdity. As regards, further, the old hallucination of ""race"
"types,"" it has to be noted that Charles, a devout Catholic and"
"persecutor, was emphatically _Teutonic_, according to the"
established canons. His stock was Burgundo-Austrian on the father's
side; his Spanish mother was of Teutonic descent; he had the fair
"hair, blue eyes, and hanging jaw and lip of the Teutonic Hapsburgs"
"(see Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, cap. 341), and so had his"
"descendants after him. On the other hand, William the Silent was"
"markedly ""Spanish"" in his physiognomy (Motley, p. 56), and his"
reticence would in all ages pass for a Spanish rather than a
"""Teutonic"" characteristic. Motley is reduced to such shifts of"
"rhetoric concerning Philip II as the proposition (p. 75) that ""the"
Burgundian and Austrian elements of his blood seemed to have
"evaporated."" But his descendant, Philip IV, as seen in the great"
"portraits of Velasquez, is, like him, a ""typical"" Teuton; and the"
"stock preserved the Teutonic physiological tendency to gluttony, a"
"Morgan was essentially a man of action, and a regular life on shore proved"
"irksome to him, for we learn from a report sent home by Lord Vaughan in"
"1674 that Morgan ""frequented the taverns of Port Royal, drinking and"
"gambling in unseemly fashion,"" but nevertheless the Jamaican Assembly had"
voted the Lieutenant-Governor a sum of £600 special salary. In 1676
Vaughan brought definite charges against Morgan and another member of the
"Council, Robert Byndloss, of giving aid to certain Jamaica pirates."
"Morgan made a spirited defence and, no doubt largely owing to his"
"popularity, got off, and in 1678 was granted a commission to be a captain"
of a company of 100 men.
"The Governor to succeed Vaughan was Lord Carlisle, who seems to have liked"
"Morgan, in spite of his jovial ""goings on"" with his old buccaneer friends"
"in the taverns of Port Royal, and in some of his letters speaks of"
"Morgan's ""generous manner,"" and hints that whatever allowances are made to"
"him ""he will be a beggar."""
"In 1681 Sir Thomas Lynch was appointed to be Governor, and trouble at once"
began between him and his deputy. Amongst the charges the former brought
"against Morgan was one of his having been overheard to say, ""God damn the"
"Assembly!"" for which he was suspended from that body."
"In April, 1688, the King, at the urgent request of the Duke of Albemarle,"
"ordered Morgan to be reinstated in the Assembly, but Morgan did not live"
"long to enjoy his restored honours, for he died on August 25th, 1688."
"An extract from the journal of Captain Lawrence Wright, commander of"
"H.M.S. _Assistance_, dated August, 1688, describes the ceremonies held at"
"Port Royal at the burial of Morgan, and shows how important and popular a"
man he was thought to be. It runs:
"1915; H. Wildon Carr, _The Philosophy of B. Croce_, London, 1917. The"
"first is an able, but very cursory sketch; the second examines Croce's"
philosophy from the standpoint of neoscholasticism; the third is an
ample summary written by a distinguished writer well acquainted with
the various currents of modern thought. Each of them ought to be read
with a critical and discriminating eye.
"In the English-speaking world, Croce's fame rests emphatically on his"
"Ã¦sthetics, and its applications to literary criticism. His influence"
on English and American critical thought has already gone much deeper
than a mere list of writings on his theories would show; especially in
"England, his ideas are, so to speak, in the air, and appear in many"
writers who have no direct knowledge of his work. The best exposition
of this phase of his philosophy is to be found in E. F. Carritt's
"book, _The Theory of Beauty_, 1914, chap. XIV. The writings of A. B."
"Walkley, and of J. E. Spingam, contain the most vigorous prosecution"
"of his thought as applied, respectively, to English and to American"
scholarship and criticism.
"For the general history of Italian thought, to which many a reference"
"is made in the course of this book, the best helps, besides Croce's"
"essay on Vico, and B. Spaventa, _La filosofia italiana_, recently"
"reprinted, Bari, 1909, are the historical works of Giovanni Gentile,"
"and especially his _Storia della filosofia italiana_, Milano, n."
d. Gentile is one of the most profound and earnest modern European
"thinkers, and it is desirable that his theoretical works, similar in"
"tendency to, but widely divergent in temper from those of Croce, should"
"become better known to the Anglo-Saxon world. Two of his books, _La"
"Riforma dell' Educazione_ and _Teoria generale dello Spirito_, are soon"
to appear in English. Croce's judgment on Gentile's Actual Idealism is
"expressed in _Una discussione tra filosofi amici_, in _Conversazioni"
"Critiche_, II, pp. 67-95. But a complete understanding of the vital"
"foundling hospitals, apparently), in 1890 the total Swedish rate was"
"slightly below 1 to 10, while in Norway it was 1 to 14. The modern"
facilities for emigration have further affected conjugal habits.
"Latterly, however, there are evidences of a new growth of intelligent"
control.
In recent years the statistics of emigration and population tell a
fairly plain story. In Norway and Sweden alike the excess of births over
"deaths reached nearly its highest in 1887, the figures being 63,942 for"
"Sweden and 29,233 for Norway. In 1887, however, emigration was about its"
"maximum in both countries, 50,786 leaving Sweden and 20,706 leaving"
"Norway. Thereafter the birth-rate rapidly fell, and the emigration,"
"though fluctuating, has never again risen in Sweden to the volume of"
"1887-88, though it has in Norway. But when, after falling to 43,728 in"
"1892, the excess of Swedish births over deaths rises to 60,231 in 1895,"
"while the emigration falls from 45,000 in 1892 to 13,000 in 1894, it is"
clear that the lesson of regulation is still very imperfectly learned.
"Norway shows the same fluctuations, the excess of births rising from"
"23,600 in 1892 to nearly 32,000 in 1896, and again from 27,685 in 1908"
"to 29,804 in 1909, doubtless because of ups and downs in the harvests,"
"as shown in the increase of marriages from 12,742 in 1892 to 13,962 in"
1896.
In Denmark the progression has been similar. There the excess of births
"over deaths was so far at its maximum in 1886, the figures being 29,986"
"in a population of a little over 2,000,000; whereafter they slowly"
"decreased, till in 1893 the excess was only 26,235. All the while"
"emigration was active, gradually rising from 4,346 in 1885 to 10,382 in"
"1891; then again falling to 2,876 in 1896, when the surplus of births"
"over deaths was 34,181--a development sure to force more emigration. In"
"1911 the population was 2,775,076--a rapid rise; and in 1910 the surplus"
"of births over deaths was 40,110. The Scandinavians are thus still in"
"their independence (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 375, 376; Geijer, pp."
"50, 81, 89, 97, 103), so that they ultimately enabled Gustavus Vasa"
to throw off the Danish yoke. Yet they had at first refused to
"recognise him, being satisfied with their own liberties; and"
"afterwards they gave him much serious trouble (Otté, _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, pp. 228, 235; Geijer, pp. 109, 112, 115, 116, 118,"
"120-24). Slavery, too, was definitely abolished in Sweden as early"
"as 1335 (Geijer, pp. 57, 86; Crichton and Wheaton, i, 316, 333). As"
"regards the regal power, the once dominant theory that the Swedish"
"kings in the thirteenth century obtained a grant of all the mines,"
"and of the province of the four great lakes (Crichton and Wheaton,"
"i, 332), appears to be an entire delusion (Geijer, pp. 51, 52)."
Such claims were first enforced by Gustavus Vasa (_id._ p. 129). As
"regards the clergy, they appear from the first, _quâ_ churchmen, to"
"have been kept in check by the nobles, who kept the great Church"
"offices largely in the hands of their own order (Geijer, p. 109),"
though Magnus Ladulas strove to strengthen the Church in his own
interest (_id._ pp. 52-53). Thus the nobles became specially
"powerful (_id._ pp. 50, 56, 108); and when in the fifteenth century"
"Sweden was subject to Denmark, they specially resented the"
"sacerdotal tyranny (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 356)."
"In Sweden, as in the other Scandinavian States, however, physical strife"
and mental stagnation were the ruling conditions. Down till the
"sixteenth century her history is pronounced ""a wretched detail of civil"
"wars, insurrections, and revolutions, arising principally from the"
"jealousies subsisting between the kings and the people, the one striving"
"to augment their power, the other to maintain their independence.""[670]"
"The same may be said of the sister kingdoms, all alike being torn and"
drained by innumerable strifes of faction and wars with each other. The
occasional forcible and dynastic unions of crowns came to nothing; and
"the Union of Calmar (1397), an attempt to confederate the three kingdoms"
"Beatae Mariae Virginis_"" among the many relics to be seen in the"
"Church of SS. Cosmo and Damiano, near the Forum."
[Sidenote: No Women Admitted.]
It is a curious illustration of Romish wrong-headedness that women
"are never allowed to enter the Chapel of St. Helena, in the Church"
"of S. Croce, except on the festival of the Saint, August 18th,"
"notwithstanding the fact that St. Helena herself was a woman, and that"
the church owes its existence to her and is also indebted to her for
"the piece of the true cross which it boasts, and which has given it its"
"name. So while men are permitted to go inside the chapel of St. Helena,"
women are stopped at the entrance and only allowed to peer through the
railing. The same degrading discrimination is made in the Church of S.
"Prassede (who also was a woman) as to entering the splendid chapel,"
"Orto del Paradiso, which contains the column of blood jasper to which"
"Christ was bound, and which was ""given by the Saracens to Giovanni"
"Colonna, cardinal of this church, and legate of the Crusade, because"
"when he had fallen into their hands and was about to be put to death,"
"he was rescued by a marvellous intervention of celestial light."""
Females are never allowed to enter this chapel except upon Sundays in
"Lent, but are permitted to look at the relic through a grating.[12]"
[Sidenote: Four Other Stones of Great Interest.]
The mention of this column reminds me of the two columns in the Church
"of S. Maria Transpontina, on the other side of the Tiber, near St."
"Peter's, which bear inscriptions stating that they were the pillars to"
"which St. Peter and St. Paul were fastened, respectively, when they"
suffered flagellation by order of Nero. A little farther on towards
"St. Peter's is the Piazza Scossa Cavalli, with a pretty fountain."
"""Its name bears witness to a curious legend, which tells how when S."
"lock the Pope into his chamber, and take the key with her!"" She finally"
"""deserted him on his death-bed, making off with the accumulated spoils"
"of his ten years' papacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to build"
"the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, in the Corso, and the beautiful Villa Doria"
"Pamfili,"" west of the Janiculan Hill. This villa, with its casino,"
"garden, lake, fountain, pine-shaded lawns and woods, and its fine view"
"of St. Peter's standing out against the green Campagna beyond, and"
"the blue Sabine mountains in the distance, is to this day one of the"
"loveliest villas in Italy, and the favorite resort of the latter-day"
Romans and visitors to their city on the two afternoons of the week on
which it is open to pedestrians and two-horse carriages.
"The notorious Simony practiced by the popes, in which, as we have just"
"seen, Olympia became such an adept, gave rise to the biting Latin"
couplet--
"""An Petrus Romæ fuerit, sub judice lis est;"
"Simonem Romæ nemo fuisse negat."""
Some of the modern methods of making use of the Pope for purposes
of gain are less objectionable than those of Olympia. Dr. Alexander
"Robertson, in his _Roman Catholic Church in Italy_, just published,"
"says: ""One of the very latest novelties of the 'Pope's Shop' is a"
penny-in-the-slot blessing machine. Specimens of this were lately to be
"seen in the Corso, Rome, about half way between the Piazza Colonna and"
"the Piazza del Popolo. A penny is dropped into it. The cinematograph,"
"or wheel of life, goes round, when, lo! there appears a long procession"
"of richly clothed cardinals and monsignori, and then the Pope in a"
"sedan chair, accompanied by his Swiss Guards. As he is carried past"
"the spectator, he turns towards the window of his chair, a smile"
"overspreads his face, he raises his hands, and gives his blessing. On"
these machines there is an inscription to the effect that the blessing
and _Political Maxims of the State of Holland_ (really written by De
"Witt's friend, Pierre Delacourt; De Witt, however, contributing two"
"chapters), and much attention was given to it here and on the Continent."
In addition to the many and copious histories written in the eighteenth
"century in Dutch, three or four voluminous and competent histories of"
"the Low Countries were written in French--_e.g._, those of Dujardin"
"(1757, etc., 8 vols. 4to), Cerisier (1777, etc., 10 vols. 12mo), Le"
"Clerc (1723-28, 3 vols. folio), Wicquefort (1719, folio, proceeding from"
"Peace of Münster). Of late years, though the lesson is as important as"
"ever, it appears to be less generally attended to. In our own country,"
"however, have appeared Davies' _History of Holland_ (1841, 3 vols.), a"
"careful but not often an illuminating work, which oddly begins with the"
"statement that ""there is scarcely any nation whose history has been so"
"little understood or so generally neglected as that of Holland""; T."
"Colley Grattan's earlier and shorter book (_The Netherlands_, 1830),"
which is still worth reading for a general view based on adequate
"learning; and the much better known works of Motley, _The Rise of the"
Dutch Republic_ (1856) and the _History of the United Netherlands_
"(1861-68), which deal minutely with only a period of fifty-five years of"
"Dutch history, and of which, as of the work of Davies, the sociological"
value is much below the annalistic. All three are impaired as literature
by their stale rhetoric. The same malady infects the second volume of
"the _Industrial History of the Free Nations_ (1846), by W. Torrens"
"M'Cullagh (afterwards M'Cullagh Torrens); but this, which deals with"
"Holland, is the better section of that treatise, and it gives distinct"
"help to a scientific conception of the process of Dutch history, as does"
"J.R. M'Culloch's _Essay on the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Commerce"
"in Holland_, which is one of the best of his _Essays and Treatises_ (2nd"
ed. 1859). The _Holland_ of the late Professor Thorold Rogers has merit
"as a vivacious conspectus, but hardly rises to the opportunity."
"Of the many French, Belgian, and German works on special periods of the"
Spanish Governor has never been decided. After three weeks the buccaneers
"started back on their journey to San Lorenzo, with a troop of 200"
"pack-mules laden with gold, silver, and goods of all sorts, together with"
a large number of prisoners. The rearguard on the march was under the
"command of a kinsman of the Admiral, Colonel Bledry Morgan."
"On their arrival at Chagres the spoils were divided, amidst a great deal"
"of quarrelling, and in March, 1671, Morgan sailed off to Port Royal with a"
"few friends and the greater part of the plunder, leaving his faithful"
"followers behind without ships or provisions, and with but £10 apiece as"
their share of the spoils.
"On May 31st, 1671, the Council of Jamaica passed a vote of thanks to"
"Morgan for his successful expedition, and this in spite of the fact that"
"in July, a year before, a treaty had been concluded at Madrid between"
"Spain and England for ""restraining depredations and establishing peace"" in"
the New World.
"In April, 1672, Morgan was carried to England as a prisoner in the"
"_Welcome_ frigate. But he was too popular to be convicted, and after being"
"acquitted was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica, and in November, 1674,"
he was knighted and returned to the West Indies. In 1672 Major-General
"Banister, who was Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Jamaica, writing to"
"Lord Arlington about Morgan, said: ""He (Morgan) is a well deserving"
"person, and one of great courage and conduct, who may, with His Majesty's"
"pleasure, perform good public service at home, or be very advantageous to"
"this island if war should again break forth with the Spaniards."""
While Morgan was in England he brought an action for libel against William
"Crooke, the publisher of the ""History of the Bucaniers of America."" The"
result of this trial was that Crooke paid £200 damages to Morgan and
published a long and grovelling apology.
and gone himself with their beautiful new motor--whatever _could_
"the chauffeur have thought?--to meet her at the prison gates,"
"_there_ he was, afterwards, worrying himself over the War: not"
"content as she was, as most of her friends were, as the newspapers"
"were, to leave it all to Lord Kitchener and Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward"
"Grey, and even Mr. Lloyd George--though the latter had made some"
"rather foolish and exaggerated speeches about Alcohol. Michael, if"
"he went on like this, would _never_ get his knighthood!"
"Then when Michael had at last, thanks to General Armstrong, found"
his right place and was accomplishing marvels--the papers said--as a
"""mender of the maimed""--here was she left alone in Portland Place"
"with hardly any one to speak to, and all her acquaintances--she now"
realized they were scarcely her friends--too much occupied with war
work to spend an afternoon in discussing nothing very important over
"a sumptuous tea, still served by a butler and footman."
"Presently, too, the butler left to join the Professor in France and"
"the footman enlisted, and the tea had to be served by a _distraite_"
"parlour-maid, with her eye on a munitions factory--so that she"
"might be ""in it""--and her heart in the keeping of the footman, who,"
"since he had gone into khaki, was irresistible."
"Mrs. Rossiter of course said, in 1914, that she would take up war"
work. She subscribed most handsomely to the Soldiers' and Sailors'
"Families' Association, to the Red Cross, to the Prince of Wales's"
Fund (one of the unsolved war-time mysteries ... what's become of
"it?), to the Cigarette Fund, the 1914 Christmas Plum Pudding Fund,"
"the Blue Cross, the Purple Cross, the Green Cross funds; to the"
outstandingly good work at St. Dunstan's and at Petersham--(I am
glad she gave a Hundred pounds each to _them_); and to the

"A complete bibliography, cataloguing the whole of Croce's multifarious"
"activity, is outside the scope of this note. The nearest approach to it"
"can be found in G. Castellano's _Introduzione alle opere di B. Croce_,"
"Bari, 1920, which contains, besides, a full list of translations in"
"eight languages, a bibliography of the Italian and foreign critical"
"literature on Croce, and a very useful series of abstracts of"
discussions and judgments on Croce's work.
Besides articles and essays in American and English magazines and
"reviews, the following works of Croce have been translated into"
"English: the four volumes of the _Filosofia dello Spirito_, the essay"
"on Hegel, the _Essence of Ãsthetics_, and the essays on _Ariosto,"
"Shakespeare, and Corneille_, by Douglas Ainslie; the essay on Vico, by"
"R. G. Collingwood, and the essays on Historical Materialism, by C. M."
Meredith. But the English or American student of Croce ought to rely
as little as possible on translations; the reading of the Italian text
"will be found comparatively easy, on the basis of a good acquaintance"
with Latin or with French. The labour entailed by the surmounting
of the first difficulties will be largely repaid by the advantages
"gained in coming into direct contact with Croce's thought, and by the"
acquisition of at least a reading knowledge of Italian.
"For the vast critical literature on Croce, scattered through the"
literary and philosophical reviews of Europe and of America during
"the last twenty years, we are compelled again to refer the reader to"
Castellano's book. We shall only mark out Croce's own autobiographical

"As a result of researches in the field of Babylonian-Assyrian divination,"
"now extending over a number of years[1], it may be definitely said that"
"apart from the large class of miscellaneous omens[2], the Babylonians and"
Assyrians developed chiefly three methods of divination into more or less
elaborate systems--divination through the inspection of the liver of a

"indeed, when recalled _at once_, with closed eyes and before moving,"
they were nearly devoid of intellectual content (_Journal of Comparative
"Neurology_, vol. iii. p. 17, 1893). R. MacDougall considers that dreaming"
is 'a succession of intense states of feeling supported by a minimum of
"ideational content,' or, as he says again, more accurately, 'the feeling"
is primary; the idea-content is the inferred thing' (_Psychological
"Review_, vol. v. p. 2). Grace Andrews, who kept a record of her dreams"
"(_American Journal of Psychology_, October 1900), found that dream"

dream emotion seems to me the most real element of the dream life.' P.

"operation which translates to the sleeper's consciousness, while he is"
"asleep, this cœnæsthesia or emotional state is what we call a dream.']"

abounds. That I have escaped them altogether is not to be imagined;

Go!
Whoa!
Wait!
Who's Frank?
Mater!
"Wait, Mater!"
"OK, here's what you do."

Come on.
Come on.
There's no one up here.

Wanna have some fun?
Wanna be safe out there?

What's wrong?
What is it?
Father?
You're convinced that it's genuine?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Go on.
"So Ari keeps saying, ""Don't worry."
"They don't put innocent people in jail. """
"Well, he was obviously wrong because they do."
- What are you looking at?
- I don't quite picture you as a clown.
- So you don't believe me.
- I didn't say that.
They're here!
That's them!

Yeah?
He has been expelled again.
This time for smoking.
-How silly it is possible to be?
-It was not me.
"There were many of us, and ..."
It's complicated.
Complicated?
"Either you have made it, or you have not done it."
You are a fucking jerk.

You have house arrest.
-Drag to hell.

He's 16.
It's just a phase.
-You're home early.
-Yes.
-What is it?
-Nothing.

I must return to the office.
Can it wait?
No.
This has waited too long.
No.
"Leong, you always trust my instincts."
- Yes?
- Chef says you must continue to go to the therapist.
I was waiting for 1 hour.
I think o. ..
John ...?
Hello?
Doctor?
Doctor?
Maybe I should not up.
God knows what you did.
Doctor ...
John?
!
John!
- What?

- Are you insane?
"Is He sold the house, John?"
Why are you still living there?
This will bring them back.
"That night I must have died, the doctor."
Well ... not dead.
You see?
...
"I can not escape anything, doctor."
You were right.
I certainly am.
"Yes, ladies!"
This is a very definite ...
"We're fine, right?"
I'm still here.
In this absurdity.
Yeah.
Ido San.
Ow!
That hurts.
Sorry.
Thanks for everything.
"Such a shame, you're still popular."
You could keep making money.
What's this?
The pizza that the porn crew ordered.
Why didn't you deliver it?
It'll get cold.
Can't abandon the front desk.
What room?
211.
I brought your pizza.
Come in.
Coming in.
You like moustaches?
Moustaches?
They're okay.
It'll be fine.
Where should I put the pizza?
Just right there.
Sure.
"The AD will pay you, so hang on."
Sure.
Miyu?
What're you doing here?
Come here.
"Hey, wait, stop!"
Who are you?
I thought I just went to bed.
Yeah.
"Hey, what are we doing, scene 61 ?"
Okay.
"Oh, just remind Flo about that blue belt, huh?"
All right.
"Yeah, I'll see you."
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking.
I can't get to sleep.
"Oh, honey."
Goddamn it.
Jesus.
There's nothing.
"Oh, Karl."
"Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that."
"Very sorry, but you see, no rats."
No rats.
Thanks a lot.
That's terrific.
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
Unroll your fist.
Arm up.
Very good.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Remain perfectly still.
Breathe normally.
Tell me if you feel a vibration.
Regan?
You feel anything?
Can you feel this?
In Brussels.
This is your house?
Where is your house?
In Sofia.
- Sofia?
"Yes, we are Sofia."
This means we are in this region.
We shot here somewhere.
I see.
"We are headed there, we are not far from the Serbian border."
Mr. Lloyd?
Mr. Lloyd?
It looks like we're with a jury.
- A jury?
Yes.
A jury for yogurt.
Now we have to go.
Now we have to go.
"Sorry,  but..."
Ok.
"Okay, okay."
Ok.
No problem.
- Thanks for everything...
It was really nice.
- No problem.
Do not worry.
"- No, no."
Be happy.
You have our support.
"Farewell to all, ladies and gentlemen."
- Thanks for everything.
You do not put my daughter in danger!
EMMA:
Stop!
(GRUNTS)
Emma!
Oh.
You okay?
Two earthquakes and a jump from a beanstalk.
I think my brain is still rattling around a little.
I did what you ordered.
Nothing more than that.
- Did you get it?
- EMMA:
Yep.
Where...
Where's Hook?
He's detained.
"Let's go, get your stuff."
We got 10 hours before he follows us.
SNOW:
What?
How?
I got a friend looking after him till then.
(PANTING)
You told her to cut it down?
Yes.
I couldn't risk...
We go back together.
That is the only way.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Are... are you okay?
Are you okay?
Dad!
"Hey, baby."
It's me.
I...
There's something strange going on in here.
There's a zoo in your fridge.
You okay?
"No, I think I ate something bad."
So I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get out of here.
This is to be continued.
Bye.
Peter.
He's going.
"He can still hear you, if you have anything you'd like to say to him."
Dad.
I love you.
But what about Jackson?
I don't want to leave him.
He'll be fine.
"Come on, Arthur."
It's time.
Wow.
- Who is this?
- It's Owen.
Arthur just passed.
Knew you'd want to know.
It was very peaceful.
His son was with him.
"Oh, thank you."
Yeah.
(♪ CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You're late.
- Yeah.
- It's OK.
- Yeah.
You lost?
Goddamn it.
"Well, at least there's one pinball player in the family."
(LAUGHS)
- That's a triple take.
- Yeah?
Is that with the spin?
You do that...
"Wait, let me try."
- You missed mine.
- Let me see it again.
I was...
We were both double-taking at the same time.
"Hey, that was three."
That was pretty good.
That was good.
Erm...
What do you get if you cut a bra in half?
- (CHUCKLES) What?
- A yarmulke with a chin strap.
- MAN:
"Can you guys keep it down, please?"
- What?
Can you please keep it down?
I think it'd be a neat idea.
"- Stand up, Josh."
- OK.
- I'm gonna show you how to take a punch.
- I know how to take a punch.
I'm gonna show you the right way to take a punch.
"OK, hit me."
- Where?
- Right in my stomach.
"Hit me as hard as you can, just at my stomach."
That wasn't as hard as I can.
I know.
I hope not.
Hit me again.
Harder.
Seriously.
"- Yeah, OK."
- Go.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Harder?
- Go.
Harder.
I'm fine.
"What I did was essentially, breathing is key."
"- Think of it as, like..."
- Just hit me.
"- All right, you ready?"
OK.
- Yeah.
One...
Two...
"Well, I think I'll be off."
Why?
"I don't confuse you, do I, lvy?"
"I believe I do confuse you, don't I?"
I ain't confused by nobody.
Let go.
Do you hear?
Let go.
"Let go, you hear?"
"- What's he doing, lvy?"
"- Oh, you let go too!"
"Watch out, lvy love."
"- Here, here."
What's this all about?
- It's him.
He insulted her.
"- He's lying, I tell you!"
- He tried to break her arm.
"- He did, did he?"
"- Yes, yes."
Tried to break her arm.
You will?
You want another one?
No!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"I'll stop it, sir."
"Hey, boys!"
"Now, boys!"
"Boys, will you...?"
I can't understand what happened.
Changed my name.
I never told her where I went.
I never saw her again.
I...
I reinvented myself.
But it didn't matter.
"No matter what I did,"
I chose
Angela.
Angela.
Like a name would protect me.
"That I dreamed I could have a life, a chance."
Didn't matter.
It wasn't done with me.
"It's coming for me, Father, I know it."
_
My name is Regan MacNeil.
I'm Chris MacNeil.
I've come to see my daughter.
I don't want to go.
Go home.
You know the way.
I don't want to go.
You'll be fine.
"Trust me, just go."
"You're too young to come, Jesse."
You won't even like it.
*Jesse:
Mark!
*
Just go!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
"- Jimmy, over here!"
- Hey!
"- Hey, Tillie."
- Dammit!
- Did he see us?
Is he coming back?
- Forget it.
- What's up?
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
- I didn't expect this to happen.
"- Yeah, sure!"
We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.
"Now, let's move."
- Come on!
- I can't move.
- What?
- I can't move.
"All right, let me look."
It's probably broken.
Great!
"- Here, take one of these."
- What is it?
- A pain pill.
- I don't want it.
- Shut up and take it.
- I don't want it!
Now I'll have to think of something else.
We're going to lower you down.
She is going to Mumbai.
Party is fine.
But till 2 o'clock?
Her lifestyle here is such.
What will she do in Mumbai?
I worry when I think about it.
Her friend Pia has found her a job.
In a fashion house.
She will be busy in Mumbai.
I don't think so.
"Well, she is our daughter."
She will make us proud.
And keep your diary with you.
It pricks me the whole night.
Shobha.
"Mother, catch."
"- Oh, God."
Gul.
Stop it.
Shobha.

Coming.
Sit.
"Gul, how many clothes will you take?"
Yes.

Mother and daughter's meeting is over?
- Yes.
It's over.
Gul.
Last night you returned home very late.
I didn't like that.
I saved my job.
That's good.
But how?
"Well, last night I showed my work."
I will be promoted soon.
Congratulations.
So today's dinner is your treat.
Okay?
Done.
Tell Carol as well.
Cool.
How did you come here?
"Wow, Carol!"

I also feel like doing something.
Shall I go for a shoulder massage?
Very funny.
Go out.
We will meet for dinner.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We will meet for dinner.

WILBUR:
Easy!
One moment.
Stop this thing.
"Voila, we stop."
"Good, oui?"
And now to get you down.
Just one moment.
"One moment, monsieur."
"Monsieur, one moment."
(SIGHS)
And now for the landing.
(GASPING)
"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Let me go!
Let me go!
"There we are, monsieur."
You are next.
Shampoo?
You're a sick man.
That's it!
"I've got the merchandise all right, but I can't deliver it."
They're checking everyone in and out of the hotel.
What are you going to do with him?
"What do you mean, ""do with him""?"
He can't stay here forever.
No.
"When he's recovered, that's for him to decide."
"You look a little flushed, dear."
Do I?
Perhaps you should get some fresh air.
"Well, when it's a little cooler, I will."
"Well, it's time for my rest, I think."
I'll look in on the patient.
Hello.
Hello.
I've had an idea.
"Now, look."
"I say the word, and you repeat it after me."
You understand?
Never mind.
You'll soon catch on.

How are you?
I just woke up.
I didn't call you.
Excuse me?
- I didn't call you.
How are we in contact?
It's normal.
Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.
Doctor Sorensen!
Mr Thomas.
Hello.
I imagine you don't recognize me.
- Yes...
Straight ahead.
Good night!
"Come on, we can't stay herei."
- He says that...
- What does he say?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Jimmy, you can't come here."
Never.
My father...
the war... he's sick.
I brought this for him.
- I see.
- Yes.
"- Pretty, isn't it?"
- Yes.
"But put it away, I can't take it."
My father musn't know.
I have to go.
I need to drop it off.
Wait.
"No, wait, listen..."
"I wanted to say, Jimmy, that I'm very happy when I'm with you."
- But I have to go.
- Wait.
What a lovely butt.
So firm.
It's marvellous.
"It's lovely, very love."
Come!
"Come, yes, like that."
Or for whoever's controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...

"Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
"Hey, Scott!"
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.
Hello?
Over here.
Here we go.
Hey.
"Yeah, baby."

[ Chattering ]
"- Easy, easy."
- I got it.
Let's get him up.
"- Dick, where's the ticket?"
- [ Moans ]
- Answer me.
- He can't.
He's been sedated.
Why did you do that?
"Or, cut off his head, or..."
Crush the skull.
Okay.
Ah...
"Blair, I'm like 99 percent sure he's dead."
Just get it over with.
Just...
Whack his head as hard as you can.
Get a good grip.

Everything's gonna be just fine.

"Circulate, all right."
Enjoy yourselves.

"Oh, easy!"
Excuse me.
"~ Right, I'm just going to say a few words."
~ Really?
"All right, everyone."
Gather round.

"- Hey, Tommy."
That's my partner.
My flesh and blood!
Come on down.
You're scaring everybody.

Don't lick me with that fish breath.
"Hey, Hardy."
RIVER RESCUE
He's still on the sauce.
He'll be sleeping it off somewhere.
He's a fifth generation cop.
He'll show.
Yeah?
Here.
Why do you still go home?
What have you been doing?
Sleeping.
Reading.
Waiting.
What for?
You taste of sleep.
You taste of car.
New car?
- Want to take a look?
- Later.
- Wait... the car.
- Later.
Are you driving?
Are you kidding?
I'm drunk.
"Well, then you've got a long way to go."
What's wrong?
"I want to come, too."
Don't start that again.
I'm frightened.
Why?
In case she doesn't come back.
Listen.
Lizzy will get well again.
That's why I'm taking her to the vet.
Anyone there?
Come on.
Just one more hour.
I can tell you're still tired.
Luis to Dad.
How did he do today?
I hear you can handle yourself.
I guess.
Good night.
"Uh, excuse me."
Why me?
I like to think I see things in people.
Slow down.
The car is not going anywhere.
Mom.
"Hey, sweetheart."
Hi.
Hey.
Whoo.
Ah.
There you go.
Did you see what's in the driveway?
"Uh, yeah, I saw."
Hey.
"So that's yours, huh?"
Yeah.
Dad got it for me.
That was very nice of him.
Yeah.
I-
"- I know it looks like... well, awesome, but it's super safe."
Dad-
- Dad made sure.
"And I promise to always go the speed limit or below, way below."
And it gets great gas mileage.
So Dad said I can take it around the block a few times.
That okay?
Look at you!
And the other students?
Haven't seen them since the dojo closed.
Watch it!
We've grown up.
It must be hard for you.
Look what happened to Iwai.
Stay in touch.
Where do you want this?
Over there.
hello.
Ni Hao.
Fried rice please.
It's a busy day!
Better than playing soccer.
You're right.
Teacher!
Teacher?
What teacher?
Teacher!
I know you're here.
You can't go in there.
Fried rice!
The soup's coming!
It's Rin!
Welcome back!
Teacher!
"Teacher, the dojo?"
Did you go?
It's in ruins.
What happened?
You must be starving!
That's not enough.
But it's the same thing...
For me.
It's quite something.
You have to go outside.
- I couldn't.
Yes.
You can.
- No.
I'm sure you can.
OK.
Where is your apartment?
Defosset Street.
Near the Luxembourg Center.
Are you coming?
You remember the park.
near the old station?
On the right from Defosset Street.
I'll be waiting on a bench.
No.
I couldn't.
- I'm leaving.
Eva.
I couldn't.
- Do you love me?
And you?
If you can't go out for me.
I won't even ask myself.
You said there was a bond between us.
We'll see.
I'm leaving.
"Hello, welcome to my home."
"You are that Police Officer, right?"
"You too are here, madam?"
Carry on!
"Ria, you try out this dress."
This is not good.
- This is first gift I gave you.
Fine!
So sweet!
"What is this shirt, so bad?"
Try this one.
"- Call from David master, I need to go."
Try this first.
- Please sister...
Try this and leave.
Excuse me..
Please open the door..
Thank you..
Can I go now?
How is this?
- Super!
Awesome!
What is this lady?
- Is it your mom?
Hello Aunty!
This girl..
- Sister?
Hi..
Has the entire family come?
Where is uncle?
"He had piles operation, right?"
Has he recovered?
Shit!
That's all right.
- Did I hurt you?
"- No, you didn't spill a drop."
- I guess...
- That's funny?
I guess it's funny.
Do you think we could turn the TV off?
That's better.
- We have to relax.
- I agree.
- How are classes?
- Going well.
- And your book?
- The outline is actually...
It's coming along.
It's almost there.
It's not at all what I expected.
It's harder than I thought.
But I'll...
I'm sure that I'll get there.
I want you to get there.
What did you say?
- Rose.
- Talk to me.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Rose."
"- No, no, no."
"- Yes, yes, yes."
I don't want to do this!
"I'm sorry, Rose."
- Say yes to me.
Come here.
- Yeah.
All right.
Here we go.
"- Hey, hey!"
I couldn't find it.
- Come here.
What?
I couldn't find a phone.
I couldn't find a phone anywhere.
I couldn't find a phone.
Come here.
Come on.
"All right, listen."
"You go in there, and you find a phone."
"You call 911, and you stay here till help gets here."
You understand?
Go!
Let's go!
You all right?
"Hey, hey!"
"Hey, buddy!"
- I sang it four times.
- I knew you could do it.
"Hey, stay awake!"
You gotta stay awake for me.

Just keep calm.
(CRAWFORD GAGGING)
"Fine, Clare!"
What do you need?
(STAMMERING) Okay...
I need something sharp...
"To stab into his chest, to release the pressure."
That's right.
I have a knife.
That's no good.
A valve...
I need a valve.
Got a pen.
In my back pocket.
"Yes, a pen!"
A pen will work!
Here...
Okay?
"Yes, perfect."
"Um, take that part out of it, and then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right.
I've got you.
I've got you.
Are you good?
All right.
All right.
(YELLING)
(YELLING IN ARABIC)
"Keep breathing for me, all right?"
Holy crap.
That was...
Holy crap!
"All right, that bought us some time."
"But they'll be back, and there'll be more of them."
And it won't be near as easy next time.
Easy?
You thought that was easy?
Jake.
Dad?
Clear the table!
Clear it!
Clear it!
I'm gonna go get Kenchy.
Get my mom!
We'll need towels.
And some antiseptic and some alcohol.
We need alcohol.
Get a towel!
Get me some alcohol!
Here we go.
Give me that.
Come on.
"Okay, all right."
Jake?
Keep the pressure on.
What?
Keep it on!
Keep the pressure.
"Hey, Jake, come in."
Hawkins.
"Hey, nice work out there."
I'll never get used to that name.
It took a lot of courage to do what you did at the hearing.
Maybe we can talk.
Call me.
Bye.
"Yes, Bob, I know you're hungry."
You're always hungry.
Go catch a rat.
Let's see what our friends the coastguard have for us.
Let's see.
Nothing up there but cabins.
Jesus Christ!
"Bob, will you get that..."
This is Hardy here.
Go.
Jo!
Kim Lee!
No!
"Oh, God!"
It stops now!
"Hands high, Danny."
Where's the girl?
I know everything.
- I got your note.
- What note?
Jesus Christ!
The key to Detillo's conviction was the testimony of Thomas Hardy.
Surprised?
"Hello, Jimmy."
I got you.
"I got you good, didn't I?"
Admit it.
Pass it on.
MAN 4:
"Hey, vato, pass that wire."
MAN 5:
Just a minute.
Pinche mayate.
MAN 4:
"What the fuck's going on, ese?"
Pass that wire.
"Órale, pass the wire!"
"Here you go, man."
Here you go.
Fuck!
COP:
Chow release!
Let's go.
(BELL ringing)
"Let's go, gentlemen."
Chow release.
"Okay, gentlemen, let's go."
"Come on, move it."
Give him the uppercut.
He's going down.
"(GRUNTlNG) That shit wasn't even clean, man."
(SPEAKS spanish)
What's your problem?
I paid for a full load.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of business.
Don't worry?
"I'm sick, motherfucker!"
Make sure he gets what he ordered right now.
You think your mom will let us stay up all night?
Yeah.
And we could also...
"Um, tonight's not gonna be good."
I just remembered I have to see my grandma.
What?
"Oh, but..."
"I'll come by your house if I can, maybe."
It's okay.
"See you tomorrow, Gracie."
Then there was the other mom.
Mommy?
"How was school, baby?"
Hm?
- Want a foot rub?
"- Oh, no, honey."
What are you doing?
Why did you do that?
You want the neighbors to see me?
- Is that what you want?
- No.
They're gonna take me away if they see me.
"I'm sorry, Mommy."
"Oh, I'm so..."
What kind of tea do you want?
Mint?
You like mint.
I would try anything to reach her.
Ow!
"Ow, ow, ow!"
"Mommy, I burnt myself!"
Ow.
- I didn't know that.
- Why don't you come to Chicago with me?
Iâm not gonna be there long.
I don't even know you.
"That's weird, isn't it?"
Right?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Oh!
You have a jukebox.
There's your fun over there.
- Yeah.
- Do you have any money?
"- It's free, we just let you give--"
"- Oh, free?"
"Finally, something free, okay."
I'm gonna play a song and Iâm gonna get out of your hair.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Any song?
- Whatever you want.
- Okay.
Here's one.
This one's for you.
Redhead.
(song playing)
Perfect.
"All right, I'll see you tomorrow."
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye!
- It's nice to meet you.
Go straight and turn right.
Okay.
- Thank you.
Hello.
I ordered coffee a long time ago.
Will you bring it today?
Yes.
Come quickly.
"May I come in, sir?"
- Yeah.
Come in.
"Hello, sir."
This is Gul.
Yeah.
Pia told me about you.
Tell me something.
Will you come to office at this hour every day?
"Actually, sir.."
- No.
No.
You don't have to call me sir.
I am used to working in a friendly ambiance.
So I guess Vivek is fine.
- Okay.
Come.
You got time?
It takes you an hour to bring a cup of coffee.
"Yes, sir."
He is the spoilt brat of our office.
Delete Singh.
"- Hello, ma'am."
Delete Singh?
- Angel?
It's me.
John.
"- I'm scared, John."
I'm coming to get you.
- Everything all right?
- Yes.
Where and when?
- John?
- Girls in life.
- I'm ready.
You do not have to do this.
Support call.
I'll kill you.
- John.
I silahsızım.
- Where the little girl?
I know you've got what I want?
Thank you.
OK.
Leave the little girl.
I'll take you to him.
- I'm afraid.
- Listen.
"Rachel'la want you to go, okay?"
- Go Rachel'la.
- Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
God.
For me what to do grant the power and wisdom.
Must find the head with me.
"The beginning of the little girl will be asked, since that is where it is?"
That's...
Tommy?
"Tommy, mate."
Tommy.
"Oh, fuck."
"Don't do this to me, Tommy."
Tommy!
All up!
Don't let them see me like this.
Rose and Frankie.
- I'm serious.
- All right.
"OK, OK."
He's in the hospital.
I'm off to see him now.
"Well, I'm not going."
OK.
If he thinks having a heart attack can make up for...
"Well, he can think again."
Maybe you should go and see him.
- Why?
- I don't know.
You never know when you'll see him again.
Like I care.
What if something happens?
What if it was the last time?
- I'll see you later.
- No... you won't.
"- I will, I promise."
- No.
"I mean, I don't want to."
Oh...
Take me.
Go ahead.
Take...
Hello.
Eva.
I'll call your insurance.
Why?
You've no right to bother me at work.
I don't.
- You don't want my services.
But I do want your services.
My job is to fuck.
At your home.
If I report that you're harassing me...
- I need you.
Eva.
No one needs me.
Especially you.
- Really?
You're just a customer.
A very difficult one.
Let's stop playing games.
- Why are you calling me?
Why me?
Because I was crying?
Why were you crying?
That's my problem.
- Maybe I could help.
Great.
I've got me a Saint Bernard.
Please.
Don't compare me to a dog.
Stop!
You can come in!
You can come in!
What was that?
I don't know.
I just know this is what happens if you don't invite me in.
What if I didn't say anything...?
Would you have just kept bleeding...?
You'd have died?
I knew you wouldn't let me...
You can borrow one of my mom's old dresses if you want...!
Hello!
Owen?
I'm in here...!
I'll be right there!
"""Hi, Owen."
Good morning.
I am in the bathroom.
Please do not come in.
Want to hang out with me again tonight?
I really like you.
"Love, Abby."""
Hello...!
Police department!
Open the door
Open the door!
Police officer!
"No, no!"
Stop!
"Jesus Christ, son !"
No!
Owen...
Shut up.
Get off me.
Get off of me.
Get off.
"Get away from me, Leonard."
Don't touch...
Get away from me!
Stay away!
"Quinn, go to your room and lock your door."
"Go on, son."
"- I hate you, Leonard!"
- Maggie.
Don't touch me!
I hate you!
- 911.
What's your emergency?
- My name is Quinn.
- Something bad is happening.
"- Maggie, it's your dad."
I'm not hearing this.
This cannot be happening again.
This voice I keep hearing...
No.
This is not happening again.
Please...
This doesn't make sense to me.
Please...
Mom.
You're such a nut.
What do you think I have on?
"No, I have a skirt and a shirt on."
It's not too short.
- Plan B. There it is.
Right there in front of us.
I knew it.
I knew it.
- Just trust and it will come.
"- Oh, my gosh."
This is insane.
- The fountain is plan B?
- You're putting them in the fountain?
- Really?
- Freshwater.
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- It's like a giant aquarium, I guess."
- Make a wish upon each fish.
"- Okay, guys."
Out you go.
Out you go.
"- Ma'am, I don't think you can do that."
- We should probably go.
Stick with your buddy.
- Don't get left behind.
- Ma'am.
- Mom.
- Freedom!
I got a lady and three minors putting some fish in the fountain.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"- Run, run, run."
Hoo-hoo!
"Hey, Grace, come on."
Get in the car.
Come on.
Don't try to serve a summons on me!
I'll do it.
(CHATTERING)
(GRUNTlNG)
(GROANS)
(GUN firing)
Get down !
COP:
Get down !
I said get down !
Wipe your face.
"I got him, ese."
I got the vato.
"You're bleeding, carnal."
"Hey, the dude had a filero."
"He cut me, man."
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
That's right.
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like telling me about your family, do you?"
"No, I guess I don't."
I don't blame you.
-I got something for you.
-Where are you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
What the hell are you doing now?
Whether I can trust him.
Take your time.
You've only just met.
"OK, Mother."
I'd like to know if it is love between Marco and me.
What do you think?
How should I know?
Hi.
What are you doing?
Watching TV.
Eating.
Could you?
Sorry.
I'll put it back.
Perhaps I should go to the movies after all.
"Oh, come off it."
Stop cleaning up his mess.
What do you mean?
- Any news about your car?
- Small-town cops.
Forget it.
Leave it.
I'll do it.
"Take this, will you?"
- Wow!
- Reflexes...
Shit!
We could spend some more time together.
We could be closer.
I mean...
I could live here.
You and I could do the ski courses together.
Kevin Calhoun.
I've just been talking to a friend of yours.
- I've got the probation report.
- Where are you?
Right around the corner.
Meet me at Franklin and Hudson.
Schwartz?
- George.
- Abe called me.
He's in the back.
That's the only way in.
The back door's gated.
All right.
I got a couple marriages.
Abe.
It's your play!
Throw the card for me.
You've been practicing all your life.
"Freddie, give us a minute."
He's dead!
Schwartz is dead.
I heard it on the phone.
I was...
Get ahold of yourself.
It's okay.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
That's when I got burned.
It's four months ago now.
I left four years ago.
"- Hi, Mum."
- So you're back?
"- Yes, I am."
- And you'll stay?
- Yes.
- You can't stay here.
I know.
"But what have they done to you, Allan?"
"They didn't do anything, Mum."
It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.
Can I get you a beer?
"- An FF, please."
- An FF?
I'm Allan.
- Maja.
- Maja?
She's still not answering.
"Yeah, Morgan."
We're on our way to Hilary Ross' house now.
She's still not answering her phone.
"All right, call local police."
He's not going to go quietly.
Do you have Mayor Wennington?
Yeah.
Keep me posted.
You got it.
Hello.
You've reached Hilary Ross.
I'm still getting nothing.
That's her car.
"All right, you two go around back."
I'll draw his fire while you flank him.
You sure you want to split up?
We gotta cover the back and the front in case he runs.
Let's go.
Aah!
Aah!
FBI!
Ohh!
Oh!
You're hit!
I'm good.
"Go, go!"
He's upstairs.
Aah!
Get in here!
Trevor Mills!
FBI!
Help.
Help.
Help.
Help!
"Something wrong, Captain?"
Leave me alone
"- Hey, clear off, you drunk."
- Get lost.
Now what's the matter?
Have you gone mad?
There.
A moment ago.
Didn't you see anything?
Here?
I'm the only one here.
"Are you afraid of ghosts, Captain?"
I
I thought I saw something.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Sounds like he saw a ghost.
- Maybe there was a ghost.
- Just for him?
Yes.
Just for him.
Help!
Bring us some drinks.
- A ship has been wrecked on the rocks.
- A ship?
When?
Only a few hours ago.
Yes.
Logan.
- Logan.
- Hey.
Hey!
You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
Logan.
- What?
I think the... that's not her mother.
- So she talks?
- We're communicating.
Communicating.
Take these now.
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.
you understand?
but this is the mutant that I told you about.
She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.
she is!
Charles?
Eating?
Pipe throwing?
It's okay.
yeah.
Take the gun.
Dump the body.
Text me when you're on the way back.
You have anything else you need?
Food for the kid?
mutie.
It's okay.
In here!
Up here!
"Indy, come on!"
Hold on!
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!
It's stuck!
Indy!
I can't push it off!
It's stuck!
-Turn it!
Turn it!
-It's stuck!
Turn it there!
Never mind!
Get back!
Get back!
Get the Ark away from this place immediately.
Have it put on the truck.
We'll fly it out of Cairo.
"And Gobler, I want plenty of protection."
Jones.
"Holy smoke, my friends,"
I...
I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England- boat, plane, anything."
"What's gotten into you, fella?"
Oh.
"- Oh, I see."
- [Barks]
"[Eric] Are you OK, miss?"
I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you.
"He's harmless really, uh..."
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
[Max barks]
We have met.
I knew it.
"You're the one, the one I've been looking for."
What's your name?
What's wrong?
What is it?
You can't speak?
Oh!
"Oh, then you couldn't be who I thought."
- [Sighs] - [Sighs]
What is it?
You're hurt?
"No, no."
You need help?
"Whoa, whoa, careful!"
"Careful, easy."
"Gee, you must have really been through something."
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll help you.
Come on.
Come on.
Holy shit!
A fucking...
Uh...
Hard to explain.
It's like a huge-ass spider with a face and dicks coming out of his mouth.
It's...
Peters.
Peters is inside.
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.
"Ah, Katie!"
"Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?"
- I think that's all you.
- I'm so fucked up!
God!
Fuck!
"Holy shit, you're fucking gross."
Yeah...
"Sorry, can you say again?"
"Katie, hello?"
"Damn it, Katie!"
"Whenever you come back online, just say the word."
"No, I'm not scared, just... bored."
That you guys?
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Fuck it, man!"
Come on!
You're in danger.
Sonja?
Now we're talking.
"Hey, uh..."
I'm sorry you kids had to see that.
"But, uh... it's a hard life on the rails."
"Yup, yup, so true."
So wise.
You should teach a class.
Bye!
I should.
You guys sure you don't want any more juice?
We don't want any more juice.
"Get out of here, Ethan."
"Okay, okay."
"See you next week, Rudy."
We cool?
"Yeah, yeah."
We're cool.
Just go.
All right.
Doesn't sound like we're cool.
We're cool!
"Okay, bye."
"Everybody, open your mouths."
Delicious.
It's so delicious.
"Num, num, num..."
Pace yourself.
Pace yourself.
Who are you?
I know we've met.
You're embarrassing me.
"All right, Rick."
Stop stalling.
"Oh, no!"
We don't want any today.
- Don't want any what?
- I don't know who you are.
- (Whispers) Go away!
- Of course you know who I am.
- I don't!
(Go away!
)
- But you asked me here!
You haven't forgotten the other night?
You got me out of bed!
"Well, didn't you?"
"Don't, Bill."
No!
Bill!
"Don't, please, Bill!"
"Bill, please!"
Don't!
Please...
Bill!
"Please, come here!"
All right.
All right.
"I'll leave him alone, and I'll tell you for why."
We're through!
Finished!
Finito!
Understand?
"Good afternoon, sir."
(Upper class accent) Good afternoon.
I'm having a day's rough shooting and want some bullets.
"As long as I don't eat a piece of food for a month, I'll be fine."
"Yeah, I thought you said you wore a size six."
Daisy:
She was a size six.
"Like 12 years ago, right?"
"- Hey-- yo, that ain't funny."
Shit.
- I'm sorry.
Maggie:
Don't be like that.
You know you look gorgeous.
Daisy:
"You do, you're beautiful."
"- Hey, Carlos."
"- Hi, baby!"
Bride:
"I said, uh!"
The bitch is four feet tall.
And her man is supposed to have...
- Maggie:
Here you go.
-...a 10-inch dick!
Baby?
- You're sure?
- No.
"Do you want some of this, Carlos?"
- No.
I'm not into that shit.
What are you into?
Are you sure?
- I'm out of here.
- Carlos?
- Oh.
Um...
"He was here a couple of minutes ago, but I know he's going on soon."
"- I was just wondering, is he okay?"
"- Yeah, he seemed fine."
- Tell him to call me after.
- Okay.
All right.
Y'all having fun?
Good.
Good.
I'm glad.
"Well, our next performer is Eddie Tennenbaum, and, uh..."
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
"Yes, we all love him."
"No, he's not..."
Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.
Two-three
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm down.
Totally cool.
We can just bypass the whole little coffee thing.
Yeah right.
Kind of awkward yeah...
I know.
Wash?
Hola!
Wash?
No I didn't pee on my hands.
Yo mama.
Hey did you see ZACH?
He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
How are you?
Good.
Ow!
Richie!
It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Oh.
Oh.
# Do-do-do-do do-do-do
# Do-do-do-do-do
# Do-do... #
"So, you get a turkey baster and you..."
Is that singing?
I can't hear anything.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
HE GROANS
Where's the fucking remote?
"Oh, no."
"It's all right, you don't have to go."
"I'm sorry, Norma."
I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."

Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.
"[Doors close, engine starts]"
That was really cute.
"Oh, stop it."
Kendall.
Ha... nice to see you.
How was San Pedro?
"Wasn't too much traffic, was there?"
What freeway did you take?

Did I just throw this?

I accidentally packed these with my stuff.

I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.

I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.

Ow.
Well beautiful.
I did not see one like this yet.
"Newer cardboards, Ágika!"
Wow it no.
Not at all.
Our kindest guest humiliates himself with so inferior work.
This can not be.
"Me, not spare, my Mariska."
"Now, when I feel well finally."
"Cardboards, Ágika!"
Here you go.
"If it is for major lord, has desire for him really."
What his blessed hand yes.

"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?

"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."

"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.

"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.
Freeze!
"Hey, right there."
Don't move.
"Come on, let's get him up."
Jesus!
I think they bought it.
Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
"Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?"
James Kilkelly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in."

So you bought a bed.

Pillow top?

"- What, you don't like art therapy?"
"Nice, Edward."
I see you've chosen to draw a house.

"So, what do you think of the book so far?"
"Dude, seriously."
Quit asking me.
I will throw this book out the window.
That's the only signed one in the world.
It's a collector's item.

"Go on, turn."
You two are gorgeous.
"My partner, Pedro."

They work at the crab factory.
We're celebrating because they got a raise.
They won the strike.
Long live the working class!
You want another drink?

Not now.
Okay?

"It's too late, Billy."
I'm sorry.
I'm apologizing.
Mr. Logan has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
Stan.
Listen to me.
"It was my fault, too."
I tripped over the cable.
I...
"Natalie, this is not about you."
I've been warning this guy all summer.

"Get him up, get him up."
I got him.

Possible fracture to the left lower extremity.
Don't jostle him.
He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.
I'm Dr. Ross.
I work in County ER.
I need a number six ET tube.
There we go.
- I need a portable O-2 and an ambu-bag.
You can't force things.

I could be your last chance at happiness.
Come inside.
I can't.
Okay.
Good night.

"Why would you lie to me, Michael?"
What are you talking about?
What were you doing all night?
I was with Chris.
"God, you lying bastard."
You make me so sick.
You know?
I'm really lucky you became my husband.
Really?
Well now is the start of our new life.
Oh come on!
You're so handsome!
And you...
You're the fairest of them all!
Promise me that it'll only be me.
You're the only one I will love.
Promise me that you won't leave me.
I'll always be here by your side.
"You're my life, Migs."
"I love you, Joy."
"Here, I've already prepared it because I knew you were coming."

Thank you.
-Hey Migs!
Your change!

Thank you Migs!

Stay here first.

"- You have a lot of energy, more than him."
[Chuckling]
"Um, I have a little surprise."
Please share.
"What is it, what is it?"
F...
"Unbelievable, man."
- She's fucking impossible.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
What happened?
She's worse than Audrey.
Or maybe it's you.
Can I buy you a drink?
"Uh, are you supposed to smoke around pressurized oxygen?"
No.
That's why I turned it off.
Dip shit.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
That was the wrong way to start this.
- Gee.
"- Maggie, my name is Lance."
"I'm, uh... in a relationship with your niece."
I know your mother very well.
I've been on the wrong end of her wrath a good many times.
"- And, uh..."
- Up-up-up.
Shit.
Shit!
Fuck!
She lose the lisp?
Pardon me?
Julia.
Had a bad lisp as a kid.
I only rooted for her.
Yeah.
She told me about that.

Got a big shadow though!
She's the biggest woman in Japan.
Here's name's Amelian.

Tell him to put the makeup back on.
"We'll just use his body, right?"
Who wrapped him?
I didn't wrap him.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, I know."
"Well, nobody should wrap until we wrap."
That's ridiculous.
"Just get him in with his body, right?"
"Oh, that's bad stuff, right?"
I won't continue with that.
CAT:
I didn't wrap him.
I'm sorry.
"Well, who did wrap him?"
CAT:
I have no idea.
He's in effects getting his makeup taken off.

With me?
You are with me.

Then I'll sew up your chest.
Then you'll be okay.
He can stand it.

Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.

"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about from Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
"- Oh, Jesus."
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

It's not funny.
"Should've called your mum, Cooper."
"- But you called me, and I led you here..."

Put the knife down.
Drop the act.

We had nothing to do with it.

"Yes, Miss Zeynab."
"Zeynab, come here, this gentleman needs milk."
It's so dark here.

Come in.
Can you milk the cow for me?
"Wait, I'll do it."
It's so dark.
How can you milk in here?
I'm used to it. I work here.
You'll get used to it if you stay.
I'll be gone before I get used to it.
We have a flashlight.
The electricity is off.
"""lf you come ho my house..."""

Thanks.
"Show them to the room, idiot."
"Yes, sorry!"
Tell the hotel we're here.
"Yes, sir."
Good morning.

I was looking for info on flea markets.
You like flea markets?
Good deals on clothes.

"Go home, Koreans!"
Don't disgrace the Japanese flag.

"Oh, my feet?"
"Looks awful, doesn't it?"
It's from the chlorine in the chemicals here.
I'm sorry.
-The cop?
What cop?
-Get on the phone!
We're gonna die for this!
"Hello, Nick."
"Nick, wake up."
"Come on, Nick."
"Come on, Nick."
"Nick, wake up."
We'll know for sure after we see the tests.
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.
"Can I have the book, please?"
Thanks.
"All he knows, it went dark."
"If he'd have turned around, Frank, they'd have hanged us for it."
"And something, something put that cop there."
"It's an act of God, those lights went out."
Don't look back.
-What?
-Don't look back.
It's a cop.
-His red light's on.
"-Oh, God."
"No, no, leave 'em on."
Bathroom upstairs?
"Ah, yeah."
What's the ladder doin' there?
I don't know.
"Hey, come here."
All right.
Sure.
I hope it's a girl.
Relax!
Calm down!
Calm down!
"Stop screaming, you'll waste your strength."
"Push, come on!"
"My god, it's a boy!"
Look how pretty he is.
It's a boy!
"Here it is, the macarroni."
"Let's go, let's go!"
Look.
Febo!
Febo!
Febo!
"I have to admit, I've never been there."
You knew I'd be here.
Are we even?
- Come with me to Capri.
- No.
I believe in my marriage.
Though...
"Febo, Palm..."
Did you find the dogs?
Not yet.
It's my fault.
"- You're a good person, Captain."
"- No more than you are, Mrs. Wyatt."
"What's this about ""net weight in the morning""?"
What does it mean?
"I insisted on that, sir."
Scientifically... the morning is when the human body weighs the least.
- He's okay with this one.
You have a case.
- Druse.
Again?
- Mama.
"- Hush up, Bobby."
This could be serious.
I've got pins and needles all up my right arm.
There.
Isn't it lovely?
Ready?
"And one, two, three, up."
"Sweatpants, no pockets."
We can't do a wallet biopsy on this one.
I know who he is.
- You want me to guess?
Is there a prize?
- I can't get air in him.
- I know.
- Really?
Want to share?
His name's Peter Rickman.
He lives in Castleview.
He's a famous artist.
"Liz, could I get an 18-gauge needle, please?"
"No syringe, just the needle."
- Are you...
- Yes.
"Tension pneumo, Elmer."
Pleural sac is inflating like a beach ball.
Time for a party trick.
May I be excused?
–You're not ditching me.
I can't explain you being here to Aceveda.
"Now, go!"
Just call an ambulance and call my family!
I'm gonna kill that sumbitch!
No.
No.
Don't.
Goddamn it!
Christ.
I hate playing this with you.
This game's sucking.
–You could stop.
–Shut up.
It's Vic.
"Hey, what's up, boss?"
Jesus Christ.
Are you okay?
–What?
–Vic got shot.
–What?
–Vic got shot.
–Can we leave?
–Shouldn't be much longer.
"Oh, please."
Don't walk out on me again.
Just please don't leave me alone.
"Look, um..."
I believe you.
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.
I was with him all night.
"If I thought he did this, I would tell you."
Are you kidding?
"Great, I've a free chauffeur."
Bro Michael!
Pre-empt.
"Welcome, the God of Wealth!"
"See this, the widest network of informers."
I'd come too for the money.
Monkey.
Scorpion King?
Police!
Stop!
Run or I'll shoot!
Where's the tattoo?
I don't have.
No scorpion tattoo?
"I don't, Inspector."
Then why call yourself Scorpion King?
"My nickname is Scorpion, last name King."
So they call me Scorpion King.
Stupid name!
Stop...
You act like a gangster.
You just have money.
Let's go.
Change your name!
What's this?
Lok Lok.
What's Lok?
Name of the panda at Ocean Park.
Get lost!
"Look, isn't it a scorpion?"
"No, it's a lobster."
Will you ma...
I love kids.
Can you make eye contact with me?
I am.
Aren't I?
No.
You're looking at my chin.
No.
"That's, that's your..."
I'll just get below here.
How 'bout now?
No.
Na...
I have a son.
Are you cool with that?
I gotta take a nap.
Okay.
Whew!
"Oh, there it is."
Here you go.
"We've got a birthday, people."
Places.
Ready?
"Here we go, everyone."
"Five, six, seven and..."
Everybody watch your back the birthday train is on the track!
"Well, hello, there."
"Put some wine in your glass, 'cause your life is moving fast, so drink your day away."
"Honk, honk!"
What's happening?
!
It's not my...
Let me just finish.
My skin is way lighter than yours.
Okay.
Just wait.
You'll see.
I just have to do your whole face first.
-What are
- Where are you going?
- I don't have to come in till 2:00.
"- Oh, see you at 2:00 then."
- Okay.
Seeya.
Guy at 1:00.
Not cute.
Say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
- That doesn't match your skin color.
- I know.
It doesn't.
"Do you want me to finish, or do you want me to leave it how it is?"
Are you guys like girlfriends?
Maybe.
You look like you could be sisters.
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
"- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool."
But that's pretty unlikely.
- How old are you guys anyways?
- Eighteen.
I'm 18.
She's 17.
- I turn 18 next week.
It's not such a bad thing to keep a man waiting.
You don't want him to think he's the only date you've had in years.
- It's not a date!
- Give me the bow.
Where's the bow?
"Hey, your mother did you up again."
"Looks terrific, Miss Morgan."
- Thank you.
- Want me to get you a cab?
"- No, I'm fine."
- All right.
"Ooh, good."
Sir!
Sorry.
Hello!
Are you sure about this?
You're going to take me?
"- Get in, lady."
- Thanks.
"Here's where I'm going, but don't go until I put up the window."
"- They're broke, lady."
- My hair!
Don't complain to me.
Complain to the cab company.
Oh!
- Hi.
- Hi!
Hi.
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
You're exactly on time.
My hair.
Singapore...
"Uncle Tang,"
I'm quite heavy now.
No problem!
His strength is of no use.
He wants to fight everywhere.
"If you don't make the newspaper wet today, you will not stand up!"
India...
Rusia...
France...
Thailand...
Sweden...
Spain...
Xiaotian!
Come on!
Come on!
Time to go!
Come on!
The weather is so cold!
- Poor guy!
- Hurry!
It's still hot.
Come on!
"Yes, drink it."
You first.
- How about this one?
- Here!
You have picked the hot one!
Xiaotian...
"I have waited so long, so will you giving me an answer?"
Can you stop making joke on me?
Nobody's joking with you!
Think I just fell in love.
So we're friends.
Yeah.
You wanna come in?
"I'm sorry, I don't trust myself."
That's okay.
You can just watch.
"You know, you may be the best friend I've ever had."
[LAUGHS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
BEN:
Take a shower.
Hey.
- What?
Hi.
- Honey?
- Yeah.
You smell weird.
- I smell weird?
"- Yeah, different."
- Different how?
- I don't know.
[BEN LAUGHS]
Sort of an odd thing to say.
"You know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found."
In the back yard.
"What part of ""My dad died of lung cancer"" is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?"
What?
"Do not lie to me, Ben."
"Please, okay?"
Are you serious?
"Well, what do you think?"
Yeah...
Go ahead...
She's all yours.
Whas wrong?
No good?
I can't get it up.
Angelras!
I have to get off now.
He doesn't know what he's in for!
We sure warmed her up!
What about me?
Why can't I get it up?
The bastard!
I sure hope he gets his...
"Right on a nice, sharp curve..."
Think he's got his car back?
You're nuts!
Not yet!
What are cops for?
Where's the fire?
I can't wait!
Hope he's on the accident list!
Know anyone here?
So why'd we come?
Give me time to think!
I'm not a computer!
Just take it easy.
"Track 4, train number 1411..."
For Bridolle.
All aboard...
"Close the doors, please."
"♪ Rockabye baby, on the treetop..."
It's burning hot.
Bastard!
Are you trying to scald my child?
"Let's go, dear!"
- Madam!
"- Mousy, come here."
"Sifu Wong, I'm innocent!"
I was...
- Have you studied Kung Fu before?
- No.
- Good news.
- What's good?
"It means ""OK""."
"Kneel down, quick."
This is my best singing bird.
Here.
You two...
"Watch where you go, girl!"
"Lady, you made me lose my lovebird."
I want you to be my kept bird now.
Return the bird to him.
"Lady, come home with me now."
I'll treat you well.
Now's your chance to impress Sifu.
Go and settle this.
Be brave.
Go.
"Come on, let's go."
Take her home.
"Hey, don't be a bully!"
Your bird is here!
Ready...
and drink.
I know what it is.
"Oh, you know?"
From one sip.
Yep.
So Bob knows it.
Say it.
I'll give you a chance here.
You take a guess.
"Oh, he's giving Rick a chance."
You don't know it.
"Talk to me, Goose."
Get inside me.
Take your shoes off.
Make yourself comfortable.
The wine's inside of Rick.
Getting comfortable.
Okay.
It's a blend...
"Yeah, it's definitely a blend."
I'm getting a few things here.
It's very complex.
"Take another sip, Rick."
This is gettin' good.
"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
I hope you're happy.
He was beautiful.
"Well, whatever."
Enjoy the rest of your ride.
I'll go check the busboys.
Somebody has the chocolate.
I'll revive the whole thing right.
"Now, watch-- here."
"That was the beach, right?"
-ALL:
Right.
-Okay.
This was Hill 405 right here.
I'll tell you why.
Zeke...
"All right, this was zero hour."
This is the way it went.
Everybody in posi...
"Gunther, in position?"
"-Right, sir."
-All right.
What are you doing there?
You're with the artillery.
"-Get over there, Tubby!"
"-All right, all right."
"Morgan, get behind the foxhole."
"Zeke, you got the bazookas ready?"
"-All set, all set."
-Now... wait a minute.
Then there came that air...
air raid!
-Air raid!
-Get in position.
(mimicking machine gun sounds)
You got him!
All right.
All right.
Set your watches.
Go ahead.
Shorty?
- Yeah!
- Shorty!
"- Hello, boss!"
"- Why, you old son of a gun."
You came just in time.
You saved my life.
"Well, look at you."
You're all dressed up.
Yeah.
We're in the money.
I filed the claim.
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!
No trouble at all.
I went right in and signed the names.
"- Oh, and the claim was-"
- Shorty.
What's that?
That's our new cook.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.

"You know, we are a team today."
Jin.
- Male said something yet?
"- Jin-san, Yankee is not responding."
"I have a bad feeling, we must go up immediately."
Ram!
The joints... are not moving...
There's another GUNK.
Take cover!
Gimlet!
Deploy the launchers!
Male!
Are you hurt?
Ram's suit is freeze.
Smoke!
Male!
Wait!
Even if you launch them here...
Discharge! Ram!
Damn it!
Gimlet!
Where's Ram?
Was evaporated...
Gimlet!
We have signal from the UAV camera.
Yankee!
Yankee!
Are you alive?
Yankee!
Jin here.
I just snaked behind.
Use the EMP grenades!
I'm going up.
Right.
"Oh, I'm coming now."
[Wind howling]
[Seagulls screeching]
Janet?
- Janet!
-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?
- I can't see it.
- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.
[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?
I don't know.
Do what?
Somers.
Martin Somers.
"I tell you all about it tomorrow, but now I got many people to call."
You be there.
Goodbye.
"Hello, Axel."
Shall I call him back?
No.
I guess not.
He'll be here first thing in the morning.
"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, that."
We'll go to your place.
I'll make you some supper.
Then you have a good night's sleep.
Look.
What is it?
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
I'm going to find out.
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
What's going on out here?
Why you knock my sign down?
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
- What is this here?
- Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
- I don't believe it.
- I did.
I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!
"Listen to me, Selena."
Listen.
- One of us has got to call.
- I can't!
- No.
- You must call them now.
I can't.
- Pardon me.
- Allison!
Norman.
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.
Come here.
"Hey, you guys."
Idiot.
-Guess what?
What?
It carries more fish than penguin that any existed.
In-land.
-And he's amazing ...
Impressive ...
-Sven?
What?
Is anyone down there very special.
"If I know Gloria, she will not eat until everyone eat."
Can you take this for her?
"Yes, do not be silly, where is he?"
"No, she."
"Ali, surrounded by children."
-That is your wife?
-Yes.
Really?
-Yes.
-Your wife?
"Yes, take the fish."
"No, no, no."
She deserves the best.
-Want to hear a song?
Do not.
Let's listen to a song.
I expect before leaving.
Why not plan stay out.
Wake me before leaving.
Will you shut up.
Shut up!
I'llneverletyou  norwillIdisappointyou
"I'm not gonna leave, Jenna."
You're gonna have to come talk to me sooner or later.
Go away!
I can't!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
"I love you, and I don't deserve you, but this is our home."
"This is our home, Jenna, and I'm..."
I'm not gonna leave this porch until you talk to me.
Jenna?
Hey.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sorry.
But I'm moving into Kenny's.
I'm still gonna be his dad.
Okay.
Good.
- Hey.
- You can start now.
Hi.
Sorry?
Lise?
"I'm exhausted, Chris."
Everything you need is in here.
"You need anything else, call."
"Otherwise, I will see you on Monday."
"I'm here, kid."
I'll never leave you.
Michael?
Michael?
- It's sparkling!
"- Thank you, Réjean."
-Hold on.
You got 'em?
-Where are we goin'?
We go here.
Put 'em up on post.
You got it?
Push.
Push.
"Know what I'd do, Nick?"
-I'd get a new one.
"-Oh, I get new one, sure."
"And that son of a bitch hang it first time, he pay for it."
Neon.
Somethin' flashy.
You know what I mean?
Bring some business in.
Neon?
What's a neon?
Neon.
You know...
-...them little colored tubes.
-Tubes.
"Oh, it's a neon."
"Yeah, neon...."
Maybe.
"Goddamn, they all try cheat foreigner."
"Frank, clean up the place."
He say how long he's gonna be gone?
He didn't tell me.
He said he was goin' into town to get some parts.
Smells good in here today.
Is that door locked?
"- Oh, I get it."
"You're celebrating already, huh?"
You ungrateful pieces of shit!
- He's okay.
He's okay.
- Unbelievable.
- What are you doing here?
- You're bloodsuckers.
All of you.
I hope your 401ks go straight to hell.
Victor.
"Whoa, whoa."
Hey.
"Come here, come here."
Calm down.
You're making a scene.
These aren't your employees.
"- Oh, wow."
You're right.
- Come on.
"Why did you do this to me, Truman?"
Why did you do it?
You think I don't see what's going on?
"I go to jail, and who benefits?"
You.
You prick.
"I thought we were friends, Neil."
"Donnie, what the hell, man?"
I'm here.
Where are you?
Get your ass over here.
_
"Sir, I would suggest that you get help before you fly again."
"Oh, I'll never be doing that"
- again.
"But I did it, didn't I?"
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
- I did it!
- You did.
Are you up?
"No, I'm here."
Can I come over?
What can I say?
- Thank you.
You saved me.
- So your apartment's ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
They did a great job.
It's better than it was before.
I should've burned it down long ago.
- Ok.
Ok.
- Ok.
"Well, goodbye."
Goodbye.
- I lost the apartment.
- I know.
I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.
I know that's a lot to ask of an ex-wife.
"David, I think that you should sleep in my basement."
Ok?
Come on.
- [sighs]
- Mm.
- Ahh.
- [sighs]
Look...
I think you're so great.
Ah.
But I just broke up with Bill...
- Right. [clears throat] - ...and I got all this
"""Girls Are Funny, Too"" stuff happening..."
- Right.
- ...and Goldie's actually letting me do a rewrite of one of the sketches.
"Oh, wow."
Congratulations.
"Thank you, so it's just-- man, it's just-- it's really bad timing for me right now."
"Timing, right."
So...
is there any chance we could just be friends?
Of course.
[laughs]
"Yeah, yeah."
"- Okay, good."
"- Yeah, friends."
"- I'll see you later, friend."
- All right.
Oof.
Hey.
"Missed your time, Sull."
"By ten minutes, just put me up next."
- Sorry.
- Who's here?
Booked until 1:45.
"Oh, angel."
You're the best.
You're the best in the land.
"- Stop, please."
- This is the very best.
The very best girl ever in the whole wide world.
"The prettiest, smartest, brightest,"
"- greatest, the best."
"- Mom, please."
Oh!
I love you.
How much?
How much?
How much will you give me for her?
"No, I'm just kidding."
I'm just kidding.
Have some fabric softener.
"Yes, indeed."
Ooh!
I'm gonna get a few of them.
"What, honey?"
What?
"What are you looking at, huh?"
What are you looking at?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
And I started flipping out.
I was moving my foot and hitting my toes with my...
"Oh, that's disgusting."
Let's not talk about it.
Ugh.
Yeah?
"Brave kid, huh?"
"Yeah, brave or stupid."
One of the other.
"How's, uh, how's your proble?"
"He's all right, why?"
Just asking.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just asking.
I've known you long enough to
Know that just asking means
Anything but.
"I'll tell you what, he's a"
"Complete idiot, but he's our"
"Complete idiot, all right?"
"OK, got you."
"OK, OK, what's the nut on the"
"Game, man?"
"What do you want to do, like, 50 bucks a head?"
400 bucks to the winning team?
You got it.
All right.
"Let's get it on, man."
"Yeah, let's get it on."
"What is this, 1977?"
"'77, '78, you're gonna get"
Yours.
Big time.
"All right, guys."
You know the rules.
"2 points in the bucket, 3 points"
"If you hit the bottle, all"
Where's our mom?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
Fine.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play along again.
I'll talk to Lukas again.

This is so sad.
Really sad.

Brother big-mouth strikes again.
Damn it.
Did Steve call you?
Uh-huh.
I told him not to tell anyone.
Does dad know?
"Well, I haven't heard any yelling, so I'd say no."
You want to meet for lunch?

"Well, it was the only way I knew how to get the sword."
What if we didn't get here in time?
"Yeah, I thought you would."
"So just--right now, could you just hurry up,"
Pull it out?
Wait.
Wait.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute.
Are you sure?
"Yeah, it's the sharpest sword ever made."

I want to cancel my card.
It got stolen tonight.
Where is your friend?
Just get it over with.
Stay down.
Is that all you've got?
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
I've felt weird lately.
Are you feeling better now?
It was a crazy night.
Maybe too crazy.
What happened to your face?
Nothing I didn't ask for.
It's Marc.
There's an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I'm quite tired.
Marc's got coke.
Come on.
I'll look after you.
Can I come back to your place afterwards?
I can't go home.
What?
I'm not pretty no more.
You are beautiful.
You hear me?
Why did he have to come back?
I wish he could have just stayed up there.
You could have married Hector.
You're just saying that.
"You're just saying that, okay?"
*
"You all right, B.?"
Huh...
"oh, yeah."
"I'm shakin', I'm shaking."
"Nah, I'm just getting started though."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
You ain't won nothin' all day.
Come on...
"That's what I'm talking about, yo."
What's good?
"How you doin', can I get in?"
My money good?
"Yeah, fuck it."
All right.
Cuanto?
"$100. a game, man."
$100.?
"Man, roll 'em, man, roll them dice, dude."
Shaking them down ain't gonna make no difference.
"(Man) All right, watch me."
"Come on six... here we go, baby, here we go."

It turns out I was hungry after all.
May I see?
You look so beautiful.
You're so lovely.
"Yes, you are."
And you're so soft.

You're the only one there?
It must be terrible to be all alone.

That's...
This can't be true.
Why did I fall asleep?
Don't worry.
Some joyrider will probably dump it somewhere.
"- Yeah, sure."
- What was in the car?
"Clothes, Christmas presents, all kinds of stuff."
I gotta go.
That guy must be on Valium or something.
"Becky, I'm taking your car."
"Hey, I have to go to work."
Ivana?
Is this you Ivana?
Help me!
Help me.

I played and I lost them.
Lost them.
Lost.
Please help me!
And your friends.
The blonde!
The dull!
Is this enough?
"-No, the debt is large."
-And you are very beautiful.
Now drop for the behind.
Here is the soap.
This is precisely what I wanted to say.
The dull and the blond... did so with the soap.
We'll see.
-FiIippo.
-My love?
When will we get back to play?
"Poor Filippo, lost in the game and also with his wife."
You think so?
"I, in contrast say that he has recovered."
-No reception for anyone!
Hey!
Where did he go?
Jong-gu!
I gotta catch him.
Gotta catch that bastard.
Catch that bastard.
I can't believe this...

Yeah.
"Well, it's definitely different."

You don't like it?
"No, I like it."
I like it a lot.
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"What's goin' on, Tris?"
Nothin'.
I'm fine.
Just...
Still having nightmares?
No.
We're good.
You and me.
I know nothing else is.
But we are.

My trunk!
Who took away my trunk?
Where is my trunk?
"Even you will vanish like the trunk, mister!"
"Go away, go away, go back."
"Look mister, I will tell you something worth.."
..10 lakhs forfree.
Got it?
Every person gets three things..
..very difficultly in this Mumbai city.
Got it?
Look there.
"Food, clothes and settler."
Thief.
Oh no!

Thief.
Thief.
Thief.
"Mister, catch him!"
Hey where are you running with my trunk!
My trunk!
Boss!
Boss!
-What is it?
Why are you screaming so much?
"Boss, look at this."
That..
"He is my man, what is it?"
"Mister.. mister, that trunk belongs to me."
He.. he stole it from the station.
It has my name on it.
I didn't say that to be mean.
I know.
"Um, I'm sorry."
What was it like?
[Sighing]
Um... it was bad.
"Not as bad as New York City, but it was bad."
"Hey, mama."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"All right, grandma, let's hand it over."
Please.
"My check was late, so I couldn't buy any food."
"I need my money, please."
"Lady, you are breaking my heart, here."
Gimme that.

[Belching]
"This is for you, and, uh, this is for you, and this is for you, and this is also for you, and this is for me."
And this is for you.
[Sobbing]
[Giggling]
"Shut up, you old bitch!"
What the fuck is going on here?
Whoa.
Tryin' to be some kinda hero or somethin' here?

[Groaning]
This has got to be Air...
Airdrie?
..drie?
What does that leave us?
That leaves this Igle down the bottom .
"Let's go for that now, and see what happens."
Bung that one in now.
And...
It might be the red herring.
What's going on down here?
Nigle?
50 seconds.
"No, that's not working, is it?"
I don't...
I'm wondering whether...
Aberdeen?
Aberdeen!
Aberdeen...
I think...
That would put... 30 seconds.
We'd have to have a lot wrong if it were going to be Aberdeen.
I think that's a red herring.
What's this Y for then?
Something-dray?
20 seconds.
Bay?
There's Ayr...
No.
Yeah!
"Yes, Ayr, yes."
You said that before.
"No, no!"
I was thinking Antigua.
Always wanted to go there.
"Nope, nope."
"Nope, nope, nope."
No.
I dated a girl from there once.
What?
So the whole country's off-limits?
The whole West Indies is off-limits.
"Well, who's this girl?"
It's a long story.
"If we ever make it out of the U.S. alive,"
I'll tell it to you.
All kinds of craziness.
Good crazy?
No.
Is that Mike?
"No, it's Schmidt."
"Hey, Schmidt."
What's up?
You have to help me!
They're coming!
Okay...
"Schmidt, hang on."
What -- what's the problem?
Is somebody at the motel?
"No, I'm not at the motel, okay?"
"I mean, I was at the motel."
Then I went back to my warehouse --
Wait a minute.
What -- y-you went to the warehouse?
Why?
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.
You got money for that commercial!
You don't got my fucking money?
"Jimmy, he's gonna pay you."
I'll fucking kill you!
"Give me the money, cocksucker."
Pay me!
"He'll pay, he'll pay."
Morrie's.
Who's this?
He's here.
"Jimmy, I'm sorry."
You should be sorry.
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!
You hear me?
Give me the fucking money!
I'll give you....
"You've got it, kid."
"You've got it, believe me."

Come on.
Let's go to church.
"- Good evening, Father."
- You look a little lost.
Can I help you?
I once was lost.
But now I found myself.
"What a sweet, sweet sound."
See you later.
"Well, John."
I gave it back to the little girl's life.
But I'm not sure if he would give the door allowed to travel.
Because you killed my son.
- What are you waiting for?
- Gentlemen.
Please.
This is the home of God.
- Family.
John.
All of the family.
- I know.
You stole mine from me.
Please!

"Let's Read, Father."
- [Laughs]
- Went on and on and on.
"- Okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high security."
'Cause we mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
- Hi.
"- Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"- Yeah, I know, I know."
This is my home.
[Sighs]
It is!
Rough day?
Y-Yeah.
Were you...
Were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
Most people think she's a lot younger than that.
"Hello, I'm Olga."
"Olga, I'd like you to meet my good friend Bob Hartley"
How old do you think I am?
"Forty, 41."
I am 65.
- That's amazing.
- Yes.
"Now, what is it that you want to work on?"
"The legs, the thigh, the hips, the bust?"
A little below the bust.
"Well, just follow along."
We start very slowly in the beginners group.
All right.
Line up.
Arm's distance.
Good.
"We'll start with a little, stretching."
"Well, so much for the stretching."
"Now, we go."
And... run!

"Wong Fei-hung, I'm not afraid of you!"
You're not?
How about this?
It's time to build up your confidence!
"Relax, follow me."
- Lock him up!
- Yes!
"Marshal, which one?"
"- Numbskull, the one behind you!"
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Nothing to do with you.
Excuse me!
You dare to retaliate?
!
Don't be afraid.
Fight!
- You bast...
"- Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Marshal, are you OK?"
Nifty footwork.
You ambushed me with your No Shadow Kick!
Give me my weapon!
Let me go!
Lift your leg.
You told me to lift my leg.
Here's a punch-bag.
You want to practise?
"- No, not really."
- Come here.
Go on.
Harder.
I knew that.
So we're going to Dallas.
Together.
But first  we sleep.

We had a bronnection.
"All right, I gotta know what she looks like."

What happened?
"I went for a swim, boss."
- I got into difficulties.
- Got into difficulties!
"- Yes, boss."
Then I'll hold it.
What do you see?
I sense something else.
A picture?
His?
He's not wearing much.
"He's not into the sex industry, I hope?"
No.
I see him on the beach waves and...
What's up?
What did you see?
"I drifted off, I think."
"His name was there, letters."
"H and E, HENK..."
HERBERT...
HERMAN
Herman!
"Gee, I didn't know you were so good at it."
Look... ls that him?
Well now...
You're going to tell me all about this Herman.
I've known Herman for years.
From when I first met Johan.
Johan?
Who's this Johan?
- My dead husband I told you about.
"- Oh, yes."
"Herman wanted me, but I married Johan."
That's life.
Sure.
But tell me about this Herman?
I'd rather not.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"- Boss... sorry, this is urgent."
- Yes?
(DOOR SLAMS)
It's him.
You're gonna wanna see this.
"- What is it, Benny?"
- This has just come in.
LUTHER:
Is this live?
"Yep, it's happening right now."
It's live.
"Jesus, some sort of hand-held webcam, or something."
It's being sent to us directly.
He's taunting us.
- LUTHER:
Do we know the street?
- Can't tell.
I want everyone on this.
We need to find that street.
- Partial plate.
- Dig it up.
Give me an address.
"- Benny, can you send it over?"
"- Yeah, it's with you now."
LUTHER:
"Gray, quick as you can."
Come on.
Erin!
He's knocking on doors.
"- Gray, come on!"
"- It's coming, it's coming!"
I'll care of it tomorrow.
Christine!
Anything I should know?
You come and go...
We cross paths.
I have a lot of work.
I have work too.
We managed before.
There's nothing.
If you want to talk...
I'm looking for Gilles.
Alain!
Gilles went to London.
Andrew knows Leslie's parents.
This is his place.
He's back for the trimester.
It wasn't planned.
His kids are coming.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
When did Gilles leave?
Last week.
I wrote him.
I know.
I don't have his address.
I'll forward the letter once I do.
- A number?
- We can't call him.
He calls.
You left Jean-René?
You can spend the night.
No thanks.
I'd rather not.
"Yes, please."
I'd be grateful for some fresh milk.
All right.
I'm disturbing you.
Don't worry.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
What a fine house.
Make yourself at home.
is this Kakrahman's house?
No.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I was told to get milk from him.
It's next door.
Where is Kakrahman's house?
Next door.
"Sorry, I didn't understand."
It's next door.
Thank you very much.
is this Kakrahman's house?
Welcome.
Good luck.
I was sent here for milk.
Can you give me some?
Go down to the cellar...
Watch your head.
This way?
Go on down.
Mind your head.
All right.
Why is it so dark here?
"There's a hurricane lamp, it's not dark."

"No, it's something else."
Wait a minute-- did you have sex?
"Marly, I think you're right."
"Look, her neck muscles have relaxed and she's not doing that crazy thing with her eyes."
Admit it.
Maybe I did... and maybe I didn't.
You did.
When did you get a boyfriend?
"You don't need a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
"Oh, yes."
Don't get angry!
Don't get angry!
"Batlya brother, you don't interfere."
"Look, you are like my younger son."
Yes.

It's not me he's running away from.
"17 years, Kike."
I gave my life to you.
"It was hard, but I did it."
I put my trust in you because I knew
You would take care of us.
But now my baby's out there.
"E., I don't know what happened to you up there,"
But it has nothing to do with Michael.
The boy loves you.
He needs you.
We need you.

Where are my weapons?
Is this all you have brought me?
- One soldier?
- Let her go.
But she wishes to remain.
She has chosen to stay here.
Is that not so?
Please.
Don't hurt her.
You must go now.
My men will soon return and they are many.
–Where are they?
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.
–I won't let you.
Not like this.
–Corrine... –I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.
Vic.
Daddy!
–Hi.
–Daddy.
I missed you so much.
Kiss.
"Hey, Matty."
Give Daddy a kiss.
"Hey, Vic, I really need you in here now."
"–Dad, don't go again."
"–Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
I have to.
"Listen, someone was hurt really bad... and I have to stay here until he feels better."
"But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come and see you again, okay?"
I promise.
I love you.
–Where is he?
–Who?
Fleetwood.
You're packing his goddamn suitcase.
"Now, where is he?"
–I forget.
–Where's your boyfriend at?
–I don't even hear you.
–He just shot my partner.
We'll have an army with us!

I see gold.
- Hey it's mine.
- Where is it?
"- Hey, give it to me!"
- No!
A stagecoach.
She must be tuned in on a western.
Yeah.
I see dummies.
[both] that's you.
- Maybe I just feel insulted.
- Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I'm putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
!
91.
Number 91!
91.
Number 91.
"91, number 9."
"I mean, how hard is that?"
A talking monkey could do her job.
- It's embarrassing.
"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
Excuse me.
"Oh, impressive wingspan!"
Very good!
"Oh, what?"
What?
These are plastic.
He can't fly!
"They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly."
"-No, you can't."
"-Yes, I can."
-You can't.
-Can.
Can't.
Can't.
Can't!
"I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!"
"-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it."
"-All right, then, I will."
"Stand back, everyone!"
To infinity and beyond!
-Can!
-Whoa!
"Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!"
-I found my moving' buddy.
-Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.
"Man, the dolls must really go for you."
Can you teach me that?
-Golly bob howdy!
"Dig it, dig it"
"Oh, yeah"
"She's lookin' in your eye, eye"

I don't know
"Whoa, yeah."
Boy with ringlets.
Man with tattoos.
Girl on... a leash?
"Man, if my parents ever tried putting me in one of those things,"
I'd trade them in.
This kid looks like she can roll over and fetch.
I learn everything I can and I write down everything I see.
Golly says if I want to be a writer then I'd better start now.
Which is why I am a spy.
Lady with a purse.
Man with... her wallet.
"Oh, help!"
Please!
Stop him!
Stop him!

It's Nanomichi.
"You know, the god of storm and thunder."
"- Cool, huh?"
"- Okay, come on, hurry up before it dries."
- Yeah.
"It's true, he freed me."
You dug a hole in the wall.
And I also have a job.
Oh!
What a tall tale!
"""If you think the night is nice, the day will be worse. """
Balla is a liar.
I'm not crazy.
Believe me!
Balla is a joker.
It's been a long time.
Haven't seen you around lately.
Is it ready?
Yes.
Let's celebrate the reunion.
Where?
Come sit with me.
They're waiting for me.
I'm in a rush.
"So, don't forget:"
"- Tuesday, at ""3 Caïmans""."
- All right!
We'll have a good time.
- How much is it?
- 1200 FM.
Where are you going tonight?
"To the ""3 Caïmans""."
We could go together.
"You need to rest, you've had a hard day."
Sure!
There's always an excuse.
"- All right, then, get dressed!"
"This is a club, not a boxing ring."
The cunt walked right into us.
- Where's your booze?
- So you beat him up?
- You let too many losers in.
- He owns three restaurants.
I'm spending 30 grand here tonight.
I can beat up anyone I want.
Have we finished?
Come on.
"Hey, T!"
Send up a couple of bottles.
"Fuck, man."
- Fucking Paki.
- We taught him good.
- Hi.
"- What's up, Hanne?"
I was wondering...
can I have a line?
Help yourself.
- I'm in the mood now.
- For what?
A fuck.
- Who says I am?
- You were just now.
That was then.
But if you want you can give me a hand job.
- OK.
Where shall we go?
- Do it right here.
- Here?
- Hey?
Is this enough?
- Plenty.
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.
- And for you?
- Another beer.
I'd better not mix anymore.
"Well, okay."
Give me both.
- What time is it?
- Late.
Get up.
They gave us a car while they fix ours.
FAIR WAGES
I heard last night the girls wanted to leave town.
- People talk a lot when they drink.
- And go where?
Anywhere.
Their father wasn't very happy with them.
Rocio.
Give these gentlemen some wine.
Say when.
When.
- For you?
"- No, thank you."
Smells good.
What is it?
- River crabs.
- Spicy?
- So what now?
- Which is their bedroom?
May I?
She brought me some milk.
There.
Do you want me to give you some?
"No, thank you kindly."
She brought it for you.
I think Farhad dug Biston on his own.
Do you know him?
Yes.
"He's a local, he lives three miles away."
A local?
Well done.
But it wasn't Farhad who dug Biston.
I know.
Who then?
It was love.
The love of Shirin.
Bravo.
You know love too.
A man without love cannot live.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Where are you going?
"As usual, we're going to eat strawberries."
- Where's Jahan?
"- Sleeping, as usual."
You'll bring him back?
"You know, he doesn't eat strawberries."
Who called?
- Mrs Godarzi.
- What did she say?
Greetings.
She wanted news.
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.
I'll see you out.
"Thanks, Leo."
I won't forget.

You kept Dragan to yourself.
Was that wrong?
"Don't they say, it takes two to tango?"
We're not dancing anymore.
"Anyway, he was a bum lead."
How do you know?
I know.
That's all.

-Did we do it?
-l think so.
-Will I die?
"-No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
(GRUNTlNG)
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Oh!
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.

No.

"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
"Stay with him, Stoke, stay with him!"
"Oh, it's a high fly ball, folks, right along third-base line."
Palmer is after it.
He's after it.
He's got it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Let me see that cut!
Stoker's through!
He's through!
How many more beatings do you have to take?
Better lay down.
Better than having your brains knocked out.

Lay down.
Lay down!

Let them fight!
What a switch!
Stoker gave him one under Nelson's chin!
- Knocked him right over the ropes!
"- You got him, Stoker!"
"Hold on, Nelson!"
"Stop him, Nelson!"
"You got him, Stoker!"
You got him!
Stoker!
Stoker!
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
"Dimmy, why do you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"

Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into a coma.
You're not my mother!
Don't listen.

"No, not at all."
Come right in.
I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.
"Pleased to meet you, Sullivan."
I know all about you.
You're okay.
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.
- Where you stopping?
"- A room at my old neighborhood on Dock Street, number 24."
"Well, I'll blow now."
"I'll drop up, say, Monday?"
- Monday?
That'll be fine.
- I'm going downtown.
I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks.
"- See you later, Jim."
Monday.
Get me Steve.
There's a fella leaving with Mac.
I want you to...
Find him and fix it.
"Yes, sir."
Consider it done.
Good morning.
How are you?
Good.
Excellent.
This is Allan Campbell.
"Hello, Allan."
Do you know who this is?
Uh...
No...
"You're forgetting me already, Allan?"
"Listen, you know, like I said, I'll..."
I'll get you the money.
It's just a matter of time.
"Well, that's great."
Can you do it today?
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I have a promotion today."
"And after that happens, then I got it all covered."
"The next time I see you, you better have my money."
"Yeah, no, I understand."
And I appreciate it.
Congrats on your career.
Thanks.
"Oh, shit."
Fuck.

We're still in Ree territory.
He's one of our own men.

We're all going to come out of the building now.
Please tell everybody not to shoot.
I'll go with you.
All right.
They're coming down.
She says she'll come with us if we let the others go.
Everybody set?
- Mary...you can't do this.
She'll pick you up later.
Don't go!
Maria!
Where are you?
"Hold on, Quico."
Come back already!
Now you can blow out the candles.
Should I make a wish first?
"Sure, my darling."
Help!
Get me away from here!
Well done.
Let's eat the cake now.
Doesn't your doll get a piece?
She doesn't know how to eat.
You never talk to me.
- Talk about what?
- Anything.
"I put together this huge party for you, yet you don't say a word to me."
Tell me what's on your mind.
- When?
- Now.
Where is my mom?
Where is my dad?
What?
Where are my mom and dad?
- Time for your presents!
"- Tell me, grandma."
"What, darling?"
Where are my mom and dad?
I told you already.
They left you with me.
"Stay calm, everyone!"
Hey!
Meeting adjourned.
"Ho, boy!"
Will you take a look at all those presents?
I can't see a thing.
"Yes, sir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure."
-Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
"-Oh, for crying out loud."
"-They're all in boxes, you idiot."
-They're getting bigger.
"Wait, there's a nice little one over there."
Hi!
"-Spell, trash can."
-We're doomed!
All right!
All right!
"If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?"
-Yes!
Yes!
We promise!
-Okay!
Save your batteries.
"Very good, Woody."
That's using the old noodle.
"Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs."

Beautiful.
"Okay, boys, let's eat."
"Come on, Johnny, Vinnie."

"You got to go on a diet, Vinnie."
Read 'em and weep.

"Alright, I'll catch you guys later."
"Yeah, you going for a walk in the park?"
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.

"-Nope, that's it."
Have a good weekend.
Thanks Henry.
You girls stay right here.
-Hold hands.
-Go right up front.
What are you talking about?
I saw her name on the register.
Jesus Christ!
You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?
Go.
Please.
Go.
"Hey, Allen."
I'm good.
"I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money."
"Sure, I can hold on a sec."
Seth!
I'm up here!
You get the bus ticket?
You're not going anywhere.
"What are you doing here, man?"
What are you doing with my girlfriend?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nothing.
Tell me.
Or I'll kill you.
Then kill me and quit talking about it.
"Dude, this place is on fire!"
We gotta go!
"Let's go, man!"
Run!
I thought basketball season was over.
"No, this is ESPN Classic."
They play all old games.
It's the Lakers-Pistons.

You remember watching this.
You were pregnant... you were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
You go.
"Sadhana, go!"
"Vikram, he..."
Turn the car back!
This is Varun.
- How many times do I call you!
Where are they?
- I'm not able to track either of their numbers.
Both numbers are switched off.
- Okay.
Track my number.
- Your number?
Your number?
Why are you talking nonsense?
I said 'track my number.'
Did you?
Yes.
On Perundurai road...
It is showing some location off the main road
You are moving in the right direction.
"Priya, what happened?"
Vikram!
- Why has he stopped the car?
I don't know.
- Where are we?
I've have no clue.
- Priya!
Priya!
- Leave me!
Leave me!
- Leave her!
"Priya, where are you?"
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
- Grandma?
- I didn't know you.
"Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms."
The showis underway.
"Please, get out."
- I'm Marcia's mother.
- What?
My apologies.
- I didn't know.
- Thank you.
"Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit."
I brought you some very tasty treats.
Here.
Do you like it?
It's all yours.
- All of it?
- All yours.
Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?
Marcia will be right over to see you.
"Great, thanks."
"Hang tight, sweetie."
Mommy is on her way.
"The crowd is waiting, Barbuda!"
"There's more here, darling."
More?
"Yes, and it's all yours."
Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.

"He's not tall, but he's young."
Philip.
"Philip, get over here."
"No, now, as quick as you can."
Get here now.
"So there was these two old men sitting in deck chairs on the beach, and one of them turns to the other and he says, ""It's nice out today,"""
"and the other one says, ""Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."""
(LAUGHTER)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hey, let's hope it's a boy!"
Huh?

Wise.
"And also rich, which helps."
"Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich."
"- Okay, you're welcome."
Where's your car?
Okay.
I'm gonna wear the hat.
"Oh, you are?"
"This way, ladies."
Okay.
Do I look like a lady?
It's tough to tell in this light.
[ Laughs ]
"Bobby Pin and Rutledge's lost brother had a ram, which was ironic, yet somehow fitting."
"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.

Okay.
Okay.

"You're my kid, see?"
Joey!
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
"You'll get that into your head right now, or-"
"Please, don't!"
"Don't, Joe!"
You're getting all sick again!
Please!
Guess this will have to wait.
Now you've hurt your sore eye.
Here-
I've got some adhesive in my emergency pocket.
I'll just clean it up a little.
"Here's your medal, Kid."
"I can't now, I'm too busy."
I'll keep it for you.
"Well, we got a croaker."
Always come in handy in our family

Honey child!
He's back!
"Oh, my darling's back!"
My boy!
Look behind you!
"The giant, it's attacking!"
It's stomping the town!
I was right!
- Sweet mother of God.

I am not a gun.
"Hey, Mom."

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Let's get out of here!
Run!
(GASPS)
Hey.
Stop!
There's a kid in his hands!
Stop shooting!
Kent!
He only reacts defensively.
"If you don't shoot, he's harmless."
You gotta tell the General!
"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.
I'll take care of it.
He says the monster's killed a kid.
"Sir, we must stop it at all costs."
Go to code red.
I'm Matt's Elena backup.
I'm your Bonnie backup.
Now it's about me and Bonnie?
You don't get it.
Why would you?
You're everyone's first choice.
Piece of cake.
You know what?
Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Caroline.
You all right?
"- Lf it's not vampires, it's girlfriends."
- Mm.
"All right, roast beef, turkey."
What do you want?
"Oh, let's do the works."
Pile it high.
"All right, I like your style."
Will you grab the bread for me?
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- Just a cut.
Will you hand me that towel?
I can't.
"You got a problem with blood, Anna?"
Mm-mm.
What's the matter?
"It's just blood, Anna."
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.
You were there?
Yep.
"You know, before I touched down here, I moved around a lot."
"New Orleans, New York, Chicago."
Been here the longest.
Ah!
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Ahh.
Yo?
I'm stripes.
That's right.
What?
You're kidding me.
"No, no, I can't switch shifts with you."
I've been drinking.
"Oh, you could tell?"
All right.
"All right, thank you very much."
All right.
"I've never seen anything like that, Tyler."
That's all I'm saying.
"Well, you're right."
It was insane.
"All right, Cory."
"Tony, please?"
Just keep 'em coming.
"You know, I could be wrong,"
But I think they call that self-medicating.
I'm a trained professional.
"- I'll have what he's having, Tony."
Whoa!
Yes.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha!
Bleah!
Oh!
Wow.
What is this place?
Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."
"Well, they all did."
My sister?
Danielle.
"You mentioned her earlier, no?"
- No.
- Oh.
"It must have been Simon, then."
He talks about you a lot.
Thanks for the dance.
Anytime.

Sorry.
I-I think I had too many mojitos.
I just... needed to lie down.
"Well, I hope tonight wasn't a complete waste."
Did you at least manage to have some fun?
"- I mean, Blanca's great."
- Mm.
"And Hector's, uh..."
He's an acquired taste.
What did you and Blanca talk about?
Honestly... you.
She said she'd never seen you so happy.
She's right.
I've never met a woman like you... ever.
And I don't think I ever will again.
I'm sorry.
Is that too forward?
I'm looking forward to your execution.

"Well, the largest you have, surely."
12-bore.
"How many, sir?"
50?
"No, I think you'd better make it a thousand."
- A thousand?

- Yes.
But didn't you say a day's rough shooting?
"Yes, I did, er..."
and it may be pretty rough.
"On second thoughts, I think you'd better make it 1,500, perhaps?"
Right.

You left her alone with a stranger?

I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
.
When do you think is she coming back?
-Wait a second.
-Oh sure!
-Just a minute.
"-Oh my, the foods are delicious!"
You should've tried everything!
When it gets cold it won't be as tasty anymore.
"You like that, right?"
.
Oh my!
I'm really excited for you.
You two can now make a family!
"Oh, don't mind me!"
I didn't see you in the church a while ago.
"It's just, I looked for you."
-My wife is so beautiful.
-You're really such a joker.
-But it's not that.
-Here you go again.
-Oh come on!
-Really!
So Joy...
Where are we?
"So, does it mean you're the only one who has surprises for me?"
.
Is that okay?
Is that okay?
.
Is that okay?
-It's beautiful!
-I told you!
That's it.
What are you doing?
There.
What?
What is it?
Stop.
They had to remove it in hospital.
They're dangerous.
Liar!
They had to.
They had no...
Admit that it's a lie.
"Just cut me loose, please."
(footsteps departing )
Stop.
Stop!

"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
MARIE:
He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'll give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!

She's had...
She's been married twice!
She's been fucking married twice!
Why didn't you tell me?
What a god awful movie... I don't like nature films...
Gé... I've had Gé... I'll try Henk.
Hello Henky!
I'm the first talking goldfish.
Another one!
Another wedding?
She didn't tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Three times why didn't you tell me?
Married three times...
What a mess!
I'd prefer porn!
I'm in there too...
"Tiddle-dee, tiddle-door, who is number four?"
"Christine, darling..."
What's this?
What are you doing here?
"Sorry, I thought you were Christine."
The back's the same.
- Malakai ?
Are you all right ?
"- Yeah, yeah, man."
Anybody catch one ?
"It ain't over, bitch."
"I don't even know why it started, bitch."
'Cause you always in my way.
I'm only in your way when it comes to Derek.
That's what this is about.
"No, it's about you."
White girls like you.
"Creepin' up, takin' our men."
"The whole world ain't enough, you got to conquer ours too."
"Whatever, Nikki."
"Derek and I like each other, and if you have a problem with that, screw you."
[Train Clacking]
[KnockAt Door] I'll get it.
- [Knocking]
"- Yeah, I'm coming."
"- Oh, hi."
- Shit !
- l'm okay.
- Wait.
Let me see.
I'm really okay.
I'm fline.
"Well, what did she do ?"
"Um, now is really not a good time to talk."
- Okay.
Well-- - l'll call you.
"Oh, no."
"Here, let me see."
But it's not yours to keep.
Great!
Really great.
And so began our summer with Tetra.
"He lived in my closet like an old friend, ...who'd been there for years."
"Hello, Misaki!"
Hello.
Is Yusuki home?
He's been in his room all morning ...just go on in.
Anybody home?
Whassup...
"How is he, Yusuki?"
I'm so sorry!
You gave me a fright.
Didn't you hear me?
Sorry.
"But boy, you scared me!"
My heart's thumping.
Stuff for Tetra.
Thanks.
Here's the aluminum.
How about this?
Let's ask Tetra!
Choose what you need.
He's so cute!
He likes that.
What's he making?
Dunno.
"But there's lots of parts, ...and he's real quick."

"OK, and buddy, that comb over,"
It's not fooling anyone.
"Good luck, God bless."
"Good night, new York."
"Hey, what's up, man?"
This your car?
"Yeah, it's cool, right?"
Sorry?
The car.
"It's cool, right?"
You know what color that is?

I just got tired earlier.
Would you like me to take you home?
.
"That is if it's okay with you, Bela."
Don't worry about me.
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Bela is beautiful, isn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, and she's kind."
She's really kind.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Not really but I just didn't know she was your ex.
Come on Joy!
"Joy, Joy..."
Listen to me.
Listen...
"Don't ever think about her, okay?"
She's gone.
"She's past, as in already erased."
It's gone.
And you...
You are my present and my future.
It's only you.
Is that okay?
-What?
Want to go inside?
"-No, I still have duty tomorrow."
-Are you sure?

-I might lack sleep.
Go ahead.
- He's in the next room.
- So the chocolate was for him?
- Mel...
- It was a retropharyngeal hematoma.
- What?
I snuck a look at his CT results.
- So he wasn't choked.
- No.
It happened earlier.
Probably from the fall.
I need to go.
My place after shift?
Sure.
Why not?
- I was getting worried.
- I can't do this.
- What?
"Tash, stop..."
"- Griff, just stop."
That's my sponsor.
I texted her.
"- What, you're in the program all of a sudden?"
"- Yeah, I am."
Come on!
I was sober for 8 months
- before you showed up at my door tonight.
"- Tash, listen."
"We can work out the whole stripping thing,"
"I was being an idiot, OK?"
Don't leave!
"If you leave, I'll have nothing."
We have a future.
"Baby, I'm thirsty."
Give me your drink.
Please.
One sip.
It's poison.
It was a joke.
"Okay, he.."
He caught me on that.
"- But everyone copies my style, baby."
- Please.
- Everybody.
- You can flaunt your style...
But I'll be the one taking her home.
Wow!

I have found out everything.
Are you thinking about him?
Are you drunk?
It's a ladies' loo.
You'll get beaten up.
"No, I am not going anywhere."
I am missing you a lot.
"Anyway, I won't be able to meet you for a week."
Why a week?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello.
"Oh, it's you."
I...
"I'm awful sorry, Skeets, that I didn't talk to you in the lab, but, you see, Aunt Nancy was watching."
"Oh, that's okay, Wilbur."
"Are you going to dance with me tomorrow night, Wilbur?"
"Sure, I'd like that."
You like to dance?
"Oh, gee, I..."
I'd rather dance than eat.
Would you like to see a real good step?
"Oh, I'd love to, Wilbur."
All right.
"Real gone, man."
"Oh, that was nothing."
I could dance a lot better if I had music.
"Hey, wait a minute."
I got a portable radio in my room!
Yeah?
Only it's against the rules for me to leave the switchboard.

There is logic?
-Geir Tangen is on the line.
This is not the best time.
-And About Zana ...
-I do not think she was in shoals.
It was a professional as the gunman.
She would not escape.
Or be released.
What if she has been freed before?
-So How she made it to the E6?
She wanted to find her father.
Were you looking for me?
Not here!
You brought your stuff?
The car is there.
Why do you not answer me?
-The Battery is dead.

Perhaps it's a momentary relief from the existential terrors of existence.
- Oh.
What?
Thank you.
Okay.
See as I gently pulsate.
Okay...
"Trying to go deeper and deeper, and bring her deeper and deeper into a stretch, yes?"
"Okay, Fabio, that's enough of the pulsating."

What about PlayStation2?
No way!

What?
Just let me have your shirt.
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.

You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.
"Okay, well, I did."
"And now I need your shirt, please."
Just...

Spill anything on your pants?
"You want me to give you those, too?"
Come on.

Do you think it's going to come up on the show tomorrow?

He's perfectly normal.

"All right, off you go."
I'll see what I'll do.
Thanks anyhow.
Good-bye.
Take care.
All right.
Hello.
Have a good day.
I've brought water from the spring.
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.
I'll put it here!
I'll get breakfast.
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.
"Yesterday, I asked your sister to bring us milk."
She probably forgot.
It was me.
"No, I spoke to your sister."
"No, it was me."
- lt was you?
- Yes.
She was pregnant.
I was pregnant.
It was you?
"Yes, in person."
Seriously!
"Yes, I've had the baby and I've come back here to work."
Where is it?
- ls that your baby?
Whoo!

"Grown into a fine man, yes, sir."

"Yes, and he dropped the charges."

"-Well, what am I supposed to do?"
Hello.
Okay.
He asked me to come in.
My daughter!
- Stop!
Don't hurt her.
Have you brought the money?
Who is that?
!
Who is the that?
!
He is someone I know.
Just give him the money.
They might hurt her.
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?
How much?
- It's not cash.
It's jewellery.
Jewellery?
Are you mocking me?
I asked for cash.
Are you trying to trap me with the jewels?
"Oldie, looks like you don't want your daughter back alive!"
Leave her!
Time out!
Collect her pieces and go!
The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.

People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.

"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."

"Connor, come in."
I don't see him.
How long has it been?
Just a few minutes.
Did he forget how to pick a lock?
That's not a rhetorical question.
"Yeah, no, I agree."
That's a fair question.
Hang on.
You stay in the van.
You don't need to bring that.
You're not the boss.
"Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there."
"No, we got this, all right."
"It just, something's not right."
"Stay put, stick with the plan."
"Blair, can you hear me?"

He's downstairs.
Apparel was half-off at the gift shop.
Oh.
"So glad you finally made it, bro."
"Thanks for being here, man."
"Yeah, man."
I got this scene under control.
She's at nine centimeters... and I'm at 16.
Why are you two holding hands?
They slept together.
You will do anything to steal focus.
"Okay, we're getting close now."
I'm gonna need you to push.
The breathing's not working.
I don't think I can do this.
Rub her back.
Get her some ice chips.
Rub her back with ice chips.
"Oh, I'm passing out."
What?
He's passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
Oh!
"Okay, yeah, get him out of here."
"In fact, everybody out."
But...
Yeah.
"Bye, everyone."
Come on.
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
- Hey.
- Dad!
"- Hey, pal."
- Hi.

Mind if I use your bathroom?
I've got to make a pit stop.
Not a full pit stop-- just an oil change.
I'm going to pee.
So do you like the zipper bags better than the pinchy kind?
We don't have to do the small talk.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Okay.
"Buddy, put your backpack on."
"Okay, have a good day at school."
"I'll call you tonight to tell you that I love you and to say good night, okay?"
"Okay, Mom."
I love you.
"Oh, that is so sweet."
Reminds me of my mom.
Not that you're as old as my mom.
My mom is young.
She looks great.
You look great.

"- Great, great, great."
"- Bye, Mom."

Oh.

I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."

You have Ben's phone?
"Yes, I do."
"Oh, no, did you tell him that you know?"
"Yeah, but I told him, uh, Dylan's dad told me."
Oh.
Thank you.
"No, thank you for telling me."
You did the right thing.
And I just wanted to let you know you don't need to come over.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Thanks.

Hi!
Come in.
I want you to meet my parents.
I never smoked weed.
Marijuana.
Thank you for the clarification.
And I've never had a drink.
Filipino parents are very strict.
What time would you like me to bring your daughter home?
We haven't said she can go out with you yet.

Get up.
"Henry, right?"
- Please.
Don't...
- Shut up.
"What do you like the new, you?"
Did I interrupted the procedure?
Can Henry not talk?
"No, you..."
You can't.
No.
"Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here might have built you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
Nice to meet you Timothy.
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Why?
Because I don't.
What was it?
"""What happens to the Good and Evil"
"""on Judgement Day?"""
That's obvious.
The Good go to hell and the Evil to heaven.
- ls that right?
- Yes.
No.
"The Good go to heaven, the Evil go to hell."
"Hurry in and write that, then come back."
Off you go.
Help yourself to tea if you want.
What?
Help yourself to tea if you want.
- You want some too?
"- No, not for me."
Do you want tea?
No.
You're a coward if you come back.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
May your wish come true.
Mother says the invalid ate the soup.
Put the bowl over there.
"Hello, Farzad."
- Are you well?
- Yes.

- To school.

- Come on.
I've been to the Biesbosch.
I can't come along.
To kill an old man...
Oh yes.
You drink too much.
You're taking a cure here.
"That's a drag, ok."
But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
Breathe.
Melitta!
"Melitta, breathe."
"Melitta, breathe!"
No!
Domina.
Melitta...
The wine...
It was the wine.
Take her.
Oenomaus must not know she came to your cell.
She was never with you.

You know the drill.
No large purchases.
No boats.
No cars.
"No down payments on that dream condo down in Boca, huh?"
Nothing that'll red flag I.A. or the I.R.S.
Where's Kate?
Right behind you.
You're late.
I had to cover my tracks.
Your fiance still in the dark?
Good girl.
Let's keep it that way.

Opposite.
You?

"Lie down, chill out, make yourself at home."
"Yeah, wake up and find all my credit cards gone."

That gavver?
- Gavver?
- Smurf.
Billy Filth.
"Cos you're obviously not one of them, no offence whatever."
No offence taken.
"Well, um... it's a long story."
So give me the edited highlights.
OK.

"Look here, governor."

"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

Help!
Police!

Weird?
"He looks a bit strange, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Did you talk to him?
A bit.
At least he gave you free tickets.
Right.
So do you want to come?
I can't.
Marco's coming.
"You don't like Marco, do you?"
"Yes, I do."
It's just that...
I don't really understand what he wants.
From me?
No... just generally.
"Sometimes I don't know, either... if he's honest."
-Would you give me the friggin lighter.
Jacob let me do it.
"Don't hit anyone, Hyder."

Lvan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
"Actually, I wouldn't..."
I wouldn't mind if we just cemented over the ocean.
I hate fish.
"Speaking of oceans, who wants to take a dip?"
Oh!
"- Yeah, now we're talking."
- Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to swoop.
I feel like such a man right now.
Oh.
"Guys, you might wanna start small,"
- because I just put a piece in...
- Oh.
- And I'm already buzzing.
- Whoo!
"Is that mint, or is that just, like, coffee?"
I'm buzzing really hard right now.
That's good.
"Oh, my brain hurts a little."
I'm tingling.
We should s'go right now.
S'go!
- S'go!
- Yeah.
Ooh.
[Grunting]
"Yeah, baby!"
"Oh, this song..."
- Actually sucks pretty bad.
Ooh!
Now all we gotta do is find it.
Oh...
"Let's go, Larry."
Very good.
"Yes, here we are."
No one sees us.
"Good, good."
Yes.
"Okay, Larry."
Here we go.
Let's go.
That's good.
Okay.
Oh.
Larry.
"Oh, pardon my vigor."
"Now, Larry, if we meet any other boaters, let me do the talking."
"Hang on, Larry, I'll be right back."
"Don't go anywhere, lover."
Everything will be fine.
"I've got everything under control, Larry."
One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
"Ah, there we are, perfect."
"Okay, Larry, here we go."
"Help me out here, Lar."
Scooch over.
That's good.
Okay.
What?
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Larry."
Of course you'll still be attractive to me after the autopsy.
"Yes, to Lázaro Cárdenas."
How long is it going to take?
OK.
Bye.
How much money do you think the Old Lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"Yeah, it's really good."
It's like...
It comes out sizzling.
Sizzling?
"Yeah, it'II..."
It'll save your life.
It's amazing.
Weird.
It'll definitely help with physics.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you gonna get?
Hi.
I didn't know you were...
Didn't know you were working today.
This is a surprise.
"Yeah, shift change."
"So, can I start you all, you know, with some water before I come and take your order?"
It sounds great to me.
Yeah.
Just water.
All right.
Just working on some physics here.
"So, we need some..."
"Go, move."
"Chin, go, go, go."
I got you covered.
Stay down.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Craig?
I wanna see him.
Please?
Dana.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."
- That's good.
- Bad news is you lost Mary.
"Sorry, she confused me with a Jedi mind trick."

I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.
Drop the bat.

- You are lookin' peaked.
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
"No, you did not."
I need you to go to the top of those stairs up there.
Don't come down until your mommy comes to get you.
- Don't come down?
-Don't come down.
Can you do that?
"Be brave, okay?"
Okay.

We have to open this.
"Uriah, I need your help."
Go.
ERIC:
Hey!
Look who decided to show up.
It's really good to see you again.
"All right, folks."
Nothin' to be nervous about.
Just a little routine inspection.
Then we can all go back to our business.
Hello.
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
"Divergent,"
-10%.
-Hmm.
Shit.
"I thought you meant ""career"" with a dollar sign."
I think we need more.
"Fireworks, shooting guns."
Maybe we need to get arrested.
"Yeah, that might be a little bit problematic for some of my younger, more impressionable fans."
"I have a lot of those, I'm told."
Hi.
Ashley. (CLICKS TONGUE)
"Oh, my God."
Hi.

- I think we should get into a fight.
For the article.
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.
"- He's dead, David."
- Shut up!
But you made it out all right?
Come on.
"- David, if you leave..."
- One more word from you...!
Dad!
- Dad!
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.
"- [SUSAN] Ready, OK, open."
"- [LING] Oh, my room!"
My room!
I love it!
"Oh, my god."
Come here!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
I'm calling Bender!
[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
We've found the medal.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
What?
Wait.
"Oh, what, you want a photograph?"
Thank you.
That's not what I had in mind.
What?
"Just hang on a second, will you?"
Hello.
What is it?
Uh...
Hm.
What's that?
That's neat.
Neat?
Yeah.
Huh.
At last.
"At last, it's wonderful."
Let's get out of here.
All in good time.
I must take a closer look at this ingenious...device.
Absolutely marvelous workmanship.
Fiendishly clever.
"Eh, what sort of trap do you suppose it sets off?"
No.
Hey.
"I'll entertain any ideas, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
"Condom in the eye, Waterfalls."
She's a classic.
She's a cla...
She's still around.
He has no idea.
He knows.
"No, that's okay if you don't know who Rihanna is, Adam."
"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.
I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.
- Right.
- Excited.
Do... what do you think?
Poker Face.
That's a hit of her's.
One word or two words?
- I don't know.
-Your way!
-Make your way
"Come, Erik."
Let's dance.
-Erik.
-My little one!
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!
"Sure, let's go."
I can't figure this out anyway.
Reinhold's a fine young man.
"We can all be wrong about people sometimes, you know?"
Let's go.
- You go.
I'll be right there.
All right.
See you later.
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
But first we're picking up two guys.
I can't be gone long.
Cilly's waiting.
We'll go get her later.
Good Lord!
She'll be furious!
Henschke?
Henschke.
Isn't Reinhold here?
They all drove off together.
- What about Biberkopf?
- Him too.
What's wrong?
"Why so upset, Miss Cilly?"
They just want to have a little fun.
Nothing wrong with that.
- What's wrong?
- What if Franz messes things up?
We've just gotta help him.
"God, I'm thirsty!"
The boys are waiting.
Taylor.
They abolished slavery.
"Excellent, excellent."
Liam.
There were no executions.
"Yes, that's true."
Joanna.
Men and women were treated as equals.
"That's right, that's right."
"At the back, Sam."
"They believed in peace, not war."
Absolutely right.
"Now can you tell me, what was the Treasure of Atlantis?"
Knowledge.
I can't hear you.
Knowledge.
I still can't hear you.
Knowledge!
Absolutely correct.
Knowledge.
You are all my brightest students.
"All right, come here."
Stand right here.
There.
Tell me you don't hear it.
I don't hear it.
Wait a second.
"Okay, now."
You don't hear that?
I don't hear it.
It's humming.
-l'll think about it.
"But it'll cost you, Hill."
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
- I hardly think so.
- Oh.
Let me introduce myself.
"My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and this is Miss Right."
"Oh, congratulations!"
"No, no."
That's her name.
Her name?
"Oh, how do you do?"
Yes...
Would you care for a glass of sherry while you wait?
"Yes, please."
"Er, has Mrs Ransom been a widow very long?"
"Oh, yes."
Many years.
Yes.
"Many, many, years."
Her poor husband died out east in rather mysterious circumstances.
- Oh?
- Yes.
"Drowned, poor fellow."
- Oh!
- Flora was in England at the time.
Oh.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
That may be she.
She's... (Chuckles) She's apt to forget her keys.
Let me do the talking.
"Good morning, sir."
Mrs Ransom?
"She's out but we expect her back, if you'd care to come in."
"Wags, not too far behind with five."
"This time, I'm looking for two answers to get the points."
"Wags, over to you."
Find...
Reveal the hive.
I can see femur there...
But I can't see leg...
Thigh...
Thigh...
Femur...
"No, there's no thigh."
"So, er, clavicle..."
Three points now.
Shoulder is there.
Shoulder.
Shoulder and...
What's the...?
Scapula!
Yeah.
Your answers?
It's shoulder and scapula.
Show me your first letters.
For two points...
"Scapula and shoulder, very well done, excellent."
"Lutrophiles, over to you."
Find...
What have we got?
Minerva and Athena?
"Are they there, though?"
Minerva and...
"Oh, where's Athena?"
Athena...
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)
"- Get that, our kid."
- I don't get calls.
- Further your people skills!
Yeah.
"Oh, right, hang on."
It's for you.
"- Troy, it's for you!"
- It can't be.
- It is.
It's for you!
- I don't get calls.
"Well, you're getting this one."
It's Donna.
Your wife.
Oh.
"Hiya, Donna."
- How's the wife?
- She wants me to move back in with her.
Oh.
"- D'you fancy it, or?"
- Aye.
Suppose.
- Best pack me bag.
- Yeah.
Suppose you best had.
Yes!
See me after the show.
I'll tell you more.
"I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you."
Let's cooperate.
I'll send you out of the country afterward.
They'll never get you.
But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed.
- Mayor!
- Congratulations!
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat please!
"Have a few more drinks, Marshal."
I'll get myself drunk alright.
I've got to see Chiu at the theatre.
- I'll come along.
- Stay here!
"Ah Foon, but..."
But what?
You think I'll die?
What are we?
- Friends.
- Right.
Take revenge if I die.
What are you doing?
This is my family charm.
Take it.
Superstitious!
Wait for me!
Go to hell!
Mr. Chiu!
Substitution!
Help yourself!
What do you mean going off and leaving Regan by herself?
Are you crazy?
Her window's wide open!
-Didn't he tell you?
-Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Nobody was here.
"When I went to get the Thorazine I had him stay with her, and...."
-I should have known better.
-I guess you should have!
How were the tests?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
"Hi, Chuck."
Come on in.
I suppose you heard.
Heard what?
You haven't heard.
Burke is dead.
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.
"By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck."
"Oh, God!"
"Yeah, I know."
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
It's him.
"It's him, he's my friend."
"Here, hold onto it."
For your son.
Don't lose it.
"Don't lose it, Pedro."
Well?
How about that drink?
You're a hero now.
Your photos.
There's somebody else but you can't see who.
It's just a spot.
To Truman Capote.
To Truman Capote.
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him.
It was an accident.
A gift.
This enlargement came out better.
Taken the day the girl was killed at the protest.
They called him the Crow.
He alone tortured over 100 people.
And he was the best at it.
"Take care, Pedro."
Jesus made us some food for the road.
"- Here, I owed you this."
- What is it?
Bambi stew.
- Watch yourself.
- You too.
"We're good, right?"
Not even a fountain...
It doesn't matter now.
Tell me everything tomorrow.
- If she needs...
"- Don't wake her up, here's the key."
- Do you know him?
- Me?
No.
- He went like this.
- No.
- Is that the truth?
"- Yes, bye."
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you everything tomorrow.
"No, I wanted to tell you that... nothing."
- Tell me tomorrow.
- There's nothing to tell!
- Nothing?
- 20 kilometers...
- Not even a fountain?
- Not even a drop of water.
"- Bye, goodnight!"
- Bye!
Just one kiss?
Bye!
- Nicolino!
- Yeah?
- Come here.
"- Nicolino, look at this!"
"- ""Femme de chambre""."
- Translate it.
"- It means maid, doesn't it?"
[LAUGHS]
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.
"Oh, please, give me another chance."
I just couldn't stand it.
Couldn't...
I can't do any more time.
"Please, turn me out of here."
We'll do what we can for you.
Go along now.
Next man.
[¶¶¶]
I don't know.
I don't know anything about it.
Honest.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
That's the truth.
"You gotta believe me, fellas."
I'm waiting.
I don't know.
"Don't, Stacey, don't."
"All right, I'll tell!"
Spill it!
"It was Carlisle, Polecat Carlisle."
Hanley had him do it.
I didn't have no part in it.
I just fingered him.
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.
Polecat.
Yeah.
"- Hi, girls."
- Hi.
Look who I found!
"Hi, Simon!"
- Can I have a drink?
- Have mine.
- So sweet.
- As always.
So I'd noticed.
Too strong?
- Where's my sister?
- Sofie?
- I haven't seen her for days.
- We thought she was with you.
Hasn't she been home?
"Tommy, my top was brand new."
I told you to come on my tummy.
You've ruined it.
- Dry clean it.
- In the middle of the night?
- Look what Tommy did!
- I told you to use a rubber.
- He didn't want to.
- Wear this.
- Josephine's got a bottle for us.
- You forgot something.
What?
- Give me a break.
- What's up with you?
I'm not kissing a sperm mouth.
It was your sperm.
- I'm not a fucking faggot.
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
"Jesus, Reznik."
Just wanna talk to you.
Hey come back.
"Reznik, Reznik!"
Reznik!
Trevor?
"Oh, no."
"Trevor, what happened?"
"Trevor, it's okay."
"Oh God, what happened?"
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.
Did he stop?
"No, he just kept going."
He fucking hit 'n run drivers man.
He gotta be hanged.
It was my fault.
I wasn't paying attention.
"Trevor, I gotta get you to a hospital."
You may have some internal injuries.
It's just bruises.
"Okay, you see this?"
"This is a bruise, and this is a train wreck, alright?"
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?
I trust you.
Now I know you're crazy.
Can I stay here tonight?
"Baby, you can stay here every night."
"Hey, my veil is the same as yours."
"Oh, you're right."
It is.
You're very pretty.
Thank you.
Are you the boy?
Yes.
You don't look as pretty as the bride.
Bye.
Bye.
Story of my life.
Ok.
Come on.
"Hey, are you waiting for them?"
If you could give us a ride I'll make it worth your while.
"Listen, Dale."
I'm too tired to drive.
Will you drive my car home?
Seven...
Ok.
Boy schmoy.
Dale.
Catch.
Hey.
Hey.
"No more douchebag boyfriends semi relationships, and keeping people at an emotional arms length."
I just wanted to say-
"No, wait."
"Sure, I'm putting myself at risk again."
But I'm finally ready to face an uncertain but promising future.
"You were right, Holly."
Because...
I'm having an asthma attack... from the stress !
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, my God."
Do you have an inhaler ?
Or like an Epi pen ?
I could stab you.
Maybe... we could just...
"sing ""Night Moves"" ?"
I think it might calm me.
Really ?
Please.
Uh.. uh... uh...

* She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes *
That's good.

His money.
"Your money, I don't do anything."

"No, no, no."
"Fold it, fold it, fold it."
"And then again, this way."
Crease it.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like this.
"Yeah, yeah, good, good, good."
"Here, so if I rub the twenty, just like this, here."
"Can you see, your twenty?"
- Yeah.
- Look.
"If I rub the twenty against the one, see, the ink'll start to change."
See?
"Here, you see your twenty?"
"I'm going to give you my one, but look."
If I just place the little piece on top like this and I do that.
"See, now, actually--"
No...
I kinda messed up.
George:
Oh!
That's a--
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.

A little spying.
"Spying, on who?"
On Gretchen.

Mr. Miles?
Yeah.
Bob?
Yeah.
He's in the Army?
"Well, sure."
He's in the reserves.
"Gee, now, if they called him back to active duty, then Nancy and me..."
What?
"Oh, I was just wondering to myself."
How come he wasn't called back?
"Well, read this."
It's from Gretchen to Colonel Blair's wife.
You shouldn't read other people's mail.
That's not very nice.
Start the music.
What are you doing?
I'm not getting in the mood.
Come on.
Save me.
Save me.
Save me.
Help.

Get your self treated.
I've changed my doctor.
But Boss.
Trilok's contract is for tomorrow.
And tomorrow's Saturday.
Trilok!
Saturday means no work.
Only singing and dancing.
She was a nurse.
"No, thank you."
I'll do that.
I could probably get Miss Brody to come by.
- What?
- Emma Brody... the woman who received your daughter's cornea.
She says you've written to her.
No.
I never heard of Emma Brody.
Is this the place?
"Well, this is the right block... but... jeez, what a dump."
He said that the Davisons were at 523 South Sawyer.
"Well, there it is."
That's it.
That's it?
"Now, wait a minute."
We got to find a place to park here.
"OK, I'm gonna turn around up there... and park back there across the street."
"Oh, they've seen us."
This is good.
I'm gonna go.
Hold it.

You'll see me.
"Now, wait."
Hold on.
Hold...

"Hey, officer."
Mrs. Davison.
It's Emma Brody.

Yeah.
I don't really understand it all but that's what the doctor tells me.
"Oh, no, Al, faking or not, he's crossing the line here."
I if I wanna talk to JMJ...
Give him time.

JMJ?
Can you hear me JMJ?
Hello?
This could be thrown back in our face.
He's all over her.
We could get a law suit for sexual harassment.
This is the box.
He knows what he's doing.
He can't be second-guessed.
"Hello, JMJ?"
"Hell, Al, he's outta control."
You wanna stop it?
It's your call.
You are a mean son of a bitch.
Mean son of a bitch?

They found it floating in the river.
Castro.
Who was it?
I don't know.
We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.
Late means late.

I am calm.
You're the one who isn't!
Good morning.

"You're going back, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Klaus, we're gonna move you back to Bowmanville."
And I wanted to apologize.
How is your social life?
It's been a bit easier over the phone.
"Everything seems to indicate - that you have severe exhaustion, in other words, burnout."
Take one of these in the morning.
Things are a bit better now.
"Well, it varies, you see."
Any hobbies?
-No.
Relatives?
No.
Wife?
No.
There must be more to life than work.
Perhaps a small trip?
Doctor's orders.
I know where I could go.
And forget the fires for a while.
Look...
I've got one.
-You do?
This is part two.

"Oh, he's gonna kill me when he sees this, man."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:

Your bandages will be removed today.

"Varun, give it a try."
Slowly...
Try...
Are you able to see?
Can you see?
One.
Two.

Varun!
I was scared!
Let him take rest.
I'll come back later.
It's Sadhana.
Mom.
"That's why I am saying, dear."
The life that you were leading in Jaipur..

Well.
Take this.
What is this?

Read it.
And this is a diary.
"Dear, I just want you to begin a new life."
And record each moment of your life in this diary.
Okay?
"Yes, mom."
I will write.
Anything else?
"And yes, tell Pia I miss her a lot."
"Yes, mom."
"Mumbai, yeah!"
Come on.

Everything is fine.
Jaipur is still the same old Jaipur.
How are mom and dad?

Very good.
Yeah?

Two hours ago he was my boyfriend.
You will never change.
He's also lucky because of you.

"You know, the go-getters."
Then feature your Auntie Isabel.
-She's a breast cancer survivor.
-That's right.
And guess what she's doing now?
-She's good!
-That will do.
-Why don't you feature your mom instead?
"-Oh, never mind."
"Dad wait, how many years have you been with mommy?"
Is it 29?
"Ara, is it 29?"
That's sweet!
You know what?
I wish me and Joy are just like that too.
Wait a second.
"-Oh, are you going to tell us something?"
"-Yes, of course!"
Why won't I?
.
"Dad, wait."
"It's like this, actually..."
She said...
Brother.
"-You've been together for just 1 year, right?"
-Yes!
So what?
Are you sure about your decision?
.
This is really all I want in my life.
- Okay.
- Okay.
"Uh, just grab a couple of bottles of chardonnay."
I'll get the sandwiches.

The writing is super lyrical.
"Oh, not that chardonnay."
"Uh, could you see if there's any more Stags' Leap?"
"- Uh, I'd have a Merlot."
"- Oh, I'll have Merlot too."
Would you see if there's any bubble water in the fridge?
Yes.
"For you, a thousand times, yes."
Thank you.
"No, that's a line, um, uh, from the book."
He gets what he wants.
And I guess he wanted me.
You know what?
I've really missed you over the years.
Me too.
You know you're the only person I was ever able to talk to.
After Jesse...
Why didn't you contact me when you came back ?
"You know, no bullshit, Pru."
Just the real reason.
I don't know...
I just thought...
The past was better left there.
It's Slade.
Just checking to see if you're OK.
Where are you ?
I'm just out.
- Out where ?
- I'm just out with a friend.
A friend ?
"Yes, Slade, a friend."
I do have them.
Put her on.
Sorry ?
Pru.
Put her on.
"Hi, Pru."
How is he doing ?
He didn't seem too good the other night.
"Yeah he's fine, considering."
- Did he speak much about Jesse ?
- Not really.
"You had a date with Doc Migs, didn't you?"
.
"-Hey, what's happening to you?"
-Are you okay?
.
"Wait, I think I know it."
-Doc Migs proposed to you?
.
-Yes!
And...she accepted my proposal.
"-No more backing out, okay?"
-But she already said yes!
I'll fetch you after your shift.
"Make it fast, okay?"
.
"Wait, wait wait."
-Tell us how he proposed!
-Yes!
Come on!
Wow it's so beautiful!
"-Leonie, put my stuff in my car okay?"
.
"-Yes, Sir."
How are you?
"I see, you finally saw each other!"
How are you?
"The last time we e-mailed each other, you said you have a boyfriend, it's Ryan, isn't it?"
We've broken up.
I heard you're getting married in three months?
.
Why?
Don't you love me anymore?
You messed up my performance!
This is no time to dawdle.
W-what's going on?
How dare you destroy my daughters!
"You're not thinking you can leave this ship alive, are you?"
Ugh!
You look awful!
Damn you!
Laser...?
"I 'll give you some, too."
Here you go...
Kuya!
Damn you!
"Make it quick, Kuya!"
I'm not letting you get away!
I guess it's time for the star performer!
Dimension Code:
Disengage Protection Mode!
Kuya!
Quit dawdling!
Bout Dimension!
Dangaioh...!

Flame Arrow!
What are you doing?

She's just a big old goblin!
Let me at her!
You can't get anywhere firing blanks!
"Here's what you get, you old witch!"
"I'll leave the rest up to you, Kuya."
Cross Tornado!
"Do-wat, do-wat, do-wat"
I'm goin'!
Ooh.
I'm goin'!
"Hey, you guys... what do you say I propose a toast?"
Come on.
Oh... go away.
"Say it quick, before it stops fizzing."
"Shake it up, take a sip, and wish for what you want most in the world."
Okay.
I want to replicate my own DNA and win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Yeah.
Oh!
"Very good, Janie."
"Okay, shake it up, Sport."
Shake it up.
"I want to play more baseball games than Cal Ripkin, Jr."
"Oh, yeah!"
And get filthy rich doing it.
"Oh, yeah!"
"Shake it, Harriet."
I want to see the whole world and I want to write down everything.
"Harriet, slow down."
That's very impressive.
Harriet?
I'm goin'!
"That's good, Harriet."
"That's very pretty, isn't it, Janie?"
"Yes, I like it."
Got you!
"Hey, wait up."
"Everybody, hello!"
"Yeah, we completely believe that you eat cheeseburgers all the time."
Look at me!
I'm taking a bite!
That's my food.
- Mmm!
So good.
- Okay.
"So, um, are you guys gonna be home or away for Thanksgiving?"
Home.
Allen is gonna be in the city with the boys and his ex-wife.
They still do holidays and vacations together.
"- Don't you go, too?"
- Mnh-mnh.
His ex-wife hates me.
- Mm.
- Hates me.
Hates me.
She thinks I stole her husband.
Which I kind of did.
But not on purpose.
"You realize that's not a good story to tell people, right?"
I know!
"So, I'm gonna be all alone."
- Mm.
- By myself.
- Yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.
This coming Thursday.
"Well, enjoy the peace and quiet."
I will!
Okay!
- Bye!
( phone rings )
( people scream )
Can't think with the phone ringing.
"Dorothy, get over to the window and shut the blinds."
The rest of you stay put.
Don't do anything stupid.
"Come on, Dorothy!"
"All right, back with the others."
( cell phone rings )
What's that?
Whose is that?
Is that you?
Yeah.
- Answer it.
- You sure?
"Just don't say anything stupid, huh?"
Okay.
Hello?
"Ni-Ni-Nina, it's really not a good time."
"Allie doesn't run off, Nina."
That's not something she does.
I-I can't.
It's really hard to explain.
- Hang up.
- My daughter's missing.
- Hang up the phone.
- You can just wait.
Is she okay?
"- Yeah, she's all right."
- How do you know?
.
I know.
Yeah.
Seriously you think you can.
But it's impossible.
You have another 50%.
I've been waiting for this job.
I don't want it to go to someone else.
Do you want me to beg?
"Je, please just this one time."
Tomorrow I will send the rest.
"When you talk like this, what do you expect?"
Let's go Suchart.
This medicine may make you sleepy.

I'm not afraid of you.
"Kai, let's play badminton."
Huh?

Who is that?
Let's move it.
We've cut.
"It's a little too late to be careful, sir."
"I'm sorry, I..."
"Oh, what is going on here?"
Will somebody get the security guards?
"I can't tell you how sorry I am, sir..."
"Would you mind very much, sir for making this disturbance."
I really can't tell you.
My name is Columbo.
I'm from the police.
We're ready when you are.
- But there's not.
- This is my favorite move coming up.
"Wait, right..."
Coming.
No.
No.
No.
- That's a cool shot.
- This.
Here it comes.
- Now.
- Bingo.
I love that.
I love that so much.
That gets a huge...
People will really laugh at that too.
That lipstick on the windshield thing took us a long time.
I know.
I know it.
Yeah.
- I had to be in a very specific spot.
- Yes.
"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...
- Food.
"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.
- You got your ticket?
- I must have dropped mine.
What kinda ticket did you have?
He's in the brown Lincoln.
Foreign plates.
He's walking towards Front Street.
Gothim.
Angie's parked overhere in the LTD.
Cute.
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.
"The car's dirty, Cloudy."
We're gonna sit here all night ifwe have to.
What time is it?
Ten after four.
- Huh?
- Ten after four.
That's the third time those guys have been around.
"All right, let's hit 'em."
Hit 'em!
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
Stay right there.
"Ifyou move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doin'?
Turn around.
Who's the boss here?
Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?
What are you doin' here?
-I saw our future.
What?
-He came to me.
-Seriously.
"He said ""Sven go through there fast!"""
I'll go with you.
But he lacked fly.
Sven-

-What is this?
-It is amazing.
"-Seriously, never saw it."
Do not.
-Is the green.
-Green!
"Brothers and sisters, behold the power of Sven."
On that day I made an oath.
Sven ...
I
I promise to use my powers only for good things.
"For eternity all the time, to create ... eter a new ..."
Is there no end to the power of Sven?
-Will you marry me!
"No, marry me!"
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!
What jokes ...
"But if I love some, who love girls."
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?
"Someone, either."
No one.
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
"Look, you give her an inch, she takes a mile."
I think we should stop.
"Oh, babe."
Come on.
Not now.
-I'm sorry.
-No.
You're right.
I....
I didn't....
Sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
-You should be with her if you want.
-I don't want to.
I wanna be with you.
-I want you to be with her.
-I can't be with her.
-Why not?
-She's Sam's girlfriend.
They're about to break up.
It's obvious.
-She's throwing herself at us.
"-She's throwing herself, I can't do it."
Jane....
"Look, I've done some weird shit in my life, and I'm glad I have because I have enjoyed 99 % of it, but I'm not screwing my son's girlfriend and I won't lay there and watch you do it."
"Oh, who's gonna know?"
I'll know.
-Hey.
What took you so long?
-Sorry.
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lin."
Mr. Lo Keung called.
He has something important to tell you.
His number and address are here.
Can you swim?
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
Are you scared?
"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?
- Do I know you?
"- No, I don't think so."
"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
- I'm Sarah Walker.
- It's nice to meet you.
You too.
So...
Holly?
"Oh, um..."
- I have no idea where she is.
- OK.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Rebecca.
Um...
Do you have a minute?
Could I talk to you?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"
No.
"That's what people do when they love each other, isn't it?"
I'll never forget you.
Go to the hospital now.
- You'll come and see me?
- I guarantee it.
- Now I suppose you want some time off?
- A day or two.
Well...
Take Thanksgiving.

"Talk to him about what, Chris?"
What the hell are you talking about?

He should be telling you.

"- Tie that up for me, will you?"
- Hardy!
I've been calling you for an hour.
You missed roll call.
Penderman's really pissed.
You look like shit.
Did you fall off the wagon?
You're a fucking mess.
I'm sick of taking shit for you.
- What do I put in the log?
- Will you get the stern line?
You're a real asshole.
How did I end up with you?
Hardy!
"Get some dry clothes on, Sacco."
I'll catch you on the next run.
"River Rescue 9221, this is base."
We have a 111 one mile south of Neville Island.

You...
You're him...
The world is coming to an end.
We all must pay the price.
"Casshern must pay, as will we."
So Casshern has awakened?
Indeed.
We knew it would happen.
Your business will be booming for a while.
Beautiful...
--Me?
--Yeah.
"Are you a human, mister?"
"Then you must be a robot, right?"
I... suppose...
You don't know?
Are humans...?
Beats me.
I haven't seen many of them.
That's why I thought you might be one.
Since you're so beautiful.
"What's your name, mister?"
My name?
I'm Ringo!
I'm...

How's everything in here?
All right?
"You off, then?"
Oh.
"Er... yes, if you're sure you're all right."
- He won't want for anything.
- It's Adam's decision.
Are you having a laugh?
"Look around, George."
I'm a pig in shit.
- Adam.
- Sorry.
Hm.
"- Right, I'll show you to the door."
"- No, no, that's OK, we can find it."
"Of course, yes."
Like tracker dogs.
- Um... excuse me?
!
"- No, come on."
"Cheers for bringing me here, though."
Look after him.
We don't need you to tell us that.
OK?
See you.
- Shall I feed the boy now?
"- Oh, not yet, Seven."
We're going to make a night of it.
"After all, Adam's finally where he belongs."
Do you work every day after school?
That's gotta be tough.
"Um, no, just three days."
My moms don't want me to work any more than that.
- Moms?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- It is.
"Oh, don't worry, I'll grab that."
"Oh, thanks."
See you soon.
"Oh... down the street, I'm telling you."
- You're really good.
- Not good enough.
"I thought you did great, way better than me."
I'm supposed to be good at this.
- Damn!
- What?
- Someone left us a hundred-dollar tip!
- What?
"- A hundred dollars, yo!"
"- Oh, my God!"
Who do you think it was?
I don't know.
Vanilla milkshake?
He sure was chatting you up.
- Please.
"- Come on, girl."
You know he likes you.
- Shut up.
- He wants some of that.
- Daphne!
"Damn it, Reid."
"I said, ""Don't take the vest off."""
Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.
This is going to probably sting a little bit.
Whoa.
Did you see that?
I knew it.
I knew it.
"Hey, look."
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got the chip.
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...
Not yet!
Turn it on.
Turn the chip on.
Excuse me?
"- Get off the train, Reid."
"- No, no, something's wrong."
Get off the train.
- Get out of there.
- Why isn't he moving?
How many shots would it take to move in?
Two.
First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.
I didn't stand a chance with those odds!
it wasn't my fault that I lost.
that's all!
Always looking down on me with those smug expressions!

Then you're saying that you still have the resolve to fight?
You are most fortunate.

"Hey, what do you want from me?"
Get away!
He's got Tia's vest.
Get him!

Don't leave me up here.
"Open the door, Tony."
You can't go in there without ids.

[boys panting]
Tia!
"- Quick, let's get her out."
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
"This is what... recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.

- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This my home.
It is!
Who's the murderer?
Speak.
You've got the wrong person!
I've got to go!
Cross-eye!
"Yes, Marshal!"
Have you got all the masked opera singers?
Every single one of them.
What about him?
We missed him.
- You fool!
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Wait here!
Wait here!
What are you doing?
Shut up or be arrested!
I can lock you all up!
Is this an uprising or what?
- What's going on?
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Stupid.
What about my loss?
If you find any one suspicious.
Let me know.
You'll get paid for it.
They're all crooks!
The murderer is connected with the opera troupe.
Keep your eyes open for me.
Yes?
There's a newcomer who acts strangely...
"Mr. Chiu, it's your turn."
I'm coming!
You got character.
I don't make this offer to just anybody.
"Sarge, I got a great-lookin' gal to go home to... not to mention my wife..."
so it just ain't in the cards.
Igor.
Another glass of cheer.
You think you got it rough?
Look at that guy.
"- ## [""Harbor Lights""] - [Sighs]"
"Boy, he looks terrible."
What's his story?
"He got a ""Dear Maxie"" letter."
- Says he's got nothin' to go home to.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.
And...
- And...
"- That's it, pal."
Get it off your chest.
Tell Joey all about it.
Yeah.
"You're right, Joey."
Who are you?
This!
I'll kill you if you don't take your hands off me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Do you hear?
Don't hold my hand!
Let me go!

"Yes, absolutely safe!"
- We have to treat Fung-wu.
- Right.
Come on!
Come on!
Jun-kit!
"Although you saved me,"
Shaolin caused my master's death by my hand.
Why do you say that?
The Shaolin persuaded His Highness to get our 8-divine Sword Book.
- Shaolin wouldn't do such a thing.
There you go.
"Inhale, reverse warrior, look up."
Exhale.

How's it going?
Just wondering how you're doing.
I haven't talked to you in a little while and was just wondering how you're doing.
"So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you."
Obviously.
"But you're out, I guess."
So just call me sometime.
Or tonight.
"I'm around, I'll be..."
"Well, I'm in and around."
So that's enough for now.
It's Alex.
Okay.

"- Hi, Jessie."
"- Hey, Mick."
Ben around?
No.
He went with Mom to the store.
Are you bored?
"Yeah, I know how it can suck being the new kid."
You can hang out here with me for a while if you want.
Are you sure?
You don't mind?
Tell you what.
I was thinking about going for a boat ride.
I could use a little muscle.
Sure!
I'm real strong.
Only if you promise I'll be safe out there on the lake with you.
"'Cause after all, you're a pretty good kisser."
Ready?
Go!
I'll race ya!
"Jessie, why do you have to go away to school?"
JESSIE:

I was a bad girl.
I got kicked out of my school here.

Kill somebody?

Only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.

You're going on a tour?

"What of your writing, your work?"
What of me?
Am I going with you?
We'll talk about it later.

We're going back.

"Finally, please, get some help!"
-You get some therapy!
-I don't need it!
-That is exactly your problem!
-My problem?
You're unbelievable!
This is why I never come back!
Things always spin out of control with you!
You're like a 2-year-old.
Like a fucking infant!
How did you get to be so rigid?
At least I'm living in reality!
At least I have dignity!
Dignity?
Jesus!
Why are you so afraid?
Afraid?
What are you talking about?
You're insane!
Jane?
"I'm sorry, can I ask you to step outside?"
"Fuck you, Phillip."

Either he's gutted or scalped.
"And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem.
"Like us, he's on his own."
We made a promise to the Captain.
A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
"No, we can't."
Look at him.
"All right, shit, then, buddy."
Get him up.
You want to take him?

"I haven't had the chance to thank you, Mr. Brannigan, for bringing Johnnie back."
"There's no mister, and back home, they call me Gene."

I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.

Why'd you screw me?
Stop it!
"Stop, dammit!"

They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."

"All right, Project Cadmus."

"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."

"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
"And I will miss you, but I'm not gonna sit here and watch you rot."
"- Oh, Pete..."
Pete.
- Horace?
You can call him all you want.
"He doesn't hear you, Horace."
Horace.
"You know, fuck Easter, then, I mean, like, you know, fuck that anyway."

Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!

Bulldog!
"Ilango, where is Kutty?"
Tell him to come.
He went somewhere.
Cuddappah Raju questioned him where he went.
He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.
No Velu.
Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.
Singamuthu is in jail.
I saw him.
They threatened me.
But I told them nothing.
Take him to hospital.
Make it fast.
Shocked?
I'm not Murugesh to get beaten up.
"I'm Vel, Singamuthu's son."
Vetrivel.
He will come.
I swear.
His words have come true.
One must give birth to a son like him.
Hit him in the belly!
"You got him, Nelson!"
Knock him out!

"- Okay, okay!"
It's a bet!
Finish him!
"Come on, finish him, Nelson!"
Nelson's opened up his left eye!
- It's bleeding!
- Good!
"Come on, Nelson!"
"Get him, Nelson!"
Come on!
Stand up and fight!
Nelson's pounding his kidneys!
The sucker!
Why don't he work on that eye?
That's more like it!
Come on!
I don't like this!
I don't like it!

We suspect a gas leak.
We discovered four adult bodies in the debris.
We assume two were the residents.
We don't know about the other two.
"Ma'am, do you have any idea who they might be?"
"No, I don't."
I see.
What about Mikey?
I saw him go in there.
We did find the skeletal remains of what appears to be a 10-year-old child.
Are you sure?
I'm very sorry.
You're sure?
"When we found the boy out on route 240, he had a bad case of Amnesia;"
didn't even remember his name.
"Mom, you won't believe this."
Something ate our TV antenna.
"- Oh, Hogarth..."
"- No, no!"
I'm serious!
"Oh, but it's not Sputnik, like Mr. Stutz thought."
Hogarth...
"- No, it's a robot!"
"No, really, it is!"
- Hogarth...
Hogarth...
"- And the robot, it's 100 feet high!"
- Please...
- Hogarth!
- And it eats metal!
Stop it!
Just...
Stop.
I'm not... (SIGHS)
I'm not in the mood.
Come on.

"A peaceful stay-at-home kind of day, in a town very much like your own."
"But then, suddenly without warning... (EXPLODING)"
Atomic holocaust!
But how does one survive an atomic attack?
Hey.
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
(LAUGHS) He says his boat ran into a sea monster.
I need you to be strong.
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Yes.
Paul.
Hmm?
I think my hands are nearly free.
Guard them!
Hello.
Hello.
"Oh, my God."
Felix.
"- Cut us free, Luke."
- I don't think so.
What?
"Just do it, you little turd."
- I killed Jonesy.
"- And what, hey?"
"What, you think I'm gonna tell on you?"
"Luke, Luke, look at me, look at me."
"I don't care how many people you've killed, okay?"
"As long as it's not me, and as long as it's not Paul."
"Now come on, cut us free."
Have you enjoyed what you've seen?
I hope you're satisfied!
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should have stepped in when Chris went for you but this...
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I saved him.
Cut him down.
E R..

Tucker?
Maybe you're taking this accident thing a bit too hard.

I don't know yet.
"There you go, made to order."

Got ya!
That one's going on the fridge.

Smile!
It helps if you push the button.
Trevor?
What is it?
"- This place, brings back memories."
- Good memories I hope.
"Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid."
"My ex, probably phone to ruin a happy Mother's Day."
Could you...?
"Yes, no sweat."
I'll take Nicolas for a ride.
Thanks.

Aunt Pam?

"- Yeah, of course."
You want me to read you a story?
Or I could actually...
I could make one up.

- So we meet again.
- Your challenge is acceptable.
Prepare for battle.
- I want to come home.
"- Hey, turn it down, man."
- You turn it down.

"Like, before you were even born?"
"And the midnight screening of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" at the Cinedome."

So?
"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
When's your curfew?
I don't have one.
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
For how long?
Couple of weeks.
Seriously?
"Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."
The motel?
"HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great."
Yeah.
I guess.

Thank you!
"Brother, help me!"
Someone is trying to kill me!
"Brother, someone is trying to kill me!"

He's deaf.
You've got to answer my questions honestly.
- Do you know the deceased?
- Yes.
- I don't know him.
- What does he do here?
- He helps the actors dress.
- I don't know.
"Sir, the Marshal has arrived."

Full-gun salute.
See you later.
"Well, John, I gave you back the life of that little girl but I'm not sure that I can let you walk out that door because you killed my son."
What are you waiting for?
"Gentlemen, please, this is a house of God."

"You guys,you have to come tonight."

You must tell me.
Listen.

Listen to this.
I'm really sorry.
"If you give me your number, I'll call ya and bring the money to ya."
I don't take I.O.U.'s from guys that I just met.
Forty bucks.
"Oh, wait."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
How 'bout this?
What's that?
"Hundred dollar five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, Lions."
From the Montecito.
Huh?

You kidding?
- I owe you 40.
"This thing pays, you'll get two grand, man."
Come on.
Come on!
Give us a break.
Start betting on Korean Ping-Pong.
And get out of here.
"All right, fine."
All right.
It's me.
So what?
I don't know anything about fake chips.
You don't know anything about fake chips?
You cashed it in.
This isn't fair.
No.
"- It isn't fair, is it?"
- It wasn't even my chip.
"Anytime, anywhere, just call beauty."
-Only call.
-Right.
"Let puppies, time to go home."
"Come on, Erik."
"Come on, children."
"-We are lost, is not it?"
"-Atticus, we are not lost."
The land of emperors should be right here.
"You are crazy,"
I'm sure the land of emperors is there.
Not here.
My God!
"Then, no!"
"Look, someone got out."
"They saw, I knew there was a way out."
"-Friend, how we get out?"
I do not know.
-I am trying to get.
"-Mano, Mano!"
"-Hey, Dad!"
"-Atticus, my good boy"
-See you all well.
What happened?
A huge iceberg came tumbling and rolling and here we are.
This is terrible.
"Nothing that would not to give way, baby."
-Mama!
-I told everyone to relax.
-For he knew they were good.
-Where's Mommy?
Has anyone seen the glory?
She goes through my pockets some nights.
"Oh, absolutely."
Which horse?
"- Uh, Dragonfly."
- When's it running?
"No, it ran today."
I won that on it.
Oh.
"Well done, old boy."
"No, could you keep it?"
"No, I couldn't do that, very decent of you..."
"No, could you keep it just tonight?"
"It's Sybil, you see?"
Secret.
"Ah, a present."
"Sort of, yes."
Don't mention it.
Mum's the word.
I'll get it from you in the morning and bank it.
"Understood, old boy."
Cheers.
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"Good morning, Mr. Fawlty."
"Good morning, ladies."
Hello.
Fawlty Towers.
Watt!
I didn't say anything.
Have you called the police yet?
"Excuse me, I'm trying to take a telephone call."
Have you called them yet?
You need to be strong now.
Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.
And I can't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together.
"Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore."
I just wanna feel safe again.

You're here.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I am."
You're here.
- Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Secure the hallway.
All right.
It's all right.
All right.
"Okay, I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna get out of here, okay?"
"-No, you're gonna hurt yourself."
-Don't have a choice.
One...
"-Okay, okay."
"-...two, three."
"Now go, go, go."
Ryan?
"Ryan, are you okay?"
"Yeah, yeah."
-You?
-Yeah.
"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Hey, Ryan."
"Sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God,"" because usually, I'm very good in a crisis."
But I started thinking about if anything happened to you.
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay.
We're both okay.
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.
We might encounter all sorts of crises when we're away together at college or--
"Oh, my God."
Is that blood?
I faint at the sight of blood.
"-Oh, no, no, no."
It's just glitter.
Okay.
-Taylor.
Taylor.
Call when you get tired of it.
Shit!
May your hands wither away!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Nina's out, I... it's her mother."
"Right, Maria Vasilyevna."
See how it turned out!
And who are you?
Ghena?
From her work?
"I'll tell her, I will."
All right.
Mom!
"What is it, for God's sake?"
"Oh, my little fish!"
My honey!
I've missed you so much!
You've grown so big!
You know what I brought you?
There's a basket under your pillow...
"Grandma, why have you got such a big nose?"
Why big?
A regular nose.
I'm big and my nose is big.
It's interesting...
"The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left."
How did you like your granddaughter?
She's grown up!
They grow so fast.
"- Mom, get away."
- I'll show you 'get away'!
"Don't yell, I beg you!"
"Uh, yeah."
Sure.
Hi.
I know.
Brian's here.
Relax.
"All I said was ""Hi""."
Are you gonna bite my head off if I ask you how you are?
"I had a great time in Bali on my non-honeymoon,"
- and tomorrow I start working.
- That's good.
But Brian is here.
"Yeah, well, wasn't that how you guys planned it?"
"Adam, who are you blaming here?"
Marjorie or Brian?
I'm not blaming anybody.
"I'm just... trying to move on with my life, Nicole."
That's all.
"Yo, Adam."
Get your scrawny ass in here.
I need somebody I can beat.
"I'm sorry, Nicole."
I gotta go help a friend.
- Whoa.
Sorry
- Excuse me.
"Hey, honey."
Guys and video games--
- What's the chick equivalent?
- I don't know.
Pedicures?
Let me smell you.
"OK, hurry up."
Come on.
Why did you leave the key in the car?
You look fine.
God loves you for a liar.
Daylight never saw such a ruin!
But you've put on weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.
You look good.
Blanche!
"Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it."
But watch your figure.
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella."
I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve...
- the summer...
"- Laura, come quickly."
What's wrong?
Internal bleeding and head injuries.
- How did it happen?
- A car accident.
"- Shit, I don't know if I can..."
"- Sure, you can."
You've got no choice.
Come here.
Hold this.
Swab.
Suck it up.
I can't see anything.
- We need more blood.
Ligature.
"Yeah, Lila, she does."
That's good.
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
"Oh, that's right."
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like talking with me about your family, do you?"
"No, Lila, I don't guess I do."
I don't blame you.
I got something for you.
Where you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
DALE:
What the hell are you doing now?
Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.
Fucking Kraut!
What was that?
Fucking Kraut.
Idiot!
"Only for buses, sir."
-I'll be right back.
"No access for normal cars, sir."
Don't be a nag.
There's plenty of space.
Only buses.
"Drop dead, asshole."
"Yes, one more for my husband."
Everything will be ready when you come back.
Stop!
Take him away!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
I won't turn in my weapon.
Never.
Check if we have these people in the computer.
"If not, ask who we do have."
Just the addresses.
Is it urgent?
-A matter of life and death.
I'll be gone all afternoon.
The money.
"Here, fifty thousand."
Take it.
I already bought jenever on the black market.
Ay yi yi...
Tu viste eso?
"Her daughter, son?"
"What are you doing, Angie?"
I'm getting ready for bed.
Don't you miss me?
"Enrique, please not now, I'm tired."
"Yeah, what you tired from?"
Life.
"Life, huh?"
I thought you were tired from going
With that new boyfriend of yours.
What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.
No?
No...
"what are you, deaf?"
"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."
You sure?
"Of course, stupid."
"We're,like,at..."
Wilson's.
Hey.
I totally wasn't waiting for you.
My sister's car got towed.
Right.
Johnny!
"What's up,brother?"
"- Good show tonight,man."
"- Thanks,brother."
"- See you tomorrow,Johnny."
- Johnny.
"Yeah,the show was great."
"Your musical tastes have changed a bit,huh?"
"Oh,yeah,I guess you can't really sing along to the new stuff,huh?"
"I don't sing,remember?"
- Yeah.
I do.
- I noticed you're rocking the eyeliner now.
What's up with that?
"What,you don't like it?"
I dig it.
"It's just,I..."
"I admire that you can do the ""in the eye"" thing."
It makes me look like Boy George.
"Yeah,well,uh  you never needed any help drawing attention to your eyes."
"So,how's..."
"It was good to see you,Bella."
- Oh.
Okay.
- Take care.
Bye.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This may hurt a bit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
There we go.
(PANTING)
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you
"(TELEPHONE RINGING) at the lab, yes..."
Hello?
(SPEAKS RUSSIAN)
They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.

One dark and windy night.
A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.
I'm not a virgin!
You scared me!
"Robin darling, I need you!"
What?
I need you!
Me...too!
- l need you now!
- Now?
You mean right here?
But the bed's a little small!
"If you don't go to rescue Yoyo, he's done!"
Rescue Yoyo?
I wouldn't do that!
People hold cars in high esteem.
They show certain signs of concern when they lose them.
Martin!
-Martin!
-I love you!
"One moment, the boss has a meeting."
I'm asking for sick leave.
Immediately.
Now before the symposium?
You've gone crazy!
And what about the report?
Do you have the report for me?
-Well...
"-Yes, or no?"
-No?
-I'm sorry.
It'll be all right.
Sorry.
-Yansky!
-Good bye!
"Martin, what's going on?"
You won't even look at me?
You have a nice hat.
"Yes, yes, Doctor Yansky."
"Decent, truthful,"
"responsible,"
So send him to a psychiatrist.
Life is beautiful.
-I know.
-So what's missing in your life?
It's not missing.
It's excessive.
The one from Sophia?
"- No, why?"
"Okay, never mind."
Thank you.
- Sure.
Sanchez.
"- Detective, it's Danny Ferman."
Hi.
"- Danny boy, how are you?"
I'm good.
Thank you.
"Did you guys call my office to pull,"
Sophia's voicemail off my machine?
Maybe.
We do that.
I'll look into it.
"Oh, and by the way, tox came back on her."
OD'd like I said.
- Okay.
We got a statement from the neighbor.
Russian woman.
A real character.
"- Yeah, I saw her last night."
"She said she saw a man stop by at the vic's early in the day, but no sign of a struggle."
"My gut says they were either shooting up together, or he was a dealer."
- She give a description?
Vague.
She said it was a white guy.
Big.
Really big.
That's it?
- That's it.
"Alright, alright!"
- Griffin...
"Oh, my God!"
"- Hey, Sandy."
What happened?
I'll call 911.
"- No, no, no... don't."
"- OK, I'll get some ice."
"No I don't have time for that, just sit down."
- What?
Griff...
- Sandy just sit down.
Sit down.
I need money.
"I got into some trouble with some guys tonight, and, uh, they say that if I don't pay them tonight, I..."
- We have to call the police.
"- No, don't."
"Sandy, the police won't, just..."
It's better if...
I hate to ask.
You want me to beg?
You want me to beg from you?
- OK.
- No...
"OK, Sandy, I'm begging."
I am begging from you Sandy.
"I need some money so please, could you give me some money?"
"Sandy, I'm scared, I am scared,"
- and I am begging you for money...
- How much?
- A grand.
- $1000?
"It's normal, too."
"Henry, wait."
Wait.
We'll get there.

You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."

Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument.
"Please, don't move your hand."
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory is a funny thing.
I am an expert and I do not know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were...

This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.

A competitor.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
Senor... nobody's come out of there alive.
Please...
Senor.
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.

"Of course, my son."
Congratulations my dear!
"Dad, you really have a good taste."
Another one?
"Well Dad, I really want me and Joy to be just like you."
It was so sudden.
"Just come home, please?"
"You're his first love, you know."
He only met that Joy because you left for Canada.
"Please Bela, just come home please?"
.
I really don't want Joy to be my sister-in-law!
She's not on the same level with my brother.
"Come on Ara, you've already pre-judged the person."
But it's true!
"I'm right, am I not?"
Right?
I'll just get back at you.

"Beautiful, is not it?"
- What's the problem?
- I do not like this place.
"This is only temporary, okay?"
Just for a two nights.
Remember?
"Soon, not whisper their home."
"Who knows, maybe one of those pools."
"First, a few need to handle the job, okay?"
"Then they whisper very, very far away."
- Really?
- Yes.
- You know what?
I am sure that Bella liked here.
"- No, I did not like."
Is that right?
Let us ask him then.
"It's beautiful, Bella?"
See?
Complacent.
Really?
Seven years and not once.
Cool.
And how about you and Gary?
What?
Poop?
"No, silly, your virtual romance."
Enough virtual.

Mom makes great coffee.
"No, always tea with cold milk on the side, some toast and a plain yogurt, thank you."
This is yours.
- I'd put it there.
- That's the chimney vent.
- Even if she doesn't remember.
- Yeah.
"- Yeah, so -"
- [Knocks]
- Hello?
- Ida?
- [Ida] Yes.
- Can we come in?
"- Well, of course."
Come in.
"Oh, Ida."
Okay.
"Can I just, uh, introduce you to someone... 'cause I'm not sure you're going to remember her."
- I'm Vivienne.
How are you?
Okay?
- [Ida] I'm fline.
You're not feeling too great.
"Well, I came to tell you that in the Poslun's auditorium... there is a picture of Alderman Herb Orliffe and his family... from about 1960, it says."
- [Ida] My goodness.
- Yes.
So when you're feeling well -
- I can get dressed...

"You think you can make me happy, Murray?"

"Now, get out."
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
"When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome."
You know what they said?
"""You're history. """
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
"Daddy, stop it!"
"Daddy, no!"
[Ariel sobs]
"Ariel, I... [sobs] Just go away."
Poor child.
"Poor, sweet child."
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were something we could do.
But there is something.
Who...
Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.
[Both] Just imagine...
You and your prince...
Together forever.
I don't understand.
Ursula has great powers.
[Gasps] The sea witch?
"Why, that's..."
I couldn't possibly.
No!
Get out of here.
Leave me alone!
Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.
[Both] Yes?
- [Sniffles] Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.
It was an accident. [mutters]
And if I don't get home soon...

I need your help!
"Good, good!"
"It's all right, mother."
I'm home now.
"Oh, yes, yes, I know, darling."
"No, I'm all right."
"Oh, my dear!"
"Hi, dads."
I'm here.
"Oh, son!"
That's a boy.
You all right?
"- Yeah, but I have to sleep."
Leave him alone.
"Oh, it's all right, Joe."
"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"
Let's get this coat off.
"You two must have had some experience, huh?"
Yes.
"Here are your pajamas, darling."
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?
Whas the matter?
"What does ""off season"" mean to you?"
Thas the big question...
Pretty bleak place...
Isn't this comfy?
Not even a lump of sugar!
But there's lots of toilet paper super-soft.
Interested?
Isn't that touching...
Daddy...
Mommy...
Jacqueline...
Poor Jacqueline all alone with her folks.
Thas Jackie's bed...
Look what she left us...
Isn't that cute?
How old do you think she is?
I don't know.
"Thirteen fourteen, at the most..."
"No, she's much older."
Much!
At least sixteen...
Take a whiff...
Les see...
You're right.
"Oh, my God..."
At least...
A real young lady...
Like she just took them off a minute ago.
Jacqueline!
"Hey, Jacqueline!"
Jean-Claude.
I think Joe there is the answer to that question.
"Let this thing lie down, John."
Understand?
"Thank you, John."
"Bob, look at this:"
"""Man thrown in prison for eloping with his sister-in-law. """
I'll be.
I wonder what he did.
Put down the paper and play.
It's cold.
"Nolt boy got killed, Tom."
- Who's that?
"- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt."
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
"That's what I shoot, a.45-.60."
"Shoot what, Tom?"
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
"He's dead, too."
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
-Yes.
He tries to buy their freedom.
Why would he do that?
He lives a good life in Malaysia with his wife and children.
How do you know?
"William, have you had contact with him?"
I had to do something.
-Oh my God.
No.
It is you.
You asked him to come here.
10.2 million euros.
That is the price for Karine?
"He killed her, he hit her head against the stone until it cracked!"
Finally.
It was not him.
Tonje saw him somewhere else.
The alibi was a joke!
We all know it!
Try to think ahead.
Think of the responsibilities we have.
Here you can not ask me.
Never.
Never.
Hey dear.
"God, so good to see you."
-Oh?
Has it been good?
Aksel Nilsen.
It's rescuer.
-The Aksel Nilsen?
-Yes.
End of discussion.
If the contract's been taken the job will be done.
Fine then I'll leave.
- See you uncle.
- Bless you.
Boss.
An elderly person's waiting for you outside.
I asked him to come in but he refused.
He's standing outside in the hot sun.
Ask him what he wants.
No he wants to meet only you.
What's his name?
Name.

What happened?
What did you say?

Why am I running errands for them?
They treat me like crap.
They even stuck me with the suckiest country.
Portugal.
"Yeah, I'm Portuguese."
"Well, here's the thing."

"No, there is no hope."
There was no hope.
"Please, he knew that, Maria."
He knew that.

I can't look at these.
"Please, I wanna get out."
Explain why your DNA and fingerprints

I'm sorry!
I'm trying to be totally honest with you!
"Jenna, I could've lied and I'd be inside that door right now, but I didn't."

"Oh, these mountains."
"Oh, it's my first time here."

"And the air, it's refreshing."
Don't you find it refreshing?

Oh.
Could I trade that in for a free breakfast?
I can look into that for you.
Thank you.
"So, what brings you to Denver?"
"Oh, I'm just, uh, passing through."
[Vacuum cleaner whirring]

"As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. lt's important."
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
-Take this. lt's a couple thousand.

"Maggie, wait."
"I don't want you to leave like this, all angry."
"I'm not angry, I just want to know what's up with you."
It's just that I...

Dalton...
I didn't know you were a friend of the family.
"Hey, I didn't put him there."
I'm tryin' to find the guy who did.
"Mm, sorry, I don't know why I said that."
That's okay.
"I probably can't get anything out of him anyway, huh?"
I don't think so.
Dalton.
"Uh, I-I'm sorry I'm so sarcastic."
"Well, that's okay."
I guess we've both had a long day.
"Hey, you hungry?"
Yeah.
What kind of food do you like?
Anything.
"Like, you want a picnic?"
Ha... are you serious?
"Sure, why not?"
"Why not, indeed."

"You want to get that stern line, please?"
- Afternoon.
- Hello.
Give me the bottle.
Let me rephrase that:
Give me the bottle now.
- You know this is a no-wake zone?
"- No, sir, I didn't."
- Drive a little slower next time.
- We have to give them a ticket.
"- No, we don't."
- They were speeding.
You're going to become my puppet.
Puppet...?
You plan to brainwash me?
What's that!
You're responsible for this?
!
What are you talking about?
Go take a look!
You're not...!
Hurry!
An android...!
"Don't think you can get away, witch!"
Wait!
We've got to get out of here.
Who the heck are you?
Duck!
Ohh...!
The kidnappers...!
"The kidnapper is Midorikawa, the owner of this ship."
We're getting out of here.
I'll take over from here.
"You, no good robot!"
Looks like you need a spanking.
Very nice!
I told you you needed a spanking.
This food battle is over!
So long!
Enter the Dragon!
My fist is deadly!
Adios!
My name is Chidou;
"first name, Hitomi..."
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, I got myself something there."
What?
A barrette.
"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
- Stop it!
Ugh!
[glass shatters] [coughing] [panting]
"Oh, no."
Why did you make me do that?
I guess I'm on my own.
- Psst.
- There you are.
You're all right.
"- Yeah, you are too."
You're ready.
"- Yeah, I know."
That's what I was saying the whole time.
But it feels good to hear you say it.
"- Go get 'em, tiger."
- Ow.

I'm not going to say anything.
Hello!
I saw the poster in your window and went along to his class.
"And saffron, Myisha and Kwesi have found love, too."
"He can cook, too."
She taught me everything I know.
MYISHA:
What do we get?
KWESI:
Anything with garlic.
"Everything OK, Jagjit?"

"Are you all right, son?"
Somebody after you?
"How would you like never to be scared again, Jagjit?"
"Teach him, till he's a master like you."
Why are you doing this?
That's like the worst combination for you.
I know.
"Oh, just..."
I'm stuck.
"I'm sorry, Dale."
Jill...
You don't have to be sorry.
You just got a little wasted that's... all.

I'm never drinking again.
I've heard that one before.

"Just finish blowing chunks, ok?"
Why don't you go make sure everything's ok out there.
I'll stay here with Jill.

"Pull up the list of parks, would you?"
"And check for ""Windward."""
"""Sunset."""
"""Sunset..."

There's only one Windward park or school.
"Oh, man, Windward Elementary."
That's close to my shop.
I know those kids.
"Hey, Tanner."
You bored of me yet?
We've got a park to check out.

"- Boy, do I."
- Tell me how much.
Tell me.
- Cheers.

What's happening is that this is a great song.
"I'll be out here if you need me, Jess."
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
"Yeah, like he'd ever have a job."
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
"Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV."
"- I miss you, Jess."
- Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
"- Oh, that's not healthy."

Oh.

I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

Yeah.

Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!

You're home early.
Did you lose your trainer?
"No, Why?"
I believe a few weeks' proper care will be of great benefit... to your career.
"You're still a very handsome man, Mr. Hilliard."
Yes.
But your good looks have fallen prey to a certain scrawniness.
"Oh, no, we can correct this, I believe, together."
"- Thank you, Mr. Hilliard."
"This way, Mr. Hilliard."
"- Young ladies, thank you."
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
I'm not concerned about how many lines I have.
I'd rather have four honest words
- than 50 pages of bilge.
- Wyndham Best.
- Young lady.
Remarkably good turnout.
Mr. Frayle.
- Hello.
Did you-
- Is this--
- Yes.
Congratulations.
Well done.
- Good evening.
- Miss Moore.
Very ship shape.
"- Why, thank you."
- Hello.
Let me do this.
Mrs. Cole?
She's coming?
I tried.

Into pleural space.
Tube.
Chen?
OpSite and Polysporin.
Tube's in.
Hook up the Thora-Seal.
Any detail would help us.
"Sats are back up, 91."
- Were they Latinos?
Black guys?
- I don't know.
It happened so fast.
Let's page Corday.
"Hey, Trina, you did really good."
"Rest up now, okay?"
"For us to get to work here, we need a real description."
I saw one of them.
I think he was black.
"Driver, get out nice and calm."
Face the vehicle.
- Welcome to the ' hood.
"- Passenger, come around to this side."
Face the vehicle.
Put your hands up on the roof.
Grab the roof.
"Hey, man, take it easy."
License and registration's in the glove.
"- Hey, what are we being stopped for?"
- Easy.
"Spoon, stop!"
Shit!
-Stop it!
Stop!
-Stop cussing and go home!
-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.
"-Spoon, watch out, man!"
"-Thanks a lot, Farber."
"Oh, mother-damn!"
She shot at you with her eyes closed!
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
"-lt worked, didn't it?"
"She is shit-hot, man."
Put in a good word for me.
-Stop cussing.
-And go home.
I got you.
Aim and fire.
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
"Hell, I'll take the cavalry."
Defense Department uses all USR contracts.
Why didn't you just hand the world over on a silver platter?
Maybe we did.
Robertson has the uplink control in his office.
Service areas.
No surveillance.
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.
Everything's locked down.
"But don't worry, I've got a man inside."
-Dr.
Yes.
They might shoot us if we touch her.
She's valuable government property.
(GROWLS)
"Hey, I can see her face better now."
(CHATTERING)
She doesn't look like Sally.
Are you Sally?
(CHATTERING)
"Well, since it's Judy, we'd, uh, better take care of that leopard."
Uh-huh.
Be my guest.
(GROWLS)
(YOWLS)
"Ok, nut."
Come on down.
"Very nice work with that leopard, fella."
Thank you.
That's a handy gun to have around.
"Mr. Dane, I'm sorry that we doubted you."
We heard her confession.
"But if this is Judy, where is Sally?"
"Uh, beats me."
(THUDDING)
"Judy, stop that."
The least you can do is show them you're sorry.
"Thank you, Judy."
Now all you have to do is tell me where Sally is.
(CHATTERING)
You had the helmet.
You must know where she is.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
I didn't mean to hurt you.
"Sara, I would never do anything to hurt you."
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
- You wanna go ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where l live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
[ Laughs ] He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- lt's not anything special.
- lt's all right.
My dad's gonna flix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
- Do you wanna see my room ?
"- Uh, yeah."
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
- [ Laughs ]
"There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna flix it, but I don't know."
"He's, um, at work right now."
He'll... be gone all night.
"Yeah, um--"
[Siren Wailing ln Distance] I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
"All right, I want to conduct."
You can't conduct.
I want to conduct!
No!
Let Wilbur conduct.
MAN 1:
Let Wilbur conduct!
MAN 2:
"Go ahead, Wilbur!"
"Now by popular demand, we bring you the interstate choir conducted by Wilbur Hoolick!"
Good luck.
"Oh, don't go, Mr. Miles."
Help me out with this number.
What number is it?
I Like to Hike.
"So do I, but what's the song?"
"I Like to Hike is the name of the song, and do it with dignity."
Dignity!
"Oh, yeah."
I...
I'll be dignity.

You cannot forget the bidding of the auction.
I know.
"Look, Janki.."

"If you leave me, then I wont be able to live."
"No, Janki."

Sister-in-Iaw!
"No, sister-in-Iaw."
"No, sister-in-Iaw, you cannot leave me!"
"Sister-in-Iaw, I didnt go away from you.."
..so that you leave me forever!
I didnt go to the city to earn so that when..
"..I come back, you dont even talk to me!"
"See, sister-in-Iaw!"
See.. see..
I have brought so many saris for you!
See!
"This pink one, this black one, this red one!"
"Hey, leave Dr. Cicchirini out of this."
He's my boyfriend.
He's an asshole.
"He may be an asshole, but he's my..."
What are you making me say?
"Okay, fine."
"Make the call, but first you should know I did it for you."
Sandro!
"You mean... the Addison's disease,   the fake kidnapping..."
you did that for me?
Yes!
"Meaning,   I'm so important to you that ..."
... that you ...
Yes...
"God, it's cold."
Stop!
"Stop, please!"
"I'm Dr. Cicchirini, can you give me a lift?"
"Hey, slow down."
What happened to you?
I've been robbed!
"16,600 liras, my girlfriend..."
"- Give me a ride, I can't go any farther."
"- Come on, get in."
"My God, what a terrible experience."
Mother of God...
That's the truth!
- What is it?
"- I'm not sure, but that's a serious stench!"
- And it's getting worse!
"- God, yes..."
What a stench!
"Jesus, baby."
I was talking to that man.
Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.
- Can you focus on me over here?
- Yeah?
Burying you.
It's like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...
"Henry, stop dicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
Chop Chop.
Shh.
"It's me, Jimmy."
Move.
"Oh, shit."
Those pigs are here again.
Psst!
Don't compromise my lab.
Let them leave.
"Yeah, that's great, yeah."

Mr. Cheng?
Mr. Cheng?
"Mr. Cheng, what troubles you?"
Nothing.
"If nothing, why are you out here alone?"
I'm resting.
"I can't see, but I can listen."
"You never say much, or even laugh."
Right.
I am troubled.
Everyone has some worry.
"You mean, you have troubles?"
Naturally.
Mother's dead.
"I just have an aunt, she is kind, but that's all."
"Actually, you should worry about your eyes."
It's no use.
"Oh, no."
"If you go to the city, find a foreign doctor, maybe you'll see again."
(gasps) Really?
It's the only chance.
Sure.
But where do I find the money?
"Don't worry, when I'm finished here, I'll take you."
Thank you!
"Mr. Cheng, thank you."
[Aunt] Xiao-Mei!
Yes?
[Aunt] The sheriff is leaving.
I'm coming.
You trust them more than me.
I trust you enough to be honest about this.
Look at this place.
"Locks, cameras everywhere."
You obviously think someone is watching you.
"But as soon as something bad happens, you point the finger at me?"
How do you know you haven't been hacked or broken into?
Have you even considered that?

In school today.
"You know, it is so not OK to"
Slap your classmate in the
Middle of class.
I'll handle it.
She's out of control.
"Hey, I'll handle it."
I like uncle Johnny.
He's so nice.
He never gets mad.
He never yells at us.
And he never does that thing
That daddy does where he would
"Say something and then, like, a"
"Few seconds later, he'd have to"
Explain that he didn't mean what
He just said.
"Oh, you mean sarcasm."
Yep.
I have the package.
"Ground floor, through the library and down the stairs."
- The library.
We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
"- Walker, I say again we are coming to you, we are on the move."
In the library.
- Shit.
I'm empty.
- Walker!
"Run, run, run!"
Stenz!
"No, not that way!"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Was that...?
Was that a conscious choice?
- I'm gonna dig into you.
- I think so.
- I think I remember being...
- I love Switzerland.
I think I remember saying it.
It's just...
"Like, yeah."
Well...
"Of course, those aren't gonna work."
And then Andy said a lot of funny stuff here.
He gave that guy a lot of funny names like Cheddar and...
What were the...?
The names were:
"Switzerland, Steinbrenner."
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
T-Bone.
"- T-Bone, yeah."
- Michael.
- And he said a lot of funny stuff.
- Your tighty whities are visible.
Yeah.
Kat made me have the most uncomfortable meeting with Andy Samberg.
- I didn't mean to.
I was so 7th grade and embarrassed.
I didn't mean to.
You were gonna meet him that night or you weren't.
"I was like, ""Oh, Andy's here?"
It was all adrenaline...

Mamma?
Everyone is sitting and waiting in the cafeteria.
"Come in, please."

ScanBrazil has withdrawn the contract.
-The agreement was completely waterproof.
-They have gone bankrupt.
This is absolutely insane.
They sat here and smiled a week ago.
I'll find a solution.
"Go down, you."
I ...
Just look at the numbers.
ScanBrazil is thinly possible.
Of course I'm sure.
Because it My job is to be sure.

I now know not.

Shit!
Yes!
Skip Tyler is in!

Mr. Tyler..

My weapons system is coming online.
It's being accessed remotely.

It's firing.
Target is an aircraft somewhere over Ohio.

"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!

Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.
You can go.
Now.
"Kai-- I told you to stay away, all right?"
Stop trying to save me.
It's not your job.
"If Dr. Fred can give up, so can you."
"No, Dr. Fred, he hasn't given up."

I want out of this job.
It's wrong.
It's no good.
You're the best we've got.

"Some of their problems come down to faith-- their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.

They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."

Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
- Anything in the van?
"- Welding equipment, cans of gasoline."
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
"Without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore."
Then he's gonna lash out again.

What do you got?

There's two more of the same girl in here.
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes

P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
You're married!
There's always something dragging you back.
What was he after?
Nothing.
You don't know him?
No.
Good.
And thanks for doing the riding hat.
Get me out of bother.
Who have you spotted now?
Mr Tubby.
"Aw, he's walking away all sad."
Will you not just have a butty with him?
No!
Yoo-hoo!
Tubby!
She's changed her mind.
She will have lunch with you - next Monday in the square.

"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"

See you soon.

Yeah.

How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
What?
I'm a dirty panty fiend.
I have a thing for your panties.
"Really, I can't get enough of your jumbo panties."
I really love your panties.
I love your panties so much.
You can stop saying that.
I'll stop saying that now.
Good.
"Now, Marnie, what are you doing here?"
Ask Ricky.
Don't say my name.
"So, Ricky sent you?"
"Oh, Marnie, don't kid yourself that I don't know all about the big secret."
What secret?
What secret?
And I don't care if my husband did father that fat bastard!
Sshhhhhh!
Coach Bowman's my dad?
Ricky.
Can you feel me closing in?
"You're mine, Ricky."
Ricky!
Ricky!
"Hey, we're trying to sleep."
Sorry.
"Yeah, I do get carried away sometimes."
I should just shut up.

We want our mom back.
Have you gone crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Clean this up and go to your room!
You're not our mom.
To your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I've had it.
"Anything else, maybe?"
( Door slams )
I want you to say 10 times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!
- Say it.
- You're my mom.
- Properly.
You're my mom.
Look at me.
"You're my mom, you're my mom..."
Louder.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
Stop this foolishness!
I'm not playing along anymore.
Understand?
There'll be only one breakfast and one set of clothes.
And promise me not to talk to your brother!
No.

Promise me.
Don't shoot!

"All units, stand down!"

"Come in, Nautilus."

This is Nautilus standing by.
Launch the missile now!
That missile is targeted to the giant's current position!
"Where's the giant, Mansley?"
What...
Oh...
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.
"There's no way to survive this, you idiot!"
"You mean, we're all going to..."
"To die, Mansley, for our country."

You don't have to apologize.

Once and for all.
But I'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
"You know, everyone's here."
Yeah.
Everyone's here.
"- Oh, it's beautiful."
I got a better shot letting him fuckin' drive.
What are you waitin' for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
"What, warm it up?"
Get out of here!
-Who is it?
-lt's Belle.
Open up.
It's Belle.
Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone--
-So what the fuck you want me to tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care about her?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time.
Everyone okay?
SAM:
Dirk.
[GUN CLICKS]
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
Everybody stay where you are.
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
I'm like 21 Jump Street.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
-Where is it?
-No way you'll ever find it.
SAM:
Where is it?
"Sam Winchester, still a bully."
"You, you jocks."
"You popular kids, you always thought you were better than everybody else."
"And to you, I was just Dirk the Jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
"- Night, Buckley."
"- Night, Mrs. Cole."
- Pretty copper kettle.
- Such an age since...
- Bright copper kettle.
- Been such an age since...
"Pretty copper kettle, bright copper kettle."
There it is.
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never...
Mrs. Cole?
They'll never get us all out.
"Uh, where..."
Where is she?
- Thank you.
- Cut!
Could someone please get Mr. Hilliard out of Dunkirk?
- Find Mrs. Cole!
- Train ticket.
Ration card.
Authorization to travel.
"Oh, don't be nervous."
Mr. Hilliard won't notice you're gone--
It's not Hilliard.
It's Ellis.
"He's gonna be so disappointed in me for missing the opening, for not turning up till the last minute."
Nonsense.
"Your husband is a lucky man, Mrs. Cole."
I'm sure he knows it.
He's not my husband.
Let's get you into makeup.
Hm...
You do look handsome in your sowester.
Mr.Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
I'll blame War Transport.
He'll have to make a deal with me.
So?
Fishes!
Fishes every....
Don't...stand under any thousand pounders.
Uh.
The Director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
He didn't say what it's 'bout.
"Tell him, ""he can find me""."
But...
I have found you.
No you haven't.
You are a masseuse.
Leaning the way of the ship.
"With Johnnie cradled, cradled in your arms."
Cradle.
Oh!
No...no thank you.
You look up.
And you see coming towards you...across the deck.
A vision of loveliness.
And you say.
Get up!
"""Kid's pretty messed up."""
"Girl, kid's pretty messed up."
You want to tell me what's going on?
"It must have been something I ate, I..."
Something you ate.
And now I...
I feel better.
- I think.
- What'd you eat?
- What's gotten into you?
"- I know you, Marie."
And I know when something's up.
And you know I'm gonna dig it out of you sooner or later.
Lamb.
I ate lamb.

Get me an address now.
We're running out of time.
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.
Bullshit.
"This is your training officer, all right?"
Take the afternoon off.
Humor an old man.
Take a right.
Come on.
All right.
Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
Should I call the boss for you?
"Don't piss me off, I've a gun."
I just got dumped.
"Let me remind you, there are CCTV cameras."
Cover your face.
The price tag is still on your toy gun.
Don't come over!
Don't come over!

Lucky.
My money!
You're under arrest.
What underwear?
You're officially under arrest.
"I'm Inspector Mak Ho-Man, Michael Mak."
Shit!
Shit?
Shit?
!
...
Congrats!
Solved another big case!
More like a ridiculous case...
Money means nothing to these rich playboys.
Michael!
You did it again!
Where should we celebrate?
I've reserved a table at a good toro Japanese restaurant.
Expensive but I know you won't mind.
I'm not going.
You guys go ahead.
Why?
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."

But time is running out for all of us.
Except you.
"You're dead, man."

"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?
!
(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?
)
"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.
- Rook'u Where can I find?
- I do not know what you're talking about halttan.
Fuck man!
We'll fly it out of Cairo.
"And Gobler, I want plenty of protection."
Jones.
"Holy smoke, my friends,"
I...
I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England... boat, plane, anything."
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
- How?
- I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
- The Ark?
- Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
And I shall.
Take care of her.
Of course.
Look. ;0]
We'll put this by the window.
So you can watch your friends dancing across the street.
And look.
I love this room.
I'm going to order the whole lot.
And...
Come in and close the door.
How are you?
Sit down.
Thank you.
"Alicia, look who's here."
"We're just getting some air, reading magazines..."
Who was that woman who just left?
"Katerina, Alicia's teacher."
Her teacher?
"Yes, her dancing teacher."
Katerina's a real character.
Her academy is in front of my house.
Alicia was her pupil.
And Katerina loves her like a daughter.
FOUR YEARS EARLIER
"Benigno, you've been at the window for half an hour."
"I'm coming, Mom."
Are you following me?
No...
"Well, yes."
And?
I think this is yours.
"We all spend so much time, energy AND money in an effort to look our best."
We all WANT to be attractive.
Hello.
"Hello, Rose, it's Alex."
Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?
"Oh, I'm okay, I'm... trying to get on with my life, ya know."
"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."
"Sammy, watch where you're going."
I'm watching.
"I'm all right, man."
Jesus-sorry!
[Overlapping chatter]
"Red light, red light."
Jesus fuck!
God damn it.
"You're fucking pushing on me, man."
Who's that?
"Hey, it's John Wayne!"
It's not the same guy.
"Hey, it's Mr. America."
I thought I told you to get out of here.
Holy shit!
[Gunfire]
"You must be thinking of somebody else, friend."
Come on...
Get out of here.

"You're very kind, but I have... Is all right."
You're safe now.
I really can't...
"Shh, shh."
Don't worry.
Everything's all right now.
My little girl is home.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.
But you know there's nothing I wouldn't do for my sweet Ralkana.
My name is Kathryn Janeway.
"""Kathryn""?"
Thas an unusual name.
Very pretty.
I
- I like it.
I am a starship Captain.
It is very important that I contact my ship.
Wonderful.
Captain...
Kathryn of a glorious starship.
Then what happens?
Go on.
I'm listening.
I love your stories.
Is not a story.
Is a request.
May I use your communications equipment?
Communications...
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
"Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?"
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
"There he is, men."
Frag him!
Let's string him up by his pull string!
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
"No, no, no!"
Wait!
I can explain everything!
"Okay, Mom, be right down."
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
"Mom, do you know where Buzz is?"
"No, I haven't seen him."
"-Andy, I'm heading out the door!"
"-But, Mom, I can't find him!"
"Honey, just grab some other toy."
"Now, come on!"
"Oh, okay."
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
"Honey, I'm sure he's around."
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
"Fine, but Mr. Lloyd is not coming with us."
Period.
What do we do with the Atomium?
"I'm sorry, but do you have to do it right now?"
"Yes, it's very itchy."
Almost done.
I wonder how he feels.
He is probably in shock.
Wallonia broke off Belgium.
You can imagine his distress.
- Three papas.
- Shut up.
But it's true.
Kebab accident.
Border!
What the hell are you doing?
!
"Cheers, my friends!"
"The old generation, they want traditions, and we want fusion."
Coming!
- Hi!
- How are you?
"Hello, my dear."
Who are these people?
Who are all these guests?
"Mother, they are from Belgium."
They have to get to Sofia.
"They need a bus, can you imagine?"
A bus?
Here?
- Or a taxi.
- There are no taxis here.
Hold it.
Hold it.
"- Say, ""Thankyou, Snookie."""
"- Thankyou, Snookie."
Get your ass on the floor.
"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.
We should pray.
"Awesome Father, S.J. Auditions today, let her do okay..."
Shut up!
Henschke!
We'll leave for a couple of days.
I'll let you know where we are.
Quiet!
You're coming along!
"Hey Mr Biberkopf, how are you?"
You've been away for a long time. 3 weeks.
Glogg stove?
"No, look."
- I'm not gonna buy that.
- It's a bandage anyway.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Paula.
Paula?
I don't know anyone named Paula.
What's that about?
"You are ill, Mr Biberkopf."
Minor injuries to your head and arm.
I need to get out of here!
I have work to do!
I need to get out!
I'll get a doctor.
Just a moment.
What is going on?
What happened to me?
"Excuse me, we need to get your personal data."
"You don't mind, do you?"
You've been run over by a car on May 12th on Eberswalder Straße.
"You are Biberkopf, Franz."
Car accident.
"I also do life insurance, taxes and hot tubs."
"...just, huh... email."
Brother Amaar?
Baber!
"I need to get to city hall, fast!"
- Let's do it!
- Thank you!
Go!
[ Tupper is humming. ]
[ Tupper is whistling a song. ] Ready?
Hey!
[ He keeps humming. ]
"Hey, Baber!"
You can't park here.
"Tupper, we have no time right now."
We are here on official business.
"Amaar, let..."
You can't...
"Oh, hey!"
"Buddy, buddy!"
Hold on!
Hold on!
"Look at this, huh?"
"A 9/11 in progress, right there, my friend."
Caught him red-handed.
- That's a code blue!
"- It's not a 9/11, Fred."
Calm down.
"You can refresh your computer as often as you'd like, but an email from Charles isn't going to magically appear."
[ The computer dings. ] Oh!
Charles just emailed.
He'll call me in ten minutes.
And... my heart is broken.
Yeah.
Nai would what to say to you right now.
"I can't talk to her, though."
"I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore."
Exactly.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"I'm so sorry, daddy."
Hi.
Hi.
Nice shoes.
I hate talking about shoes with you.
I...
I hate that at's all we talk about.
I miss you.
I... where are you?
"Where... where did you go, Addison?"
"Like I said, nice shoes."
You came.
"No, wait."
I...
I need you to listen.
Just listen?
Um...
I want to be a good mother.
"I want to be a good mother so badly,"
"And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel..."
Uh...
Katie stole something from me.
"She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back."
"But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?"
Okay.
because I wanted to forget him.
Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
[Baby Crying]

- Yeah.
I also got two feds- Mulderig and Klein.
[Groans]
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys... and they can get all they want from ""Uncle Sap."""
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
"[Man] Mike, take a look at this blue one with the tan, on the right."
- Try a practical demonstration.
- It's a good idea.
Go forit!
Hurry.

"You have to say ""oway""."
He's here.
We'd Iike to order...
We'da like...
"I don't understand a word, I'm Venetian, been here fortwo months."
Are you alright?
I Ieft you so many messages.
Weren't you supposed to call as soon as you got there?
"Yes, but I was in a meeting."
- I have to reorganize everything.
- How are you?
"Fine, they're very welcoming."
- It's not even hot.
- Stop it.
Stop lying.
"I'm yourwife, you can tell me you're suffering."
"Sure, it's tough, it's a mess here."
I knew it!
- How well I know you.
- I'II be back in two weeks.
Taste the pastiera.

I heard a woman's voice.

"-Ah, ja,"

"-Nein,"
-Here?
"-Nein,"
Where does it hurt?
-Here?

"Ja, fuck, ja,"
You are not doctor.
You are a lying one.
Given account me immediately.
"I am not stupid, I am a German of Germany."
"No, you are an excrement German."
"All good, wanted?"
You are excited?
"Finally we can make the love,"
"Today also we have found a bloody fool,"
You cannot come on a daily basis here.
Why no?
Because you stay as an idiot.
And why I stay as an idiot?
Because yes.
"In agreement, I go away."
"He is determined, I go away."
But?

I go away.
To where you want to go?
"He is determined, I go away."
I go away.

A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
"Mommy is dead, Gonki."
Mommy is dead.
Yes.
Want me to sleep here?
Gonki Galonki is sad.
Daddy Galonki is very sad too.
How long have you been here?
I just got here.
"You look good, Daddy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
And you?
Great.
How's your son?
He is in the army theater.
That doesn't surprise me.
And your wife?
Nira and I got divorced 5 years ago.
I didn't know.
"Until it happened, I didn't know either."
"Here, something sweet."
Thank you.
"It's a good play, ""The Enchanted Nose""."
"Yes, it's never been done here before."
"Maybe in drama school, I'm not sure."
It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?
They all fit into a cab.
Could a play like that work today?
"Yeah, which takes me back to, ""Maybe we should come back tomorrow."""
No.
"This way, my darling boy."
"Ah, here he is!"
The man of the hour!
"Whassup, innit?"
"Tonight, our young boy Adam... shall become... a man!"
"I trust you'll all show him... well, us... your encouragement!"
"And just to celebrate this... very special occasion,"
I've decided to push the boat out.
"- Emma, my sweet?"
- Of course.
Number Seven's time... has finally arrived!
Number...
Seven!
"Adam, my boy, it is time... to drink him dry."
Yes.
Adam?
Adam?
Oh.
"Baby, when we get home... can you remind me to gouge out my brain with a spoon?"
- What did you see?
- Bodies.
"- Many, many bodies."
"- What, alive?"
- Very.

"You're not gonna get away with it, you hear me?"
"Holy shit... what are you, crazy, or something?"
"Hey-hey, you don't wanna fucking talk to me?"
What are you doin'?
"Hey, leave that alone, huh?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ, hold it... take it easy."
"Don't do it, don't do it."
"Hold it... no, no, no."
Holy shit.
"Holy... hey, wait a minute."
We are here to see--

"She got it, she got it"
"- Hey, guys."
- Hey.
"- Hey, Raza!"

What's up?

"- What's up, man?"
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.
What are you guys doing here?
"Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?"
"- Hey, no, no, question number one--"
- It's kind of a long story. l-  ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Yeah.
That was my idea.
"I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of all the hype over topless."
Really?
I always liked toplessness.
That's--
- Think about it.
Think about it on your own.
You're Seigaku's pillar of strength.
Stop kidding around.
Echizen's not coming again today?
What did you hear about it?
Don't worry about it?
Looks like he came to school though.
What happened?
Is it a cold?
It is a cold.
"- Ne, ne, ne, did something happen to the chibi?"
- Ah...
What do you mean something happened?
- It wasn't easy coming here.
- Then what do you want me to do?
At least help me a little.
The age of Kanto will continue tonight.

Do you mind?
"-well, turn it off!"
"Come on, will you?"
Let the girls have their music?
stanley!
There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!
"-Didn't I name it, Mitch?"
-I wasn't listening.
What were you doing?
He was looking through the drapes.
-I was looking through no drapes.

"We're gonna deal this hand again, play cards or quit."

Shall we go?
Bravo!

Scared of all these men?
No normally there's always a bunch of beggars outside the temple.
Minister Pradhan's sent us.
We're here to take you to ACP Pradhan's farm house.
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.
No.
I am scared.
I'm frightened.
Look at this I'm getting goose-bumps.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Boss.
Run!
Jump.
You jump.
Tell me something will anybody be at home?
Daddy the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?
Hello sir.
I could've pulverized your goons back there.
But then I had a brainstorm.
I left those rascals back in those lanes.
And I came visiting your home.
- No.
"- Uh, well, it's tomorrow."
"All right, um, Horace?"
Listen.
It's been a month.
I didn't need Ricky to tell me what we already know.
He's gone.
So-
- So what are you gonna do?
- What are you talking about?
What the fuck-
- What are you--
Why are you saying this to-- What are you saying to me right now?
Why are you saying this?
"- Horace, because, right now is right now."
Pete is gone.
Are you gonna do Easter?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
- Iâm not doing Easter.
Iâm not doing any of that.
None of that makes sense without Pete here.
"- Okay, so, then close this place down."
Go do something else.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
"- Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back."
- He's-
"- Horace, he is not coming back."
Horace.
"Pete is dead, Horace."
Fuck it.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."

"I don't have it all figured out, but it's about this girl after, like, an atomic war, and she has to learn how to survive on her own."
"Well, now that's depressing."
- I think it's cool.
- Depressing and cool.

You saw him with the lady and her gun.
That's it.
That's what?
That's it... we saw them.
You got out of your car?
Yeah.
"Who was there with you, aside from the lady, her son and the suspect?"
There was the one you call Touchy?
Sorry.
"Josée Morin, the dancer..."
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."

What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.

I'm on my way.
"Mrs. Rickman, I assure you..."

He was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.

He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.

Hey.
Kick me.
Come on.

Okay.

He's epileptic.
I should have told you.

"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.

Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.

... toblameadeadcop and steal a widow's rights.
You keep saying that.
Nobody's doing anything.
You've got all the answers.
Don't even have the questions yet.
"Well, I got a question for you."
You hungry?
I think we both know it didn't go as well as we'd have liked.
But I've heard from your previous employer and she speaks of you in glowing terms.
"So, I've decided to offer you the job."
Yes!
Yes!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Bang!
Yes!
I got you the job!
I got you the job!
"Oh, I got a job!"
Oh!
That is brilliant.
I'm gonna take you for a walk on the seafront.
"- Cos, boy, do I know how to celebrate!"
- Yeah.
- We got a job.
- Yeah.
- Ajob!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Oh!
"- Get out of here, you."
Oh!
You're dressed already.
What a shame.
- I'm not sure about this.
"- Oh, that was Number Two's."
He was a smallish gentleman.
That's why he only lasted such a short time.
But I think it's a close enough fit.
"Yeah, well, I usually go for a more relaxed vibe."
"Oh, but the great and the good are gathering."
"No, really, I'm fine."
Fine?
You must be exhausted.
"Multitasking, multi-flirting."
"No, I'm used to it."
"I think jealousy uses much more energy, negative energy."
Are you feeling okay?
"Oh yeah, I'm good."
I'm going over to Ricky's tonight.
"Okay, everyone out!"
"(SIGHS) Thanks, Adrian, see you around."
See you later.
Text me.
"So, let me guess."
You're going over to Ricky's to meet Amy?
"Yeah, she says she wants to meet me."
She wants to be friends.
"You know her, right?"
"Yeah, I know her."
And I kind of doubt she wants to be friends with you.
She's not going to like you.
She's probably setting you up.
It is a setup.
They're introducing me to someone.
Who?
"I don't know, but, uh, should be fun."
Could I have some more coffee?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I just ran out.
I'll have to make you some new coffee.
Hi.
Hi yourself.
You're looking for typefaces.
"You've got 45 seconds, two passes, remember."
Reveal the hive.
Helvetica.
Helvetica.
Press the letter?
Correct.
Simon.
30 seconds.
Two passes remaining.
20 seconds...
Pass.
"Pass, Helen."
Courier.
Courier?
Correct.
Simon.
"Ten seconds, one pass left."
Five seconds.
"No, you're out of time."
"Simon, you could've passed if you couldn't see it."
I did say.
One pass left.
You were concentrating...
It wouldn't have helped.
It wouldn't have helped!
All right.
"OK, let's see what you got."
"Courier, which is the standard typeface for writing plays."
And is the default setting in Hollywood.
You also found Helvetica.
Do you know where that was developed?
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.
- I got it.
Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Doing that interview would have been a really great opportunity for me.
"Last interviews are hard to get, because you never know."
I know this guy.
I like his work.
- I had lunch with him recently.
- You did?
- I did.
- IKE:
You had lunch with him?
- Yes.
"- Lunch, and, whoo!"
(LAUGHS)
"Oh, well."
"Erm... you know, I'm looking forward to reading your work."
"Hey, hey, hey, don't buy a copy."
I got plenty here.
You can have one of mine.
"Anyway, listen..."
"I gotta go to bed, OK?"
Old Ikey has got to get some rest.
Why don't you stay here tonight?
I've got a meeting at the college tomorrow.
You can drive me there.
- Erm...
- Is that good?
- Yeah.
- OK.
- I didn't bring a toothbrush.
"- Good night, everybody."
Good night.
- Night.
- Good night to you.
Yeah.
That's fantastic.
"Well, where to begin?"
"Well, first off, it's not just a bunch of nude farming."
Dad.
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.
Obviously not a coincidence.
They didn't have the machinery to move those rocks.
They're huge.
"- Yeah, they're heavy."
- Of course.
"[""IF I NEVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN"" BY MAROON 5 PLAYING ON STEREO]"
- I'm Nathan.
And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.
- Gigi.
Hi.
- Hey.
So how do you guys know Alex?
We don't.
Our friend Mary heard about this from some guy named Conor.
And how do you know Alex?
I hope...
I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.
BRUCE:
Ooh.
NATHAN:
Oh.
"So are you here as, like, a guest, or, like, his date?"
"Oh, I hate that."
When you don't know if you're a date.
Two minutes to target.
Clear the area.
Get back in there!
The Department of Homeland Security..
Get in there!
This is a mandatory evacuation..
Emily.
"No, please, please, baby."
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Tabriz targeted.
Confirm Tabriz.
"Please, baby, you gotta turn around and look at me."
Damn it.
Evacuate this area immediately!
"We need you to move back, people!"
Move back now!
Emily!
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!
My daughter was in there.
Emily Cale.
She's still in there.
Wait!
Emily!
What is with this family?
Wait for me!
Confirm Tehran.
Targeting complete.
Armed for nuclear launch.
You have 15 seconds to initiate.
"Fifteen, 14.."
SlPOWlCZ:
What's up?
- Guy in a wheelchair.
- He's got a gun on four hostages.
- I know this guy.
Let me talk to him.
- Wait for the negotiating team.
- You sure the guy's going to wait?
SERGEANT:
Get him a vest.
OFFICER:
Got it.
Ernie Dowd!
It's Detective Sipowicz!
"- I'm coming in, Ernie!"
ERNIE:
I got no beef with you.
"We'll be done in here in a while, then everyone can come in."
You got no problem with the bartender.
Why don't you let the bartender out?
"Yeah, go ahead."
- Put this on my tab.
BARTENDER:
Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
"I'm coming in, Ernie."
"You were over there, weren't you?"
"Couple inches the other way, I'd be just like you."
"You gotta cut this out, man."
They got guns out there.
They don't know these three are assholes.
Please.
"Good, together."
Why didn't you shoot?
-And you?
It's much worse for him to live like this.
You'd do him a favour by killing him.
That the bastard's ending like this...
-Excellent.
Couldn't be better.
Can I do anything for you?
"-No, I don't need any help."
I could buy the collected works of Marx and Lenin from you.
They're for my son when he graduates.
He'll never read them.
-You don't know that.
Elinor?
Marianne.
"Marianne, I do believe you're better."
"Yes, I feel better."
(CARRIAGE APPROACHES)
How long have I been in bed?
I don't even know.
"It is ten o'clock, exactly as the Colonel promised."
Mama is here.
Mama?
"Oh, Mama!"
Do not excite yourself... for her sake.
Elinor!
"Oh, my darling, are we in time?"
You're smiling!
"- Oh, Marianne."
This isn't good.
This is fabulous.
I love it.
"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially
"""amazing..."""
Where have you been'?
An ice-cold milkshake for you.
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Why?
"Oh, Carol."
"Oh, God!"
"Hey, Jack."
Amy told me the good news.
"In my culture, when two people start dating, you give them a present."
They're condoms.
"Hm, I really thought these would have wrappers."
You seem to be enjoying this.
Nice to see cocky Jack Gordon uncomfortable for once.
Yeah.
Especially because of that secret you have with Jack.
[laughs]
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, I think you do."
A real challenge... delicious!
Just tell me what happened.
Sex?
Rehab?
Embezzlement?
Sex?
Animal fighting?
Hit and run?
Sex?
Roland's secret son?
"Damn it, woman!"
You're showing no emotion!
How is this possible?
!
I'm British.
"I think the real question should be, Mason, why the obsession with secrets?"
Who betrayed you?
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
No.
Does anybody?
Probably.
Okay.
Pine Street.
Windward Elementary.
"""Sunset."" Where the hell is ""Sunset""?"

"$651,000."
"That's what, 55 years of back pay the government never gave you?"
They owe me.
They stole my star.
They took my pension.
Who are you?
"I wrote a book about Alcatraz, and pretty much everything in it is wrong."
You write about me?
- No.
- Why not?
I was there.
I was important.
The Warden said so himself.
"Gave me the royal treatment, him and his lady head-shrinker."
There were no female doctors on Alcatraz.
Let's go.
Both of you.
Where?
Sunset Beach.
The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song.
He painted the mines to blend in with the sand.
That's where we'll find Hauser.
Or what's left of him.

2nd: the Westfield at 1.23.02.
And first - the amazing Radical at 1.19.08.
"Right, diesel engines."
Three makers didn't do diesel engines.
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
"Now, the last one has now gone."
Jaguar.
No!
It's terrible.
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE
Are you OK?
That's nasty.
It's horrific news.
"They're doing a V6 in the S-type, and a four cylinder in the X-type."
Which has nothing to do with Ford.
"It won't be a Ford engine, it's a Jaguar engine in every way!"
Yep.
"But if you pick at ""Jaguar"", it might say "".. ord"" underneath."
I have worries about this.
"Jaguar is stealthy, sleek..."
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.
Stig.
Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER
That simply won't work.
"It loses something, doesn't it?"
Make this quick.
"We're all gonna pull you through this, all right?"
Positive attitude - that's everything.
"Hey, pal, he got shot in the leg."
I think he'll be fine.
Let's hope so.
Be careful with him!
[ Larry ] What are you doing?
I'm trying to disconnect this so we can get out of here.

With all the stuff I was bringing.
"Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten?"
"I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please."
- What?
- Stasik and I are separated.
- Divorced?
"- Not yet, but it's going to happen."
"- Oh, Nina!"
"- Mama, I beg you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Mama, please."
"I'm begging you, mama."
I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing.
"How can you, you got a daughter!"
"I've just informed you, that's all."
I wish I'd never come here!
I'm going away from here.
Nina!
Nina!
"- What is it, mom?"
- They're there with those snags!
"And look, up there!"

"Oh, mama!"
It's for me.
- Why for you?
- I swear.
Listening.
Playing again?
No brains mean a cripple.
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
- No.
I'm fine.
Follow us in the car.
Get support.
"Do you know what you're doing, Harry?"
Hold on tight.
"Screen's up, sir."
"God, don't let Clayton be driving."
"Harry, stay back!"
Get down.
Slow down!
Jesus!
Give him room!
Harry!
I see it.
Give me machete.
- What's the simple solution to the Fenchurch and Lau murders?
- Kevin Grey killed them both.
"Kevin, don't."
Hey!
Hey!

- You certainly had the motive.
Follow the lady!

"I can't say the same for the shooter, we'll get him good."
Who?
The dealer?
"No, apparently he's not the shooter."
We'll know more after the questioning.
We put him in a hotel on rue Marcadet.

"No, the Étoile d'Agadir."

"Suck it up, Greg."

I believe they were all killed during the war.
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to bury her in potter's field."

"Think of him in terms of Leslie... someone she might've known, someone who liked her a lot."
You got something?
I got an I.D. From an orderly.
The guy's name is Neal Booker.
- Neal Booker?
- Yes.
You know him?
The orderly.
He's so quiet... like he's not even there.
- He working now?
- I don't know.
I think this could be Neal... if he were really angry and scared.
"Ridge, get down to personnel."
Find out where this guy is.
"Your eyes are different, Leslie."
They gave them to her.
They're not the right color.
They... they took the corneas.
Just the clear window on top.
The windows of the soul.
I've been looking for you.
In all of them.
I... saw them... carry pieces of you away.
I'm here.
Put it on.
You have 30 seconds.
-As in left or died?
-Died.
"- Well, I'm very sorry."
- We were hunted down one by one.
All that they died for is this.
It's a Purean.
It contains a collective data of human progression as well as Draconian war plans.
Information that could be very helpful in our cause in overcoming them.
- And how are you gonna get that to your people?
- A rescue ship arrives tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
-At sun fall.
-So you're going home?
-No.
I'm not.
Turn left up here.
Your camera.
"-Your friend, is he..."
-From here?
No.
She's Arctorian.
- I don't think I've ever met an Arctorian before.
Is she part of this interstellar alliance?
-They are.
-Are they here to help us?
-Very much so.
-Good.
That's good.
-They're here.
-My God.
-This is Robert.
- The one you spoke?

Okay.
Now talk to me.
What was so bad?
I was in this room.
And it was red.
DAVID:
All right.
"- And there was no doors, no windows."
- Mm-hmm.
"And these curtains, they were on fire."
And I was in this corner.
Right.
"(STAMMERING) And I was looking out, and there was someone else there."
She was staring at me through the flames.
Then I woke up and...
"Well, hey, well, don't worry, all right?"
It was just a bad dream.
"Previously on ""Once Upon A Time""... (Grunts) Killing me's gonna take a lot more than that, dearie."

"Take a look, Aunt Rosa."
"On the bench, next to Mom's purse..."
- Yes?
- There's a man's bag and hat.
So what?
Lots of men in Marseille wear hats.
Marseille?
When were we in Marseille?
"What do you mean, Marseille?"
"I told you, this is Paris."
You just said Marseille.
"I made a mistake, so what?"
I'm not feeling well.
- Just tell us who took the picture.
- I did!
"Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa."
When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery.
You couldn't have taken it.
What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
- Oh...
But that wasn't then.
"I'm telling you, I took the picture."
Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-.
I'll show you.
- What?
- Your whole hat theory...
I feel like an idiot.
Why does she call me Doborobon?
It's been half an hour.
She fell asleep.
"Check her, maybe she's dead."

"-A moment, I have an idea."
-What?
"Iros, wait for me in billiards, I are in charge."
You wait for me there.
"Iros, iros."
"God, I am all wet."
You enter?
you are oxidized?
-We do not have oil?
-It closes and it starts.
"-Good evening, Italia."
"-Ah, Moroni, you are."
"Yes, you have to understand that they are only kidding and I have come to apologize."
Créame.
"Of agreement, it happens, You are all wet."
Thanks.
"I am going to dry you, give me the jacket."
"Thanks, you are very kind."
-Sit down.
-Thanks.
-Thanks to take the annoyance.
"-One does not worry, dry."
Thanks.
"I hope, hearing."
Italy.
"When I saw you with Ciotti, I became crazy from jealousy."
"Uh, um..."
OK.
I've done the catheterization.
"Yeah, no, I wasn't talking to you."
"Hey, Sam."
You two know each other.
"Yeah, that's right."
"Biblically, even."
We dated.
We did not date.
We were in love.
Or at least I was.
I'm really sorry about Stephanie.
Sam...
"Hey, sweetie."
- I don't want to.
I can't.
- I know.
- Not without Stephanie...
- I know.
I don't want to go on.
"I know, listen:"
"I gotta tell ya,"
"I have never been afraid of anything my entire life, except for your father."
"So I have got to go in and look for blockages and try to fix them so he doesn't kill me, OK?"
"OK, let's do this."
Alright...
"OK, Dr. Conner, you are looking at perfectly healthy arteries."
There's no blockages here.
So it's not a heart attack.
No.
"OK, let's check the ventricles."
"We all ride, one of us is bound to cross his path."

You got a chance to finish this now.
You may not get another one.
"Alrighty, then."
Meet up at my wagon in 20 minutes.
"-Vin, good luck to you."
"-Thank you, ma'am."
Twenty minutes?
Long enough for a man to get to know someone.
Right?
[MAN laughing ]
[LUCY laughing ]
Buck!
Uh... .
"Buck, honey."
"I think you can drop the ""honey"" part."
"Oh, Buck. I'm sorry."
I sure never wanted you to find out about Luther this way.
-Luther?
-What?
"is that your name, boy?"
"-Well, yeah."
BUCK:
Luther?
"-You gotta understand, Buck."
-What do I gotta understand?
Luther is the father of my baby.
But he wouldn't admit it.
"So l-- Well, I made a play for you, Buck."
"Oh, wait, are you telling me I was second choice to him?"
"No, no, it was only a play to force his hand."

I thought we were through the hard times.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"I'd been sick for about three months... uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and..."
- This is gonna sound weird. [Chuckles]
- Please.
My life?
No judgment.
L-lt's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that... but I...
I wanted... the opportunity... to show him that I could be there for him.
You know?
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what recovery is all about.
"You know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
[Chuckles]
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids... boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
[Sighs] Assembly line.
Boring.
- Come on.
I told you.
"If you don't mind my French, all right?"
You be quiet.
He's off the force if he does not start answering questions.

Start giving us answers.
And I'll tell you something.
We know anyway.
"So do yourself a favor, and stop fuckin' around."
[ E.M.S. Officer ] Yo.!
Hey.!
"- We gonna talk or what, man?"
- When your rep gets here.
- Fuck the rep.
I gotta talk to you.
- When your rep gets here.
"Rueben, can you call E.M.S. about this guy?"
Yeah.
"Hey, Moe, Harbor found one of Superboy's shoes."
What about the socks?
They find them too?
Fuckin' shoe.
Jack Rector's comin' in tomorrow at 9:00.
- What about Donlan?
"- Uh, next week."
- His P.D.A. attorney says--
- Who's that?
Who's his lawyer?
- This guy Sloan.
- Sloan?
"Ooh, big gun."
Says he's grieving and all depressed for his nephew.
"Oh, Ray's all grieving and depressed."
That if none of them make it back...
Then the photographs they took at the exchange...

She is not your concern.
Wasn't that enough?
Stop walking around.
"Frankie, go do some homework."
I've done my homework.
Do some reading.
Watch TV.
Do something.
"Grandpa, all I need is the truck."
I know you know that I mean.
"Come on, Ma, let me have the truck."
I got a date!
What do you take me for?
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.
He's cool;
American style.
His parents are Chinese-style cool.
"Frankie likes going out, but they'd rather he work in the store, selling milk and bread and lizards."
Ugh!
"I mean, do I try to interfere with your bookkeeping?"
!
My business is comedy!
That's what I do!
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!
"Yes, you are."
They're the money guys.
"Okay, slippery, bath time's over."

But I just got in.
"Oh, sure."
I believe that one.
"10 years ago to this day, his father died here."
He was waiting for a train as he did every evening.
"He had a good job, happy family."
"And one evening, he'd had enough."
"And when the express came by, he jumped."
Was he a friend of yours?
"And these last few days,"
Dennis has come here every evening.
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?
Look at him.
- Why should I?
- Look at him.
"Because in about two minutes,"
Dennis there will be dead.
What the f...
You're crazy.
Completely crazy.
"You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit, right across the platform."
Look!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
"Listen, don't do it!"
"Please, put the gun down!"
Is this your first time?
You seem kind of young.
He's here to see Dr. Kay.
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.
"Mano, Erik!"
Mother!
-Glory!
"My beautiful boys, I you never see them."
We have to find a way to take you there.
"Honey, everyone is looking for a way out."
"If there is an exit, we'll find."
"Do not worry, Dad."
"Today, the Uncle Mano took an enormous elephant seal a large black hole."
But that hole was quite different.
-But he drew.
"-Mano, can bring a fish for my children."
"-For me, too."
"-Here, too."
"Okay, will do my best."
"Hey, listen!"
There's a way of freeing almost all of you.
"I'm going to delelândia, I'll bring some friends."
"Will be patients, all right."
Where you going?
-I take a shortcut.
-Of course not.
-You will be right here.
-But I'm quick.
-Erik.
"-Walk away, she is an athlete."
"Sorry, Erik, I will go faster."
Boadicea!

I'm impossible even.
"-Then, boot to break, girl."
-Yay!
- Will I?
"- Yeah, totally."
"You've got the pony bug now, and there's no cure for that."
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl.
Back in time for dinner.
"Okay, I've had the most insane day."
I don't know where to start.
Uh...
"Sam, she asked me to help with Raven, he's a horse."
"And Pin was like, ""Back off, tourist."""
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?
"It sounds like you had fun, whatever you were doing."
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...
I don't want you riding.
What?
Why?
Because I need you keeping an eye on Rosie.
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable?
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's fine.
She doesn't have to be with me the whole time.
This isn't up for discussion.
I've got enough to worry about with Gramps and your dad and...
Just... promise me.
No riding.
Sure.
No riding.
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
"Joanie, I got a surprise."
"Oh, is it a food surprise?"
I love food surprises.
What on earth is that?
It's a mini-horse.
"Her name is Lemonade, and she's come to live in our house forever."
What?
- Isn't she great?
- No!
It looks like a child in an animal suit.
"Well, come on, give her a pet."
- (neighs) - (gasps)
Oh!
"Now, that's no way to treat family, Lemonade."
Be nice.
Aw...
Now you're just flirting to flirt.
She'll come around.
I promise you.
"Come on, girl."
Let's go night-night.

"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.

"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head."
But I couldn't control my body.
I could see what I was doing.
But I couldn't stop.
I just wanted to stop.

There was nothing like it.
I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.
"You know, a 21-year-old kid with such connections."
- Not for idea.
"Yes, yes."
- Not gonna happen.
"Strength, me dia."
"Then, Mr. Duncan Lloyd..."
Are you serious?
- Only when I can not breathe.
Did you really recognize that border guard?
A few years ago I made a film about Balkan beauties.
How do you speak Serbian?
- I've been here during the war.
We have a problem.
It must be from civil war.
"- No, there were floods."
Do you see all those locked woods there?
Water has passed.
A nice nuisance.
This is not a scene with a destroyed bridge.
It is a scene with a very different obstacle.
An obstacle to me and my past difficult.
Duncan!

It's me!

"What the hell are you doing here, man?"
I?
What the hell are you doing in my Serbia?

"Dragan, brother."
- Duncan the Beone.
My friend.
Good.
"You haven,t eaten, I hope."
- Nice trip?
- Us?
"We got lost at first, but after that it was easy."
"Here,s the paperwork."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, against the wall, please."
Very good.
Now undress.
"That,s right - undress."
"Lab coats off, shoulders against the wall."
"Jean-MicheI, tell us how you met."
Me or...
"Sure, CIaudine."
"At some friends, dinner party."
"I hadn,t really noticed him."
"But at a certain point our eyes met,"
",cause we were both bored."
- You were bored?
- Yes.
THEY WERE BORED.
He smiled and then -
"It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but..."
I was surprised when he called me afterwards.
",We got to know each other, Iike in the song."
What song?
By Hugues Aufray.
could you sing it for us?
"No, not Iike this."

"Congratulations, Mac."
Thank you very much.
I owe my victory entirely to your kindness.
"No, it's due to your excellent engine."
Or perhaps to Mrs. Hudson's lunch basket.
"Oh, that may be right."

"As soon as I know, you'll know."
Her name is Siri Albert.
"She's 25, lives in Manassas, and works as a physical therapist."
- Finn's fiancée is here.
I put her in the conference room.
- You did?
I did.
"No, I did."
His fiancée?
"Yeah, his fiancée."
Tall ?
Like brown hair ?

Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from Iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in Jackson, Pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That James Finn has been dead three months.
He left for Iraq three months ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay, but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.

- This ends tonight.

"- Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
- Why do we keep hurting each other?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not--
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
I count that.
- Yeah.
"- Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just-- want us to be normal again."
"- Yeah, me too."
- I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
- What?
- Why did I say that?
- Why did you kiss Holt?
- I didn't.
I did.
"We did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything."
"Just forget I said anything, right?"
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
Uh...
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not good enough!

- Go back upstairs.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.

"[Tracy] No, Kaman."
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
"Kaman, drop it."
"You shoot me, I drop this, and they burn."
Then what?
"You move, you die."
I am king.
IMANDINKA GROWLSI
Do you realize that you came this close to hitting me out there?
"Gosh, Ed."
I'm sorry.
"-I'm really miffed, Alan."
-My mind wasn't on it.
I was thinking about that Donahue Show I gotta do tomorrow.
He's ruthless.
Ed.
Ed....
BILLIE:
"No, I don't want-"
- No--
-Just look at him.
"When they dragged him out, his face looked like a pizza."
"Come on, come on, he's right over here."
"Look at him, he's fine."
Hi. toots.
-Hey. you're not allowed in here.
-We've got passes.
-We're looking for Bull Shannon.
-Who?
He's a big guy.
Kind of weird-looking.
"All right, let's have your attention."
"Gents and ladies, meet the next wrestling champion of the world."
IWHININGI Hey. you promised me I'd be champ next.
"Don't get bitchy, Ed."
[NORMAL VOICE] I'm sorry.
I've been on the edge lately.
This new fabric softener isn't working out at all.
Now he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"
Angie W.
"[CHUCKLES] Angie W., Tricia S., Tony D."
Don't any of you people have any last names?
"Look, I heard the gunshot,"
"I saw the fire, just like a hundred other people, all right?"
Can I go now?
"Yeah, yeah, you can go."
"Hey, but first, uh..."
"Can I bum a smoke, please?"
[LAUGHS] Sure.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"All right, here."
Right.
Having a rough time?
"Nasty, nasty habit."
I'm handling it.
That's what they all say.
"Seriously, I'm just down to one a day, a pack a month, tops."
Really.
"And, um, how many more do you bum?"
"A few, and you must be Clara B., right?"
Clara Barton?
No.
Monica.
Let's go.
Hail Mahadev!
Look.
I've already been punished for my crimes.
Let's end this enmity.
For that one needs to kill the enemy.
Understand!
Go on.
Kill him!
Catch him.
No matter what color you paint on black... it'll still remain black.
Raghunath.
He's already slipped out of our hands.
And now he's out of Satyakant Shashtri's life too.
Shiv.
Listen carefully.
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.
And you.
Satyakant.
Get out of here.
There's no place for a murderer in Dharam kunj.
From today you're dead for me and for all of us.
You're dead!
You're dead!
Brother!

So Boss.
You should've called me instead uncle.
No no it's always the needy that come to the provider.
How can someone like you be sulking?
Thank God.
Idiot!
What's up bro?
"A busy day, huh?"
How is your aunt Shukran?
I want to visit heragain but she neverpicks up the phone.
She is still looking for a job.
I told her.
She could work here.
She can't...
Her new boyfriend is overly jealous.
Anyway...
Bitch.
Don't be late.
I hold yourroom free the whole day.
"Madam, it is every Turkish men's duty to serve his country as a soldier."
Yourson is no exception but he is a draft dodger.
Concealing his whereabouts is a crime...
Listen son.
Can's father died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
Can's brotheralso joined the army and he is burnt out now.
Can is not a draft dodger...
Anyway...

Samantha.
"You've just--you've just grown up so beautifully, you know?"
- l have?
- Yeah.
You should see me.
I'm kind of goofy-looking?
Ha ha!
"Lucky for you, you look like your mom."
You think Mom was pretty?
"Yes, she was."
She was really pretty.
Do you mind if l--
What?
Can you lean toward me?
is that allowed?
Here.
You're not that bad.
"[laughs] I got both my eyes, my nose, my mouth."
[clicks] All my teeth.
"Me, too."
Yeah.
"Samantha, um, about everything--"
You don't have to say anything.
"Well, let me--let me-- l did this to you."
"And if nothing else comes of this, at least you can finally hear me say how sorry I am."
"I'm--l'm really sorry, honey."
[crying] I'm sorry.
She doesn't belong there.
"I mean, it's for retarded people."
She doesn't belong in that place.
Samantha signed a consent form.
- Do you understand?
"And Richard, you either tell me right now what's got your brother so riled up, or I end this goddamn thing right now!"
Tell him.
"Tell him, or I'll show him."
- Show him what?

She's a... a...

"Say goodbye, Reina!"
You're goin' home!

"Oh, this is some serious B-movie shit."

Ah!

Gotta take care of this son of a bitch old school!
"- Come on, you bastard!"
- Eddie!
Ahh!

"- [Seth] Hang on, Eddie, we're gonna..."
- We're gonna get you help.
"- Hey, Eddie, don't move."
"Just look at me, man."
Be a good girl.
"Whoa, Annie!"
Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie?
They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.
"Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me."
"MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks..."
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!
"- Very good, sir."
"- Steal Annie, will they?"
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
"Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?"
"Yes, sahib."
"Here is the bridge, sahib."
- Is this bridge safe?
"- It's safe, sahib."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
My spa treatment.
Cupping.
Cupping?
Yeah.
"You know, I thought it was gonna hurt, but honestly, I snoozed through the whole thing."
"By the time I woke up, I was down two dress sizes."
"Before the cupping, did you eat any pudding?"
Darn tootin'.
Licked the bowl clean.
[ Laughs ]
"Donna, do you remember who did this treatment?"
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
"[ Laughs ] Evelyn, you are looking great."
Just 10 more pounds till your goal weight.
Do you mind if I borrow my wife for a sec?
I'll be back.
[ Chuckles ]
"Looking good, ladies."
Thank you.

The new guys aren't personal trainers.

"By night, known as Hogarth."
Got it.
"Well, come on inside, kid."
Sorry about the crowbar.
You'd be surprised how many people wanna steal scrap.
"But, man, once I turn it into art, I can't give it away."
"I mean, what am I?"
A junkman who sells art or an artist who sells junk?
You tell me.
HOGARTH:
I like it...
I think.
"Listen, you're, you're not gonna call my mom, are you?"
She doesn't know I'm out.
I...
"Don't worry, kid."
"Look, it's not my style to report a guy to the authorities."

DEAN:
Wait here.
I'm going to go get the old man.
"Jimmy, don't go."
I was wrong.
I thought you were my friend.
"Ciao, Jimmy!"
"Hey, I'm here to see Maria, Maria Concetta."
- Jimmy?
"- We'll talk later, alright?"
- Don't go.
- Jimmy.
Relax Captain.
Get in line like everybody else...
- What are you waiting for?
"- The virgin of Naples, isn't it?"
Bullshit!
I hear she even does it with horses.
- How was it?
- Save your money.
Put it into war bonds.
I'd stick it anywhere if I could just find a hole.

Impossible.
You want to be with her?
"- You know, mooning about."
"Daydreaming, singing to herself."
"You haven't noticed, hmm?"
"Oh, well, I..."
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
[Gulps] Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
"- In love, hmm?"
"[Whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!"
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans?
What about humans?
Humans?
[chuckles nervously]
Who said anything about humans?
[yelps]
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
You'll see.
It's a surprise.
"Oh, Flounder."
"Flounder, you're the best!"
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
"[Giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?"
"Oh, this is all so... so sudden."
You aren't so special- He's fed up with all of us-.
I have to talk to my son.
"Say ""Daddy"", Yarivi."
"Yarivi, say ""Daddy."""
"""Daddy-""."
"He's a night owl, like me."
What?
Who's a cutie?
Who's a cutie?
Who's beautiful?
Why don't you bring him here?
He's growing up in exile.
- He's with his mom in Budapest.
"- Where's Budapest, in the Negev?"
"She's in school there, pest."
If you married her she wouldn't have left.
But like an idiot you told her you're bi.
- 'Cause I'm not a liar.
"- ""Bi"" my ass"
There's no such thing as bi.
"What is it, a bivalve?"
"What are you, an oyster?"
Go ahead and laugh.
Budapest...
Everyone there is anti-Semitic.
- They closed them.
- Closed what?
"The concentration camps, didn't you hear?"
"Just you wait, what was, shall be again and there's nothing new under the sun."
- Hello.
- Hello.
Your dad sent this.
- Stronger.
- What?
[Scoffs] Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those.
Where'd you get those?
Will it show up on the test?
Will these narcotics show up on a drug test?
- Hey.
- What?
"Seriously, why don't we do this more often?"
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
[Knock on door]
"Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors."
They're early.
My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined.
You had a lot of these growing up?
How do you think I put myself through med school?
[Laughs]
"Come on, aunt Hallie."
It starts in five minutes.
"Uh-oh, what do we have here?"
VIP guests for the parade?
- Aunt Hallie!
- Hey.
"- Hey, Viv."
Hey.
- How ya doing?
- Can't complain.
- Good?
"- How's, um--how's your mom?"
- Viv.
"No, it's fine."
Not what I'm saying.
And I'm sorry that I said that about Anna-Kat.
And I'm sorry that I missed so many things when you were younger.
- Mm.
"- You know, like that weird, um, break-dancing thing."
- Mm-hmm.
- It was always so important to you.
"Well, it's never too late, Mom."
Okay?
Okay.
Unh!
Unh-unh!
Unh!
Wow.
Mm-mm-mm!
That's something.
"All right, why don't you help me get out of this thing, and then we can go downstairs and enjoy ourselves before Viv's happy pills wear off?"
"I mean, where did you get this thing?"
"Oh, I visited Ruth Jackson in the home."
- Mm-hmm.
- And this was in her closet.
- Mm.
- That woman doesn't have a clue.
- No.
"- Half the time, she goes to lunch nude."
Thank you for your gift earlier.
- Oh!
- It did the job.
I've got gobs of them.
I'm really glad you came.
Wow.
These pills are powerful.
- Let it be.
Let it be.
Seriously?
- Let it be.
Sure?
Hello.

Bad guys don't turn that down.
Okay?

Not like that.

He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
"When everyone started hitting him, he escaped."
"If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name..."
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
"No idea, Sir."

His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.

My paycheck.
"Yes, okay."

"Fuck, James?"
"- I'm sorry, sir."
I am so sorry.
"Shit, open the door."
Horace.
"-Good night, ma belle."
-Good night.
"-Good night, Horace."
-Good night.
You make an awfully handsome couple.
Naturally.
I'm married to the second prettiest girl in New York.
-Good night.
-Good night.
"Everything is all right with them now, isn't it, Horace?"
"I think so, Nora."
It's worked itself out.
"-Fun, wasn't it?"
-I love our Thursday nights.
"You're such a lamb, flirting with mother, asking just the right questions."
But I do wish you could come home with me.
So do I.
"I don't think I'll be very late, darling."
It's just a question of reminding Frank that he's a reasonably honest man.
-Shall I wait up for you?
"-Yes, do."
We'll have a nightcap together.
We might even hold hands.
"-Your car is here, Mr. Belney."
"-Oh, thank you."
-Can I drop you?
-It's early.
I think I'll stop in at the Del Rio for a drink.
Join me?
"No, but I'll take you there."
But I'd much rather you went home and worried about me.

"- Hello, Aliki."
"- How are you, Dimitris?"
"- You're wanted on the phone, sir."
- Coming.
Excuse me.
You can go on with your chat.
I have some more calls to make before lunch.
Your poor father does his best to leave us two alone.
"Shouldn't we make him happy, Aliki?"
"We could make him so happy, living with him in this house."
- Why insist Dimitris?
"- Because I love you, Aliki."
"I've always loved you, ever since you were a little girl."
And because I always believed the day of marrying you would arrive.
"I love you, too, Dimitris."
But as an old childhood friend.
"Allah, I will never die."
You can't kill me.

I promise I'll make it worth your while.
"What's the matter, sweetie?"
"I mean, are you sure?"
Yeah.
"Um, Dave said he came in this morning and didn't give any notice."
Just walked out the door.
"Oh, it's the lawyer calling me back."

Hello?
"Yes, this is Samantha."
Hey.
There you go.
"Sorry, we're closing."
I know.
"But, Dave, look, I heard that Kai quit, and I really need to talk to him."
"So, do you have his phone number?"
"He doesn't want me giving that to anyone, especially you."
Dave!
"Look, please."
"Something is going on with him, and..."
"Kai, he loves this job."
Apparently not.
He didn't even give me two weeks notice.
Did he tell you that he's quitting his band?
What?
!
Last thing he said before he walked out.
I don't know what's happening to him.
"Please, please,"
"Dave, I really need to talk to him."
This is his address.
He's not answering his phone.
You didn't get this from me.
Uh-huh?

Thank you so much for inviting me over and letting me meet you and John.
Ricky loves you both so much.

"Wow, really?"
Which one of us was your favourite?
OK.
OK.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
- Hey.
- These are my friends!
Anyway.
"Yeah, good one."
Almost beard to beard.
Nice.
No.
Justin actually wrote us a letter asking for a simple favor.
So...
"- Yeah, you're on, buddy."
"- Don't blow it, dude."
I won't.
Are all the Backstreet boys taking a poo together?
"Uh, Candace I, I believe that when you meet the person that you're supposed to of your life with, you shouldn't wait around."
You should just know it and go for it.
So with that said...
Holy crap balls!

"Oh, my God."

"I wouldn't be won'th a damn today, if it wasrt for her."
And it was more than that.
She was my friend.
Hey.
"Take it easy, Ward..."
"Exactly what time did it happen, Lieutenant?"
"Last night, sir."
About ten minutes to nine.
Ten minutes to nine.
God knows what I was doing when she could have used my help.
"Alone in my room, probably, with some idiot script."
"You were not, you were watching the ballgame with me."
I was?
A ballgame?

I was alone.

Okay.
He's heading north now.

Melvin?
"What is it, Melvin?"

- Nothing.
- Come on.
It's not like you've never seen this sort of thing before.
It's just that she's so young.

I have also curious to know why you're acting so weird.
Me I'm weird ?
!
strange.
I'm strange.
strange.
I'm strange.
You really have something strange ... training or me ?

"the West Sitting Hall, and the president's bedroom."
"Killick, he's trying to burn the place."
Second floor.
Send your men.
Tyler?
Turn off the goddamn sprinklers!
Who makes this shit?
"Oh, shit!"
What was that?
I've been waiting all day to kill you.
Stop hurting my White House!
German mantle clock.
Empire style.
"Killick, report!"
"Killick, what the hell is happening?"
Report!
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?
Dad!
She's here with me..
"in the Oval Office, so why don't you come down and get her?"
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make all this shit personal?
"Oh, you're talking to me about personal.."
when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I should've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kill this prick.
Hey!
What?
You lied to all of us.
"So if she's a fucking head case, why do you even want to get involved with this one?"
I think she just needs some guidance.
And I've already had some sponsors asking about her.
- Who?
- Slaughter Water.
- Did you pitch Ryan?
"- Yeah, they don't want him."
He has an image problem I have to figure out.
Fuck.
Too fucked up for Slaughter Water.
How'd that happen?
Yeah?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Mario Goldsmith can be here by 4:00.
- Perfect.
- You did not.
I'm just gonna apologize to him.
I'm gonna smooth things over.
"You know what, I don't even care."
Just keep rubbing my feet.
Enjoy your meal.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your...
Order?
[Sighs]
Terry:
I'll take a triple cheeseburger.
- [Cash register beeping]
- Extra onions...
And chili.
And...
- A tantalising invitation.
"- David, please..."
"Drink up, darling."
"- You'll be packed and ready, won't you?"
- You needn't worry.
I'm ready now.
Good.
Daddy.
"Mother, I apologise for David."
He finds it difficult to be with people now.
- You understand?
"- Of course, darling."
- My poor girl.
- No.
I'm all right.
We're all all right.
"Aren't we, Tom?"
"Aye, indeed we are."
"Well, goodbye, Mistress."
These are for you and your husband.
There's little enough to eat in London at the moment.
"Thank you, Tom."
"Thank you, Tom."
"Come on, Tom."
He's drunk.
- Is he always like that?
"- Most of the time, but he's a good friend."
"Any time you want to come home, you and Jo..."
No.
"My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo."
It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure.
- I'm afraid it was.
Ha ha.
"Touché, Eddie."
"Come on, let's go and pay for the stuff."
I've remembered why we shouldn't be here.
- We have no cash.
"- Eddie, I am a celebrity."
Celebrities don't need money.
- Next.
- Ha ha ha.
Boo!
"Hello, love."
"It's me, Richie Rich."
A-ha!
It's just cancer crunch and a trolley of meat.
I'll give you a mensh on my next prog.
"£200, please."
"My dear girl, you don't seem to understand."
"I, Richie Rich, am offering you, nobody, a mensh on my next prog."
- Right.
This requires subtle handling.
"- £200, please."
How does it feel to be a checkout girl who's reached the peak of your potential?
How does it feel to know that you're a talentless git who never even had any potential?
- I see.
"- £200, please."
Uh.
Stitch that.
I think you're on there.
I know a come-on when I see it.
This is ridiculous.
Somebody here tell donkey face who I am.
We don't know.
It seems there was an argument.
She fell down the stairs.
Potentially a blow to the head before she fell.
Potentially?
- l don't have all the facts yet.
- Is she all right?
"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.
I'm late.
Your-- Your dad went home.
"So, um... your ne_ hearing is in 28 days."
OK.
And we will get you moved then.
28 days.
That's when we'll move you.
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.
-Perfect!
"-keep quiet, she already comes."
Thanks.
-Young lady.
-Yes?
You often suffers migraine?
From time to time.
"You feel nauseous, dispepsia, schizophrenia?"
"Good, in fact..."
"Sickness, pains to the legs?"
Why?
I am ill?
-It is possible.
-It could be serious.
"Please, Professor, help me."
We would have to examine you.
-I undress?
-You are not embaressed?
"-Good, in fact..."
"-Young lady, we are doctors."
We on a daily basis see a great amount of naked women.
"Good, then..."
"Well, we will help you."
-Lie down in the sofa.
-Comfortable position.
We are going to examine you.
"-Lie down, trust us."
We undo this...
"-Everything, Doctor?"
"-Yes, it is better."
He already is...
"The next time, a bad zipper"
- Shut up!
"- Dude, come on..."
- I said shut up!
Go!
get me out of here!
Help!
"Excuse me, can I see your ticket?"
That trunk yours...?

"Hey, it's Fred!"
My life is a horror movie!
It's so scary!
I'm so scared!
"And you'll be, too, once you hear about it."
You'll be scared and scarred.
Scare-arr-red!
"That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined."
Which is what you'll be.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Do you want to hear about it or not?
Meet me in the kitchen.
"Usually, I lead a very normal life, go to school, hang with friends, see my girl."
"You remember Judy, right?"

Long distance?
Are you still there?
Are you ready for your call?
"Yes, I'm ready."
KAREN:
Hello?
"(MIMICKING GRETCHEN) Karen, darling."
How divine to talk to you again.
It's been a long time.
"Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it?"
"Much too long, you naughty girl, you."
We must get together again real soon for a rousing game of mahjong.
"Oh, I'd just love to."
"Oh, by the way, Karen, my dear."
I have an enormous favor to ask of you.
My Bobby...
Booby?
"No, not booby."
Bobby.
"- Oh, my."
Now that's going to leave a mark.
[Pants]
All aboard for the transdimensional express.
Huh?
[sighs]
Why me?
This can't be good for my cold.
But this is no time for selfish thoughts.
It's time for a little turnabout.
Ew!
Can you get any more disgusting?
Don't make me come in there.
Wait a second. [sniffs]
Smells like... ambush!
"Mucal invader, is there no end to your oozing?"
[Pants] Adaptor!
[Pants] Adaptor!
Adaptor!
Thanks.
I've had enough chasing.
"It's your turn now, Thorozpog."
Thrakkorzog!
Thrakkorzog!
"With a K. Boy, are you ever rude."
Eat your brain!
No brains today.
"We're only serving humble pie, Whatchimozog."
"- Listen, for the last time it's..."
- Thoraxinabog?
- Thrakkorzog!
"- Ah, Laxativelog."
Richie Rich.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Here we go.
Break a leg.
- OK.
"Get off, you maniac."
"Hello, hello."
Shut up.
"Hi, God bless and if you can't be good, be careful."
Ho ho ho.
Right.
"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."
Happiness
Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."

He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?
I haven't gone this fast in years.
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.
Serpentine!
"Serpentine, serpentine!"
What in the blue blazes?
Crazy hot-rodder.
"I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower."
"The sixties weren't good to you, were they?"
What?
That's not the Interstate!
Ah!
Oh!
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ow!
"I'm not the only one seeing this, right?"
- Incoming!
"- Whoa, man."
- No!
- Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
My tires!
"Fly away, Stanley."
Be free!
"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble."
"We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track."
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
What's your strategy?
What?
Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
"When he gives the order, don't do anything, call me."
Do as I say...
- Understand?
- No.
- Perfect.
- What's the matter?
.
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, then I'II leave."
- I wanted to know...
What?
Can you confirm that FriuIi's below Austria?
- Why are you going to Pordenone?
- Where?
Pordenone.
"There's no sun, there's no sea."
There's no me.
"If you have something to say, okay, if not, I'II go back to the festival."
"Every time I have something to tell you, you gotta leave."

Fire calling fuse.

"The music's done, they're wantin' the 'works."
"I don't understand a word, could you repeat clearly?"
I can neverunderstand a word when you talk!
"Mattia, hearme?"
Shoot!
"- hello, Mattia?"
Got a minute?
I'm off the clock.
I want you to give Griff his job back.
- No.
"There, less than a minute!"
"- Well, let's talk about this."
- He almost killed a patient.
- It was an accident!
It's still no.
- Just like that?
- Yup.
- No discussion?
"- Uh, no."
Alright.
I'm not leaving until we talk about this.
Close the door on the way out.
I need to eat.
"Frank, wait!"
Nicole...
"It's OK, I just,"
"I just wanna sit with her for a bit, OK?"
OK.
I yelled down the stairs.
- What?
"- When she left for work, I was too tired to go downstairs and kiss her goodbye."
You didn't know.
No one does.
I never in a million years thought I'd marry a woman.
"I had a boyfriend, we were serious, and..."
"I met Stephanie at some first responders thing, fundraiser, and  all my everything turned upside down."
I do.
"I do,"

Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in jackson,pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That james finn has been dead three months.
He left for iraq three nths ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay,but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engad to jimmy,too?"
"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."
"- Come on, open your eyes!"
- Snap out of it!
Get your morning paper!
Read all about it!
Paper!
Get your morning paper!
Read all about it!

- Holy Toledo!
"- I took him, Gus!"
I'll say he took him!
That last right hurt me!
On the table!
"You missed a great bout, Gus!"
"Oh, you should've seen it, Gus!"
Stoker hit him with everything but the bucket!
- He was landing as often as the Marines!
- Boy!
- I'll take care of that!
- Stoker was sharper than eight razor blades!
- He got careless!
- After the third heat!
!
"I know the kid is a gone gosling, an amateur!"
"Somebody yelled, ""Yoo-hoo, Nelson, you dropped your glove!"""
"He sure did, and his duke was in it!"
- There!
- How's that eye?
It's a beaut!
I can't wait to see Nelson's hand!
- Where's Tiny and Red?
- They ain't been in here!
Huh ?
"Oh, yeah, whatever."
"I mean, sure, if you want to."
We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport.
First would be...
Luke at Holly's beach house.
"Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
Right.
At the diner.
"Yeah, and again at the mall."
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.
"Yeah, in T.J."
"Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic ?"
"Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away ?"
Hmm.
"Well, we have checked everywhere else."
Light.
Be careful.
Oh... gross.
It's okay.
What is that ?
That's Uncle Alistair.
That's your uncle ?
Yeah.
No.
"It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school."
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.
"God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
Okay.
"When I worked there last summer,"
I spent every day jumping JCBs over cement mixers.
"- Well, that's a lie."
- And I got paid a grand at the end.
- Another lie!
- I had a wank earlier
- about your mum's tits.
Is that alle?
- I hope so.
- It's not.
"- Oh, good."
"- Sorry, mate."
- I ain't your fucking mate!
He's touchy.
It's probably cos he's such a short arse!
- What d'you say?
- What?
"- He's taking the piss, Danny."
- Yeah?
I'll fucking do you.
"- Yeah, whatever."
- Wanker.
- What's his problem?
"- Ooh, don't cry, Simon!"
"Yeah, good one."
"Um, catch up in a bit."
"Oh, that's right, run after her, that's not creepy!"
"I may not have received any Valentine's cards, but that didn't mean I hadn't sent any."
Charlotte!
"Oh, hello."
Happy Valentine's day.
Did you get any cards?
Bye.
Hello?
I'm Max.
"Excuse me, I thought you were Cristina."
I got the wrong number.
Sorry.
Fermín?
I'm Max.
"Hey, don't you remember Cristina's number by any chance?"
What do you mean Cristina who?
"Well, some years went by but... you know Cristina."
"Yes, of course, that Cristina!"
All of a sudden I thought I could remember her number.
Yes that's right.
It's possible that she doesn't live there anymore.
"But, I don't know."
Nothing in particular.
I just... wanted to know how she was.
"Well, I'll find her anyways."
Thanks a lot Fermín.
Bye.
Can you put Father Urlieta on the phone please?
Thank you.
Father Urlieta?
I'm an old student from high school.
My name is Máximo Gascón.
They called me Max.
Yes...
I think you should remember.
You taught me religion for 4 years!
Of course it was a lot time ago... 30...
More than 30 years ago I think.
That was a long-ass leg.
Ain't know where the hell I was going with that.
"That's just a long-ass, Wendy Williams-sized leg."
Damn!
It was big--
You ain't been here the whole show?
"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""
And I was like...
"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"
Biggie Smalls and Tupac.
That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.
Just cool.

Now get in there.
And hurry up!
"hello, George!"
I wasn't expecting you till next month.
"- How are the children, the country?"
- Fine.
Listen.
"I need another 3,000 francs."
What happened to the advance you got?
You know my expenses.
"The children, the estate, my mother's nursing home..."
The divorce took half of everything.

But let me have one more instalment first.
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way!
Here I come!

-Nothin'.
Nothin'.
"I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all."
"Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose."
It's just a mistake!
"Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody."
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
"Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome."

-Give me the sword.
-Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
Talked to your husband about going overseas?
"Yes, I've been talking to him."
"Yes, I know."
"You've been a perfect angel about it, but I've changed my mind."
You have?
I think that Robert should go.
Are you sure Bob wants to?
"All right, Gretchen,"
I'll tell my husband that Bob's changed his mind.
"Oh, thank you, Karen."
You're such a darling!
I'll tell him he should have his orders in the next 24 hours.
"Goodbye, Gretchen."

"Listen, if I leave my suitcase, will you send it to me?"
I guess so.
You're just gonna sneak out of here without saying goodbye to anyone?
"Well, I have to."
"You say goodbye to Nancy for me, huh?"
What do you want me to tell her?
"Tell her, uh..."
"Just tell her goodbye, huh?"

"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.

Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.

"All my respect, Don Ciccio."
You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak.
He couldn't hurt anyone.
"But when he grows, he'll grow strong."
Don't worry.
This little boy can't do a thing to you.
"When he's a man, he'll come for revenge."
"I beg you, Don Ciccio, spare my only son."
He's all I have left.

"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am."
You seem to have a very close family.
"Yes, you certainly seem to be daddy's best girl."
W hat?
Oh.
Ew!
"Oh, no."
That's not my father.
"No, no, no."
That's New Christine's father.
Why were you kissing him?
"Um, because I'm, um..."
I'm sort of dating him.
You're dating your ex-husband's girlfriend's father?
Yeah.
That's right.
"Well, you know, Christine, if we don't tell you enough, we are so happy you're at this school."
That's nice.
Ugh!
"I got so distracted by those meanie moms,"
"Yes, I'm fine."
"Well, I'll just visit the powder room."
Of course.
You sure Mrs McCarthy's in danger?
George may well have poisoned Henry to stop him revealing that he killed Vera Blanchett.
And if George did that to Henry...
Exactly.
"Oh, that looks lovely."
I've taken the liberty of pouring you some wine.
Oh!
Why not?
"Here's to you, Bridget, and to Henry."
Of course.
To poor Henry.
"Oh, It's quite sharp."
Maybe even a little bitter.
Try the fish.
Yes.
Mrs McCarthy.
What are you...
George.
What on earth is going on?
!
I'm afraid there has been a fire at St Mary's.
A fire!
"Now, the Fire Brigade have it under control, Mrs McCarthy, but I need you to go back with Sid and sort out a few things."
But I haven't even started my dinner.
I'm so sorry.
"But all things considered, I think we've had a lucky escape."
Right.
Shall we?
"The Rolls, Mrs M?"
"But you'll be there, right?"
Tuesday night?
Of course.
"Take the 11:40 bus, okay?"
Anything later on a weekday will get you in too late.
Especially with traffic.

LUCY:
Uh-huh.
-Congratulations.
-Same as you.
As me?
Ha.
"You're the father, Buck."
"Hey, Buck and Lucy are having a baby."
LUCY:
And a wedding too.
-What?
"Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one."
And you know how mad he gets.
A wedding.
"Well, someone should buy a round of drinks."
"The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold."
"No, no, this is nonsense, all right?"
It's nonsense.
I'm not the father of that baby.

Do you know my grandson Peppe?
"I have to send him this, it's a sweaterI made."
"I want it to get there fast, how long will it take?"
- Two orthree days.
- Two orthree?
"And if it rains, what will the dearthing wear?"
.
should he freeze to death?
Two orthree days?
But it's just a small package.
Your grandson Peppe?
- You're talking about Peppe?
- Do you know him?
"Peppe said, I quote:"
"""If my grandma comes, tell her she can't make sweaters,"""
"""she's gotta do fried dough, 'cause she does 'em great."""
"But he doesn't like sweaters, make him a dessert."
"Making sweaters isn't foryou, Peppe said so."
- Make scarves.
Come on Prewitt.

Is everything alright?
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr. Vega.
Hey!
Benigno.
Hey!
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said goodbye to Lydia.
OCR failed!
but Dr. Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
I'll read them to Alicia at night.
They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
Are you going alone?
Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
About what?
Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
Just around the block.
Yeah.
Just around the block.
"And be careful, okay?"
I will.
Bye.
I-It-
- It's really--
"It's really great to have you home, Mom."
"Hey, seriously, be careful, okay?"
I will.
Okay.
I guess we should talk.
"Oh, I think you said plenty the other day."
No.
"Look, about that, it just--"
Did you get the car wash keys?
"Um, yes, yes."
"Skyler, I may have... overstated things earlier, and I'm sorry to be so forward."
But I-
- I just--
I want you to know something.
I want you to--
I need you to understand that you are safe.
"You, Junior, Holly--"
You are completely safe.

But he does not talk you who is?

You were covering Christer.
Why did not he tell them?
-No Was Lars who answered.
He called you often?
What does this have to do?

Seven games to five.
It's a pit between physical peserverence.
We can't lose.
Third match is beginning.
Hyotei's Kabaji against Seigaku's Kawamura.
One set match.
Hyotei to serve.
Play.
Hadoukyuu.
15
- Love
What!
Winner will be Hyotei.
"If this continues, we'll lose."
"Taka-san, that is..."
I will definitely win this match.
I want to be in the Nationals.
Single-handed Hadoukyuu technique.
I can't play anymore.
Kabaji's stamina is actually drained.
The last ball doesn't count.
Singles three no game.
Chiku'so!
Perhaps he's doing his nets or something.
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
Get the hell out of here Danny!
You drunk!
***

- What's wrong with him?
"- Oh, Danny was so mean to him this morning."
I can still totally picture it.
"So it all started when Justin, he woke up."
He was in a great mood.
"He was like, man, I love being in love, man."
I just love it.
Makes me wanna do the moonwalk.
I could do the moonwalk.
I could get jiggy with it.
I could...
I could spin.
I could jump.
I could dance for days and days but I'm not.
I'm just gonna stand completely still.
Completely still.
Still like a stone.
Like a stone.
"And then... and then Danny,"
We pan over to Danny and Danny was all like grrr.
I think love is stupid.
Getting married.
"Getting married, ""pfft""."
That's all like a dumb mistake.
I would never do that.
And I get to be mean to you for just no reason because I'm a big baby.
I'm a big baby.
My hair's too long to be a baby but I act like a baby anyways.
I'm the friggin' host of the show.
"Oh, okay."
We're being interviewed by a 12 year old.
Hi.
"I'm 14, and my show gets the most hits on Viddimension."
- You dig?
- Yeah.
I dig.
"I guess ""dig's"" back in."
"Now, I hope you noobs are ready 'cause I've played your beta, and I got some serious questions for you guys."
So who's gonna walk me through the demo downloads?
- I hope it's you.
"- Uh, I will."
- Come on.
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"- Yeah, that's awesome."
Hi.
"Oh, hey, you must be Suzanne."
"I'm Deena, Dave's wife."
Of course.
Really nice to meet you.
Dave's told me so much about you.
"Oh, not too much, I hope."
Hi.
Hey... honey.
What are you doing here?
"- Hi, honey."
- What are you doing here?
"Well, you know, today's a big day for you, so I just, uh--"
I'm--I'm glad you came.
And I finally get to meet the famous Suzanne.
"- I just can't believe it's taken this long-- - oh, it's been really crazy."
"Hello, John Klein."
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
"Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin."
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
"Okay, you got my attention."
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
"You're reading my mind, aren't you?"
Did you read my mind?
"I have no need to, do I?"
What's the third line of page 51?
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!
call me Dean.
"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."
-Right after I finish talking with--
-Dean.
-Found your pet.
-Where?
"squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth."
I'm trying not to wig out here.
Get outta here!
"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?
"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"
You're blocking' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
"- Now, back away."
- That's it!
"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.
- Your sisters.
JANINE:
"I mean, everyone makes mistakes."
"I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?"
"Probably seems the wrong time to do that, but why not?"
"You know, why not?"
Better later than never.
I'm dating now.
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?
Have you been married?
MAN:
"Yes, I'm married."
- You are married?
MAN:
I am married.
And what's your question?
MARY:
"We're heading there, is that fair?"
CONOR:
It's moving fast.
Just on our way.
"I like him, I'll say that L word."
"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
"I like her a lot, so..."
"- Good, I'm glad."
[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
Look how happy the mom is now.
"-Oh, Rach."
-Screw you!
You don't have to do it!
-Hey.
-Hey!
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Why?
"Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
"In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner."
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
"What's going on, huh?"
Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe I can help.
"Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
"You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex."
"-So anyway, what is it?"
-Forget about it.
It's no big deal.
"-Come on, what is it?"
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
"Nice going, Campbell."
"Hey, Ben."
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
"Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,"
"Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar."
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah.
Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
"You live in Washington, D.C."
"Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach."
Will anyone help me?
Hey Gocha...
"Don't put pressure, he may die."
"See and tell me, I must kill him."
I must kill him.
"Hey, Doctor?"
- He's on the bed.
- Wake him up!
"Doctor is there, but what you do there?"
What to do now?
Gocha...
Gone again!
My partner said he's in this quarry.
He can't speak properly.
Even a sorry would hear like quarry.
"Sir, is Singamuthu's son a fool like you to come here?"
Now you know what?
"-Dad,listentome!"
"Father,giveme asec ,okay?"
"- I do not do, because odaklanmadın."

- I have not heard for the first time today.
- Stupid fucking cop.
Do you know who my father?
- Where the little girl?
- I do not know from what you're talking about.
"- For your own good, I hope this is a lie."
- Look at yourself.
Stupid fucking nigger police.
- I'm going to ask one more time.
Have something sweet.
"Thank you so much, aunt Anka."
"I'll be off, then."
"Wait, I've got something else."
- What is it?
- Take a look.
Thank you so much.
You really piled up a heap.
"I didn't peel this off, I was afraid to tear the stamp."
- You'll do a better job.
- Thank you so much.
"I asked the neighbours, too."
I know that you collect these things.
- Now you've got a bunch.
"- Thank you, I've got to go."
"Bye, thanks for dropping by."
The series will start now.
"Tito, Nasser, Nehru."
Tito lives.
"Mail for you, Countess Lily, you have to sign here."
Fucking Tesla...
"You know what, Lily?"
"Of all the people in this town, you're the most honest person."
My Sime... what is honesty?
"Father Ive, praise the Lord."
This was one of the best days ever!
"- Sime, my man!"
- I'll be only a minute.
It was just like you said!
Lebicada wind on St. Nicholas' Day!
It was a good day for scorpionfish!
Here's one for you.
Come to my cabin immediately
Okay sir..
Sir..

I am asking you.
Why do you laugh?
Is your son a Police officer?
He is not even passed Inter.
How can he become a Police officer sir?
"No, he is lying."
"He is a Police Officer, I have seen."
I now understood whom you have seen.
"I, myself was confused being his own father."
No surprise in you being confused.
What are you saying?
There is a Police Officer who looks same as my son.
He even has a girlfriend.
He speaks non-stop in Hindi.
My son doesn't know any Hindi.
Are you sure?
How can person failing Inter and working as stuntman become a Police Officer sir?
You can go now..

Sudhakar..

You're so fat!

"Oh, stella for star!"
-blanche!
"Oh, my darling."
"Now, Iet me look at you."
"But don't you look at me, stella."
"No, no, no!"
-I won't be looked at in this merciless glare.
-Did you find our place?
What are you doing in a place like that?
"Never, never, never in my worst dreams did I picture--"
only Poe.
only Mr. Edgar allan Poe could do justice to it.
What are you doing in that horrible place?
"Oh, what am I saying?"
I didn't mean to say that.
"I meant to be nice and say, ""What a convenient location,"" and such."
-You haven't said a word to me.
-You haven't given me a chance to.
"-You dog, open your pretty mouth and talk."
-Come say hello to stanley first.
"-No, not now."
Not now.
-Just say hello.
"Oh, which is he?"
Which one is he?
-Is he the one that's--
-The one that's making all the rhubarb.
Isn't he wonderfuI-Iooking?
"stella, I can't meet him now."
Not till I've bathed and rested.
-would you Iike a cold drink?
I'm gonna go have a shower.
Ok.
"Uh, Sarah?"
What should I make us for dinner?
"Don't you mean, what should you order in?"
"No, I cook."
S-sometimes I cook.
"Yeah, I'd wait for mom if I were you."
"Wow, look at you."
"Yeah, please don't."
"I look like I walked off the set of ""7th Heaven"" or something."
"I hope you don't mind, I put my clothes in the wash."
And since everything else I own is in Martin's van...
It's totally fine.
What's that?
This is fettuccine bolognese.
Wow.
"Props, dad."
Thanks.
Hello?
Tom?
"Yeah, we're in the kitchen."
Sarah.
"Hey, mom."
"Um, dad said it'd be ok if I came home with him."
"Of course it's ok, if you're here to stay."
"Sarah's here for dinner, which, uh... is actually going to be ready momentarily, so..."
"So, what was it this time?"
"Did you run out of money, or did you have another fight with Martin?"
"Yeah, it was a big mistake."
I really shouldn't have come here.
"Sarah, wait."
Check your bank account.
Your money's back.
[WHISPERS] It's Georgina.
"[IN NORMAL VOICE] Georgina, where are you?"
What happened to Poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
"You got your money, that's all that matters."
- Now you can go to Yale.
"- Well, I'm going to NYU now."
"Oh, great."
Then I'll see you next year.
"Wait, what does that mean?"
[PHONE HANGS UP]
Wait-
- Hello?
Georgina?
What?
- Georgina Sparks?
"- Yes, that's right."
I recently enrolled in Gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
"Thank you, Ms. Sparks."
- Is there anything else?
- I'd like to request a roommate.
Blair Waldorf.
"She's my best friend, and I just can't wait to live with her."
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in Dubai?
You know you can't lose me for long.
Where you headed?
Everywhere.
- They're here because Rory invited them.
They can't say no to that little face.
It's like hitting a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper.
You guys are not gonna believe this.
- You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.
- You'll pipe in every time I talk?
- Can it.
- Stuff it.
- They're in love.
- Clearly.
"Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too."
It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.
"That's Emily, right?"
- Rich people feel so entitled.
"- Yes, damn them."
I saw her wipe her face with a $100 bill.
We should line them up against a wall.
You know what I'm saying?
- Is Lorelei Gilmore here?
- Yes.
Good.
"Have a look at these, will you?"
- Wow.
Pretty.
- Look them over and take your pick.
- What for?
- To wear.
- Are they for sale?
- No.
They're paid for.
"These are from your mother, Emily Gilmore."
- Wow.
"I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous."
Like sandwiches with toothpicks in them dangerous?
Even more dangerous than that.
Like eating a bomb?
In between.
Like eating a firecracker.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Well... aren't you kids playing nice.
"Hey, Ethan, over here."
Look at my face and hands while I'm talking.
I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today.
"Um, it isn't June 3, it's today."
Okay.
"Wait, I have some questions for you."
Uh-huh.
"Um, what does ""Ethan"" mean?"
Um...
Sounds like how Shakespeare Huh?
"So, maybe that's where it comes from?"
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
"Next question, uh... if a train leaves New York at 4:00, and another train leaves Dallas at 5:00, what time will they meet?"
Uh...
Great.
"Well, I'm kind of busy right now, so I'm gonna have to let you go."
Have fun at my mom's birthday.
Bye.
Uh... do you want juice?
!
You're gonna have a baby.
"I hope they haul you in, turn a fire hose on you Iike the Iast time!"
-I want my girl down here!
-You stinker!
"Hey, stella!"
"Hey, stella!"
I wouldn't mix in this.
"Don't ever leave me, baby."
"BIanche, come back!"
Miss DuBois?
Miss DuBois?
AII quiet along the Potomac now?
She ran down here and went back in there with him.
-Sure she did.
-I'm terrified.
Nothing to be scared of.
They're crazy about each other.
It's a shame this had to happen when you got here.
-violence is so--
-Sit down on the steps...
-...and have a cigarette with me.
-Why I'm not properly dressed.
"well, that don't make no difference in the Quarter."
Such a pretty silver case.
"I showed you the inscription, didn't I?"
Yes.
So much--
So much confusion in the world.
Thank you for being so kind.
I need kindness now.

"Hi, boss."
Hi.

That was bad.
"That was very, very bad."
Want a date?
I don't think that's going to work.
That's Reverend Whitehead.
God doesn't let him do that.
Got you an ice cream.
Being on the job probably makes you hungry.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Where are you going to sleep tonight?
"In a hotel, if you'll get lost and let me make some money."
I-I don't think you should be doing this.
"What are you, some kind of child missionary?"
Sort of.
I did have an idea about the sleeping thing.
"Hi, Frank."
She spoke to me.
"I speak to her, but she never speaks to me."
"Hey, Frank, going to the dance?"
I-I can't dance.
"Me, neither."
"Aren't you going to introduce us to your friend, Frank?"
"I'm Frank's father's sister, Aunt V, and Frank and I are very, very close, aren't we, Frank?"
[ The phone rings. ] Charles?
Then what good are you?
Little Mosque on the Prairie S06E07 Mosque of Dreams
- RAYYAN:
Hello!
- SARAH:
Hi!
"Mom, is that bacon?"
That's bacon.
What are you doing?
I'm not eating it.
"Well, not yet anyway."
Do you know I haven't had bacon for over 30 years?
Because it goes against our beliefs?
"Well, I'm just not sure what our beliefs are anymore."
"Mom, what do you mean?"
You're a Muslim!
What if I'm a Muslim because I was married to a Muslim?
"Well, um, how long have you been feeling this way?"
"I've been on a date, I've had wine, and something else Ann put in my drink, and now I'm thinking about trying bacon."
"- No, don't do it!"
- Hey!
- That's turkey bacon!
- Oh!
I'm not going to jump in headfirst.
I've got to dip my toes in a little.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Ow!
"Fine, I guess, I had that coming."
AMAAR:
It'll be our own mosque.
Or just hitting Mike.
- It's like hitting a puppy.
You cannot...
- But we were in character.
"I know, but..."
It would have been so Of Mice and Men.
I didn't do it.
But back to the Denzel story somebody thought Michael was Denzel.
Did you ever think that maybe Denzel was just standing behind you?
- We looked to make sure.
- They were looking at me.
"I looked around for Denzel, because I love Denzel."
- But there is no Denzel.
"- No, it was me."
Did we have any celebrity sightings on the shoot?
- I don't...
"- Wait, wait."
"Yeah, we..."
"Oh, God."
"Well, now I forget."
"Remember there was a guy near Don Hill's who was crossing the street and I was like, ""That's the guy from..."""
Really?
"He's in a band, remember?"
He's handsome.
- Was it Mayim Bialik?
- I forget.
- Maybe.
- Mayim Bialik.
- Could be.
- I love Mayim Bialik in Blossom.
I don't remember.
"Mayim Bialik was, like, head of a Yiddish singing group."
"He'll understand, believe me."
Connie.
"If you don't listen to me and marry this man,"
you'll disappoint me.
-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!
"What's ""Chen dannay""?"
"""Cent' anni""."
It means 100 years.
It means we should all live happily for 100 years.
The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
"Merle, you've met my sister-in-law, Deanna."
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.
"With all respect, I didn't come here to eat dinner!"
"I know, I know."
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.
You're justjealous because he's a real man!
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!
These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives.
"Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to."
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop.
Don't!
"What are you doing to me, you big slob?"
She works here.
I'm positive.
"She a waitress, bartender, like, what..."
She's a waitress.
I know the manager.
"I'll go talk to him, see if she's on tonight."
"Give me some money, I'll get drinks."
Is that Marla?
- Come on!

Donna was the chef.
Antoine was her number two.
"Back there was Ray and César, they were the kitchen staff."
"Gunther was the catering manager,"
Candace was his assistant.
Lots of other people.
Good people.
"They were here, then they were gone, and nobody came down to say,"
"""Can we please keep them on?"""
It wasn't fair.
You think?
- But Griff is different.
"- Oh, yes, he is."
Because they didn't do anything to deserve to be turfed.
What'd he say?
"The guywho burned you... turns outyou don't need to go up there to see him, 'cause... well, he's coming down here to seeyou."
See me?
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
Just a heads-up.
Well...
- looks like I'm gonna have to get the Charger fixed after all.
- Yeah.

"WHEN YOU'RE BURNED, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING --"
"NO CASH, NO CREDIT, NO JOB HISTORY."
YOU'RE STUCK IN WHATEVER CITY THEY DECIDE TO DUMP YOU IN.

SOMEONE NEEDS YOUR HELP.
BOTTOM LINE -
"It's OK, polo."
There.
"feels good, huh?"
Yes... yes...
What's going on?
"Nothing, I got caught in his headphones."
He often screams like that.
"I was washing him, the headphones fell, he couldn't hear the music."
Seeing lots of strangers makes him yell... or losing his play farm figures.
What happened?
- He fell in the bailer.
- baller?
- The thing that makes balls of hay.
- I know.
He fell in one when he was small.
You've known him long?
always been neighbors.
We played together as kids.
"Right, polo?"
What's the music?
"""Give me roses""."
Fernand Gignac?
Yeah.
What else?

"Tony, the bus won't run without me in it."
It's all my fault.
It's such a mess.
"Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it."
I'm sure Uncle Bene won't mind.
I'll do the engine.
You do the body work.
- OK.
"- So long, Alfie."
"Goodbye, Alfred."
"What job will you do now, Mr. Yo-Yo, uh, Yokomoto?"
"Oh, I've saved my money."

"Hey, kids, look."
I don't understand this.
- Man!
"- Wow, what a family."
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...
- ...somehow.
"- Uh, that's a possibility."

I'll tell them that the reports were exaggerated.
"And, if you kids will go back to school,"
I'm sure they won't fire me.
- l'm sorry!
I have to get out of this house.
They say it'll be here in twenty minutes.
Great.

You just made a date with Kyle?
"Yes, not that it's any of your business."

Angela!
"Kyle is my boyfriend, I hate to tell you."
Brian Krakow happens to be waiting in my living room... and I don't know what you're doing with him!
Nothing!
Nothing!
We're just friends.
"Yes, when Kyle's not around, you've been using him."
You are lecturing me about using Brian Krakow... when he is so obviously in love with you and you totally use him!

Or someone who works at the fair.
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.
- And gray.
It's a common car.
- Excuse me.
Someone wants to talk to you.
"Angelita is psychic, she sees stuff."
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother the last two nights.
And she said... she saw the girls at the abandoned farmhouse.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.

LAUGHTER
"And he was like, ""Oh, that's a sweet job"
"""you've done there,"" you know?"
LAUGHTER
"OK, top thing people get jealous about."
People that can spell definitely.
LAUGHTER
Ohh...
"I've got D-E-F - after that, I've got nothing left in the locker."
LAUGHTER
That's why defo was invented.
Defo.
LAUGHTER
New girlfriends or new boyfriends.
"Yeah, that's a good answer, yeah."
It's that sort of area.
"Flirting, flirting."
Flirting with...
Yeah.
Flirting is exactly it.
Ahh.
APPLAUSE
"Yes, the top thing people get jealous about is their partner flirting."
I'm a bit of a flirt.
"Just last night, I had a girl give me a look that left me in no doubt as to what she wanted."
"No, it's pretty good, hon."
"- Well, I -"
- No plate.
- No?
- No.
No knives and forks either.
I understand you're supposed to dig in.
"0h, allow me to show you, will you?"
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
"You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap."
"- (McKenna) 0h, I see."
- May I show you?
"- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?"
- l'll hold it for you.

"Well, I, uh... uh..."
"Boy, could I use this hand."

- No one minds.
"- lt's messy, but worth it."
- l'll practise on an olive.
"0h, honey, it's wonderful."
Here.
Take a bite.
- Good?
- Yeah.
"Tell me - does this way of eating have to do with religion, or something?"
I think it's more social than religious.
I don't know.
"It's well worth a flutter, but pay the tax on it before..."
"Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay."
Very nice.
Hope to see you again before long.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Fawlty."
"Goodbye, Mr. Firkin."

We should have him stuffed.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty, 3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly."
Right?
"Yes, good luck!"
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
"Morning, Major."
"Good morning, Fawlty."
"Yes, dear?"
"What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?"
"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."
- Really?
"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major."
"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.

- What is it?
[Muttering]
[Kaman] Let's just get honest with each other.
Where is Tracy?

- You're lying.
I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in Ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth!
We have no reason to lie.

She wants me back.

Come here.
Ahem.
- What are you laughing at?
"- Punk, you're like, 7 years old."
"I don't get it, Mary."
"I mean, why come back here?"
You already missed the funeral.
You think I feel good about not being there?
Truthfully?
"I don't know, I can't tell."
"I mean, we were invisible to that man."
"I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment."
Because at least it would have been something.
"Listen, Mary."
"You know this is really hard for you to accept, okay?"
But Dad loved us.
"He just didn't know how to show it, I guess."

"Oh, hi."
You came to see me...
Mr. Larson.
What brings you here?
"Uh, a peace offering for your dad."
"I know he's ticked off 'cause I screwed up his real estate deal, so I brought you all some of our tavern's famous corned beef sandwiches."
Mm.
Yummy.
That's very considerate of you.
"Can I see you in my office, please?"
Should I come in and take notes?
- No.
- Please?
Can I come in and...
"Right, get back to my own work, that's what I'll do."
You look great.
Nice flowers.
"Oh, those."
Yeah...

I can accompany you?

No.
"Why, what happened?"
There was a revolution.
The actress did not wish to take her clothes off.
"And, you know, and she did the first scene"

-I'll introduce you to my childhood best friend.
-But why will I meet her just now?
"-Because she came from Canada, she just arrived."
-Make sure she's just your best friend okay?
-Yes!
Come on!
What?
"You know, Migs and I have been playing together since we're 2 years old."
"As a matter of fact, he's my first boyfriend!"
How old was I when I answered you?
"-Around 1 6, right?"
-What 1 6?
Around 1 5 and three fourths!
-Come on.
-So you've been a couple.
Yes!
"We're childhood sweethearts, right?"
"I'm sorry, I thought Migs told you."
"No, it's okay!"
I was just surprised because he never mentioned that to me.
Haven't I told you about it?
"You know, why don't you guys tell me how you met?"
Oh!
It's like this.
"We were together in the hospital, she's a nurse there."
There it is!
Hence the uniform!
Then it's okay that you're together!

You want to fight in real fights-- proper fights with proper prize money and betting money.
That's how you make money in fighting.

I just rescued her from a lab.
[Exhales sharply]
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
"I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit, and I want to do it in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me."
I want to see that.
"[Cheers and applause] ß It's time for ""The Girlie Show"" ß"
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.

The pizza was really good.
Jerk.
"And Precious, make sure you do that thing I told you to do."

Grab that.

- That's better.
- Where is he?
Ate the whole box.
- He OD'd on Ding Dongs.
"- Oh, God."
- You okay?
"- We didn't have a choice, man."
- It was for his own good.
- He'll be fine by game time.
Dickie Dunn Jr.
Here with Dickie Dunn III bringing you another exciting season of junior league hockey action.
And this year's first battle is a real David and Goliath matchup.
"Yeah, Dad."
"If David were a Chihuahua, that'd be more like it."
"Yes, that's true, D-III."
It's the defending champ Ice Hounds versus Newman's upstart orphan team calling themselves the Zenovators.
A real pisser.
You wanna talk now?
"Okay, let's talk."
Let's get it over with.
"Swear to God, I've never met a ball buster like you my whole life."
"Who loves you more than I do, huh?"
-l'd do anything for you.
-Except stop busting my balls.
-Let's go have coffee.
"-Want to go to the diner, or what?"
We'll go to the diner over there on the boulevard.
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. lt's open 24 hours.
-They got danishes there?
"-Yeah, they got everything."
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.
You hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston?
It's terrific.
Nunzio up in--
I thought he'd never shut the fuck up.
I know.
Pain in the ass.
-Whatta you wanna do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you get through.
"-Frank, let's chop him up."
-All right.
"-Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?"
-I thought you said chop him up.
"Up at Charlie's, not here!"
"Come on, what are you doing?"
Get the fuck out of here.
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Jesus, Harry, stop the machine!"
"- I'm dying here, come on!"

Try Kinzoku in Chinatown.
(GROANS)
(PANTS)
Cuff-Fit.
All the rage in LA.
Need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of here.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me and I will not keep my mouth shut!
Alright?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar?
SURI:
Who's that?
No one.
"Come on, let's go in."
(MUSIC PLAYS)
# It was a kind of so-so love
"# And I'm gonna make sure it never happens again it You and I, it had to be"
I?
Temperature suddenly dropping with no explanation.
Thought that you were a man of science.
I am.
But I also know that there are things in life that even science can't explain.
Okay.
Carter.
Any messages for me?
"Uh, no, Ms. Marquez, no messages."
There's nothing from Mr. Harpel?
Nothing.
Danny here?
Do you see him?
What about Ed?
It's kind of urgent.
[Sighs]
One of my whales disappeared.
I can help you.
I should probably talk to Danny.
I can do anything he can do.
Probably more.
- Really?
"- Oh, uh, really."
Can you find Mr. Harpel?
The guy you were supposed to meet earlier?
Mm-hmm.
You sure he didn't just stand you up?
Or maybe Paul Logan swooped in and yanked him from your clutches.
I knew this was too serious for you to understand.
"Hey, Danny."
It's Sam.
I need to talk to you right away.
Hey.
Uh...
Lobster truck is here.
Hm.
"An hour ago, I found Mr. Myers down in the E.R. washing the feet of a homeless guy."
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Reminds me of my Uncle Ben...
"Goes to mass every day, twice on Sundays."
Nobody calls him crazy or that he has some syndrome.
You believe in God?
I was raised Catholic.
It never leaves you.
I pray sometimes... mostly for the mets.
God's record there is pretty spotty.
- What's going on?
- Anything?
Who brought Mr. Janson out here?
- I can see!
- You can see?
Jacob brought him for lobster.
Ha!
"Jacob, I can see!"
I can see!
All praise to Hashem!
I can see!
It's a miracle!
"I touched Larry, and Larry can see."
This is a fact.
"Look, as scientists, you have to accept hard evidence."
Larry has graves' disease.
That's why he was blind.
We treated him with a steroid that reduced the swelling...
"- Hey, John, check the words to this."
Yo!
"And I ain't chatting no black talk, mate."
Yo means I in Spanish.
- Very impressive.
- There's more.
Yo no soy marinero.
I ain't no sailor.
Soy capitan.
I'm captain.
I've found Risdale.
"To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
Una poca de gracia
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
"Seriously, John, that ain't a trick question."
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
We're going to the seaside.
Pack a bag.
"Mi amor, Calum."
Mi gusto los churros a los chico.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
It reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, my dad used to take us to the seaside."
Me and my sister would sit in the back eating digestive biscuits.
"Don't mind me, Joyce."
I've worked the Samaritans' Christmas bazaar.
I know misery loves company.
I just feel so alone.
"Listen, I was actually on my way to a coffee morning."
A really nice crowd.
Why don't you come along?
Thank you.
"well, well, if it isn't Miss marple herself."
I thought I couId smell cat piss.
Looks like we're going to have to up the ante.
"- DeIphiniums are looking good, Margaret."
"- Thanks, Barb."
"This way, Joyce."
Come along.
Quiet as you can.
Baby asleep upstairs.
"- Joyce, hi."
- Pam.
"- Oh, my God."
What happened?
"- Oh, yoga."
You left so quickly the other day.
Is everything...
OK?
"Erm, fine."
you could fit a whole salmon into this one.
I Iove the coIour-coordinated Iids.
"I think we've got just the thing for you in here, Joyce."
Beretta nine-miIIimetre.
"Good, solid pistol."
Squeeze off a full clip and you can stop a Fiat Panda at 50 yards.
- Both:
As fuck!
Look at Tommy.
This is what I'm saying.
"""Practicing with my boys, Edelman, Gronk, and Amendola."""
- God.
- And when was that?
Yesterday.
What?
Get the fuck out of here.
- ( doorbell dings )
"- Oh, shit, I'll get that."
These motherfuckers practicing without me.
"( sighs ) Come on, Ricky, they in Boston, man."
"Well, shit, Edelman lives in LA and Gronk lives here in Miami."
"Last time I checked, Amendola was in Botswana."
"Yet, they get the call and I get the proverbial stiff arm?"
"- Yeah, yeah, you're right."
- That's bullshit.
"You're right, you're right."
Fuck Brady.
Fuck him.
I'ma unfollow his ass any motherfucking way.
You know what?
I'ma set up a practice of my own.
Just fucking go to...
"Hey, T!"
- Yeah?
- Grab me a group together.
"And not that busted-ass quarterback from last time, all right?"
"Who, JaMarcus?"
He used to play for the Raiders.
"And don't forget to keep in touch, ok?"
"Ok, out."
"Now, Judy, we've got work to do."
"You get Clarence, and we're gonna join in the search."
Go on.
"No, Toto, I'm sorry."
You're gonna have to stay home.
You're too small to take out into the bush.
"Anyway, I can't look after you."
"As a matter of fact,"
"I need Clarence and Judy to look after me, so you stay here, ok?"
(CHATTERING)
(ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING)
(TRUMPETING CONTINUES)
(CHATTERING)
"Oh, Judy, I guess you're right."
I can't focus too well.
There's no harm in letting you try.
"Do you see anything, Judy?"
(CHATTERING)
(CHATTERING)
"Ok, Judy."
I guess she's not around here.
Why don't you take a look over there?
I'll stay here with Clarence.
"And remember, if you find Sally, be gentle with her."
Dad says she's a very important chimp.
Now go on.
(CLARENCE PURRING)
Paula Tracy calling Officer Hedley.
"Come in, Hedley."
Paula Tracy calling Hedley.

"Oh, there's Ms. Bossman."
( chuckles ) Wow.
"WAGs for the guys in the front office, too, huh?"
- Dallas does it right.
- ( chuckles )
- Spencer.
"- Hey, Tanya."
- You look beautiful as always.
- ( kisses )
- What are you doing here?
"- Well, I heard a couple of my friends were vacationing in my neck of the woods, I thought I'd come by."
"Yeah, and I grew up nearby."
Might pop into my mom.
"Tanya, my business partner, Joe Krutel."
"- Hi, Joe."
- Hi.
Boys are getting big.
"Ah, yeah."
"Henry is already 6'1"" and he's only in middle school."
They grow 'em big like that in Texas.
When are you gonna make some?
It's such a shame to waste those genetics.
"Yeah, I am working on it."
"Tanya, where is, uh..."
Where is your husband?
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?
"Over there, massage."
Something really got under his skin this morning.
Said he needed extra pressure.
"Huh, wonder what that could be."
Send for my chopper.
I can take 3.
Coming along?
I'm staying.
MacDANIEL:
"I see them, Dai Uy."
NIM:
Pardon me.
PETERSEN:
Weapons check in 30 minutes!
Fall out!
[SERGEANT SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen!
PETERSEN:
Charlie's building caskets and ladders.
A lot of them.
How far away?
About 15 clicks.
That gives us plenty to do before they get here.
Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp.
- Will systems be operational by dark?
- Affirmative.
"May I suggest we contact ""C"" Team?"
See about the weather.
- Petersen?
- Yeah.
What was all that about ladders and coffins?
"When Charlie knows he's got a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell."
The ladders?
They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us.
Later they use them for litters.
You have to think about the political aspect.
"They here, however."
-They are already bankrupt.
I was not finished talking.
M r.
"Borgen, you've got a phone from Norway."
They say it's personal.
Do you have a privacy?
Put them over.
Can you please go?
-Hallo?
-Hi.
Aksel?
Aksel Nilsen?
-Who is it?
-William Hansteen.
-Are you there?
-Yes.
How are you?
Do you know Solar Tech?
-Why do you ask?
-Old Lifjord Mechanical.
We leave on the solar cell production a few years ago.
-We have lost an important contract.
-Scanbrazil?
You have the interests of the market for alternative energy.
We are facing a breakthrough on 4G.
If I sent you ...
-We are not interested.
-How can you say that?
I see there are Eva who is controlling the company now.
"Yes, I met a little wall after what happened with Karine."
Coming up...
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
...Our competition for tips on the streets of San Francisco takes a strange turn.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.
[ Laughter ]
"And later, Rutledge makes a scientific breakthrough."
"Oh, come on!"
You unplugged it!
Ferrara:
"To celebrate our 25th episode, we've turned over control of the show to Rutledge."
I've got Wood.
"So far, he almost killed himself."
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Bleep]
And now he had me working the streets of San Francisco for tips.
Andrew?
I had $40 to Rut's $20.
Pow!
Yeah!
And we had our last passengers of the night.
I want to know more about this boy that you say you like.
I'm not sure about this.
He was really nice.
- I don't know.
- He was nice.
I thought he was nice.
Really?
You don't like him 'cause he's chubby and nerdy.
No.
That's not true.
The funeral's over?
"Well, yeah, it happened."
We're getting married.
I told you you look good together.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now that Nana quit and Yoon-sung's gone...
The Blue House is so boring.
You said all you needed was me to be happy and...
This is why one shouldn't propose too soon.
Take it.
"Mine, too."
Da-hye.
It's OK if you're too busy to come to the wedding.
I'll text you my account number.
I wish you health and happiness.
Choi Eung-chan.
"Be happy, Eun-ah."
"Ma am, how about... we open a restaurant in the States?"
We can name it Delicious Korean.
What did the ex-president say?
"He's sorry, grateful, and he wished me happiness."
You know...
I was a chef on a ship once.
I love Korean food.
It's amazing.
The Americans need to taste my food.
I'll be famous.

Right?
"Well, I haven't played as much paddle as I used to."
That's not exercise.

Sausage?
A little dessert?
"Mom, some dessert forthe Director."
- I'm really fine as is.
- Taste it.
"It's good, a kind of chocolate."
"Kind of, it's called blood pudding."
It's chocolate with pig's blood.
- You have to eat it.
- I got that.
"Yourmother's right, it's not so hot here."
"They told me it was very hot here, but..."

He's joking.
"He's the new director, from milan."

And that's an order.
Washington hasn't released a story.
What gives?
Drake's the story. I'm not.
You see Johnny here-
- Johnny?
Sergeant Drake!
Johnny!
I didn't like that salute.
There was something final about it.
I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder.
He'd faked a birth certificate to enlist.
"John Joseph Preston, eh?"
The Yale pin said so.
All I needed was a telephone.
"Sorry, gorgeous. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance."
Yale University.
"Hello, Yale?"
Give me your top man there.
What college?
"Yale, of course."
"Okay, so it's a university."
How would I know?
I just own taxis.
"Yeah, one of my men f ound a pin with a name on it, class of 1940."
I want his address so I can return it to him.

"""May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel,"
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"Thanks, honey."
Not a word to Raziya.
"Okay, honey."
"If you ask me, Mom was a spy."
"She grew up in Algeria, right?"
- And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year?
- Yeah.
She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad.
Do the math.
Dad was in Intelligence.
- He was a cook in Intelligence.
- That was his cover story.
So the Algerian spy got her pregnant?
- Maybe he was an Arab.
- God forbid.
Maybe she was the spy.
Or a murderer.
Ever see her kitchen cleaver?
- I know.
She was a Nazi hunter.
- What?
Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz?
Since when did she have family in Oschwitz?
It was an educational tour.
We're Jews.
"Unless your father is a little Arab spy,"
- which makes you...
"I know with our history, you'll think I made this up--"
"Andy, what?"
"Now, an incident has occurred at my apartment. lt's not fit for visitors."
-l don't believe this.
-You wanna know what happened?
-No.
"-Hey, John, good morning."
"I've heard about fungus in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--"
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?
What happened?
"Well, I have a very bad gas leak."
"Now, I called the gas people."
There is no way I'm gonna feel comfortable exposing you to danger.
-We're back to square one?
-We are definitely not at square one.
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a changed man. I have a dangerous leak.
"That's all we're talking about here, now."
"You want some advice, Andy?"
Get it fixed.
WOMAN:
Mike?
Roberts?
-Mike Roberts around?
I gotta see Mike.
DONNA:
He's not here.
Mike?
"-Hey, Roberts."
-Excuse me.
"Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that?"
It's a man's hat.
- Maybe Morn bought it for Dad.
"- Yeah, right."
"Anyway, this is what we have so far."
1.
The picture. 2.
Dates of Mom's trips.
3.
Algeria - black hole.
"And, oi course, Aunt Rosa."
She's obviously hiding something.
The conclusion is:
We have a father and we need to find him.
And the conclusion is:
"There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them."
"""Have a father must find him!"""
"Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either."
Don't pretend.
"What are you getting at, Shai?"
"Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight."
Maps.
Even new swimsuits.
The hotel has a pool.
You are nuts.
He's nuts.
We fly a week before Passover.
- I can't.
"- You're on vacation from school and Dorona, you're free now anyway."
- But...
- I spoke to Raziya.
You told Haziya?
What's wrong with you?
"Man, where the gefilte fish at?"
It's in the fridge.
That shit's perishable once it's open.
"They ain't in the fridge, man."
"Hold on, man, I know I put that shit in the fridge 'cause don't nobody want no hot-ass gefilte fish."
"Just like I said, right behind the peanut butter."
"Ain't no peanut butter in here, man, just yogurt."
"- Where the fuck are you, Ricky?"
"- Where you think I am, man?"
"I'm in the motherfucking kitchen, bro."
I'm in the kitchen.
I don't see your ass.
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God!"
"Yo, TTD, call the cops."
There's a weird white kid in our house.
"What house are you in, Rick?"
- Ricky?
- Uh...
- Ricky?
"- Oh, shit."
- Ricky.
- Boy:
"I know who you are, asshole."

Not hard when I'm with you.
"Hey, hey, hey."
I'm Hannah.
Hannah Montana ladies and gentlemen.
And apparently her new boyfriend.
Why is it always the guitar player?
Why not a nice cameraman like my nephew Lenny?
"But seriously, I'm happy for you Hannah."
And what's your name?
"Ah, you don't wanna know my name."
Come on.
You kissed her on national TV.
What are you shy all of a sudden?
Come on what's your name?
-Jesse.
-Jesse!
There you have it.
Hannah and Jesse America's new sweethearts.
Good night everybody.
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.

Do I...
Do I have cookies and cream?
I sure do have cookies and cream.
(SIGHS) And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanilla-fudge swirl chunk for Mr. Newman over here?
"- That'll do, thank you."
- Okay.
And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here

- Sure will.
Thank you!
Be right back!
"- So, you're a farmer, Wayne?"

I want everything run just exactly as I left it.
No changes.

You understand?
- Is she around there now?
- No.
"I think she's in her cottage, Mr. Gargan, I could get her for you if--"
"No, no, that's all right."
Never mind.
Just tell her I called.
"Yeah, so long."
"And remember, no changes."

"She didn't even know Ray's last name, but she thought he was staying a couple blocks away with some dopers, so we checked it out."
Can you separate it?
Mmm-mmm.
Not yet.
That Ray's package?
So who's this black guy?
"They call him ""Pluto."""

I don't.
Well...
No sales being had.
No maintenance or repairs being had.
It's just a whole lot of nothing.
I haven't had a real need for Ken in the garage.
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.
He took them with.
He didn't say anything.
He just... went.
That don't sound like him.
He died of love.
"I mean, he must have been killed by a jealous lover."
Makes sense.
This was brutal.

What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in Milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't your friend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
He'll be coming soon then.
Though I hope that's after the bill is passed through.

Stopping...
Doesn't quite suit me.
Let me ask you one question.
What is the reason that you're doing this?
That's all.
"Keep an eye on them, Seymour."
"Company, attention."
Fall out for five minutes.
"Oh, Quigley."

I need to see Benigno Martin urgently.
I know it's irregular but it's a matter of life or death.

This way.
On the right.
"Empty your pockets, please."
"Hey, wait, don't run!"
Wait.
It's there.
At the end.
Good morning.
I'm Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
"Dear Marco,"
It's still raining.
I think it's a good omen.
When Alicia had her accident it was raining.
I'm writing minutes before I escape.
I hope that all I've taken is enough to put me in a coma and reunite me with her.
You're my only friend.
I'm leaving you the house
I prepared for Alicia and me.
"Wherever they take me, come and see me, and talk to me."
"Tell me everything, don't be so secretive."
"Farewell, my friend."
Okay.
Thanks very much for calling us.
Yeah.
Appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
( Clearing Throat )
Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today.
There was an accident at Ben's house.
Is Ben all right?
"Ben's all right,"
- but his sister's boyfriend is dead.
- What happended?
Some bizarre accident.
He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi.
I've been doing research into Mikey Trenton's background.
I really need to talk to you about this.
"Yeah, okay."
You go to your class.
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
"Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax."
"""Electric chair""?"
We were so stupid.
"Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid."
He was probably just changing the station or something.
I went in to answer the goddamned phone.
Do you believe there was some pervert on the line?
I'm glad you're not dead.
God!
I wish I was.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
- Did Iris come in at a bad time?
Maybe.
"Okay, then next time!"
"Next time you cry, be sure to show me!"
Didn't you have a report from Ryner and Ferris to give me?
"Oh, yeah."
Here you go!
"The dog is Ryner, and the angel is Ferris, I take it?"
Yup!
"The wild beast and the dazzling beautiful avenging angel, Sister Ferris!"
"Same as always, hm?"
What's this?
"Um, they dug a hole and pulled out a dagger-looking thing."
"They had no idea what it was and threw it, and a dragon suddenly came to life, they said!"
A hero relic?
They really existed?
- Your Majesty.
"- What is it, Miller?"
Have a look.
You're certain of this?
The information comes from him.
"You know who I mean, I'm sure."
Iris.
"Sorry, but would you mind returning to Ryner and Ferris immediately?"
"Okay, Ryner."
Take care of today's portion.
"Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango!"
"Sion, you..."
"Sion, you!"

"He is, but do you know him?"
"Of course, I do."
"He's incredibly kind, generous--"
My dry-cleaning guy is kind and generous.
Where's the prednisone?
Left bottom shelf.
I know him. I do.
Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it...

Clips his toenails in bed?
-Drips when the toilet seat's down?
-Abby.

"I am very happy for you, I really am."
"And, of course, I'll stand up for you."
I wouldn't miss it.
-Great.
-Okay.
"Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?"
-Sure.
-Walk with me?
All right.
"This young man, K.J. Thibeaux?"
You've been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.
Yeah.
"He got in the surgical floor storeroom, stole a digital video camera."
-What?
Get out of here.
-l don't wanna make a big issue...
"Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager."
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
"In English, please."
- Sorry.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know.
I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
"If I were him, I'd only sign for 1 5."
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
"Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me."
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
"Of course, Mr. Vermont."
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
"You know, Americans are sticklers for details."
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
"I said, all right, Horace."
"I called a time out so you can go take a leak, all right?"
"I mean, what am I gonna do?"
"He's my nephew and he's crying, right?"
"So I said, okay, honey, go to the toilet, I'll put Ralphie in right field, all right?"
So you can go take a pee pee.
"And he's crying, just standing there."
"I said, what's the matter with you?"
I thought you had to go make a pee pee?
Now go make a pee pee!
"And he says... (high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!"
I look and he's got piss all over his pants!
His pants are covered in piss!
"Remember that, Horace?"
Remember when you peed your pants in little league?
Where you going?
"Oh, come on, you little crybaby!"
"- Don't cry, little Horace."
Horace:
He's all right.
"He's all right, Pa."
man:
"Oh, Jesus."
"- Hey, Horace, didn't your other boy play baseball, too?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, Little Pete's good."
- Yeah.
"- He's on a team, he's great."
"Shortstop, and he can hit it."
Fantastic.
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Where you been?
"No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop."
And now they're gonna be in a show together?
!
"Jesus, it's all over for me."
They'll probably even have a kissing scene!
What did I do to deserve this?
And what am I supposed to do now?

"It's our son, he's running away!"
- l know.
"Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate, and let's not get any more involved, please."
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
Alright.
"Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?"
- English lady.
- That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace in the last hour?
"- No, sir."
- Wait a minute.
This is very important.
- She had my little boy with her.
"- No, sir."
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.
- He what?
- Checked out.
- But he couldn't have.
"- Yes, sir, he did."
"Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses."
"Yes, sir."
He checked out.
"(Sighs) I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted."
"I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell her she can bring Hank back."
"- Just hold that call a minute, Jo."
- Why?
Because I asked you to!
"Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?"
I hope not.
"Well, then stop acting like that."
I merely said I was going to call Mrs Drayton.
-Of course you're sorry.
is that your signature?
We record the receipt of all documents.
What about phone calls?
You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.
Glamour.
"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."
Maybe we can nominate them.
I thought it was all cut.
"Cut, not cut."
Politics.
Nothing's cut.
Where you going?
I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
- His doctor?
I don't know.
"Oh, wait a minute. it could be a Dr Kessler."
"Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here."
"- Could you check with him, please?"
- Sure.
Let me check.
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I went to the market for five minutes and he's gone!
Where is Saul?
"- Take it easy, Lena."
- Rick won't tell me nothing!
- What's happened?
- Saul may have had a heart attack.
"- Oh, God, no!"
- It's all right.
We don't know yet.
- Is there any word?
"- No, not yet."
"Dr Kessler will be here in a moment, but he knows nothing of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack."
And international Life Support haven't dispatched an ambulance since last night.
Where is he?
What happened to Saul?
Where is he?
"Please, where is my husband?"
"Oh, Thomas."
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?
Why don't you just go and find my Saul instead of torturing me!
- Lena!

Posthumously.
"No, everything is all right, comrade mayor."
Everything is OK.
Everything is all right.

"-Misha, is that you?"
"- Master, it is us, Grisha and Valera."
Bloody hell!
"Folks, you are wet to the bones!"
"Take this, warm up a little."
"Take, please."
-What about yourfriend?
- The friend can not afford this.
Why so?
"Everything is all right, auntie."
"Comrade captain, we are sorry."
"Please, do not get offended..."
But we will not untie you so far.
"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."
"Look, it's 14 to the right, then you go twice around to the left 'til you come to 22..."
And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?
"Those two bums, that fuckin' whore..."
They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?
"Hell, no..."
You kiddin' me?
"Hey, look, I swear."
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
Hold on!
"You gotta be kiddin', buddy, I got your message."
"This fuckin' guy's crazy, man."

Are you crazy...
Don't do that!
Stop it!
"Jesus Christ, don't!"
"Please, please, don't do that."
"Goodbye, gone."
When do I start?
Let's go.
"- Listen, this isn't a great time for me right now."
- Oh.
"- I'm sorry, I apologize."
"- Oh, Iâm sorry, just give me ten minutes, though."
"Just give me ten minutes and then you won't have to see me again 'til tomorrow, at work."
Horace.
- You want an interview now?
"- Yes, please."
"I mean, that's what you said and I'm in a hurry."
I have popsicles in the car.
Popsicles melt.
And then it's juice.
"Who likes juice, Horace?"
Please?
"- Sure, have a seat, would you?"
- Thank you.
- Okay.
"Now, I know this job starts tomorrow, but Iâm gonna need next weekend off because Iâm gonna go to Chicago."
They're having a bit of a--
"Like, a little party thing that I want to go to."
And I like going to parties.
- In Chicago?
"- Yeah, in Chicago."
"The land of pizza, yes."
This is a nice place.
Do you have any termites?
Everything's wood.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
"I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy."
Heather!
Daddy does those things to Mommy.
Okay.
Yeah.
_
Yeah.
Lark just would not stop crying today.
- Yeah.
"- And 45 minutes later,"
I found out her shoe was on too tight.
How am I supposed to know that?
"I know, it's gonna be so much easier when she can talk."
"Like, we won't feel like we're, like, on a Japanese game show we don't know the rules to."
Hey.
- Is that Sam?
- Yeah.
"Hey, Sam, what's up?"
"Hey, Uncle Greg."
"Move, you're blocking the view."
"Oh, of what?"
"Oh, the security guard stuck against the wall on a Segway?"
"No, we're spying on my boyfriend."
You have a boyfriend?
Irving Rosenblatt... he's the coolest boy in the class.
He's been acting weird.
I'm not even sure if we're boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
He liked three of Lexie's pictures on Instagram.
"Oh, I hate her."
Unless you're Lexie.
"No, I'm Jenna."
Lexie's a monster.
There are no other customers.
Why do they keep adding up bills and cooking noodles?
Why would a small shop like this hire so many workers?
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
"Even if you're in GuangZhou, we still have to arrest you."
"Bounty hunters from both sides of the rivers, ZheJiang, SanXi, GanSu and Hubei, all join forces to capture us."
You want us to turn ourselves in without a fight?
Come and get me.
Watch out!
Think you can get us?
Fat chance!
Husband!
Husband... run.
Boss Wong!
Boss Wong!
- What?
- I'm here to collect the laundry money.
Come and get it.
I just sent him away.
He's such a coward.
Lucky I've not been bitten by that dog with rabies!
Big Mouth.
- Big Mouth.
"- Yes, Boss?"
What can I do for you?
Get Ah Seng to dress me.
Big Mouth.
Still memorizing your script?
Where were you last night?
What's with the make-up?
Hurry up!
Don't take advantage of my good nature!
Leave now!
Now what?
Why don't you answer your phone?
Answerthe damn phone!
The papers are not interested in warphotos anymore.
I'll see what I can do.
Do something on kids.
Kids always sell.
People want to see hope.
"OK, I'll ask the fixer."
Send me something in two days.
"Why are you so late, my son?"
School ends around this time.
"It's been half an hour, my eyes were glued to the clock."
What's half an hour in Istanbul?
What's this radio station again?
Radio 'Holy Water'.
I am scared.
Istanbul is a dangerous place.
I know...
You called me 26 times today!
I can't wait to see you get out of this filthy place.
"As if ourhometown were cleaner, look!"
Neverdeny yourroots.
I wish I could.
May God forgive us.
You're beyond mercy...

At the inn?
That is either Monsieur Chopin or Monsieur de Musset.

- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'll be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not Alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- Felicien Mallefille.
- He's the children's tutor.

"Chang, look over there!"
An explosion!
Let's check it out
"Chang, we can't lose him now!"
Freeze!
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.
Don't cry.
- He's down there!
Step on it!
- Okay.
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?
He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
Go down the hall.
What happened?
(DOOR SLAMS)
Wow.
"Damn, Finn."
This must be your best one yet.
How long you been workin' on this?
"Like two, three weeks?"
Fuck off.
I don't go to the bar and complain when it takes you 10 minutes to make a martini.
(PHONE RINGS)
I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.
I just hit a little creative block.
That's all.
(BEEPS) Hello?
"Oh, hi, Mrs. Anderson."
"Why, yes."
The building manager's right here.
"Oh, I'm sure he'd be delighted to come over and fix your toilet."
He's givin' me the thumbs up right now.
He'll be over in a second.
"(BEEPS) You were saying something, right?"
About you being perfectly happy with where you're at in life?
Hello.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Well, he said he was thinking of going to art school."
"And I said, ""Oh, what a coincidence!"
"Our building manager used to be a painter."""
(CHUCKLES)
"When you're 18, everybody wants to be an artist."
- Shh!
- FINN:
Where did you get that?
Garage sale.
"Oh, wow, that's a really good question."
(sucks air)
"La, la, la... (blathering)"
Mm... (blathering)
(blowing raspberries)
"Oh, hi, Meg."
Could you tell Chris breakfast is ready?
"Oh, um, I-I-I think he got up early."
"He, um, said something about a fat kid rally at Little Caesars."
"Huh, it's not like Chris to miss breakfast."
"Oh, don't worry, Mom."
I...
I'm sure he'll be home later.
"Well, I hope so."
We were supposed to go to the library to wipe boogers in fancy books.
I like to wipe mine in Bronte novels.
It's like a time bomb to gross out lonely chicks.
"Oh, Heathcliff."
"Oh, come on."
I want so little.
"Chris, what did you do with my video tapes?"
I had a whole system.
I was trying to find a good movie to watch.
I've never even heard of most of these.
"""Jeffrey at the Park."""
"""Mikey's Scoliosis Exam."""
"""Nephew Somersault Compilation."""
"Well, even if you never heard of them,"
I assume you heard of the alphabet.
"You want to explain to me how ""Sammy Popsicle"""
"comes before ""Napping, Various""?"
"Geez, I'm sorry."
"Clearly, I"
Will go sailing
No more
Mom!
"Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?"
"What, dear?"
What was that?
Never mind!

"Buzz, where are you?"

Really?
That is so interesting.
"Would you like some tea, Mrs Nesbitt?"
Buzz!
- [Piano]
- Notthat.
[Stops]
Buddy?
I have always stood by you.
I campaigned foryou when I was pregnant.
"During Checkers, when Ike wanted you out, I told you to fight."
"This is different, Dick."
You've changed.
"You've grown more bitter, like you're atwarwith the world."
You weren'tthatway before.
"I'm 50 years old now, Dick."
Howmany millions of miles have I traveled?
Howmany millions of peoples' hands have I shaked that ljust don't like?
Howmany thank-you notes have I written?
"It's as if I, I don't know, justwentto sleep a long time ago... and missed the years between."
Says he picked up his personal effects.
What about the super saying they fought?
-We're gonna work on that in a minute.
"-John, this guy gets zero rhythm."
Zero.
"Razor, shirts, couple of pictures."
"Which would kind of be what I told you, right?"
-You were only there once?
-Right.
-Super says you were there twice.
-Let's break that down.
Super says I was there twice.
He's a liar.
Says he heard fighting.
Maybe he did.
She had scumbag friends...
-... that'swhysheworkedforus.
-We're getting different stories.
You say you were not there before you went to pick up your stuff?
"-Correct, for the second time."
-You altered a crime scene.
You admit lying about it.
"Hey, John, don't talk to me like some street skell here."
"You guys want to screw me for this, you go ahead."
I'm done talking to you.
-Yeah?
MEDAVOY:
Mrs. Fuentes?
-Yes.
-Detective Medavoy.
Detective Martinez.
-Your husband spoke to Detective Kelly?
"Every time I come here, Every time, you two."
Don't you work?
"Henry, nice to see you."
"Hi, how are you?"
"Anthony, right in the front."
"Anything you need Henry, just let me know."
"Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it."
You gave them $20 each.
"Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there."
-Where?
-Over there.
"Thanks a lot, Tony."
Salut!
-What do you do?
-What?
-What do you do?
-l'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen the Copacabana is proud to present the king of the one-liners Henny Youngman."
How are you all?
I'm glad to be here.
"Take my wife, please."
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.
"I said, ""Where do you wanna go for your anniversary?"""
"She said, ""I wanna go somewhere I've never been before. """
"I said, ""Try the kitchen. """
Dr. Wellsler is here.
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.
Gave him another six months.
I love this crowd.
Scottie's going to say a few words.
~ Turn it off!
"~ Can we have you on the dance floor, please?"
Where is he?
Peter?
~ Peter?
~ Come on.
"Little Peter Magath, where is he?"
"~ Ah, there he is!"
"~ Go on, Peter!"
"Now, little Peter may not have been the smartest kid in the village, but he was the slowest."
I've got short legs.
"We used to think, Michael and me, that Peter had been dropped on his head as a kid."
~ I had.
~ We felt sorry for him.
"We worried about your future, Peter."
How's little Pete going to manage?
We didn't know you'd end up one of the richest sods in Newcastle!
"~ Did we, Michael?"
"~ No idea at all, Scottie."
"Should've paid more attention, then, shouldn't they?"
"~ Oh, they're only joking."
~ Hm.
Hilarious(!
)
"Now, when Peter came to me and said,"
"""I'm going to make my fortune laying pipe,"""
I thought he wanted to be a gigolo!
"~ What's a gigolo, Scott?"
~ Ask Michael.
"~ Gigolo, that's right!"
"~ Michael thought tonight was fancy dress, so he's come as a Danish porn star."
I know.
"It'sjust a start. I mean, I know you're too old for a twin bed."
"It's a nice bed, Roy."
"You know, l-l didn't mean to mess up your life."
Oryour mother's.
"And I don't deserve a second chance to be your father, but I'm hoping you'll give me one anyway."
"You know, wayback when... lthought lhadallthe time in the worldtoget to knowyou, foryou to get to know me."
"But... one day... wake up, you look around."
"All you got to show foryourself is a... beautiful, talented, little girl."
Young woman... who hates you.
I don't hate you.
I miss her.
I miss her so much.
"God, everything isso screwedup."
Derek is mad at me.
He's not gonna come tomorrow.
I want him to be there.
lneedhim to be there.
I just want someone there who loves me.
I love you.
Whoa !
Hey.
Why are you so quiet ?
I don't feel like talking.
"Derek, there's something I oughta tell you."
I said something to Sara.
What ?
What did you say ?
Stuff.
About how maybe Nikki had a point about black men and white women.
What ?
You said what ?
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
Mm.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
Father?
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
-Come in.
-Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
-He's here already.
-Father?
-Father Karras.
"-It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and, um your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case first?
Why?
This is yours to do with as you please.
"You can choose to escape, if you want, but you may never be able to return."
Don't let anyone decide for you.
"Hail Mary, full of grace...."
I may not be back till 1 0:00.
"[ Woman #2 ] Yes, Mrs. Pauley."
Maku just called me.
"Oh, how is he?"
Worried.
"Someone just visited him, looking for Diane Westmore."
"[ Magnum Narrating ] Faced with a tough problem, some people drink."
Some eat.
"Me, I swim."
"I was pretty sure Maku recognized Diane, but when he suggested he call some friends and get back to me,"
I decided not to push it.
- [ Barks ]
"- Hi, guy."
Where's...
Apollo?
Zeus.
Apollo.
Patrol.
[ Dogs Bark ]
Enjoy your swim?
[ Chuckling ]
"Oh, whatever it is, Higgins, the answer is no."
"My, we are suspicious, aren't we?"
I won't give up the Ferrari.
"I wouldn't dream of asking you to, old boy."
I won't move out of the guesthouse.
"Well, I should bloody well hope not."
And I won't let someone move in either.
Never entered my mind.
You want me to take out your sister?
She's married and living in Sussex with four monstrous children.
All right.
Size?
"Is this a five or a six, Ursula?"
Ursula?
What?
Sorry.
Neck size.
Is it a 15 or a 16?
16.
What is wrong in cooking his favorite dish?
"Senthil, has Thangam opened his shop?"
"No, he has gone to Peelamedu for ear boring"
"Oh Casanova, Don't pinch my heart"
"Slowly, with your eyes don't measure me.."
-Who are you?
"-That doesn't matter, you dance"
"Stop it, this is my house, who are you?"
- Is it house no 1 3?
-Yes
- Are you Paramasivam?
-Yes
- Wanted someone 'for ear boring'?
- Yes
- I am the guy -ls it so?
- Tell me for whom I should do
- For my girl
- Is it her?
What is this?
Her nose and ears has already been bored
Why do you want to do again?
That is all old style do you know the latest style?
-What is it?
- That is at the navel
- No idea.
Pass.
- Mark Twain.
What Irish river forms the border of Connacht with Leins?
- The Shannon.
"- That's pretty scary stuff, Suri."
- How's Daisy doing?
- She's good.
She's going to get out soon.
- Great.
I have something to show you.
- Where is this?
"- The Falconer's Arms, opposite..."
- The Green Dragon.
- The night Lau died.
- I'm guessing 5 minutes before he died.
- What?
- Keep watching.
Kevin Grey is walking out that door to kill Freddie Lau.
Come on - you have nothing here.
So I had a drink with Freddie Lau one evening - so what?
This is accessory to murder.
No.
"Harry, I need something here, Harry."
Old friend.
You've been lying all along about this.
I think Kayleigh Fenchurch was murdered as a warning to Lau.
Then someone set Kevin Grey on the path to revenge.
Someone screwed with his head just enough to make him kill Lau.
"A nice, neat love triangle - case closed."
"But that's not what's really happening here, is it, Kalim?"
So tell me who's pulling your strings?
"Hey, is this Burton falling's office?"
Is this Burton falling's office?
"Yes, it is."
What do you want?
What do you care?
Bitch.
"It was good to see you again, Liz, and, um, I'm sure"
Jake will do a great job for you.
He's a very bright young man.
"Well, I appreciate this, Burton-- aunt Liz?"
Ohh...
Nicholas?
Ohh!
"My goodness, look at you."
It's been a long time.
Yeah.
You look great.
Heh heh heh!
And I see that you've met my son Jeremy.
Judge:
"I am sentencing you to 1,500 hours of community service."
Using your skills as a corporate attorney to work as a child advocate.
So Liz wants to sell her company to vortex communications.

"Oh, I've seen that one."
"[Cartoon voice] ""We're freezing prices down here!"""
Good.
The Western grocery price Terminator?
"Oh, heh heh!"
That's funny.
Look at you.
What do you look like now?
"Master, I think he looks like a lily"
You all think so?
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Master Shi, we found on your apprentice"
Zhou Sanzhao's silver ingot
This is indeed strange
We hope you can clear things up for us!
"The silver ingot is engraved with the word ""San"""
"Y es, ""San""!"
San is on it!
Y es
Where did you get it?
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me
What?
Zhou Sanzhao is the most notorious murderer
How will he gave you money?
That's right!
"He didn't really give it to me, I..."
"Master, he's lying again"
Y es!
He's lying again!
Where did you get the money?
"Gao Jian, tell dad the truth!"
"Quick, otherwise Master will punish you!"
Zhou Sanzhao threw money... at the prostitutes
So I dressed up as a woman and got his money
Dressed up as a prostitute?
Good idea!
"Y es, yes, he does look like a woman!"
!
- Nope.
"There's a lot of wedding rings in here, though."
"Sir, we're in a big hurry."
Have you seen a cap and gown and sash?
Man:
"Gentlemen, put your hands together for..."
Val the Dictorian!
"(electronica version of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" plays)"
She definitely looks like she knows stuff.
(sighs)
Credit where credit is due.
She put together a pretty solid act in very little time.
Can you just please help me get my stuff back?
Miss?
Miss?
Val?
Hi.
Heh.
Here's the thing.
"The gown, everything..."
He actually left them here last night.
Manny:
I was having a tête-à-tête with Chyna.
She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.
"See, I'm going to college soon, and I... and I don't want any loose ends."
I'm in the middle of my act.
"Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back, so if you could strip a little more in our direction..."
I'm such a screw-up.
"Huh. ""Integrity."""
"It should say ""Perverted Schnapps Maniac."""
No work here.
MAIRIE OFFICER:

And the night is cold out here
Though our lives are very humble

"I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life."
"Hey, Frankie!"
"Come on out, let's play some Hearts."
Frankie!
Is it true you're worth over 300 million dollars?
"I'm a retired investor, living on a pension."
I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot.

"Everybody, pay attention."
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
"This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa."
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
"He's good-looking, isn't he?"
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
Sit down.
Talk to each other.
"Hey, Mr. Einstein..."
-The cake.
"-Sally, get in here!"
-I was scared.
Going out with Alice?
Where's Henry?
"Uh, I don't know."
Alice probably called him.
We'll probably meet up.
Probably?
It's not a big deal.
Are you leaving out Henry for some reason?
No.
You and Alice dating?
Got plans to sleep with her again?
Dad!
No.
"We are not dating, exactly."
And I do not have plans to sleep with her.
"But if that were going to happen, you wouldn't have Henry around."
"Oh, I'll call Henry."
Henry doesn't know you slept with Alice?
No.
He does not.
And I'd like to forget that ever happened and so would Alice.
Let me make a suggestion.
"Hang out with Henry, or Henry and Alice, not just Alice."
You slept with her.
She's not just a friend.
"Geez, Dad, what is going on here?"
What is going on here is I think you might be sneaking around trying to see Dylan.
Where did that come from?
I'll tell you where it came from.
Dylan's father.
"He called me asking about Henry, if I know Henry."
Dylan's going out with Henry tonight.
"- 'Cause it's notyou, it's the system."

The system won't letyou stop it.

"- No, I'm not powerless."
Because...
"Because I understand the system, I believe I can, uh..."
"I can control it, maybe notcontrol ittotally, buttame itenough to make it do some good."
Sounds like you're talking abouta wild animal.
"Yeah, maybe I am."
"We really must go, Mr. President."
Please.

Getaway.
"- [Nixon] She got it, Bob."
- Nineteen-year-old college kid.

Who?
She understood something that's taken me 25 years in politics to understand.
"The C.I.A., the Mafia, those Wall Street bastards."
- Sir?
- The beast.
I started making calls because I didn´t wanna wait.
"I told you, we have a small window of opportunity here."
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
All right.
- l have other things to attend to.
- OK.
- ls there anything else?
- That´s it.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
- What´s the security configuration?
- Don´t worry.
We´re handling Nina.
"- Ryan, you know what she´s capable of."
- That´s none of your concern.
- l´m sending you to Medical.
- l´m fine.
- l don´t think you are.
- What´s this about?
We found evidence you´ve been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I´m off here, Jack."
Tell me I´m wrong.
- l didn´t think so.
"- Ryan, I haven´t missed a step. I´m fine."
I have to cover my ass.
I need to get you checked out.
You´re wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah.
I thought you´d wanna know your dad´s back.
- What about Chase?
I suppose.
Always managed to find a bit of money from somewhere.
Do you know his name?
Aye.
Said his name was...
T Dan Smith?
No.
Richard.
Richard Grainger.
"But when you find him, tell him there's £2.10 to come back on that."
~ He won't be collecting it.
~ Off the cliff?
"Something like that, yeah."
"~ It's all part of the job, pet lamb."
"~ It isn't, actually."
~ I had to do it.
"~ Oh, please don't tell me this is character-building because you're living proof that it's not."
I could have you disciplined for that.
"~ Go on, then."
~ Lovers' tiff?
"Right, guv, there's three Richard Graingers in the Newcastle area."
"One is four years old, one's 78 and the other one is alive and well and works at The Ministry in Longbenton."
"So, the dead man's not from the area, then?"
Do I amuse you?
"What, is this that T Dan Smith blokey again?"
"He's called Richard Grainger now, is he?"
"Are there any chocolate biscuits, pet?"
What?
What's funny?
"Grainger Street, Grainger Town, Grainger Market."
~ Yeah?
~ Richard Grainger.
"Good night, beautiful."
Good night.
"Doctor, it's so nice of you to come."
My pleasure.
"And, Mrs. Comstock, what a heavenly gown."
How sweet.
Thank you.
"I believe you know Margo Stevens, Doctor and Mrs. Comstock."
- How do you do?
"- How do you do, Miss Stevens?"
"Margo is one of my husband's little golf partners, you know."
It's a shame you've never played yourself.
"Oh, you'd be surprised how much I know about the game."
Now be a dear and get Dr. and Mrs. Comstock a drink
"- for me, will you?"
- Thank you.
"You must come out some time, Mrs. Langley, and give me lessons."
Psst.
Danny.
"Danny, I was afraid you weren't going to come to my party."
I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world.
My bags are packed.
Everybody'll be squishy by 11.
We can sneak out then.
"We'll drive, Danny."
Anywhere in the world.
11:00.
Anywhere in the world.

Noona's has work now so I won't be able to take care of you as often.
So eat a lot.
Your sister wasn't even able to sleep last night because she was preparing all this.
So eat up and go to school already.
I'm so sad.
What's with you face.
Your friends don't give you food at their house?
Noona.
Ah for real.
If your that worried why don't you follow him with a bowl.

I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie?
Him?
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens.
That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job.
He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
"Nobody cares what he says, he talks so much."
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
-Okay?
-All right.
Start like this.
Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
"Stop breaking my balls, alright?"
.
I was just stalling for time.
"- Well, that's unnecessary."
"- Oh, she's right, baby."
"If you had worn these things in college, even I wouldn't have slept with you."
"And, if you recall, I was good to go."
(BARNEY LAUGHS)
"No one, I mean, no one could get laid wearing these."
(BARNEY LAUGHING)
Challenge accepted.
"I, Barney Stinson, being of sound mind and amazing body, will wear these overalls until I have sex with a woman."
- I actually dated that guy.
- Yeah.
- (LILY SIGHS)
- Okay.
Quick game plan.
"Maggie shows up, couple minutes of hugs and ""Hi"" s and then everybody's out of here."
This is my one shot.
I am not gonna screw this up.
Who'd you get to cover your class tonight?
- Crap!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Hey.
- (LAUGHS) Hey.
"Oh, my goodness."
"- Hey, stranger."
- Hey.
"- Maggie, this is my roommate, Robin."
- Hey.
- (GIGGLING) Hey.
Nice to meet you.
"- (GIGGLING) Nice to meet you, too."
"Um, I totally forgot I have to teach a class tonight."
Hey!
He's good luck.
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.
"You know, I feel bad."
I didn't give you something.
"I bring something, but I forgot it when I left that morning."
"Balsamic vinegar, 35 years."
From my sister's husband's family.
Live in Modena.
"So, aside from your Dad..."
-was it wonderful being back in Italy?
"-It was wonderful, yeah."
"Go home and see your friends, your family."
I gotta be honest... it was not so nice.
-I don't belong there no more.
-No?
Something change.
-Maybe me.
-What do you mean?
I'm like a visitor in my own town.

He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, are you sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know for sure that he was in the Navy.
He hasn't called you or written you?

"And what's ""Oschwitz""?"
The word is Auschwitz.
"Oschwitz, Auschwitz, it's the same crap."
Stop it.
- Where to?
- To sleep.
- Dad's inspection.
- What?
I cracked the case.
I spent all night with this garbage.
"The delightful record of an obsessive cheapskate, but it's also the entire history of this family,"
"- before I was born, of course."
- Where did you find Dad's whistle?
Don't interrupt.
"Okay, as we all know, Mom and Dad got married in 1965."
"Morn was 19, and that's when Dad started keeping records, right?"
"You, Natanel, were born in 1976 and Dad bought a stroller."
So?
It took them 11 years to have their first child.
So what?
We know that.
Look.
"Exactly 9 months before Natanel was born it says: ""June 23, 1975, plane tickets to Paris for Yonah,"
"""1,400 liras"""
What's your point?
- She visited Aunt Rosa every year.
- Right.
"9 months before you were born,"
"9 months before Dorona was born,"
and 9 months before I was born.
What does it mean?
"I'll marry a cold fish, then cheat the rest of my life."

But the graduation dance is important.
"You want a new car, don't you?"

"Hello, Betty."
This is Rodney.
"Look, Betty, this is so terrible, I don't know where to begin."
Tell her.
"Betty, the graduation dance is off."
She hung up.
What a fine graduation.
- I know someone you can take.
- Who?
Allison MacKenzie.
Her mother kicked me out of the house for kissing her.
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison's a girl of quality.
"Quality's a very good thing in woolen cloth, but it's very dull on a big date."
"I didn't know you were such a good dancer, Allison."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Hi, Rod."
"- Hi there, Allison."
"Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?"
"After the dance, shall we go to Rockland?"
Okay.
"Oh, really?"
"- Some more, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"- No, thank you, Ms. Thornton."
"May I have this dance, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"I haven't danced for such a long time, I'm afraid I'd be terrible."
"Oh, my God!"
This is Helmut Lang.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Dripping with edge.
"- You know you're never gonna get it back, right?"
- Fine.
I'm gonna rock this forever 16 jacket forever.
"You know you're cooler than any guy, right?"

"Yeah, now would be good."

"So, Tracy, how long has this been going on?"
"Three weeks, and it's getting worse every day."
"All he talks about is God, God, God."

Wilbur wouldn't do a thing like that.
"You're very fond of him, aren't you?"
Very.
I wish he belonged to me.
"You could do with a little of Wilbur's manners, you know."
"I'm sure they must be very charming, but he certainly didn't have any trouble worming his way in."
"Well, no, he didn't."

Why not?
You're not dating her anymore.
"Well, I mean, he can date her if he wants, but he knows I still like her."
I don't think he would ask her out on a date.
"But then again, I guess he did."
Huh.
"It's, uh..."
I can't believe that.

I can't either.

"Yeah, sure."
"Mr. Fuentes, it's Detective Martinez."
My partner and I got the impression maybe something was bothering you...

"Hey, Marcus, my niece just called."

She's worried he might be dead.
"A guy who uses the name ""O.G. Pwnzr""?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
She's not the only one.
911's ringing off the hook.
Apparently he was some sort of online celebrity.
"Whatever happened, it went viral."
Look at the number of viewers.
"30,000 people have seen this?"
Only no one knows the guy's real name or where he was in New York when this happened.
"If he's dead, there's a murder scene out there, and no way to find it."

"Yes, Mother."
"Wouldn't it be nice if you had men friends, or dates, or even marry again?"

"Anyhoo, point being, Wayne McNut was the only one Slim Jim couldn't beat in the whole Great Lakes region."

Yeah.

"--It was in my coat --Hey there, Pavel!"
--I need to see you --Hi.
"Bad timing, come by later"
"Listen, what did you say to my dad?"
That I stole some bar of soap from you...?

I'll remind you.
"May 1943, Boys Village in Amur Region"
My soap vanished in the morning.
In the evening you brought a bottle of booze.
"--What ""Boys""?"
--Where we were demoted together

"- Yes, ma'am."
I made free to wish her joy.
"Mr Ferrars was in the carriage, but he just looked out the other window."

Miss Lucy seemed vastly pleased.
"Well, I..."
I'll put that lot away.

Why would the Nazis accept Franco's demands?
What have you found out?
"We don't know if the Holy Grail is in Montserrat, but there is a time door."
Of course.
The grail of all grails.
They are accepting the conditions because they want that door.
And how do they know about a door that even we aren't aware of?
From Lola Mendieta.

I just thought it might be easier to fly.
"Nothing worthwhile is easy, ellen."
We know that.
Kids?
Who wants to see the trip plan?
"Dad, we`re playing!"
"Okay, shut off the video games."
"Come on, Russ."
Shut it off.
I know you`II enjoy this.
I worked out the trip on the computer so that we get the maximum amount of fun time at WaIIey world without missing any of the good stuff along the way.
Here we go!
There`s us.
And there`s WaIIey world!
"Now, Iet`s just take a look at Day One."

That`s just great.

"Now, my fantasy pick for a president would be Eddie Murphy."
"Look, thanks a lot."
That's what I get paid the big bucks for.
"Speaking of which, that will be two hundred of them."
"Right, remember?"
Yeah listen.
Alls I got is thirty right now.
"Hey, that's nice. 18 karat?"
"Forget it, sentimental value."
Sentiment has no value.

How about I give you this now and I'll give you the rest next week when I get paid.

"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."

"""Kane."
"Kyoko. """
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane. "" So this is our Grandma, right?"
- Eleven!
- Eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.

Hello.
"Damone, it's Peter."
I'm at my date and I left my wallet at home.
"Will you please borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet, and bring it back here?"
"Damone, are you there?"
I've never chosen my own company.
"Nyssa, it was you who contacted me and begged me to help you find your father."
"And, Tegan, it's your own curiosity that got you into this."
"And Adric, a stowaway."
-The Tardis!
-It's followed us from the Central Register.
-How can it get here when there's no one in it?
-Did I say there was no one in it?
It must be the man who brought me to Logopolis...
I don't want any further argument.
"One, two, three of you into the Tardis."

Go on.
"-Look, we want to help you..."
-It's impossible.

"Can I do your back, honey?"
I`ve already done my back.

Go do your own front.
We should call Catherine and Eddie and tell them that we won`t be in until tomorrow afternoon.
"If we`re not there by 10:00 a.m., we`II be completely off-scheduIe."
I planned very carefully so we`d be at WaIIey world first thing Saturday morning.
"Sparky, I know how much this trip means to you and that you want all of us to have a great time, but it`s a Iong way to WaIIey world."

"Mr. Campbell, do you have something on your mind?"
I wanna know just one thing.
Do we have to be better Southerners than the Johnny Rebs themselves?
I went pretty far tonight.
But let me tell you this:
"You said you all moved to Paris, but Mom said your parents died back in Algeria."
Papa died 12 years ago and Mama died two months later-.
12 years?
We had grandparents until 12 years ago?
Why didn't we meet them?
Your mom shunned them until they died.
"She didn't speak to them, only to me."
"Aunt Rosa, where's Maurice?"
Please tell us.
Do you know who Isabelle Moretti is?
- The actress?
- Yes.
Talk to her.
- What does she have to do with Maurice?
- She knew him.
Look her up and talk to her.
"This isn't Hollywood, she's just an actress-."
Now leave me alone.
Who are you talking about?
Why should we talk to Moretti?
Why can't you tell us?
"- I don't want to, okay?"
- Why not?
Who are they talking about?
"About Madame Isabelle Moretti, no more and no less."
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
We start with Romeo and Juliet and end up with Isabelle Moretti.
"Suddenly Mom jumps out of windows, has abortions, she's a Communist."
I don't know who you're talking about but it sure isn't my mother.
And to top it off you invent grandparents.

"L""ve got it all arranged so Clara won""t have to know."

"For me to say I""d leave Clara for you?"
Yeah.
I did.
I just did.
Sleep with me.
Just tonight.
"L""m afraid to go home."
Is she smiling or...
"Have you seen what I""ve turned her into?"
My daughter.
"My brilliant, talented, grown-up daughter hates me."
"No, she""s ashamed of me."
I have six dental practices.
I employ 50 people.
I put bread on their tables.
I work seven days a week... to build something my mom and dad could be proud of.
"Now it""s meaningless."
"Overshadowed, negated by David""s mortal sin."
- Maybe I should go.
- You have to understand.
"When I first met Clara, I never imagined I would ever..."
"Back then, her accent was so strong, she""d say, ""David."""
"That was the only thing she""d say that I could understand."
"But still she""d talk and she""d talk... and I""d watch her."
I could watch her forever.
I used to look at her... and think I had more respect for this woman than anyone I have ever known.
Very good.
We are counting on you to do your best in the national communication network sector.

They've broken up with me.
I know more about break-ups than anyone except Taylor Swift and every person she has ever dated.
"I've been dumped by nine women, and I've only dated five of them."
"Wait, wait, so four strangers just walked up to you and said, ""It's over""?"

Dragon Ball Super is brought to you by Bandai and these sponsors.
"At long last, the God of Destruction Beerus has set to work."
"The Kaio take notice, and fear that a new battle may begin..."
"Elsewhere, a large crowd of friends have gathered aboard the cruise ship where Bulma's birthday party is being held, however..."
Vegeta's not coming because he's training?
.
And Son-kun too?
.
"At the same time, the God of Destruction Beerus set off towards the north Kaio's planet, where Goku was, to find the Super Saiyan God..."
I will find him...
"This ""Super Saiyan God"" guy."

Tonight's soup is asparagus soup.

Is there any more soup?
Ah.
I'm afraid cook didn't make enough soup.
"Tonight was quite strange, almost seeing them as, like, normal people."
"We've always looked up at them and I found it almost quite unbearable and uncomfortable to be served by them and I mean constantly I felt myself, like, wanting to help them."
"I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Mason."
Yes.
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO LIGHT.

"NOW, HOW WERE THE BANDS, WAS THAT THE RIGHT BAND?"
"YEAH, IT'S THE RIGHT BAND."
"I JUST HAD A BIGGER LOOP, SO."

"--Why didn't you say anything, moron?"

--So you haven't knocked down a single garage?
--Sure did.
Gaeva's.

- ... bartended before?
"- I have, I've bartended a lot, actually."
"The last, I was in Greece, I worked at a taverna for a while in Athens, Greece."
"And then I did a little bit of bartending in Mykonos, 'cause I was there, and I bartended in"
"Chicago at a little club, but I hated the manager."
I'm not gonna give you his reference.
I hated his guts.
I actually took his keys and I threw them in the snow 'cause I knew he wouldn't find them 'til the springtime.
I just couldn't stand that guy.
"I mean, I know I shouldn't be telling you that, 'cause here I am trying to get a job, but..."
"And then I've been everywhere but pretty much, like, North and South Dakota,"
I've never been.
"But I love Black Hills Gold, so I should go there one day, right?"
Are you all right?
You look--
- I've had a tough day.
- Oh.
"I'm sorry, let me just.."
"God, it's driving me crazy, your eyes are, like, soaking wet."
"They're, like, soaking wet."
Do you have an allergy problem or something?
- Um.
"- Look, Iâm gonna just go like this."
- Okay.
- And you're just gonna breathe.
Yeah.
"Um, the one on the left-- the first one."
Thanks.
"Uh, what do you want in Hillie's room?"
"Well, I need-- I need a dress to bury her in."
Do you have any suggestions?
Her favorite was the blue dress with the bow on the back.
"You loved her, didn't you?"
"- Uh, everybody loved Hillie."
- But... you loved her a little more.
"You would've made a great Dr. Watson, Al."

He's your father.
"To your real father, how can you..."
Kim Young Joo was faced with the same.
"Because it was his father, he concealed and covered it."
"But, was that really good for his father?"

Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I'm gonna go talk to her again.
Okay.
I'm gonna stay her e and do our job.

"In a press conference just held, the Beijing government has announced that if there are no signs of a resolution by 6:00, the situation will inevitably develop into a serious crisis."
"In response, Secretary-General Chang of South China, also known as the Democratic Federation of China, questioned if there was some connection to the terrorist acts committed by the unidentified AS..."
Listen up.
"We have until 6:00 AM, which means we have 90 minutes left."
"""Burning Hong Kong"" We have until 6:00 AM, which means we have 90 minutes left."
"""Burning Hong Kong"" If we fail, that's it."
"If we fail, that's it."
Hong Kong will become a sea of flames.
And I doubt it will stop there.
You kept her face pretty?

Even the biggest production numbers needed stars.
So Eleanor Powell became MGM's first big dancing star.
In Broadway Melody of 1938 and almost all of her films Eleanor becomes a huge sensation by the last reel.

- Enough for all the ladies who do high tea at the Bel-Air.
"Yeah, I remember my first campaign."
I didn't care about image.
I would show up at a fundraiser in the same suit that I wore to the previous night's fundraiser.
"Sometimes my wife and I would bring the kids,"
- strapped to us in those backpacks.
- Sounds like fun.
"No, it was, and then we'd rush home, put the kids to bed and then stay up all night laughing about the evening."
Sounds like you and your wife made a good team.
Ex-wife.
"And, yeah, we did."
For a while.
Do you miss her?
I miss the people we were back then.
"And no, I don't miss who she is now."
And I know she doesn't miss who I've become.

"AND OVER TIME,"
JACKIE ROBINSON HAS PUSHED US FORWARD.
"FOR HIM, THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION"
WITH SIMPLY BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROOM.
BARACK OBAMA:
PART OF WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON IS
PRECISELY HIS ABILITY TO APPROACH BASEBALL
AND THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF INTEGRATION
IN WAYS THAT WERE CONTRARY TO HIS CHARACTER
OR HIS FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WRONG
IN SERVICE OF A LARGER CAUSE.
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN.
HE HAD PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK HIS MIND MANY TIMES OVER.
NARRATOR:
"ON APRIL 15, 1947, JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON BECAME"
THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE MODERN AGE
TO PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
[CHEERING]
"IN HIS FIRST SEASON WITH THE BROOKLYN DODGERS,"
"HE HAD SILENTLY ENDURED RACIST TAUNTS,"
"THREATS, AND ABUSE,"
PERFORMING SPECTACULARLY ON THE FIELD
AND BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEN IN THE COUNTRY.
"LATER, UNBURDENED OF HIS PROMISE TO BRANCH RICKEY TO KEEP QUIET,"
"TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK,"
"AMERICANS WOULD BEGIN TO SEE THE REAL JACKIE ROBINSON,"
AND THEY WOULD NOT ALWAYS LIKE HIM.
"Come on, snap!"

I was not the only one to lose a role here.
"In Annie Get Your Gun, Betty Hutton was a big hit as Annie Oakley."
But Betty wasn't the studio's first choice.
Judy Garland had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced.
"Retrieved at last from the MGM film vaults is Judy's version of ""I'm an Indian Too. """
Am I an Indian yet?
Hoh!
"Like the Chippewa Iroquois, Omaha"
Like those Indians
I'm an Indian too A Sioux
A Sioux
Some Indian summer's day Without a care
I may run away
With Big Chief Sun-of-a-Bear
And I'll have totem poles
Tomahawk Small papoose
Which will go to prove I'm an Indian too
A Sioux
"A Sioux Oh, I'm an Indian, I'm an Indian"
I'm an honest Injun Indian
"I'm an Indian, too"
Ow
Folks are dumb where I come from
They ain't had any learning
This is the only other number Judy shot forAnnie Get Your Gun.
"As you can see, whatever conflicts Judy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer."

"Because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."
- Thank you and good day.
- Mr. Nixon.
I
- Is this the end of politics foryou?
- [Reporters Shouting]
[Shouting Continues]
[March]
[Announcer] Here in California... we can officially write the political obituary of Richard Milhouse Nixon.
"Asmall town lawyer like Lincoln, Nixon became a representative at 33... and a senatorat 35... as partofthe postwar Republican sweep ofthe congressional elections... that attacked F.D.R.'s big-government new deal."
"Running as a South Pacific veteran, victories overCongressmanJerry Voorhis and Senator Helen Gahagan Douglas... made it clearthat, to Nixon, politics was war."
"He didn't have opponents, he had enemies."
"Why, she's pink, right down to her underwear."
I
"Nixon became one of the leading lights... on the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee, questioning labor leaders, Spanish Civil Warveterans, Hollywood celebrities."
"If I had myway, they'd all be sent back to Russia."
But itwas the Alger Hiss case that made Nixon a household name.
"One ofthe architects ofthe United Nations, intimate of F.D.R. And Oliver Wendell Holmes,"
Alger Hiss was a State Department diplomat... accused by freelance journalist WhittakerChambers... ofpassing secret documents to the Soviet Union.
- Hiss is lying.
- Hiss claimed he was being set up... by Nixon andJ.
Edgar Hooverto discredit the new deal's policies.
"I am not, and never have been, a member ofthe Communist party."

"Oh, Gigi."

Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.
"Just say the word, and I'll do it."
I don't need you for that.

All of you are a blemish on the name of a woman.
You people are living in a disguise.
I'll send you behind bars.
"No, sir."
"No, sir."
Let me go home.
My younger brother... ...is suffering from fever.
I had to do this for his treatment.
I've no support in life.
I've nothing to eat at home.
Even my mother died of hunger.
- How?
She was suffering from Asthma.
I didn't have money to give her the treatment.
- Oh!
You go home.
- Yes.
Swings?
Were there swings there?
"You said you are going to the toilet,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;what are you doing?"
I was going now.
"Man Ok, let's eat together later."
Okay.
Aren't you going in?
Where did you go?
You neglected a person dying with pain alone.
Wow!
"What, neglect?"
I left after seeing that you had fallen asleep.
Never mind!
"If I catch a cold, it is all your fault, Stylist Jang."
What?
I even poked his finger for him.
My bag!
Let's resume after a break.
"Everyone, be quiet!"
Be quiet!
Be quiet!
"Yes, Grandpa."
What would I be doing?
We're in training.
"At one, shout."
"At two, action."
Start.
- One!
- Ay!
Two!
Ay!

What are we going to do?
"Also, exposure causes early onset."
(SMACK!)
Take a hard look at yourself.
I'm slipping.
(BRAP!)
Both of us are.
We must abandon her.
Here?
Now?
(TWEET!)
RAPE!!!
"Handy, right?"
We have to go this very minute.
"Okay, um...I'm on board."
"We'll change our last names, and then we'll call the cops."
"Right, right, right!"
They'll take her into custody.
She's no longer our problem.
I like that.
-Move!
Go!
-What?
GO!
GO!
GO!
"Yeah, I don't need to know that."
"No, no, no, no."
I am an expert in discharge.
Just ask away!
"Nasal, Vaginal, Anal."
Our short webseries tells these stories.
It helps maintain the illusion.
"Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine."
She asked me to come.
But not to come late.
I have to see this show.
"Just let me in, I'll stand in the..."
A Spider-Man A Spider-Man...

"May I have an autograph, please, miss?"
What are you doing here?
You hungry?
Starved.
What was that?
Okay.
Cool Spidey outfit.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
I made it.
Looks uncomfortable.
"Yeah, it gets kind of itchy."
And it rides up in the crotch a little bit too.
Hi.
"In this case, I think it's required."
I'd better get home.
I feel a murder coming on.
"Mm, college man."
"Hi, I'm Lila."
Which Greek god are you?
"Lila, Russ and I are trying to talk here."
"Russ, is it?"
(trills) Russ.
"Sounds kind of like an animal, doesn't it?"
Your nose is shiny.
It is?
It is not.
Is it?
If you're lying...
Back in a flash.
Let's bail before she comes back and ruptures a hormone.
Bye.
Manny.
And I want a lot of closeups.
Hello?
Winston?
Are you in this time zone?
Hmm?
"Oh, yeah."
"Zooms, closeups, lots of energy..."
Gotta go.
Bye.
"Focus here, people, focus."
Remind me to talk to him about his attention span.
What?
"Here's a little present for you, trashman."
Stop complaining.
Last time was the Big Sister.
Now you want me to be gay.
"No, thanks."
I don't want anything going through my back door.
"I don't want to say this, But all good things must come to an end."
Tell your dad I miss him.
"- Got it, uncle che."
- See you next break.
- Do you know how to drive?
- You want problems?
"Hey, come on."
Hold on.
- Who the hell are you?
You're so big?
- What's wrong with you?
- You don't have anywhere else to talk?
- Do you know who I am?
I'm a nephew of Che.
Who the hell is Che?
I don't know him.
"- Hey, calm down."
- You shut up.
"- I'm sorry, uncle Che."
Give me the gun.
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Too much.
Too much.
- I'll teach you a lesson.
Son of a bitch.
Come on.
This is my nephew.
Can't you try it on now?
It should suit you.
No.
Go home now.
Alright.
- Somewhere quiet...
- I don't have time.
Go and take this.
"If you don't like it, give it to a friend."
I don't have any.
"Yes, you do."
"No, I don't."
"-Yes, you do."
"- No, I don't."
"Yes, you do."
Wait for me downstairs.
-Where are you?
-Walk ahead 10 meters.

-Why?
"Wait., come upstairs."
- I think we should stop seeing each other.
- What?
Yes!
- Alone?
I sent her.
So what?
"Aunt, we never send a girl and a boy out before marriage."
"This is a love marriage, son."
And you must be aware what can happen before marriage... ...in such types of marriage.
They come closer and closer... ...and embrace each other.
He's Jimmy and he's Kishan.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you very much for the drama you played for us.
Thank Mr. Damodar to trap me in this.
He's a very nice person.
Oh!
"So, this is your motorbike factory."
"Yes, I work here."
What?
You work here?
Yuck!
I thought you are an owner of it.
No!
I'm a labour.
Labour?!
Sad!
Very sad!
Labour class people.
"Anyway, Kishan."
These are few shirts... ...I had bought them for myself.
I didn't like it.
You keep it.
"No, sir."
- (Finebros) You got one.
- Yay!
(Finebros) But it's not over.
- Aw.
- (Finebros) You need seven more.
Come on.
Where are you?
I don't understand where I'm going.
There's a page.
"""Follows."""
♪ (jolting chord) ♪ (high-pitched static) - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - (whimpering) (high-pitched static) (nervously) Guys!
Don't be there.
"Oh, no!"
No!
"No, no!"
"Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!"
I really-- I didn't even find any notes.
"(Finebros) Oh, you're okay."
Keep going.
- Oh!
Oh!

Go.
"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
I'm really lost.
I'm just walking aimlessly now.

Happy birthday.
I'm seeing somebody now.
"You mean, like a boyfriend?"
"Well, like I like him."
What?
Nothing.
"Thas good, you know?"
Companionship...
May be more than that.
More?
I don't know.
I'm coming to see your play tomorrow night.
You're coming?
I'll be there.
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
Rent.
Hi.
Hi.
"Whas ""hi""?"
Can I spend it?
I have a paycheck due this week and...
You're a month late again.
Again.
I promise as soon as...
"If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat."
"I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch."
All I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.
"""Sorry"" doesn't pay the rent."
And don't try to sneak past me.
I have ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.
- Let's do it here.
Here?
I don't think it's a good idea.
-Whew!
This is strange.
- Never mind.
Get up.
Aren't you coming?
Where?
Where?
Behind the phone booth?
Supermarket?
No.
Don't cross the street.
Just walk straight.
Don't look back.
Yes.
Keep on walking.
- Hide over there.
Hide - Come closer to the sidewalk.
Lean forward.
Okay go.
"- Now, we don't have to talk through the phone."
"- Oh, Okay."
"- Now, where are we going?"
"-Where?, We are going to kill ourselves."
-What do you mean kill ourselves!
- We must die if we love each other.
-What were you thinking coming here?
- I'm sorry.
No one knows who I am.
Open it.
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.
Like a movie.
Alright.
"One night, a night of brilliant moonlight,"
I was asleep... when the door opened quietly.
"Honey, could you turn that down?"
WHOA!
Dammit!
My ankle!
Oh yeah!
I didn't want to trip on them.
Ow!
"Sweetie, is your car running OK?"
"Yeah, why?"
Great!
I'm fresh out of gas.
I'll take yours.
I'm late for work.
(DlNG-DONG!)
Just a minute.
Oh!
"Hi, Marla."
We need to talk.
Come in.
What happened to your ankle?
Getting out of bed this morning ...
Tripped over Barry's golf clubs.
Yeah.
Happened to me many times when we were married.
I still wear a brace when it rains.
"So, what's in the box?"
I thought Barry cleared all of his stuff out after we got divorced.
I was cleaning today and I found something.
What is it?
You're not gonna like it.
Like what?
"Well, all those years, I knew there was something."
Catch him.
There he goes.
Catch him.
"Don't let him go. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Here comes Govinda... """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Don't let him go, catch him. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Go that way. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Let's sit down and talk.
All I did was file a case.
lf you try to talk they'll cut you in half.
Look behind.
Catch him.
Faster!
Who are you?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.
What?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.
So you're from UP.
You can call me Kanhaiyya.
Catch him.
Careful.
Careful.
"Careful, slow down."
Slow down.
Are you a man or a stuntman?
You can call me a stuntman as well.
But people call my stunts a miracle.
Miracle.
- Hold on.
You aren't wearing a helmet either.
There he is.
"Hey, even the card companies give you three months."
"You can give me three months, can't you?"
Let's meet on Saturday for sure.
Okay?
Saturday!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is there a forecast for rain today?
Well... the report has just come in.
"Sorry, Soo-jeong."
It'll be clear today too.
"Oh, I see."
I'm right here.
Mom!
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.
- And your homework?
- I did it.
- And the diary?
- Of course.
"Hey, I told you to draw me better."
"Look, my eyes are closed again."
Watch here.
Like this.
It's not working very well.
"Mom, do you regret it?"
Regret?
About me.
Do you regret it?
Why should I feel any regret?
It was my fault.
"No, it's Dad's fault."
Who is he?
His name is Venkat.
He is handsome and 6 feet tall.
That is the main problem.
Thank you.
Do you want another?
- It is enough for now.
Are you Venkat?
Yes.
Boss is calling you.
Get in to the jeep.
- Which boss?
This territory has only one boss.
Bhadram sir.
Why does he wants me?
Hey!
He got some work.
Shut up and get in to the jeep.
The boy is with me.
You go.
I will drop him at the house and follow you.
Who is he?
He is talking opposite to what we say.
Put both of them in the jeep.
Come on.
What is this?
Why are you so angry with us?
Sorry sir.
I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.
I would not cause any harm just caress him.
Take the boy home.
"Narin, please..."
Narin!
Narin!
No Narin!
NO!
It is not going to end like this...
This is not going to end like this.
1...2...3...4...5 1...2...3...4...5
Why did you save me?
Why did you?
I won't leave you Narin
I won't leave you...
Your life won't be like this.
I promise.
I promise...
Narin...
"Wake up, let's eat..."
Haven't you left?
How could I leave you?
I am not leaving.
I am here.
Don't do it.
Don't...
Don't cry...
I feel very ashamed before you.
Don't tell anybody.
I promise.
I won't tell anybody.
"But you have to promise me, too..."
"Whatever happens, don't give up on life."
Life is very valuable.
"You saw the bottom of the pain, Narin."
Not you!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
- Hello!
Inspector Damodar speaking.
"Yes, this is Uma."
- Oh Uma?
How did you make a call here?
I got this number from the police station.
What's happening actually?
"Nothing, I'm on duty."
Cover your drape.
What?
- No...
Not you.
"Yes, tell me."
Where's Radha?
She has gone to the youth festival.
She's coming back tomorrow. she's fine.
Why are you getting disturbed?
Cover your drape.
I'll tell you after I come to Mumbai tomorrow.
Okay!
"Okay, tell me one thing."
Do you miss me?
"Yes, I do."
Do you miss me?
"Yes, I too miss you a lot..."
That's why... cover your drape.
What's wrong with you?
What are you blabbering?
I'm not going to make it.
"Hey, put him down."
Down.
Let him down.
"Bastard, why did you let him fall off, huh?"
Go drive the ambulance.
Don't stare at me.
- Did you hit my friend?
- I didn't.
I did.
Just get in the ambulance.
Go.
Don't make me hit you too.
Go.
Hurry up.
This is amazing.
How's the sea?
It's alright.
Really?
I was thinking about going.
"Hey, how much are those two bottles of pepsi?"
"Well, it's been paid for."
"The man at that table has paid, sir."
What's this?
He's your next victim.
No way.
This is way too much.
"The last time, I had to put up with that Che."
"It's disgusting, eww..."
Don't get too dramatic.
Hey.
I've always managed.
You have to--
Sick!
You're so sick!
I'm so sorry.
I know.
The doctor said that you're gonna be okay.
He said it's just gonna take a little time.
We're leaving tomorrow.
It's not safe for us here now.
"- You all right, mate?"
- How is he?
He's hanging in.
"So, what now?"
You let Tommy know I want a straightener.
- Tomorrow.
- All right.
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.
"Ike, your mate runs security at Trinity Wharf?"
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him.
Set it up.
Sure.
Come on.
What's going on?
Ben and I are on the noon flight to Boston.
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.

"- Yes, she can."
She has to.
Then who the hell are you?
I'm...

Tell her this.
If she's got something to say.
"Beat it, punk."
What now?

The excessive violence...
"Get lost, bastard!"
"Get a life, you shit."

"Oh, no!"
Get out!

A good person!
But we don't love each other.
"My husband's a good person, too."

"Yeah, Abby's my mom."
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
"Um, you guys want to come inside?"
Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything?
"We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something."
Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.

"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.
- Yun?
"- Yes, Sire."
Yun.
Father.
"Well, then, what is it?"
I'd like to see the Crown Prince.
He's gone to see the King.
What?
What's your business here?
Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?
lf you come to the U.S.
Make sure you stop by Santa Monica beach!
Mr. Bookworm.
I'm not used to this.
Cut! okay!
It's over.

"The sunshine, the beach, the sand, everything in general was good"
None
Everything was wonderful.
I think the MV will come out well.
These shoes are too heavy I can't wear them.
"Ah, so heavy."
"Hey, seriously... stop that!"
You look scared for sure right now.
Take one hand off!
- I can't.
- It doesn't look good.
"Look here, kid."
You have to stand up straight.
Don't do that.
This is really dangerous. or you can do this.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
"Ah, my back."
Shall we go?
"Good, really good."
I think I can do it now.
That's a wrap!
Great job.
Great job.
Someone else gave my mouth a six and one third.
What's wrong with my mouth?
"God, I'm having a nervy B."
We've only gone over the plan a gazillion times.
You don't need to have a breakdown.
Just stick to your lines and we'll be fine.
Okay.
How's my hair?
Very Keira Knightley.
"Just get in there, you minger."
"Remember, lower your voice so you sound sexier."
Okay.
"- Hi there, how are you?"
"- Oh, fine, thanks."

What are you doing?
Jas?
"Hey, Jas."
Quelle surprise.
What a shock to see you here.
I want this brother.
That's fine.
Just stop playing with your hair.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...
Let's take a rest.
"Ah, Pura."
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Is something there?
All right.

Which ocean?
A tumbling open Ocean

Cold wind is getting in underneath.

"In the summer, we'll go."
Like a honeymoon.
- I can't go.
-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?
- Did I leave the stove on?
The rice cooker?

Come here.
Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!

Whatever you say.
But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
Never...
I'm a thief.
A goon... a criminal.
I can commit any crime but not this.
Her love is so pure and I'm full of dirt.
A dirt!
"She thinks I'm Kishan and I'm Jackie, the don."
"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!
- Kishan!
Radha!
I'm an absconding criminal.
"I'm a sinner, Radha."
I'm a sinner.
- Look out!
- I can hear someone breathing.
- Where?
- There's nobody there.
"- I tell you, I can hear like an owl!"
"- Hey, Mitrofanova."
"Such an important uncle, and you are making a Babylon of your hair!"
You know what I'm saying?
"- All right, Marat."
Go on.
- Maybe it'll sting through the shirt?
- Off with it!
"- And your pants, too."
"- Oh, come on!"
"- What, you think epidemics leave tan lines?"
"Rash all over, except the butt?"
"- Go on, then!"
"- Come on, guys, can't we do it all together?"
- We can!
- Stings like mad!
"- Come on, guys!"
For the win!
"- Oh, man!"
- Okay...
Interesting.
- Pull!
- And again!
- Raise it up!
- Stretch it out!
- Stop.
That's good.
Tie it.
Go.
Go.
- Who is that imposter?
Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."
- What's wrong with the mic?
Take a look.
- What's wrong with the mic?
Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."
- No.
Where are you going?
- Go.
Get down.
Play it.
- Wait everyone.
Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."

Today's 'Janmastami'.
You've your exams tomorrow.
Who will write that?
Get down!
Why do you always stop for religious things?
He'll be absolutely fine.
My son's playing Govinda.
My son won't become Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.
He'll grow up to become a cricketer.
Get down.
Get down.
Come on.
Mahadev.
- Coming.
- Let's go.
- Come soon.
Listen.
Remove the tag of Rs.250 from.. ..all the new idols that we bought.
- Yes.
"Now, watch how I sell it for 10-12 thousand."
And keep one idol from each on display.
- Okay.
Understand?
- Yes.
Come on.
One and only one piece in the world.
This idol appeared from the ground.. - Yes. ..when the temple at Badrinath was being built.
What are you saying?
That's the plan.
Rule the world.
You and me.
Any day.
- Love your hair.
- What?
"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
"He's a singer, sings in two voices."
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these new set of teeth from?
"Kundan, what a surprise."
- Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.
Kishen.
- Mona.
"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
"Just give him the freaking ""malk""."
[Josh]
You guys aren't even saying the same thing.
[Julian]
"We're all saying ""melk"", Josh!"
[Josh]
No!
"You're saying ""melk""!"
"You're saying ""malk""!"
(Yelling versions of milk)
[Josh]
Shut up!
Shut up!
[Donovan]
You better put it down.
[Julian]
"Don't do it, Josh!"
[Josh]
"You're going to shoot me, if I shoot myself?"
That doesn't even make any sense!
[Donovan and Julian]
"Josh, put it down!"
Put the gun down!
(Yelling at each other to put the gun down)
[Josh]
I'm going to kill myself over this!
[Julian]
You're like a brother to me!
Your head is like a brother to me!
(Screaming)
[Josh]
"And then, after that, we pull the trigger."
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?
- Who?
Tiger!
"- You will find it in the jungle, sir!"
Where is Tiger singh?
"I don""t know!"
"I don""t know! sir.. his grave is ready!"
- My grave?
Bury him alive!
- I will tell you!
I will tell you!
Tiger singh is in lran!
lran?
"This beauty, o beloved."
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.
NARRATOR:
It looks like Lee cut himself and he might be bleeding
Lee:
"Slow down, Lee."
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
You got plenty of time.
Broken in small bits.
"If it's big, it ain't going to get cooked."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Yeah, if you got blood in the food then you, you can't serve that, you know."
Lee:
Still bleeding a little bit.
"Now you all, we are ready here."
This...
NARRATOR:
"Hold up, guys."
Hold up.
Lee.
Lee:
You got it.
NARRATOR:
"Looks like you cut yourself while you were cooking there, brother."
Lee:
Yes.
NARRATOR:
Let me see that.
Lee:
Right on top of the thumb.
NARRATOR:
We can't take a chance with blood being in this food and the Cub Scouts eating it.
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
"Look at you, Peter."
Your grades have been steadily declining.
You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know.
I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
"Better do your research, Parker."
"Get it done, or I'm failing you."
Surprise!
"Well, say something."
Whas the occasion?
"Really, Peter."
Is your birthday!
Whether you want to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
"Don't you, Pete?"
"Hi, M.J. Hi."
"Hey, buddy."
Hey.
"Long time, no see."
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
Is going fine.
Is going good.
She's brilliant in it.
How would you know that?
Because--
"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.
They had a fight.
"Well, Gus found out"
I went into Johnny's room.
Johnny made me go.
"Oh, sure."
( dials phones )
Is this Gus' handwriting?
I wouldn't know.
Hello.
Who is this?
North Shore Clinic.
"Uh, this is the police."
"Will you check something for me, please?"
I'd like to know if you've given a smallpox vaccination to a Gus Priamos recently.
"Uh, Priamos."
P-R-I-A-M-O-S.
This morning?
"From the land of Mathura, where else?"
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.
Glory to you.
As long as people believe in toys like this.. ..our business will prosper.
Kanji.
"This is the God's idol, don't call it a toy."
The Lord is only a delusion.
"- Yes, let's go."
lsn't that Chintu?
Yes.
"Yes, that's him."
- Yes.
Yes.
He's dancing so well.
I'll put an end to all this.
Shut down the shop and get the scooter.
- Yes.
Come on.
- Kanji.
- Yes.
Look after my shop for a month.
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.
I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.
God save me from devils.
Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.
- Coming.
Feed them worth 10 rupees.
- Okay.
"Let's go, let's go."
Glory to.. - Siddeshwar Maharaj.
Whoa.
*(revving engine)*
Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
There he is.
(pulsating echo)
Thank God.

"Ah, there he is."

That scared me.
Aw.
Did it just die?
Did the flashlight just die?
"Well, gentlemen, I think it's all over."
"I can't see anything, and he's behind me somewhere."

It's just a matter of time before he catches me.

We're running around down here - Where the fuck are we going?
Connor:
"Matt, calm down."
"If you know where to go, let's hear it."
"If not, shut up."
Connor:
"James, do you know where we can go?"
James:
I think if we go back and left and follow the ring around we can find our way from there...

James:
Kate!
(Bang against door)
James:
We've got to go and get her.
Amy:
You have to listen to me!
"James, listen!"
She's gone!
"You saw those people James, you saw what they did."
Matt:
"Don't just fucking stand there, help!"
(Gas escaping)

Connor:
What's that?!
James:
Freon coolant gas.
Matt:
Ksanka's got to go.
Ksanka.
Ksanka!
Get back into your girl's clothes.
You'll go to Zbruyevka.
Maybe she oughtn't to go alone?
Find out how many there are and how long they'll stay.
"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?
Something like a psychologist.
He knows all sorts of bourgeois words.
Valerka told me they burned that Joan of Arc.
He probably just made it up.
- Ksanka.
- What?
I like you prettier in girl's clothes.
What things you say!
That's right.
What are you doing?
I won't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.
You want to give me away?
Don't argue.
Go back.
Ksanka!
Ksanka!
"Wait, Ksanka!"
What were Danka's orders?
It's not that.
"What happened to Egghead, Egg-breath,"
"Eggbeater, Eggnog, Egg-brain?"
Egg salad?
Good one.
Ha-ha!
"Winston, this thing between us is getting out of hand."
"I play a trick on you, you try to get me back."
The anger we're building up here could scar us for life.
"Here, let me get that."
Sit.
"Now, as I was saying,"
I think we should try to live together peacefully.
"You know, let bygones be bygones."
"Have you suffered a severe trauma of the head recently, Bruce?"

"Right, Manny?"
Yeah.

You think?
Yeah.
Go talk to her.

We've got less than two minutes and we're fried.
We've got to get out!

Matt:
What about us!
James:
Fuck!
James:
It's locked down!
Connor:
"James, calm down and think."
How do we get out?
James:
We go into the service tunnels.
Matt:
The tunnels?!
I'm about to lose my house.
Where will we stay?
"On the streets, or in their house?"
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?
"Come on, Jigna."
Sit in the car.
Come.
- He's made a mess of things.
I won't leave papa.
I'll slap you if you refuse.
"- No, mother."
"Come on, sit inside."
Please..
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).
What?
"lf you were a Muslim, I would've said Allah."
"lf you were a Christian, then Jesus Christ."
"You're a Hindu, so Krishna."
"You, here?"
"You're an excellent stuntman, really."
Very good.
I'm sure you're acting is decent as well.
Why don't you approach some television channel?
They keep remaking Ramayan and Mahabharat.
Krishna.
Suited-booted Krishna.
Here to teach me a lesson.
Look.
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
They aren't like you.
Wasn't that Jae Hee?
"Who, hyung?"
Why did that guy come here?
"Now, you even sleep out?"
Ah!
"Baek Go Dong, are all the guys here?"
I detest waiting!
I think the guys are here.
Hello! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
What is this?
"Uh, did you come?"
Who said you can use our practice room without permission?
So what?
"Man Ok, keep doing it."
This... this is totally cool!
Aren't you practicing?
"All right, I'm leaving now."
Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.
Take care.
We might not be able to see again until the trial.
You want anything from us?
No.
Just your good health.
Tell the lawyer if you wanna eat anything.
I'll cook and send it over.
"Okay, but it's not needed."
"I took a vow, when you get out of this place... ..."
I will feed orphans.
Look...
Stay away from the prison dogs.
- God be with you.
- Stay away from them.
Inshallah you'll be out after the first trial.
We'll see.
Inshallah.
We got the appointment for 13th of the month.
"Oh that, I got it."
I wish you the best.
Good for you...
"Goodbye, son."
See you.
- See you.
- Goodbye.
Handan Pakel.
Can I have my bag?
Have a good day.
"Ilyas, where are you?"
"Okay, I'm coming."
Can I have my ID as well?
Sami Tekinoğlu.
"-Wait, let me finish."
- Absolutely not.
No way.
-Why are you so worked up?
- Fools...
Don't I have a say in this?
Forget it.
No.
I have a guy already.
"A blind date is the best present, right?"
Really?
You have a boyfriend?
You do?
"115 00:14:46,652 --&amp;gt; 00:14:47,209 Wow..."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Yeah, he's good-looking."
How'd she meet a guy like this?
"- They look like a good couple, huh?"
- Right.
"Hey, Sister-in-law!"
Stop!
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Time out!
"Looks ridiculous, huh?"
- It was a mistake!
"Coach, save me!"
- You're dead meat!
"Come here, you bastard!"
"Get over here, you bastard!"
It was a misunderstanding!
The ministry of education requested proper courtesies regarding cell phones.
"And if anything unwanted comes up in the future, get rid of it."
And I'm sorry.
But I can't wear a skirt for you.
"A baby, crying all night."
"This poor mom, who can't do anything for him, other than to cry outside, so that he doesn't hear her."
"All night the baby cries inside the house, and I cry outside..."
"I love you, baby."
Please don't be sick.
I love you mommy.
Please don't be sick.
Why?
Hwi-chan.
Hwi-chan.
You don't need to do that for Mom anymore.
The nurse came and gave her a shot and some pills.
So you don't have to do that.
"No, when Mom did this for me I got well."
Go on.
-What?
-The song.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Mommy's got a pot belly.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Is anyone here?
- Is nobody here?
-We're the rescue team.
"If anyone's here,just yell."
-Anyone here?
-We're the rescue team.
"Ten, this is 101."
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.
She can carry the whole show.
I'll stake my reputation on it.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
*Missing school fund discovered.* *After a recent probe...*
"Now, there's our anchor."
"Hi, Russ."
(boy) Out of the way.
Quit shoving!
Editorial!
"Yes, the Patman does it again."
"What's it feel like to be a loser, Egg-wad?"
There's no justice!
"Yes, I got anchor!"
Yes!
I got the Fashion Forecast.
Taste finally arrives at Sweet Valley High.
(girl) I know.
She's gonna be great.
"(boy) Oh, well..."
*(boy #2)* OK...
"So, Russ, looks like we'll be working some long hours together."
It'll be my pleasure.
"Well, that's a start."
Jessica and Lila got on and I didn't?
There must be some mistake.
Maybe you should talk to Mr. Collins.
"OK, news team, come get your story assignments."
Go on.
I will.
Go get your assignment.
I'll be fine.
"You did an exceptional job, Jessica."
Go!
Father.
"Canglong, are you an animal?"
Lingerh.
Mother.
Shut up.
"If I get angry,"
I'll eat up all your hearts.
Canglong.
We're guests here.
How could you be so rude to Miss Zhong?
Down.
Wake up.
Where are we?
Caught by the Yellow Robe Man and brought here.
Right.
"You've sucked up the Red Python's blood, and you're endowed with ""Red Dragon Soul""."
Climb up and look around.
"Maybe you can break the top, and we can escape."
I'll try.
The cover is very strong.
I can't break it.
Senior.
Is Tuan Zhengchun coming for his children?
Of course.
I've brought them here... as bait for Tuan Zhengchun.
Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."
No one can fight it.
Not even the Yi Yang Finger... can tackle it.
We can get rid of his whole family.
Only then I'd have vent my anger.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
But I love Kishan.
Then get ready for the ruin.
I agree.
Welcome!
Kishan!
Father has come here.
And Jimmy has done this.
"Yes, I heard."
- God!
Support my love.
It has to reveal one day.
"So, let it reveal today."

My son wishes that I would just stay sick.
"I don't scold him, I don't go drinking..."
How long has it been hurting?
Yes?
- Just... since the accident.
"- No, I don't mean that."
Haven't you had abdominal pain?
It must've been quite severe.
Listen carefully to what I tell you.
I already told your husband.
"Wait a minute, wait!"
Time out!
Wait!
I didn't mean to hit you.
Nice job.
You're the best human sandbag.
Excuse me!
"Sorry, but could you do me a favor?"
- Me?
- Yes.
"If he asks who you are,"
-just tell him you're someone I know.
-Yes...
Yes... hello?
I am...
What is... your name?
"Mi-ryung, Song Mi-ryung."
"Well, I'm an acquaintance of Song Mi-ryung."
And next?
I want to break up with him.
Do you remember what he looked like?
About 35.
Dark.
Nice-looking.
"Uh, thanks."
Thanks very much.
A boat would be too slow.
Check out the airlines.
Right.
One of them has a booking for Gus Priamos.
Find the person who sold him the ticket and make an identification.
See that your men have pictures with them.
We've got no pictures of Priamos.
You've got pictures of Kimble.
( dramatic theme playing )
I keep thinking about it.
Keeps coming up in my throat.
"Ah, you think too much."
"If Gerard wasn't there, where is he?"
Someplace.
What do you care?
"He's going to get a message from the captain, he's gonna come running like crazy."
And he's going to be late.
And you're on your way to Greece.
You're on your way to Greece.
Yeah.
But he thinks it's you.
"Hey, Johnny."
We're here.
"You know what to do, Gus."
You betcha.
( tense theme playing )
Uh... pink.
"Yes, I have a pink sari. ..."
"But, it has big flowers."
The big flowers will look very nice.
Now go!
Your daughter is very innocent.
Your dream has come true.
"Miss, your airman has come!"
"Renu, are you all right?"
What's happening?
"- Nothing, sir."
Where is Renu?
- She is inside the house.
"I am aware of that but, where is she?"
- She's inside the house.
Are you all right?!
"- Yes, sir."
"Aunty, give me my clothes."
It's getting late.
Suraj will be here soon.
I have arrived.
I thought that it was aunty.
Get out from my room!
Come out.
There's no need to feel shy.
Our wedding is also fixed.
Shameless man!
Impertinent!
Are you going or....
Get dressed quickly.
We are getting late for the function.
Give me something to wear.
Because you are the future of Egypt
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!
He will be safe with me
"He is Egypt, that is all I've ever lived for!"
And now he must live for you!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
ls Marc Antony alive?
"I do not know, my Queen"
But you have to flee the city
Octavius' army will be here within the hour!
No!
I will wait for my king
Your Majesty... there are documents that have to be destroyed...
Go!
Go!
Have you seen Caesarian?
Where is he?
Have you seen the child?
Where's the child?
Out of my way!
What're you doing here?
Your Queen needs you on guard!
Where's the boy?
"He's not here, by the blessings of lsis"
Not here?
What do you mean?
"It doesn't matter, he's safe"
"Listen to me, Mardian"
Caesarian is in grave danger
That's not it!
Don't you know me?
In that extremely degraded place!
Ah!
I don't know.
I feel leery!
I feel leery!
Hey!
Doesn't my body smell?
Huh?
"Hey, Baek Go Dong!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Try to smell it."
"Ah, hyung-nim!"
Speed up!
I have to go quickly and wash it off.
Sauna!
Sauna!
You can't go home right now.
Why?
Tae Ik hyung-nim
left for the practice room.
He kept saying he won't let you go if you are late.
Seriously!
I said speed up!
"Anyway, the one that came out best..."
I think is this one.
What do you want?
I don't expect anything big.
The commercial that Won Kang Kwi is shooting again.
"If you hand it over to me, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;I'll keep my mouth shut."
Just for a commercial you go through all this trouble?
"At a cheap motel, with a guy partner..."
Isn't the combination extreme for a Hallyu star like Won Kang Hwi?
"-No, your ideas are always this unoriginal and half-baked."
-[scoffs]
"Well, you know what?"
I wasn't thinking of going with that idea anyway.
I was thinking that we should just--
"-Haunt people and, while they're distracted, just steal their money?"
-Stop it!
"Yes, let's just do that."
"-Sweet, high five!"
-Whoa!
[groans]
Ow!
"All right, Old Man Blumpkin's house."
"-Yeah, but be easy on the old guy, okay?"
You know he's got that heart condition.
[gun cocks]
-What are you two turds doing in my house?
-Old Man Blumpkin?
-How can you see us?
Only ghosts can see other ghosts.
"-Duh, a--hole."
I just died.
-Ohh.
"-Wait, what did you just say?"
-Ohh.
"-No, the thing before that."
-Only ghosts can see other ghosts?
-But then... that means...
-You don't remember... do you?
"Last week, when you were driving..."
-No.
-There was an accident.
Radha's alliance is fixed with Jimmy!
There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.
- I understood.
And I also want to see one more relative.
"Mr. Jackie, don't drink so much."
For God's sake.
Please.
Mr. Bharat?
You?!
"Come... come, sit, Mr. Bharat!"
Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
Fuck Prince.

"Do you watch ""The Voice?"" He really, like, is into, I think he might give just the right amount."
"Like, not Sting give, but--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I would do what I had to do to meet that cat.
That white cat he holds on that show.
BETH HOYT:
That's what he's saying.
What?
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.
[ Finch ]
She reads the articles.
[ Boys Moaning ]
Is she ?
She's goin' downstairs.
[ Moaning ]
"- Oh, my God !"
"- Jackpot, baby !"
- Can you believe this ?
"- Nadia, I would have never known."
I have an announcement that I would like to make.
There is a gorgeous woman... masturbating on my bed !
- [ Finch ]
"Thank you, Nadia !"
"- If you ever had a chance with Nadia, this is it."
- [ Scoffs ]
"What am I supposed to do, Kev ?"
- Seduce her.
Wha-- What the hell would I say ?
Go over there and ask her if she needs an extra hand.
"- That's stupid, Kev."
I can't-- - That's not stupid !
You're stupid if you don't go !
Come on !
Get over there !
"- Get goin', man."
She's prime.
- Get out of here !
- She's waitin' for you.
"- Okay, all right."
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.
Not everyone can become Jackie Chan.
Heard from somewhere that he fell unconscious five times and has metal parts all over his body.
My goal is to fall unconscious six times and be a Robocop!
Ouch!
That really hurts!
A Robocop!
You're Robocop!
"Dad, Dal-rae's killing your son!"

Yes.

Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:
April.
AB:
April what?
Audience:
17th.
I believe that was a Sunday.
"Can you confirm, Chris?"
Chris Anderson:
Yes.
AB:
- Showing them a TV.
This is not done.
- That's how I do it.
I sold all TV's.
Only one or two are left.
What are you doing?
Do you intend to loot?
How can they loot like that?
What do you mean by threatening me with a gun?
Keeping a gun on the temple means. . .
Gun?. . .
Gun ! . . .
Neelambar!
You were making a bill and demanding money?
I'll pay you !
Move it. . . move it both sides.
What are you doing?
- Kick him.
"Neelambar, call the police."
Call the police!
What happened?
- Mr. Gorpade has come.
"Mr. Gorpade, they were stealing our TV's and Videos."
Who?
Where?
- Over there.
You always give wrong direction.
- Thieves?
"Constable, arrest them."
Beat them up.
What happened?
"For the first time, while shopping with you, I made an arrest."
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
"Ladies, five minutes."
Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
"Work out, plenty of rest."
"You know, eat your green vegetables."
Thas what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on.
Go.
Keep it steady.
Is a web.
"Go, Spidey, go!"
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
"I mean, no."
Hey.
Hey.
"Hey, chief."
"You park there, I'm towing it."
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
Can I help you?
"Yeah, I've come to see the show."
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
How... you know this better.
At present he's celebrating festival at Khandala...
"Your father, Pasha."
Santo!
Raghu!
Kali!
Badal!
God!
Who are you trying to threaten by firing in the air?
Those days of threatening and firing have gone.
Now I'm only a retired IG.
- Uncle!
- Yes.
Uma sent this photo for you.
Wow!
Dear father!
Your darling daughter Radha!
Did you see?
This time my daughter left me... ...for her college youth festival.
"Thank God, your darling sister is here."
"Sandhya, it's right that Jamna is my sister."
But reason her widows are not supposed to have long tongue.
Even I don't like it.
But she's a widow.
"So, I can't even say anything to her."
"Shanti, where's Jamna?"
Sitting in the backyard.
Reading a holy book.
Mother!
Aunt is calling you.
"You go, my son."
I'm coming.
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
When daddy has put the incense in here.
[bell rings]
That's it.
"Good morning, mummy. boy speaking native language:"
"Good morning, mummy. man speaking native language:"
"Good, now put the incense out."
Good. boy speaking native language:
All done.
I want some water.
[man speaking native language]
[woman laughs]
[man coughs]
man:
Today we're gonna videotape Sasha doing his first ever shave.
Sasha:
"Oh, boy. man:"
Sasha is how old now?
Sasha:
Uh...15. man:
All right.
Sasha:
15. man:
The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha:
Yes. man:
So that it'll warm up your face and moisturize your skin.
"Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?"
Sasha:
It's always been hot. man:
All right.
Yes.
"Whatever you say there, dude."
What the f did I tell you?
The bandaid on the back of your neck?
The briefcase.
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
MALE SPEAKER:
"Oh, jeez."
Just another day at the office.
-I told you Porno Pictionary was the way to go.
"-Hey, why don't we kick it up a notch and make this into a swingers party?"
"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
-I choose Nancy.
-What?
-That little filly.
-What are you talking about?
-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.

- Is Güney Bey here?
- No.
- Tell me when he is.
"- Yes, sir."
Has the vendor come?
"You bought some hair conditioner, too?"
"Okay okay, good."
I took my time when those two appointments were canceled.
Maybe I shouldn't come to the shop today if there's no customers.
"I'm home, yes."
You call me if you need me.
"Okay dear, kolay gelsin."
Why don't you take a break.
- Your coffee is getting cold.
"- I'm coming, abla."
There's a lot of ironing to do as well.
"We'll get all done, abla."
Don't worry.
"What is wrong, abla?"
- He's dead.
- Who?
"Which one, the one with the picture?"
Who is he?
Abla?
Someone you know?
"""Son of deceased Ibrahim and Hatice Gencerel..."""
"""... beloved father of Arda and Tuba..."""
"""... husband of Sevgi Gencerel."""
His funeral will be on this afternoon.
A relative?
"Abla, are you okay?"
To the funeral?
But I never had the proof.
"What are you talking about, Marla?"
"Your husband, Barry.... my ex-husband, Barry..."
"Denise, Barry's a selfish bastard."
What?
No!
"No, he's not."
No.
Look.
-Oh my god.
-Mm-hm
This is not happening.
He fooled me too.
There were always signs.
What signs?
Think about it!
Haven't you ever been stuck out in the cold with him?
"I got pneumonia once, but..."
You got lucky.
I lost a finger.
Frostbite.
Think about your last birthday.
Happy Birthday to you!
Mmm!
It's spongy.
Selfish bastards can't participate in the celebration of others.
It's been documented.
No!
It's not true!
He loves people.
He was so close to his brother and sister.
Selfish bastards recreate the past for personal gain.
- Let's break up.
"-Why, Sook-hyun?"
-We've made it this far.
Just...
- This card is maxed out.
Find a better woman.
Can you put these back on the shelves?
Sook-hyun!
There's no better woman for me.
Don't do this...
Cut it out and get lost!
I'm sorry
Attention please.

Will you go in and see Mom?
Don't worry.
They said she's fine.
SMS from Lee Jin Woo
Meet me at the Sky Lounge today.
"Hello, Hello."
"Jin-woo, if you're off duty, then act like it."
Forget this and go start a fire in your girlfriend's heart
Okay?
See you.
"Hey, be careful!"
Where is it?
Please let me find it.
The gap in performance at elementary schools is rising.
"Now, today's weather forecast."
"Due to the high atmospheric pressure from the southwest, the heat wave..."
And that's fine.
I understand that.
Bobby:
Dad's fault.
Cathy:
"If it's because you're scared to go upstairs by yourself or downstairs by yourself, just tell me that."
Bobby:
I will.
Sometimes... [speaking indistinctly]
And stop videotaping!
Cathy:
Bobby... man:
I was gonna give you a camera too.
Cathy:
"We're gonna do a project-- a family project, okay?"
Can we all agree to do the family project?
"If not, then we can't do it. man:"
Do you want a camera?
Cathy:
Okay?
Bobby:
What? man:
Do you want a camera to videotape me?
Bobby:
Mm-hmm.
Cathy:
It's gonna be a family project.
"I need to have a happy boy today, okay? man:"
You have to be happy if you have the video camera.
Bobby:
Why? man:
Because it's a happy film.
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...
Don't die!
I'll behave from now on.
Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.
1 1 O'clock.
And that guy must still be snoring in bed.
"Get up, it's morning. . . . ."
"Get up, it's morning."
"You have come, that means it's morning."
Don't recite poetry.
"Get up, you have a meeting at 1 1."
Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.
- Wear them quickly.
God !
"Go take a bath quickly, the water will go."
Why take a bath everyday?
"It's a waste of time, water, soap."
My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.
Ay!
Ay! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;All you needed to do was open your mouth.
I can't lie.
Smart ass!
What should we eat?
Uh...
How about ribs?
I like rib patties.
That is slightly...
Then do you want to have sushi?
I know a great place.
"Their fried fish is also good. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;And, they also have Yeongdeok snow crab."
"Even that... for the time being, no..."
Then what do you want to eat?
What about pizza?
Pizza?
We haven't had it lately.
"Oh, Pizza sounds great."
Really?
Then where should we go?
How about Marco's?
Their pizza is good!
That place is expensive.
Let's go where we always go.
Ah!
The pizzeria at the crossroad?
Hey!
There is no place to sit there.
"Baek Go Dong, let's go somewhere else."
Somewhere else!
Forget it.
Go there!
It's a great site.
"Earthquake's got a thing on there, oh my god."
"Oh, I know, I always go."
"That's another thing too, there's like, there like a top link on their US business site, so that the, like, uh, the top thing that's come out."
Visited.
Yeah.
"Let's say, right now."
Have you ever been to
California?

There was one last night too.
"It's So it, so it just ended?"
It just happened right now?
Yeah.
"Just now. ,, , What part of California do you live in?"
Los Angeles What?
"Oh, okay."
"Oh yeah, I see where it came from."
I'm just looking at the epicenter.
Yup.
"Or we can do it online, god, geez."
"Yeah, we're coming to"
"California in a, a few weeks here."
"We're in the middle of a heat wave right now and we had an earthquake last night and, and earthquake today."
And I'm just hoping that this earthquake is not a harbinger of a big one.
"Oh, oh."
I hope not.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, the, the, yeah."
Cuz that's.
A big earthquake.
Professor.
Professor.
- So you're finally here.
So what have you decided about marrying Tanya?
"Professor, I want to make a request."
Request.
Type the year!
Any year!
"- Fortune town, 1975."
Is that your birth year?
My parents weren't even married.
What's the connection between marriage and birth?
"City, Mumbai."
I mean then it was Bombay.
Don't touch anything.
- No.
Especially this red button.
"If you touch it, the machine will switch to flying mode."
Get it.
- Yes!
"Remember, don't touch anything."
Careful.
"Oh my, God."
I said don't touch the red button.
Try to stop it now.
"Try to switch it off, Bunty."
Press the blue button.
Bunty.
"Bunty, stop, stop,"
At least hear how you've to come back.
At least hear how you've to come back.
Forget Bunty.
"Uh, it's, uh..."
Wait a minute.

And what a day it is. man:
It's the best day ever.

You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
"Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest."
"Often during this time of the day,"
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.

Good morning.

Thank you， boss
Where's he?
Landal， where have you been?
The Seven-Eleven， to buy shampoo
Why are you wet through?
I was pouring at Seven-Eleven
Why's your head covered with suds?
I had a shampoo because it's wet
This is the detergent， not the shampoo
I took the wrong thing.
I must go back and change it
Who are you looking for?

You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;

Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.

Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.
None
Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
- ln demonology -
- Hey so that you could make it - [ Moans ]
"- - You're really makin' it --** - Hon, can you tell Vic to come on down for supper ?"
- [ Screams ]
Holy shit !
- Shh.
You know there's no lock on your door ? - -- [ Humming ] - [ Moaning ]
-- [ Continues ]
Ohh !
I'm coming !
I'm coming !
-- [ Humming ]
"- Oh, Jim !"
- Dad.
"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."
You see ?
It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
Yes
CL:
It's scary.
I think it's scary.
CL:
I'm a little nervous about how it will go in front of huge numbers of audience.
CL:
I don't know how I will act when the cameras are turned on.
I have no idea.
I am so nervous that I hardly sleep at night anymore.
KL:
There are still some steps...
D:
A waltz by Camilla and Kristjan
D:
Thank you.
D:
Well Dermot.
DC:
"If you had the nerves, I couldn't see it."
"To be a premiere dance, this is perhaps one of the best I've seen through seven seasons."
DC:
It was elegant.
You have a very nice position.
"And if I should criticize anything the first night, it is to breathe more and get the head a bit more....."
CL:
I didn't breathe at all
DC:
Think about it to next week.
You have to dance and breathe.
"It was a very, very good start."
D:
You go to the hospital everyday?
"So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?"
"Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two."
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
"Hey, what are you saying..."
No?
What no
"We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!"
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!
How do you read this?
How much is it?
"Yes, what does it mean?"
How much is this?
Correct.
"Hey guys, let's eat a snack."
What is this?
"Hey, what's the use in knowing that?"
The No Ri that we love
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
"No Ri, happy birthday!"
"Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged."
Thank you.
"Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me."
Okay.
"If there's something you don't know, always call me."
"You know my phone number, right?"
"Yes, I will."
"No Ri, get healed quickly."
"Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem."
"No Ri,"
[woman speaking native language]
[Masood speaking native language] woman:
"Here I am by myself, because my husband is a half a world away, going to work, fighting for us."
What shirt should I wear?
Which one do you think will Phil like better?
Hmm?
Which one do you think?
That one?
Is that one the best?
Masood:
Here is the market in the old city.
"Most foreigners think that it is dangerous to walk around the streets of Kabul, but as you can see, there is no danger... for us, anyway."
woman:
Waiting game.
Waiting game.
[birds chirping]
Masood:
So this is a street that's normally selling birds like this.
They call them lovebirds because they are always kissing each other.
Sharon:
Oh.
Where are you?
Ooh.
Phil:
"Hi, Sharon."
Sharon:
Hi!
Phil:
Hi.
Sharon:
How's it goin'?
Can you see me?
"So, it starts with level one, holding hands."
"Two, arms around waist."
"Three, good night kiss."
"Four, kiss lasting over three minutes without breath."
"- Five, open mouth kissing."
"- Number six, tongues."
"Oh, my God."
"Seven, upper body fondling outdoors."
Eight...
"Oh, my God."
I've gone all jelloid.
- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
Why do you want to know my bra size?
Huh?
- I never knew Su-eun was so dirty-minded.
- Get away from me!
Happy birthday to you!
"Happy birthday dear Su-eun, Happy birthday to you."
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!
"-Okay, in one shot!"
- One shot!
One shot!
One shot!
Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!
My present?
You want more?
"My present, my birthday present!"
You think I'm still a kid?
These are really popular these days.
Then you wear it.
We spent all day looking for this.
Just keep it.
"Quiet, both of you!"
You're so loud I can't understand anything.
Let me speak too.
What's his problem?
"Sister-in-law, I'll give you a better present than this."
How about a blind date?
Really?
With who?
"Well, in my station, there's..."
"No, No firemen."
Letter to Santa.
"""Dear Santa, I have been SO good this year..."""
You know what?
No!
"No, I am not listening to any more of this!"
You're just jealous!
Long term exposure has compromised your ability to judge.
There is no way I am married to a selfish bastard!
(SMACK!)
"Focus, Denise!"
Think about all that you have sacrificed.
How could I be so stupid?
"Don't go there, Denise!"
You deserve so much more.
I do?
"Denise, you deserve oral sex."
But... he said that was...
Impossible.
That it's just...
A scam.
Can't he get help?
No.
It's terminal.
"If he were a loser or even a prick, maybe..."
NOOO!
I hate G-d!
I hate Christmas!
Pull yourself together!
Denise!
NOOOOO!!!
Your life is in danger.
Earthquake!
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.

SPEAKER 2:
I generally don't go out at night by myself.
They're the goons who wants you...

They move on by helicopters.
By swear!
I see.
Father were also talking something like this.
My Radha!
"Sister-in-law, why are you scared?"
Brother Shreekant has personally gone to look for her.
He'll arrest that rogue in no time.
Jamna!
Bring my Radha back.
That's it.
My Radha...
"Yes, sister-in-law."
She'll definitely come back.
She'll definitely come back.
But God...
In which condition?
I just can't think over it.
That young boy and young girl...
And she'll be all alone.
And that too in a jungle!
Wonder what he must be doing with her.
And Radha is so innocent.
She doesn't know anything about this world.
She's so innocent.
- What will happen with her?
- Aunt!
He studies to be a journo.
His old man is a journo.
What's the fucking difference?
You let one of them get in with us.
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--
I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."
You started this firm.
"I'm speaking for all the boys, we got the biggest ruck... ...of our lives coming up and your brother's too much of a bottle job to lead us."
The GSE is Pete's firm.
All right?
He calls the shots.
Yeah?
"Well, fuck the lot of you."
GSE?
Get out of the fucking way!
Move!
Get yourself cleaned up.

"C'mon, thish babydoll needs her daddy, see?"
"Sure, when I'M paying!"
"How 'bout you pay, huh?"
Yungdal... look...
No changing the subject.
This has got to stop.
Hush!
I shwear that girl looks like Her Grace.
Huh?
Is Sulhi in?
"I really AM drunk, I'm seeing things."
She looks just like Dong Yi in the old days.
"Um, I think it's her."
Huh?
It IS her.
But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."
Are you mental?!
James:
The LHC master power's down there.
"It's shielded, we can shut it off."
Matt:
This is insane...
Connor:
"Right, we'll go down and shut it off."
Then we'll work out what to do there.
Matt:
"No, but we can't..."
Amy (Interrupts):
Come on!
Kate:
Push something!
(Buttons being pushed) (Machines stop)
(Group breathes heavily)
(Backup power starts)
Matt:
So that's it?!
The worlds largest machine has an on/off switch?
Kate:
What is your problem?!
James:
"Look, this is just a relay."
There's six of them.
If one of them trips the others go off automatically.
Amy:
I hope somebody noticed that.
Connor:
There's nobody around to notice it.
No one will be in until tomorrow.
"All Rio has to do is get his victim safely to shore, grab the flag, and he wins."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Make sure not to let my head go under in case he went under."
I wanted to see where he was at all times.
Stay calm.
I'm here to rescue you.
You're going to be okay.
I got you.
"Just try to kick with me, all right?"
I'm swimming for the finish line.
That's when I see Paul.
Paul:
"I get to the bridge, I look out in the lake,"
I see two swamped canoes and some guy in the middle of the lake splashing around.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" We're almost there, okay?"
Paul:
Calm!
Stay calm!
Everything's coming back to me from my Life Saving merit badge.
Get the person calm in the water before you approach him.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" I got him to the shore."
I pulled him out of the water.
You okay?
"All right, you'll be all right, man."
Teenager:
"Hey, man, you get the flag."
Teenager #14:
Outstanding...
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #14: ...brother!
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
Is nice.
I get to see you every day now.
"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was... ...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
Phil:
Yeah.
"You did get all dressed up, didn't you?"
Sharon:
Yes.
Of course.
It's our date night.
[children chattering]
Masood:
"Afghanistan comes-- the name of my country comes with the conflict, war, suicide attack, and all the negative points that we--I mean hear and listen in the news."
But there is another side of Afghanistan that you don't normally see.
These girls make me feel optimistic about the future of my country.
Phil:
I love you.
Sharon:
I love you too.
Stay safe.
Phil:
"I will, honey."
"You too, okay?"
Sharon:
Okay.
Phil:
Bye.
Sharon:
Bye.

It's not easy to explain motivation.
Can I do something to reunite Korea?
It looks impossible.
It looks out of my hands.

"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Aah!
[romantic music continues] man:
"Well, so here's the deal."
"Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, ""No."""
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.
woman:
"Okay, let me say that it is meant for women to kneel down."
"For example, a woman is supposed to kneel down for a man. man:"
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to show us how you do it? woman:
Yes. man:
"So you greet Moses, like, traditionally."
[Moses speaking native language]
man:
Wow.
Wow.
"Moses, how do you feel about it?"
Let me go!
Please!
More compresses.
Is he stable?
It looks like he's responding.
"The doctor told me not to call the police, but to keep you here for the moment."
I'm better now.
"I need some coffee, please."
"One, two, three..."
"One, two, three..."
Third discharge.
"One, two, three..."
He's gone.
Doctor!
Mom?
"No, I was awake."
"Yes, I know I said we'd take a plane this week but..."
Pablo can't talk.
He's... asleep.
"Mom, hold on."
Listen.
I want to read you something.
"""Manuel Leonardi was a writer and journalist."
He wrote stories.
His wife Amalia... studied fine art but quit her studies when she became pregnant with her first child.
The last thing Amalia painted was her daughter's bedroom.
"She painted it blue with colored fish."""
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I was so freaked out.
"(Finebros) So, do you know what that game was?"
No.
Skinny?
Slim?
"I mean, it said ""Slender"" in the front."
"- ""Slender."""
"- ""Slender."""
"""Slender."""
(Finebros) And how do you know about this game?
- I heard it on YouTube.
- On the Internet.
"Someone was, like, tweeting about it."
"(Finebros) So, have you ever played the game before?"
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
(giggles)
- No.
- No.
"No, and I resisted playing it till this day."
- Yeah.
- It's my third time playing it.
I have played it on my phone once and didn't sleep for two days.
(Finebros) And what is the purpose of the game?
To scare you.
To scare the living (bleep) out of you.
I don't know.
You told me to find a piece of paper.
"To find the eight pages, which I failed miserably."
(chuckles) (Finebros) And how did it make you feel when you were playing?
Understand?
Yes
Boss， here you are
Not me， he's inside
Boss， Tina's here.
What do you want?
Take off everything
Okay
Then you take off everything to go to bed
You really are impatient
I'll go down and get Lisa to have a look
Her sister's back
I win， I win
What has become of you?
Where's your brother?
Not yet back
The car's outside and you said he' not back
Bastard!
Robert
Brother-in-law， you...
Go back and eat shit!
And you eat papayas?
You're special
You really are macho
Sure， get busy
"Sister, hurry up"
You can't do it asleep
Don't waste it
"Sister, hurry up"
Hurry up
Open up
Brother-in-law， I know you're inside.
I said stay there.
You hear me?
Where's my mommy?
"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.
I can't fucking do it!
Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?
- You're a liar.
She's not coming back.
- I promise she is.
I'm scared.
Don't leave me here alone.
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Stop, please!"
Where are you?
I don't want to see her die again!
"Please, I beg you."
Help me.
Please.
This is yours.
"January 11, 1974."
There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."
Can't recall the things you've done.
"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.
"Sir, I came for visit."
"Hi Dal-rae, welcome!"
"Hey, what's up?"
This is Ji-hwan's dad.
"I'm MOON Young-hoon, Ji-hwan's classmate."
"Ah, so you're Young-hoon..."
"Sir, bought some soju and squid for you."
How many?
The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.
Yes.
Do you drink?

Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?
"Wh, what are you!"
I'm Atom.
Stop it!

Be glad to take a message.
I'd like to talk to him.
"It's about this fellow, uh, Kimble."

"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?

"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.

Why shoot us?
Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
"I got it, i got it!"
Over here!
Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."

So let me tell you what cutting edge astronomy looked like not so long ago.
It looked like this.
"First of all, that's just a sketch."
"Somebody stood at a telescope from night after night, incidentally wearing a top hat, sketching what they could see."
"And secondly, they're looking at a single object."
"In this case, it's what was known as a spiral nebula."
An island universe.
"Ah, semi-retired."
"You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you?"
Just want to be honest.
No secrets.
Ok.
Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck.
Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood?
"That, and, uh..."
This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.
Convenient.
Are you worried I'm a supernatural being?
One can never be...
Too careful.
"Oh, um, hey, um."
Sorry.
"Oh, uh, I'm gonna go."
"Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure."
"Elena, I am..."
I'm sorry.
"Please, it... it's ok."
"Ah, it's not ok, Elena."
"I mean, this is not even my place."
It's... it's your place.
It's Jenna's place.
It's your family...
It's your family's place.

You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?

Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.

Then you take off everything to go to bed with her

"Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well."
"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"

He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.
Rajesh!
- Now you can keep your gal with you!
"Rajesh, seema is not what you think of her!"
But how come that flower string was with you?
Forget that flower string!
"Believe me, Rajesh! seema is sacred like the Ganges!"
"Marry her, Rajesh!"
Marry her! only you can keep her happy!
And look..
I have fixed your alliance!
"lf you didn""t marry her, then her family""s image will be tarnished!"
"Look, Rajesh!"
I beg you!
I plead with you!
You have done so many favours on me!
Do one more favour on me!
"Marry seema, Rajesh!"
Marry seema!
Are you drinking poison? - seema!
Look here!
"Look here, sister-in-law!"
"Look who is the groom! shekhar! seema, I had told you that love is very strong!"
It can face any big storm! so what?
"I don""t accept this wedding!"
"This is not a wedding! lts betrayal! lt""s cheating!"
"I didn""t expect this joke from you!"
"This is not a joke! lts true, Mrs. Dinanath!"
Actually I was going to marry her.
"But when I found out about shekhar and seema""s love.. ..l fulfilled my duty!"
This is not duty!
This is betrayal!

"What's the scoop, Mr. Collins?"
The school's installing a new in-class video system.
"As of next week, Oracle goes broadcast."
Cool.
Lame.
What a great opportunity.
I'm signing up now.
Hello.
Can I help you?
You already have.

"In other words, none of the comforts of life whatsoever."

"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."

-Why would I not?
-Not gay!
-What?
-Not gay!
-What are you doing?
-Looking at gay porn.
"-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay."
"-Anthony, you can't be so racist."
Just because his culture is different it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.
-He was looking at gay porn.
-And who doesn't from time to time?
-True.

I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.

"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."

Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."

Your room is with your brother.

I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.

"For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries,"

"By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?"
"If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand."
"Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first."
"What year was it, first of all?"
That's why I pick a gentleman first.

You can like having sex with yourself and not like having sex with a partner.
Joy:
Yeah.

Wait.
"Now, you're describing something that's-"

You didn't answer the question.
Do you like to have sex with yourself?

"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?

This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?

"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?

Yes.

So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."
Good bye.
Now we'll be moving on from San Francisco to Las Vegas to film.
This is Las Vegas.
The weather is really nice.
It's warm.
Las Vegas!
It's warm.
"Weather is good, scenery is good."
I feel good.
"""Seoul, Tokyo N New York City"""
Everyone is making bets going around.
Las Vegas!
"Mira!&amp;gt; Okay , we will talk later."

"Not at all girl, don't be happy right away."
Where are you calling from?
"Cut it off, I can't talk for long."
"Ayse, I need Yaman's phone number, could you find it?"
"Just a minute I have it registered on my phone, I have to search it."
Are you OK?
Did you get my letter?
Did you write a letter?
"No, I didn't get anything."
"Come on, I really don't have time."
"We will talk with you later, give me that phone number."
"Okay , I'm spelling it."
"Ah man, Mert!"
I brought you lucky chestnuts instead of lucky rice.(kind of believe that -special rice blessed with prayers brings luck
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"For breakfast at midnight,"
To fall in love with strangers.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
Yeah!
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely at the same time,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when,"
"We forget about the deadlines,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if,"
You keep me next to you.
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright,"
"If we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're, twenty-two, twenty-two!"
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"This place is too crowded,"
Too many cool kids.
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway?
Ew).
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"We ditch the whole scene,"
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping.
Yeah!
And transformation magic
"Overrated, right?"
I needed something really unique
Just then
I saw a strange woman
One more time?
She never smiled
Like she had a dark secret
I can't really explain it
So
I followed that mysterious woman
It felt so strange
How should I put it?
Like a ghost was about to pop out of a wardrobe
Just then
I had an awesome idea!
Exorcist magician
Rattle
Wardrobe ghost

"On top of that, we have good seats, I think"
"I'm not a soccer fan, but, really, I'm happy"
"Also, I must say it's a beautiful game"
"A nice game, no, really, I like it"
"I feel good seeing him happy, it pleases me, it's..."
Really...
Thank you!!!
"Oh, you're not gonna put make-up on, again?"
"Look, Loulou, my lipstick is all gone"
What?
Miss Universe!
Miss Universe...
"Careful, there, oh!"
"Stop it, Loulou, you're being silly"
"Oh, come on!"
"But, look, you're an idiot!"
Careful!
"Stop it, Loulou, it's really not funny!"
"I know it's not funny, can't do anyhting about it, it's the car that does that all the time"
"Stop it, I'm telling you!"
"Oh, come on, breathe!"
"Cind-who? fuck'n ""rella""?"
Jesus!
Who the hell's naming these kids?
Goddamn my head.
So it turned into a yearly ritual.
Is that a crime?
Yes.
"OK I have a huge family, and yes OK I may have snuck into their homes after dark - but only because I didn't want to wake them."
What?
I told you - I'm not one to skimp on the Gandja..
Ahhh... it's called MUNCHlEEEES.
Ya - all I did was eat a few cookies and maybe grab a glass of milk?
And are you forgetting I DlD leave them a few gifts?..
So what?
What's the difference if I do the Return or someone else does the return for me?
They still get to exchange it for something they want.
Oh come-on.
I'm sure a toddler can find something cool from Joe's Big-Boy Shop.
What?
No fuck'n way!
You can't pin that on me!
I have absolutely nothing to do with that kid Jesus.
I want a lawyer.
"Yo Guys, it is Keralis, I am here just to tell ya that I am livestreaming."

There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
"Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order."
"Harmattan, Burton &amp;amp; Smith."
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
"Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas... ...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
You have to make it in time.
"Peter, you're a nice guy."
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
"Hey, what, are you stupid?"
Whoa!
He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
"Hey, you guys."
No playing in the streets.
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
See you.
"Way to go, Spidey!"
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
"Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing."
"But to me, is serious."
"Is serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
You're fired.
Why don't you just enjoy being 14?
Enjoy being 14?
How twisted is that?
"And if home isn't mental enough,"
"I have to spend all day at this loony bin, or as some people call it, school."
Sometimes I think Jas and I are the only normal people here.
There's Dave the Laugh.
- Why do they even call him that?
"- Okay, now get this one."
Boys are such a mystery.
"- Yeah, how was that?"
"- Oi, Nicolson!"
Watch it.
The Bummer Twins are the school bullies.
- Twice as mean.
- What?
Twice as mingy.
"Lindsay ""Slag"" Marling from the year above."
She really is Miss Slag of the Century.
And where did she get those bazoomas?
How did they grow that fast?
"Two minutes to lessons, children."
"Let's not start the term with a detention, Nicolson."
"Our headmistress, Slim, likes to oppress me,"
'cause I caught her once with her skirt in her knickers.
I laughed so much I nearly fainted.
"- Hey, guys!"
- Luckily I've got my Ace Gang to fill in the long hours before we get released.
- Christmas tree.
- D.J.
"Ellen, Rosie, Jas and moi."
"Now, when your hands are numb you lift them up to your bazoomas and press."
Why did you drink so much?
Come to your senses!
Good job.
Go on your way.
Aren't you going to give me some...?
- Give him something and send him away.
- Yes.
Come to your senses!
In Hyung!
In Hyung!
"Your Excellency, you're home."
He must have had an event at work.
These events are important to one's career.
The police have been busy all day due to the explosions at the harbor.
"- Father, you're home!"
- In Hyung! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Father!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Take him to his room.
"- Yes, Sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;In Hyung, wake up!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Take care of the body.
It was him that night!
Gil Dong...!
Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
"Hey, my son"
"Here you are, sir!"
We are looking for of Bulent Tiryakia!Where do we find him

Amy:
It's a particle that we're trying to make in the collider.

Connor:
"So what, you think Higgs radiation is dangerous?"
Amy:
I don't know.
I'd know if I could get it to finish!
Connor:
They wouldn't run the LHC if they thought it was a danger.
Connor:
Must be a glitch or something.
Connor:
Have you tried on the central computer system?
James:
Except... she doesn't have access to the mainframe.

It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
"In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways."
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
"See, I told you."
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.

You came?
"Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that..."
"Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?"
"Eun Jo, are you okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"

It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
"It'll all go well, I guess."
Could she have gone there for another reason?
Why do you always think aboutthe worst and ugliest possibilities?

They're people Matt!
Matt:
See?
"It feels like someone else is touching them, not your own hands, right?"
- Wow.
Freakilicious.
"- Oh, I could get used to this."
I don't think we should be doing this.
It's kind of lesbiany.
"Well, you asked me what it was like to be felt up."
"So, what's the best thing about having a boyfriend then?"
It just feels really natural.
"You know, really grown up."
And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.
The Ten Stages of Snogging.
- You're mad.
- No.
It's scientific.
- How would you know anything about it?
- Please.
- Who got 82% in Bio?
- True.
We cut out all the letters about kissing from the problem pages of every girls' magazine.

"I'll get you, Patman!"
Principal Cooper.
"Egbert, stop that horseplay and get to class."
Can I quote you on that?
"Thank you, Mr. Superintendent."
"Elizabeth, you're here late."
Just doing some fact-checking for my audition tape.
"Well, I know you'll do a great job."
"You asked for it, Patman."
(hissing)
"(Manny) Hey, Bruce, wait up."
Want to get something to eat?
(Bruce) Great idea.
"So, why do you want to get involved with this Oracle show, anyway?"
"I want to do the editorials, share my opinions."
I feel like owe it to these simpletons to tell them how to think.
"Hey, you're the man."
Of course.
What about the audition tape?
Done deal.
Made a call.
I'm bringing in the best director money can buy.
(coughs)
"Good morning, Sweet Valley High."
"Today's top story... 3, 2..."
*♪ I've got some news for you*
*♪ I am the one you need...*
Missing school fund discovered.
After a recent probe into the school department's budget...
Go again.
"OK, take 14! *♪ I've got the perfect story* missing $5,000 fund..."
This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
"Oh, boy."
If she only knew how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
Parker.
Parker!
"No, no, no, stop!"
Stop!
"Parker, you're late, man."
Always late.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz."
Different.
I think he grew up fast.
"Forcedly.... - He is more mature, but he is a good person."
He tries to look harsh but in order not to be hurt... it's obvious he is the only one who is not aware...
"Yaman is a tender kid, he is merciful, he is a real man.."
"Mira, what happened , Mira, what is wrong my girl?"
"We lost hopes with you- I am not late, take it, there are exactly 1000 TL here, count it!"
Is it OK?
"Kenan's issue will be solved, right?"
Hopefully!
"Brother , what time is it?"
- Half past two.
"Brother, can I use your phone shortly."
I have to make an urgent call.
I will pay for it.
But don't let it be so long!
"- OK, give it."
"Hello?&amp;gt; Hello Mert, it's me ,Yaman."
"Hello Yaman, where are you man?"
Half an hour is left for the exam.
"I am dying from worry.-I am on my way, I am coming, I will catch it, don't worry!"
"OK, were you by Mira's side too?"
What happened to Mira?
- Okay... okay... see you!
Mert i'm saying what happened to Mira?
Yaman! &amp;gt; Where's Mira?
Inside.
Her parents are with her.
"What happened, what does she have?- I don't know, they said they would take her for operation but..."
"Why are you here mom, what's happening?"
"Sude, calm down.- Oh my God!"
Again everything comes from you.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."
"Life, a day at a time, my love."
"Life, a day at a time, don't know."
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"I want to reach the greatest mountain, climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."

I'm taking pictures right now.
All the passersby's look incredible.
I want to ask so many of them
lf I could take pictures of them.
There are tons of people who look much better than we do
They look very modelesque.
I got this stain from a hotdog I ate earlier.
I guess I'm clumsy sometimes.
Thankfully I dropped it after I finished my scene.
Dae Hyun and Yong Guk are filming at Time Square and Central Park fountain.
It's like a dream.
When else would we come here to film for a MV!
"Right now, we are at Central Park."
We're here because Dae Hyun is filming.
He's filming for the MV right now.
And I'm just going there to watch him.
"At Central Park,"
The trees are all very tall and the air is very fresh.
Look over there.
It's a horse.
I've only seen it in NY I think.
Horses in NY!
You don't see that often elsewhere.
Horses on the streets.
This place sure is humongous.
The trees are enormous and the streets are wide.
It's one thing that stands out about America.
This place is so big I feel like I'm in a giant's forest.
Dae Hyun is a natural at acting.
This place is Central Park.
ln the middle of Central Park
I took a picture over there by the fountain.
Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
"But you are still a baby, you are my big baby."
"Okay then, Okay, have some rest,"
Don't ever force your leg okay?
"If you need something, shout to us."
"Okay, I am lying down.- Bravo !"
Lie down!
"Mira, did you talk to Orkun?"
"Yes mom, is the third time you're asking today."
What does he say?
- He doesn't say anything.
"He went together with his dad to the fabric in Luleburgaz, they will be staying there for some days."
"See ?, he is escaping too.&amp;gt; Mom, don't please!"
"The owner of this wants his vehicle in some days, you have to take care of the instruments order right away on morning.Beeren calling"
"OK, no problem, I will solve it tomorrow!- Good bye! &amp;gt;Good night uncle!"
Yes?
Err...
"I called to tell you I am fine, maybe you are worried about me,"
It's me Berren...- Beeren?
Aa Beren...
So good you called me..
I was thinking of you.&amp;gt; Really?
Dad?!...
Daddy... &amp;gt; My sweetheart...
"Where were you ,i was so worried , dad..- I am sorry.."
I am sorry.
I will solve everything.
"I know my dear dad, i know..."
Shall I go and talk with him too?
No.. just let him..
It means he is suffering from love.
My precious boy!
He is growing up dear Ender.
This is Dayton Way in Beverly Hills.
It's actually a very expensive town.
"I don't fit in very well, do l?"
&amp;lt;'Bear' Yong Guk's shoot begins&amp;gt;
The background saved me.
It's like L.A.
It looks fantastic.
Feels like L.A. here.
Pictures come out beautifully here.
Nature is definitely better than creating expensive sets.
No matter how costly a set is it's incomparable to nature.
okay.
Great job.
"Now, it's Zelo's turn."
The first scene is a wrap.
Zelo will now be shooting a skateboarding scene.
Zelo will film something similar to me.
Directors are so good at filming.
They're making us look very attractive.
We look as though we're Korean-Americans living in America.
I'm pretending this iPod is an iPhone.
"Woah there, wind."
None
I'm doomed.
My face is bloated.
I can feel my face all swollen.
I'm screwed.
I think that's a person over there.
Look at him wash the baby like she's laundry.
(Born in Busan) I've been to Gwang-an-ri Beach in Busan.
"Hae-woon-dae, and Song-do beach."
But I've never been to such a huge beach like this before.
"Let me see, where were you?"
Mert whispering: is that Mira?
Hello?&amp;gt;Just a second..
I will go so you can talk comfortably.
Your voice sounds interrupted...
Last night was left half.
"In fact we have to complete it. want to talk with you a bit tonight, but alone."
Okay?
Don't take Mert with you.
Only you and me.
"Look, girl!"
"I am telling you the last time clearly, I don't have anything to do with you and will never in this life."
"Did you understand it?-Ah..ah...-Ah or not, this is it!"
You will have nothing from me!
I'm telling you this from the beginning.
Do you understand me?
"Hey, talk properly !"
You're the girl that my friend loves.
"Be wise, be worthy of him!"
I am trying to explain it politely but...
"look Eylul, if you sadden that boy, I will break your heart, know this too!"
OK?
Did you get me?
You're out of your mind!- Whatever it is!
"Don't call me again, ok?"
"Or even say ""Hello"" as a human... or don't even greet me."
That's it!
Mert?!
I forgot my phone.
There is a girl at our place...
Err...
Giray's girlfriend... stupid... she calls me constantly..
"I was good, wasn't I?"
"So, it looks like a tough assignment."
Maybe you could give me a hand.
Or maybe both hands.
"OK, those who didn't get talent positions, there's room on the crew."
Talk to Patty.
I thought my tape was really great.
"Elizabeth, some people like yourself excel at the written word."
Not everyone's meant to be an on-air personality.
There's still room on the crew.
Get it together!
We've got a show to do here.
"Enid, did you get that?"
"(Todd) Man, Patty's really trippingon this director business."
"(Patty) People, please!"
Are you feeling any better?
Not really.
You're still *The Oracle's* star writer.
No one can ever take that away from you.
"I wanted it so bad, Todd, and I thought my work was really great."
"Well, what did Collins say?"
There's nothing he can do.
"If you ask me, they should change the name from *Oracle On-Air* to *Airheads On-Air.*"
Hey...
"Present company excluded, of course."
"Hi, Liz..."
Todd.
Have you met Russ?
"Yes, I have."
"Well, just wanted to say hi."
Don't forget to watch me tomorrow.
Is it wrong to hate your sister with a passion?
Will it lead Pasha on the gallows?
Yes!
Definitely he will.
Never.
Because you'll withdraw your statement.
"I spent 35 years of my life, listening to the... ...threatening from the boys like you."
"If I wish, I can kill your entire family in just five minute."
But you've a big family.
And it's in your hands to let it prosper.
It was my duty to warn you.
"So, I have."
You are lucky that my gun is under maintenance today.
Your darling daughter Radha.
"Stop, Shreekant."
I've no one in my family.
But you've many.
Think about it.
19 days are left for you to give your statement.
"Santo, let's go."
Hail Lord Krishna!
"- Lord, what a festival!"
Hail Lord Krishna!
"Uncle, we must leave for Mumbai now."
Never!
Shreekant Mathur has never got... ...afraid of anyone's threat nor will he in future.
"Thank God, Damodar isn't here today."
"Otherwise, he'd have started firing."
"Let go off it,"
I know Damodar.
He's just a police officer by profession.
"Otherwise, he's very soft hearted person."
Inspector Damodar!
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."
In- cuse?
It could be cuse.
But if this is qua?
Quis?
"Quis, good."
In- quis-a- tive.
Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
"- Good job, Christine."
"- Oh, thanks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Monti?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It just shows the inexperience.
- Helene?
- Helene is a disaster.
Helene was shocking.
"According to them, it was, like, way undercooked."
You're not the worst.
She is.
And Tali.
I mean...
Disaster.
I don't know what Tali was up to.
- No.
- Dave?
"The sand, you know, big, big technical error."
"I didn't wash the mushrooms, and I think I started too late."
"Any freakin' dish but risotto, man."
"Like, seriously."
Ryan and Tali are the two people that I want to see go home.
They're just total idiots.
"And, if they don't stay on their toes,"
I'm gonna be the one to take 'em out.
Clearly we have to take him out.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm gonna have to throw someone under the bus.
"Once one of 'em's gone, the other one's..."
"Remember, you're the best."
- How do you feel?
- Good.
"All right, guys. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Back to your stations, please."
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"- Wait, Georgia."
"- Georgia, don't go."
- Georgia!
"Georgia, what are you doing?"
You'll be late for your first day back at school.
I'm coming.
"- Georgia, Mummy wants you."
- Libby.
"Oh, flip, flipper and flipping hell!"
Excusez-moi.
C'est trés grotesque.
If you don't mind?
Oi!
Cheeky.
"Libby, stop putting Angus in the fridge."
"What do you want for breakfast, munchkin?"
Stuffed olive?
"Just because I did something so beyond the Valley of Sad City last night it doesn't give you the right, as my parents, to humiliate me further."
Today is the first day of my life as the new Georgia.
"And who is she, my little elf?"
"She's not an ""elf""."
Not a munchkin.
"She is a mature, sophisticated woman called Ms Georgia Nicolson."
"So, to celebrate the new me,"
I've decided what I want to do for my birthday party this year.
"I want a proper party in a club, with a D.J."
"You're not old enough to get into a club, never mind hire one out for a party."
"If you haven't noticed, I'm a woman now."
I wear a bra!
Bob.
Are you really trying to damage me permanently?
"There's no way that you are having a party in a club where there's drinking, and it's full of randy men."
Tommorow they're going to visit the school.
Why don't you accompany them?
(Daniela) Of course!
(Roberto) But MOM!
"(Berta) well then, it's all set."
"They are going to the hotel San Diego.IF you are going with them, then you can talk about your plans for tomorrow."
(Julia) I can do that.
And that is how Julio and I met Linda.
"Julio, you're not coming?"
"Now I remember, I can't."
Tommorow I have a soccer game and now I have to go to the gym.
"Excuse me, but I can't accompany you now."
"See you later, eh?"
Julio is a great player in the team.
He's a great athlete.
Benito Juarez Preparatory School
The following day my sister Daniela take Linda and her mom on a tour of our school.
I'm staying here.
I need to talk with the principal.
"(Linda) Oh, ok Mom."
Daniela is going to show me the school.
Perfect!
Then you can tell everything to your classmates at school.
Until I see you later.
You guys study English here right?
"Yes, but also their culture, history, and everything!"
And my school in San Antonio we study Spanish.
"The culture, and history of Mexico."
(also)
Our school have a lot in common!
"Look, there's Julio."
"Hi,"
"""Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."""
(Whistling)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Marker.
I'm afraid to open any doors around here.
"And five, six, seven, eight."
- And one.
- Liberian Girl
You came and you changed my world
"You know, Whoopie, it'd be a blast if Michael asked me to dance."
Liberian girl
- It's the most stupid thing-- - He went on Oprah's show the next day.
He told everybody I was going to make him into another Michael Jackson.
Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
Two lovers in a scene
Then she says Do you love me
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"
Who's directing this?
Maybe we could have some rolled up with some kind of string... that I could like pull him up.
Liberian girl
"I know this is kind of loose, but do you know what we're supposed to be doing?"
All I know is that Michael called me.
"I guess when he gets here, he'll let me know what we're supposed to do."
- You won.
"- Well, hey-- Is Mike here?"
"No, but I think Bubbles is here."
That's one of the Cosby kids.
Hey!
Do something about this bag...
"I packed, but I'm not sure."
"Take a look, hyung-nim."
That's alright.
I will be back real soon.
I will buy the things that I need.
"By the way, what is going on?"
Why suddenly..?
I don't know.
"Get going. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
Her phone is turned off.
Who?
Man Ok.
Stylist Jang.
"Today, she went with Tae Ik for a scheduled radio broadcast."
Radio?
Why does the stylist have to go along for radio?
Today is a live-broadcast radio.
"Last time, Tae Ik went dressed in anything and around fifty thousand malicious comments were posted."
"""A Date in the Middle of the Day""."
"Today's guest is the cool guy from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Lee Tae Ik."
We will shortly come to you with live radio.

Now you people will have to seize the gold from the ship!
But.. nobody besides Tiger can do this.
"The syndicate is broken, kaka sir! chhota sheikh, where are you going?"
Talk about the deal with me.
- How can l?
"lts syndicate""s rule that the deal.. ..should be discussed only with Tiger."
Goodbye!
"Tell me, sheikh!"
"Tiger singh, kaka sir pleaded a lot with me."
"But I didn""t pay any heed."
Anybody want some granite?
"My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house."
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
"I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict."
"And in four years, Ken has done two things."
"He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything."
Good morning.
Ken:
Good morning.
Randy:
Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken:
Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
"Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist."
"And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks."
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Madam Noh, please help me."
Please help me find my daughter quietly.
Do you know who took your daughter?
That...
You should know him as well.
The one who was killed as an insurgent.
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister!
Hong Gil Dong!
Is he still alive?
You must find her quietly for me.
She is the only daughter of the core of all power!
No one must ever know she is with him.
And everyone that is found with her...
Silence them forever.
Do you understand?
So the one who blocked the police was Hong Gil Dong?
Did the prince know this?
He told us that someone would block the police so that we can attack Choi Chul Joo.
I am sure he knew.
So the reason he gave up the explosives and stopped the ship was... ... because of Hong Gil Dong!
He has interfered with our plans yet again.
- Go and find the Councilor's daughter.
"- Yes, Madam!"
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister and the only daughter of the Second State Councilor...?
We may have found a better weapon than the explosives.
- Search the area carefully!
"- Yes, Sir."
- Search the empty houses too!
"- Yes, Sir."
Hurry!
Miss Eun Hye!
"For you, I will lay down my life!"
"Well, let me say first of all thank you for haveing my mama at the White House [oh, yeah] for the Easter, that was a beautiful event and she was so [applause] and she was so thrilled to be there."
It was great having her [applause] she's terrific
We even got Bo in there.
"Bo's there, Tony's there..."

Why do souls become restless after they die?

That's not it.
Suppose the deceased has a unfulfilled wish.
Then his son will fulfil it.

DG:
Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."
There's a place where you throw in coins and make wishes.
I made many wishes.
First wish was 'Please let B.A.P have a hit.'
Second wish was 'Please let our hair designer get married'
And the third wish was 'Please let our make-up artist get married too'
"I wasn't going to say this but, honestly, I wished for many chances"
To see many BABAz.
I think I threw in coins worth about 5 dollars.
"Well most importantly, the MV has to come out well."
We have to finish off the concerts in
Korea and Japan successfully too.
Take this energy from Central Park...
This is awesome.
None
Americans seem to know how to appreciate the small things in life.
We're so used to internet and machines.
We should stop getting used to them
And become appreciative people.
"I will try, too."
We're going to Time Square now.
Yong Guk is filming his scene at Time Square.
I've only seen it on TV.
Like in 'lnfinite Challenge' kind of TV shows. or other entertainment programs.
I've always wanted to visit.
And I get to go today.
I'm excited.
"Yo, New York City."
"We're here, in NY."
There's so much to do.
"Hogwarts kid, move."
We're here in NY.
I said move Hogwart!
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
I've seen many skateboarders since yesterday. our youngest Zelo also likes to skateboard.
"Board shop, board shop!"
"Here, it seems like a routine."
"Just as we go bike riding, people here seem to enjoy skateboarding."
Look at the camera.
None
"Since the U.S. is a really big nation, the roads and buildings are all big"
I can tell why Americans are so relaxed.
"I heard in America, people eat burgers and shakes together."
There aren't many people yet in Korea who eat like that.
"- Yes there is, Yong Guk."
"- Yes, Yong Guk eats like that."
We will give it a try today.
"At Shake Shack, they eat burgers and shakes together."
"Usually, people drink coke."
"Well, that's what they say."
Why don't you all try it too?
I hear strawberry shakes are delicious.
I felt this last time too...
The clouds in America are so beautiful.
I think I can see them more clearly because there aren't too many tall buildings. one two three.
We're in America.
"one more time, one more time."
"Hurry, one more time."
"oK, the red light is on."
I'm at a coffee shop.
"This is a mango smoothie, sold only in this store."
None
I don't know where everybody else went.
oh!
There's Zelo.
"Yo, what's up!"
"After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut."
-Baek Eun Jo  -No Ri.
Thank you.
My parents... are coming up on an evening flight.
Uhmm..
They must have been very surprised.
The doctor complimented you.
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.
"If you hadn't told me how,"
I wouldn't have been able to do anything
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.
I had no idea.
I really... had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.
I will call my dad.
He must be worried.
Oh Ha Ni!
"Ah, my cellphone and my wallet... where did I leave it all?"
"I, really..."
How old am I that I'm already...
You know..
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...
He explained everything to me already.
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.
I was afraid... that I might do something wrong.
"So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo."
Everything is alright now. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; It's the first time that I heard.. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;warm words from Baek Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Since my anxious feelings were all relieved... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My eyes and heart... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I cried so much they nearly melted away.
Hello!
Hi Eun Jo.
Omo!
You made it today.
The flowers smells good.
It's Oh Ha Ni again??
There are so many careless drivers in the world.
I have seen many different sizes of fly.
"In North Africa, smaller fly than here."
"And Turkey, smaller fly than here."
But this size is same fly in Korea and in Japan and China.
So I feel very emotional.

"Which way do I go? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you go in that direction, you will die.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You shouldn't go there!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In that case...
What if I go the other way?
"If I go here, will I live?"
I...
"Of course, I got carried away a little bit after that."
No harm or nothing done.
It was just innocent.
We thought it was just normal innocent stuff.
"What about the music, speaking of the dance."
Who played music at that time around here?
That would have been
Jule Gillespie and Pat Bonner and
Walter McCauley.
"Maybe Robert Palmer, Edward's brother."
"Russell, one of the [?] guys or something."
There's a lot of people - a lot of them can make music
Family type stuff...
Jules - Mary's mother...
Mary can sing.
Mary Palmer.
If you can ever get her to sing.
"Richie Gillespie is a good singer, if you can ever get him to sing."
"He used to - twenty years ago him and Rich [?] could - you name it, they'd play it."
Richie'd sing as good as anybody you've ever heard.
"But Jules's wife, she could sing too."
She was a real good singer.
What kind of music?
Just the regular stuff that you hear on the tapes.
The country type or whatever you want to call it.
Were anybody left that actually did any step dance?
Mm-hmm.
The Dodie guys would just ... wife here a couple weeks ago...
Uncle Joe [?]
"Gallagher, and Uncle John he lived over where [?] is."
He was a big guy.
"Not quite like me, but big guy."
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Yo, LEE Ji-hwan!"
Concentrate!
"Let me ask Mrs. Ender, let me see what will she say."
Don't let Mrs. Ender know about it please!
I can't give money to anyone without her knowledge.
How can I give it son?
"Brother, I really need it very much.Look, I will pay it back as soon as I can."
What do you need this money for?
"I family matter. &amp;gt; I'm sorry..&amp;gt; Okay, thanks."
"Yaman, here you are, 300, it's not advance payment, it's from my pocket."
But it's a debt.
"- OK, it's a debt, you will complete the rest somehow. here 50 from me, &amp;gt; Thanks, &amp;gt; and from me, &amp;gt;also from me &amp;amp;gt, me too- Thank you , Thank you all !"
This is from me.&amp;gt; thanks..
Do you have 50 TL now?
"Thanks to all of you, really, as soon as I have money in my hands I will pay it back, I promise"
How will you complete the rest?- I will see.
Thanks- May you use it for the best.
How much money would you give for this? &amp;gt; Let me see.
Mira calling.
One moment...
Hello!
Mira:
Hello!
Did you get out of the interviewing? &amp;gt; Yes.
How was it?
"Not bad- This means it was very good, right?"
I don't know.
Let me take the last exam and we will see...
What time is your exam at?-At 3 o'clock!
"I have to close it, I have to study a little more."
"OK, let me know as soon as you are out OK?"
I want you to give me the good news first.
"I will call you&amp;gt; Okay, success! &amp;gt; Thanks."
The interviewing was very good.
I'm going to run away...
"Are you crazy, Mahir?How will you escape from prison? no"
I'm running away from the hospital!
"Enough talking,Gentlemen!"
"Come on,Get back!"
Come on!
Take it easy.
Feride?Are you crying?
"This is due to Mahir, right?Now you cheer upAfter you've seen it, I know it..."
How can such a big lovefinished in a minute?Is this possible?
"Feride...listen to me,I know you're very angryat Mahir, but trust mewhen I tell youthat Mahir loves you!"
"Everything is explained,he did everythingto save his father..."
He did not intendhurt you... . trust methat he is a very good man.
"Maybe it's becausewe want to bevery good man, Bahar!"
Maybe he deceived usin fact we believe that he is good?How can we be sure?
Maybe he hidits darkness in the same mannerthat he hidhis real name?
He was shot in the street...no one knows who did it... he deals with the gangsters...
And above all he is accused of so manyillegal stuff!
"But, he said,it's all justto rescue his father!"
Feride
"You should have listened to him,certainly there is an explanationfor all."
I do not want to hearhis voice or seehis face ever...
Okay.
"As you wish,All right."
I'm going to bringsome water ..
"Ayten,It ""s me , Neždet!"
Are you okay?
"Ayten, you're very worried about me,are you okay?Why do not you answer?"
Get out!
Ayten
"Go I'm sick,go..."

"We'll transfer youhere in the morning,is rapidly recovering."
Nurse...

I am.
"Dida beautiful lady come to visit me tall, black hair,in a black coat?"
"You've had many visitors,I was busy and did notpay any attention towho enters and exits."

"news... news son,you have visitors"
"Come on, pick up. pick up."
"Well, well, brother"
Thank God you're all right...

"I'm fine,Azmi, thanks."
God saved!
"A quick recoveryMahir, good luck,"
Speedy recovery.
We're very worried.
"Thank Godthat heard the prayers! thanks brother,Do you need something?"
Just say.
"No, my friends,Thank you."
How long will youstay in the hospital
"I do not know what the doctors say,But today's my father s hearing"
And I havebe there as a witness.
"How are you going to go,Mahir?"
I have to ..
I have to go and join my fatherat the hearing to set him free .
Good morning.
"the court hearings is today, right?"
Why are you so nervous...
You'll see Mahirand his family .. surely I have been informed about it...
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him ..
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him...
"See you later, L.A."
We're going to San Francisco.
"See you again, L.A."
We just arrived in San Francisco.
"Before MV filming, we're going to San Francisco hamburgers."
"Tigger here, Tigger there."
"Lately, fans have been sending a lot of Tiggers."
We have so many Tiggers at home.
"Tigger staring at me here, Tigger staring at me there."
I'm freaked out.
They look like they're alive.
It looks like they're alive and staring at me.
oh my gosh!
This street is called Union.
The weather's kind of chilly here too.
None
It's a different feeling from L.A.
San Francisco feels a little more antique.
"Very vintage, and each building has its own character."
lf I were to choose between the two cities
I'd pick San Francisco because it's more put-together.
"L.A. is nice too though, it's very casual."
I wish my neighborhood were San Francisco.
This place has a different aura to it.
They're in the same country but they feel different.
"It's a city that goes well with our song ""Coffee Shop"" too."
Just a little bit ago there wasn't this much sunlight.
Thank goodness the sun came out.
Zelo is filming right now.
It's a relief the sun's shining brightly.
I have a feeling today's shoot will be a good one.
I'm done.
SPEAKER 12:
"Take a cab, or drive in a car if I'm by myself."
SPEAKER 11:
Try to park my car close to door openings.
SPEAKER 8:
"And I just try to have a plan in advance, like where I'm going to be parking in relation to walking around campus."
SPEAKER 13:
I know where all the blue lights are on campus.
SPEAKER 2:
Like to try to make a mental note of where all the
little blue light box thingies were.
SPEAKER 14:
I'm just aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 15:
I'm really aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 8:
"I'm not talking, I'm not texting."
SPEAKER 15:
Look at who's behind me.
I don't like people walking behind me.
SPEAKER 2:
"Like if I'm walking by a shop window, I'll look in the window to see if there's a reflection of someone behind me."
SPEAKER 15:
"Because I pay attention to who's walking around me and behind me, especially at night."
SPEAKER 16:
Make sure I have my keys all out and ready for me to get into the house.
SPEAKER 17:
Don't talk to strange adults that you normally don't see around campus.
SPEAKER 11:
You never talk to strangers or guys or take rides or certain things like that.
SPEAKER 17:
I lock my doors.
Don't tell the kids.
"Nick, who I found yesterday,  kissing a woman passionately in the street..."
He later claimed that woman was his wife!
[laughter]
Here's to the future.
Drugs... sex... divorce...
Death!
Who'd want to live anywhere else?
Here's to us.
[clink]
Try me again and I promise you  it'll be more fun this time.
"- Hey, everybody!"
Welcome to the Atheist Experience.
We're live.
"It is July 15th, 2012."
"Two days after Friday 13th, and one day after Saturday the 14th, and three days after Thursday the 13th, and they're all equally important."
I'm Matt Dillahunty.
Joining me this week is Don Baker.
Welcome.
- Good to be here.
-We're in a good mood.
"This is a live call in television program out of Austin, Texas."
We'll have the number up for you shortly.
"The announcement stuff has kind of been sidelined, and we're going to go ahead and let Don get started on his talk."
"How are you, by the way?"
- I'm doing good.
"I went to a holy place, believe it or not."
"- Holy to you, or holy to somebody else?"
It's as close as atheists have to a holy place.
I went to a great science museum.
"I went to the American Museum of Natural Science in New York City, where the Hayden Planetarium is."
"I didn't see Neil deGrasse Tyson there, but took in a great planetarium show."
Thank you.good job.
Sister!
"What happened? sister,what happened?"
"Are you okay? something happened to Mahir? sister što se dogodilo? sister, what happened?"
hello
Mr. prosecutor here Muhidin Cicekfrom the police station
"Sorry to bother you at this time,but we had a tip."
Is that so?
"Someone saw the hidden box of bulletsshops in the center, we think it isone of the traders thatalready had a warning,go to search."
"We may need to orderthe arrest of Bulent Tiryakija,the store owner."
Give me an addressbe right there!
"Right away, sir."
Doctorhow si Mahir?
Now sleepslet rest until morningthen we'll see.
"Is there something troubling,Mr. Doctor?"
"No, sir."
"Mahir nothing wrongis going to happen, it's good.The danger has passed."
"God bless you,thank you"
Speedy recovery.!
"Thank you very much, Doctor."
Thank Godthat's over!
"Sister, I wasso worriedhow to tell my dad about this,"
I was afraidWhat will he saythe brother something bad happened.
"It is, gone Songul,"
Do not worry.
Do not worry.
"I'll stayhere tonight, Ilknur."
You go home letyour sister take care of Nazif
"I want to stay with you,Mother."
"Look, you can not be pregnantand take care of the patient?"
"Listen to meand go home, come on."
"Grandma, give me a callif my black uncle asks for meI will immediately come running."
"5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there."
"And then, 12 is the same thing as 26, and 6 = 23."
"So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3."
"Another way to think about it, is that something that is divisible by both 9 and 4 is going to be divisible by 12."
"And then finally, we need it to be divisible by 15's prime factors."
15 is the same thing as 3*5.
"So once again, we already have 3 and 5."
"So, this is our least common multiple (LCM)."
"So, LCM is going to be equal to 33225 =180"
"So, our LCM is 180."
"So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator."
"So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?"
"To go from 9 to 180, we have to multiple 9 by 20."
"So, to get the denominator to equal 180, we multiple by 20."
"Since we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we should also multiple by the 4 by 20."
4*20 = 80.
"So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180."
"Now, let's do 3/4."
What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180?
You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.
4*45 = 180.
"Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45."
3*45 = 135.
"So, 3/4 equals 135/180."
Now let's do 4/5.
"To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36."
"Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36."
"So, 144/180."
And then we have only two more to do.
180/12 = 15.
"Same for numerator, 15."
"So, 11/12 = 165/180."
There's a forest behind us
"On snowy days, it feels like a fairy will come out"
I wish you could come
"- I'm sorry, Sweetie - Don't start up again, Mom"
"I'm fine, Mom"
I'm really happy here

Hi Victoria.
Did you work here at Western illinois University or somewhere else?
Victoria:
"I worked at Iowa State University, and I worked for the plant-introduction station at Iowa State University."
Beth Seaton:
"And this was on his US Department of Agriculture grant, correct?"
Victoria:
"Yes, it was."
Beth Seaton:
"So were you working with pennycress, too?"
Or were you working with a different crop?
[Text on screen:
"Victoria, student intern]:"
I was working with a bio-soil plant called camelina.
"And I was basically taking the diomorphic differences, which is the difference in the leaf shapes, and the morphologic measurements of camelina."
Beth Seaton:
Tell me about your internship.
What would you say was the most exciting part of it for you?
Victoria:
I got to work a little outside of my major.
I'm a biology major and chemistry.
And I'm focused more on the animal aspect.
"But I got to work more with the plant aspect of it, and I really enjoyed it."
Beth Seaton:
Hi Josh.
Josh:
Hello.
Beth Seaton:
Tell me a
little bit about your internship that you had with Dr. Phippen's
USDA grant this summer.
Josh:
Nothing to detect these units.
-	Ghosts cloaking.
"They are going to try and EMP all of the Sentries, if he does, he can go in for an attack."
EMP on the entire army!
His entire army is EMP'd!
He Stims and goes in to finish them off.
If he destroys this army he will win the game and advance to the round of 16!
So many Marauders!
The Vikings taking out every single Colossus and BoxeR is on the verge of winning the game and the series.
"Here he goes in, stimming one more time, the Medivacs healing everything."
"Avenge on the run, falling back into his expansion, we might see a GG any moment now."
-	Ohh..
And a Nuke!
"-	Nuclear Missile, dropping onto Avenge's natural expansion where his army is right now."
The Nuke's gonna land on his army!
"-	Ohh, is he going to get his units away?"
-	Ooooohhhhh!!
-	Nuclear Missile killing everything.
"-	BoxeR, 100 supply ahead."
-	Winning the third game!
"- With those Vikings you shoot forward, trying to get rid of those Colossi."
Not overcommitting his ground units quite yet.
And uh..
Actually lost quite a few Vikings in all that.
Choya is giving him chase and going to chase him right into the main base.
"There is the defensive nuke, if he can hold this wall right here, he's got it."
The nuke could go down right in the middle of all these units.
- Oh no!
Oh no!
And it looks like..
"Oh no, Choya!"
- Ohhhhhhh!!!
I don't see the point when I can just use an actual joystick.
"And what's really weird is that this thing, again, is just a piece of plastic."
"It doesn't have any wires connecting to it, you just plant it there."
And the buttons actually work!
"And it steers okay, too."
"To tell you the truth, I'm stunned."
Ass!
"So, that covers most of the dreaded NES accessories."
"But, I know that there's one in particular that I didn't mention, but, you know, can't do it all in one shot."
"So, we'll save it 'till later,"
"I'll see you next time,"
I think you know what's next.
Western illinois Women's Soccer returned home to face Grand View last week Sunday.
"Head Coach Tony Glinn used much different starting line up then in previous matches, but it payed off early and just in the 11 min of play Senior forward Amy Unzicker recorded her first career goal to put Western up 1 nil."
Unzicker
Shot!
Amy Unzicker barried it.
Amy Unzicker her first goal as a Leatherneck.
Congradulations Amy.
Head coach said there is going to be a Highlight reel.
Sure enough we are going to get one today folks.
Grandview will tie things up just 10 minuets later.
In the second half it was all Western illinois.
Now Rite is in the box.
Cross comes in Julies Heads!

"I have to say it, it is a stupid, racist sentence, but it is also true:"
Somali people are always shouting.
It is always the real big drama.
This was a german Reunification-Shout.
This was a Bone-Breaking-Shout.
I can't bare certain pictures.
"When I see a cruel picture, a bloody picture,"
I loose consciousness a fall to the ground.
This happend for the last time in Berlin in the subway.
There are screens called Berliner Fenster.
"They showed an advertisment for a CD recorded by the German Opera, Semiramide by Rossini."
Then they showed a photo from Pulitzer Awards.
It was taken in the National Theatre in Mogadishu.
You see a man lying on the ground with summer clothing.
"The sun is shining, he smiles."
"There is a hole in his head, there's blood and parts of his brain everywhere."
When I saw this I fainted.
Oh God!
I worked with cruel pictures as well.
A serbian colleague asked me to participate in her performance.
She experienced the Kosovo-war when she was 15.
She described a footage that she saw.
That was broadcasted in the TV.
A prisoner was tied to a column.
His skull was cut open alive.
And the liquid from his brain was spooned out.
I shoul dance a derwish-dance.
That's a prayer of turkish monks.
Then you will die
These men are loyal to Antony
"Yes, but they will follow your lead"
Antony!
Antony!
Stop him!
Move!
Get after him!
He's wonderful with the child
"I shouldn't wonder, he's a child himself"
You would do well not to disparage Antony is my presence
Are you that much in love with him?
ls your judgement that clouded?
"I am in love, Olympos, but my mind is clear"
Egypt needs him We need Antony's strength
You haven't really tested his strength Only his weaknesses
What do you mean?
"You are strong, my queen"
You have the metal to seize and heel the world
"But Antony, he wants only to seize you"
And that makes him weak
"You're wrong, Olympos"
Antony does share the vision
And he's not weak
Grattius!
What is it?
Why are you come to Alexandria?
Your Lordship
Octavius has stolen your legions in Gaul
General Cornelius?
Dead
He's deliberately flaunting me!
I'll bet we could really swing down there.
Just the three of us.
You and me... and all that money.

"Hello, LOEN TV  viewers"
"And then finally, we have 13/15."
"To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--1510 = 150, 30 remaining for 180."
152 = 30.
"So, 15*12 = 180."
"Multiple numerator by same number, 13."
"We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156."
"So, we've rewritten each of these fractions with the new common denominator."
"Now, it is very easy to compare them."
We only have to look at their numerators.
"Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers."
"The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4."
"And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5."
"Next is 156/180, which was 13/15."
"Finally, we have 165/180, which was 11/12."
"And, we're done!"
We have finished our ordering.
"HI my name is Allison and I'm the president of Communication Conections,Inc., a nonprofit for families hearing loss.I'm sitting in my favorite place-my garden."
I love all of my flowers.They are beautiful and I have a variety of them.
I work hard to have them grow.
"But my favorite ones are sunflowers.Sure,they are pretty and yellow."
But why do I love sunflowers the most?
It's because they start with such a small seed and you add water and they start to grow.
You add sunlight and they grow more.
"Then all of a sudden,they grow HUGE!"
I was shocked when I saw how big sunflowers grow!
I never knew how big they would grow.
It's kind of t the same for the new nonprofit.
I worked hard for years as a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing children.
I worked for 15 years and I've seen growth and improvement.
"But,I wanted to see a BlG change."
I started with a small idea and decided to set up a nonprofit.
I researched and aksed people to help me.
Which proves all this
"Look, my memory is perfect."
I can remember anything even if it was 30 years ago
And you can ask Sheheibar and Abo Doma
Who are Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
My children
You mean Sameh and Karim?
Isn't that what I said?
You said Sheheibar and Abo Doma
No I said Sameh and Karim
Are you sure you didn't say Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
Who's the one forgetting now?
"Ok Mr.Mahmoud, Thanks"
This case is closed for now
You may go
What did your dad just do?
We all know he doesn't have alzheimer's
Maybe the medication he's talking is affecting him?
"Talk, Shaker"
Didn't you say the medication would only make him unstable and confused?
"Yeah, that's the medical evidence we know"
"But with old age, maybe the medication has affected his memory"
You mean he actually got Alzheimer's?
Even if he did get Alzheimer's
That's what we wanted
Ofcourse not
"We just want to win this case, not hurt dad"
It's the same result
"You won the case, what else do we want?"
"You're right, that's the most important thing"
"If you're gonna empathise, remember prison and all that"
"Once you get the money, just cure him using it."
Suleiman was killed by Nazif Kara it is a Lie!
I did not kill him!- Silence!
Sit down!
"Please,Sit down, sir."
Nazif.
mrs.
Judge!Suleiman did not tellMahir will be called that particular day.
"I do not have any information,and even claims that it is called the day...I just expected..."
Silence in court!
"But you asked Suleimanto call your sonto talk, right?"
"We know all,even if Nazif Kararefused to meet with your ​​son that you mentioned in your letters."
That's not true!
"Sit down, Mr. Nazif!"
She was the one that left my Mahir!
"This woman Kader Alton is the one who left little Mahir,and claims that she is his real mother"
I neverstood between them!
Sit!
Mr. Nazif sit!- She was the one who left Mahirand threw him into the house of my brother!
These are the exact words of Kader father:She never wants to seein the face his brother's killer!
"Sit down, Mr. Nazif,I told you to sit down!"
"Any witnesses what you're saying,Mr. Nazif? is your brother or father stillm alive Mr. Kader to confirm your words? no"
I never saidI do not want to see my son!
Nazif and his familyfiled a lawsuit in order totake him away from me...
They kidnapped memy son!
"Whenever they saw my fatherHow do they pay for it,beat me..."
Every day I said to myself why am I crying for someoneWho does not want me...
I went to file a lawsuitto the police in order to return sonand then they threw meout of the house...
Suleiman was the onlywho stood by mein that difficult days...
"He helped meand opened the door of his house for me , Thus began our relationship..."
Nazif is lying and is again sdtanding between me and Mahir!
Silence in court!
"All right, ma'am."
Neždet. her sisteranswered the phone?
I spoke with her
"Kader Altun,of all those letters that you sentto your son, are missing, right?"
"Maybe theylost in the mail,"
It probably happenedBefore I sent them to my niece in Trabzon. did you ever mention in any of these lettersyour relationship withmr.
Sulejman?
Never!I never mentioned it
"Nazif from Trabzonwas very honored one . to tell him about my relationshiplt would hurt him,and also make him so angry."
"How can we comprehend,you have not to mention it To protect Suleiman's life?"
"Not at all,"
I did not writebecause it was inappropriate...
In the town where I'm fromthey do not accept easilythis kind of relationship.
Maybe Nazif Kara learned about your relationship from someone else?Is that possible?
Maybe some offriend or relative?
No.Nobody knewabout our relationship.
"Many years passedsince I escapedfrom his family,"
"That's why I changed the name,I never used the name Kader,only Nihan"
So I couldnot be found.
mrs.
"Kader,you came to the court on the day of the murder.Why did you come?"
That was the day ofMahir engagement...
I wentand saw my son from a distance...
It is so difficultfor a mother not to benear her only sonon such a beautiful day.
I stood thereas a foreigner...
Then I wentby Suleiman cryand share my pain with him.
Suleiman was alwaysvery compassionate and promised to help meto meetwith my son...
He promised me he would call Mahirand called him to come totalk to him.
"Wait a minute,just a little bit..."
So that was the reasonwhy Suleiman sent the policeto bring in Mahir Kara that day?
I do not know...but I think so...
He promised to call him... mr.
"Judge,This explains everything!Nazif Kara went instead Mahir to prevent the mother to meet her son forever"

"Well, we continue to look at the case of Assata Shakur,"
legendary figure within both first the Black Panther Party and then the Black Liberation Army.
On Thursday she became the first woman ever to make the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list.
"In addition, the FBI and the state of New Jersey doubled the reward for her capture to $2 million."
AG:
"To talk about her case,  we are joined by two people."
"Here in New York, Lennox Hinds, Assata Shakur's longtime attorney, he has represented her since 1973."
He's a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University.
"And in Chicago, we're joined by the world-renowned author, activist, scholar, Angela Davis, also a professor at University of California,  Santa Cruz."
"And she is the subject of a recent film, Free Angela and All Political Prisoners."
Angela Davis and Lennox Hinds both wrote forewords to the book Assata:
An Autobiography.
"We invited the FBI to join us on today's program, but they did not respond to our request."
"I wanted to start with you, Lennox Hinds."

The magic medicine
Story by Anatoly Taraskin
Director Roman Kachanov
Art-director Natalya Orlova

"Well, get back the ball!"
But you shot it!
"Yes I did, but it bounced back from you!"
"Oh, Coward, coward!"
"Coward, are you afraid of dogs?!"
Why are you sitting at home?
On your own ...
Well ...
"Mind you Mitya, don't touch these pills!"
They are magical.
"Wow, That's great!"
Yeah-yeh.
If you'd eat one you'd immediately turn to stone.
Why didn't YOU turn to stone?
Only children turn to stone For grown-up it's just a cure for the common cold.
Will it turn dogs to stone too?
"Yes, Mitya, It will, very much so."
What do you want?
"(Male announcer) This is the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen, where, for one home cook, dreams will become a reality."
[Cheers]
"After searching across the entire country for America's finest home chefs, we've narrowed it down to 18."
I'm a food photographer.
I'm a graduate student.
I'm a stockbroker.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
"(Announcer) But to earn the title of Masterchef, they must impress three of the biggest names in the culinary world..."
Joe Bastianich...
"The hallmarks of a Masterchef are elegance, sophistication, and finesse."
- (Announcer) Graham Elliot...
"- To me, a Masterchef is constantly innovating."
(Announcer) And Gordon Ramsay.
A true Masterchef puts perfection on every plate.
"(Announcer) Tonight, the competition officially begins."
We're looking for one stunning dish.
(Announcer) And with that comes twists...
What the heck is gonna happen now?
(Announcer) Turns...
Fire.
Fire.
(Announcer) And tears.
The search for America's next Masterchef begins now.
"Thousands of cooks have already been eliminated, and only 18 remain in the search for America's next Masterchef."
Now it's time for these top home cooks to take their place in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
(Michael) Walking into the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen for the first time is incredible.
"It's such a beautiful kitchen, you know."
It's the kitchen that I've always dreamed of.
(Josh) The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen even has its own bar and restaurant.
"Man, this is crazy."
It's freakin' awesome.
I have never seen so many glorious bottles of wine.
So that's the picture for a two by two system.
"And if the right-hand side B happened to be twelve seven,"
then of course the correct solution would be one two.
Okay.
"So let me come back next time to a systematic way,"
"using elimination, to find the solution, if there is one,"
"to a system of any size and find out -- because if elimination fails,"
find out when there isn't a solution.
"Okay, thanks."

"We headed to one of the Quran Institues here in chechnya, and Indeed I was amazed from what I've seen"
Its as though the Dream is now Reality.
"Before I came to chechnya, I was told that they focus so much on their Quran [especially the kids]"
"But when I came here, I found their Institutes to be very different from the other Institutes."
Some of you may think that I am standing in a Random Public Garden or a park.
"No By Allah, I am standing in a park that belongs to Quran Institue"
A very distinguished Institute that has many things to help the students to memorize the Quran.
I wish that this dream comes to reality back in my country and in other countries as well.
"The dream of this great concern about the Book of Allah here in Chechnya, Come with me to check it out"
"This institute... has special Rooms for Their students a classes that fits their schedule well, and a Cafeteria that provides their daily meals."
"And they have a Masjid of their own, along with a wide green field, for the students to enjoy their break time"
"But Truly, the most Beautiful thing we found in this institute.."
"Is the Organized system of the institute, along with its discipline from the Hufadh of the Book of Allah Swt."
Who can start reciting for us a portion of what they have memorized from the Quran?
"MashaAllah TabarakAllah, Do you listen to Shaykh Abu Bakr Al Shatri?"
"-Yes he does -MashaAllah, May Allah make you"
-..become like Shaykh Abu Bakir al Shatri.
Congratulation to AbuBakr for having
-.. the kids of chechnya listening to him.
May This is all be found in his scale of good deeds
Institute of Shaykh Zayid - Chechnya.
while I was walking around the institute.. here in Chechnya
"The insititute of Shaykh Zayid for Quran Memorization and while I was listening to their beautiful recitation, I met a boy named Ikhwaan"
It was said to me that this young boy is 12 years old and has the Quran Memorized.
"MashaAllah Shaykh Adam, When did ikhwaan start memorizing the Quran? - he started memorizing as soon as we opened up this Institute which was 8months ago."
- He started memorizing 8 months ago? - yes he did.
"MashaAllah Tabarak AlRahman, he memorized the Quran only in 8months! honestly I am a little shocked because he doesn't speak Arabic right? - yes he doesnt."
"-But with that, his main focus was to memorize.."
-..the Quran in 8-9 months.
And he sure did.
MashaAllah.
- How many pages does he memorize a day?

- Wow!
This is a subspace of L2 from -1 to 1.
"And it is a subspace spanned by polynomials of degrees of 0, 1, 2 to up to N-1."
"There is a self-evident naive basis, mainly sk is equal to tk, k going from 0 to N-1."
This naive basis is not orthonormal and can be quite badly behaved when N becomes large.
"Our goal will be to approximate vector x, which is sin t over this sub-space, so sin t does not belong to P3, so we have to find the orthonormal projection of sin t over this sub-space P3."
"From the basis s k, we can build an orthonormal basis using something called the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure that you're probably familiar with from linear algebra."
"So, you take the original set s k and you derive the orthonormal set u k using an algorithmic procedure which is given in steps below."
"At each step k, you first derive p k as s k minus the projection on to the previous orthonormal set."
"And then, you renormalize p k into u k by simply dividing by its norm."
"Let us see the Gram-Schmidt procedure on a set of two vectors s 0, s 1."
"So, they are obviously not orthonormal to each other."
"So first, we normalize s 0 into p 0 divided by its norms, that gives you u 0, which is of length 1, it's the blue vector."
"Then, we compute the projection of s 1 onto the subspace, using u 0, so that's u0 inner product with s 1 times u 0."
"Then, we subtract this from s 1: that gives us p 1."
"And finally, we normalize p1 into u1 which is the blue vector."
"Now, we have two vectors that span the same space and are orthogonal to each other."

It feels really nice to just be able to watch from above what everyone's cooking style is.
It looks like Tali's never made risotto before.
"It looks like Dave Mack has never made risotto before, as well as Scott."
"He's not using a classic technique, and there's reasons why techniques are developed."
I'm gonna make a poblano risotto for them today.
I'm gonna add a little scallop on top and see where we go from there.
"Hello, Helene. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What do you think?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, I think it's actually done."
The texture is telling me that it's really close.
- Did you taste that rice?
- Yes.
That taste cooked to you?
"Well, it's getting there."
- Monti.
"- Yes, sir, chef."
"One, two, three, four pans going."
What are you doing?
"I am gonna make risotto with green and yellow beans, white asparagus, and sun-dried tomato. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Not keeping things simple?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I'm gonna see how things turn out, and I'm gonna go from there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Last 15 minutes."
Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"So, with 15 minutes left, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we should certainly be adding&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the first consommes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to our final risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The rice should be toasted, the onions should be wilted."
"You're starting to see the rice swell a little bit, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;gaining volume... working it,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;working it, working it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Who do you think's gonna be doing something delicious? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think that Frank'll do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a good risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;because I think&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's eaten it before.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Dave Mack?
"- He's got a pot like this, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;where it's literally, like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;just making this porridge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Right.
- I think Tali &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is kind of really&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;out of his comfort zone.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;His technique is off.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"He put cranberries in there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, there's certain things&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that never go&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in a bloody risotto."
Cranberry's one of them.
He doesn't know when to stop. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He doesn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when to stop.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I mean, I'm seriously concerned. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He is in hot water.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Five minutes to go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Beautiful boy
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day
In every way
It's getting better and better
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
Out on the ocean
Sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
"Yes, it's a long way to go"
But in the meantime
Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day

Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger."

"During the 1840s, Warsaw was one of the centers of opposition to the Mormons at Nauvoo. Thomas C. Sharp, who edited the ""Warsaw Signal"" at this time lead the anti-Mormons. The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a ""wolf hunt,"" people knew that the ""wolves"" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846."

"These examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define, even for linguists, or people who study languages as their job."
"When a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility. An example of of this is Portuguese and Spanish. While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages."

"Well, that's what I worked on."
"Okay,"
"yeah,"
"must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there."
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
"Well, great."
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
"So, I hate to, uh,"
"I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,"
"but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,"
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
"Where's,"
How do you like Chinese food?
"Oh, we, we do enjoy that."
"Yes, sir."
"Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,"
"we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant"
and then we usually stick by it.
"But do you,  What about you?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food."
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I have a personal computer at home.
It's an A T compatible.
I don't use it very much any more.
I used to use it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Do you own a computer?
"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
"We have two P C at home,"
but neither one do we really own. Um.
Are you leasing them?
"No,"
"both of them are sort of work related,"
"and,"
Loaners from work?
"Yeah,"
"that's the nicer way, right."
Do you work for T I?
"No,"
no.
"Um, I, actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,"
"and my husband's working at Bell Labs,"
"but he's really from France,"
and these computers actually are from France.
What brand are they?
One of them's a Compaq
Uh-huh.
it's a three eighty-six
"It's usually friends from church and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring."
Yeah.
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things
and everybody else brings something.
"That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,"
yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
yeah.
Uh.
It's a lot more relaxing.
"I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone."
Well you see all that on T V
and I could never be that person.
Huh-uh.
"It just, uh, I'm just not,"
"well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back."
Yeah
"And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church"
"and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff"
"and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out"
and I don't know how she can do it and be calm
Yeah
"I guess,"
Do you work?
"No,"
I don't.
Do you stay home with kids?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it, it was heavy when we were there though."
Yeah.
"I didn't see any boats there, though."
"Not, not, not too many, no."
"But, uh, no,"
I just got back from a weekend.
"We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing."
"It was pretty nice,"
"but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff."
Yeah?
"That's a lot of fun,"
"but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,"
they're kind of into it.
"Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats."
"Oh, yeah,"
"I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here."
Yeah.
All right.
"So, where about in Texas is that?"
Is that centrally located
"or,"
"It's, uh, well,"
you ever heard of Lufkin?
"Uh, no,"
"what, what major city is nearby?"
Houston.
"Okay,"
and that's south or north of there or something?
"and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,"
"and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon"
and it didn't give me any trouble at all.
That's good.
Yeah.
"It was a late model,"
is that Chrysler van?
It's a eighty-seven.
"Yeah,"
one of the little mini vans?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Is a,"
Do you like the way it rides and stuff?
"Uh, rides or runs?"
Rides rough?
"It,"
"yeah,"
"well, yeah,"
"it rides, rides rough,"
it runs good.
Yeah.
"You know, I kind of,"
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
Yeah.
"You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway."
"Yeah,"
"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy."
Yeah.
"But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too."
"You driven American cars all,"
"Uh, yeah,"
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
"we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, central  New Jersey, you know,"
Okay.
"we're like, uh,"
"Well, that's nice, too."
"Yeah,"
"oh yeah,"
"it was beautiful,"
"that's why I, I really miss it."
"I, I don't really like it here at all"
"Really,"
"yes,"
"my wife's been away for twenty-five years,"
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
"Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,"
"and her mother was from New York,"
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
"Yeah,"
"so they,"
Yeah
"Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,"
"but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling."
"Well, yeah,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and, then, of course they call, you know,"
"before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous"
I know.
"you know, I said, this is absurd,"
"I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing."
"That's a, that's a good suggestion."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them,"
"I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills"
and they're bouncing checks all over the place
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
"uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks."
"Well, we have,"
"we used to, when I was younger"
Yeah.
we'd go every weekend.
All right .
But we haven't done whole lot of it lately.
Yeah.
I'm kind of into it.
"I'm, uh, kind of a sailor."
Yeah.
"I'm up in Minneapolis now,"
but I was in Florida
"so, uh, yeah,"
I was kind of into it for a while there.
Were you sailboating?
"Yeah,"
for the most part.
Yeah
Yeah.
"I had a little sail,"
"Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here"
No
"Just motorboat's all we,"
What part of Texas you from?
"Uh, Nacogdoches."
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
"Yeah,"
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
yes
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"
"well two, two of them actually."
"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one."
Oh that was great one.
"Wasn't that fabulous,"
"and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY."
"Oh, I loved it."
"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,"
and I need to go see it.
"Oh, you need to see that."
Yeah.
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
Uh-huh.
and this all took place in the South.
Oh my.
"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet."
"You bet, especially in the South."
"Yes,"
"right,"
"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie."
The acting was phenomenal.
"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it."
"Oh yes,"
Jessica Tandy won best actress
"yeah,"
"I agree,"
"it's, it's pretty tough that way,"
"and, I know, even like with your school books and papers."
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
"See,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
"That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though."
"Yeah,"
"well, actually I do know,"
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
"and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,"
"but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"And that,"
"I mean, I've, I've used it once,"
"All right,"
"well do you play any musical instruments or,"
"No,"
I don't play any.
I used to.
"Oh well,"
I think everybody took piano lessons
"so,"
"Everybody,"
sure.
I mean
You know
"But it is nice,"
"it is a, it is really a nice area."
"I, I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,"
and we could not get her out of the what she called the English back garden. Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn.
"Oh, really?"
Oh.
And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn
"Oh, good heavens"
Not me
I avoid the sun
"Well, yeah,"
"basically I do, too."
"Yeah,"
"it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass."
And I try to cover up when I do the lawn
"Well, I, that, that is really healthier, frankly."
"Yeah,"
"well, I have had a little, a couple of problems"
"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier."
"And, uh, we are just crazy"
"But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot."
"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,"
she is more wrinkled.
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
"I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,"
"and I've, I still play the piano as of today."
Do you?
"Yes,"
I do.
"I started,"
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
"But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band."
"I played the drums,"
"I played the clarinet,"
I played the trumpet.
Wow
"Uh, you know, whatever"
"and so I, I still sing,"
and I sing in the choir today
"so,"
All right
"I I enjoy the music,"
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
"It always sounds like,"
"for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know."
True
"So, how long did you play?"
Only for about three months.
Three months.
"Yeah,"
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
"I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh."
"Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song."
"Yes,"
I am familiar with that.
"I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it."
"And we bought it from someone who was in it,"
"but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm not sure what happened,"
"but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years."
"Oh, no."
"I, I, I found a lot of things,"
"but,"
"I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia."
"Oh, my,"
yeah.
"Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois."
"Oh, do they have one?"
"Yes,"
they do.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
"Well, I learned something already"
Yeah.
"Well, let's see,"
"the three questions are what, uh,"
How much time do you spend with your children?
Very little. Because they're grown.
Oh
What?
They're grown and gone.
"Oh, yeah,"
"well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college"
and the other one is in high school.
Huh.
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
right.
"But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people"
Uh-huh.
"and then by time you pass everything around,"
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
"So,"
"Well,"
"But anyhow, I,"
"Thank God for microwaves, you know."
"Yeah,"
"you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know."
Yeah.
"But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties."
"Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas"
Yeah.
and I have my family.
"Right,"
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
"and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either"
"and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready"
Uh-huh.
"and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, uh, Spaghetti"
Right.
"You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think if they want one, they're going to get one."
"Oh, you know"
You know.
true.
That's true.
"The bad guys are, you know,"
"like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
And that was hard too.
"I, I lucked out with really good people both times"
but I know so many people that are never able to find that
"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,"
so
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you have a nanny
or did you have someone  that lived in with you?
Yeah.
"Well no,"
she didn't live with us.
"Uh, the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school  just purely on baby-sitting money."
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.
Uh-huh.
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had  because both our parents are dead.
Yeah.
Oh.
"So that, that was a plus from  that respect as well."
Oh gosh.
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"I have, uh,"
I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
Uh-huh.
"I was just listening to a program this morning,"
"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,"
"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,"
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
"I, uh, know the name"
but I haven't been there.
"Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant."
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
"Uh, I went to the Naval Academy."
"Oh, the U S ,  Naval Academy?"
"And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty."
Uh-huh.
"And,"
"yeah,"
"we would go over there to, uh,"
"pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders"
"I think it was,"
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
"Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,"
"but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,"
"and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy"
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
"Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?"
"I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has."
"Yes, sir."
"My dad worked there for years, and years."
Uh-huh.
"That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando."
"So,"
Uh-huh.
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
Uh-huh.
and our shifts overlapped
Uh-huh.
"so I would come in,"
"and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,"
"and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,"
"it's my vitamins,"
"I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,"
"why are they working at my desk,"
and can I have it back.
Yeah.
"Can I have it back soon, maybe."
"Then you start missing stuff,"
and.
"Oh, yeah,"
"no mommy is going to take the vitamins,"
"I'm sorry,"
I have
That's okay.
"See that would, that would make me really mad,"
"because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,"
"just because,"
"I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way"
and you know how it looks and everything.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, you know how you left it the day before."
Uh-huh. child_talking
"That would bother me, definitely."
"Oh, yeah,"
"so, that's, child_talking"
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
"I, I've been working,"
"we're going to have a baby this summer,"
and I'm not going to work anymore.
"Oh, how exciting."
Yeah.
"So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day."
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
"and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,"
so.
Yeah.
"Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather."
Yeah.
"Eat at six, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family."
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, yeah,"
I don't like the run in and out part.
Yeah.
"And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened"
"and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home."
"Yeah,"
that's neat.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things"
and I think that's good.
"Yeah,"
that really is.
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
Yeah.
"I think,"
Right now we eat in front of the T V
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
"You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with."
"Um, uh-huh."
"You know, they, they see most, uh,"
"they're, they're quite upset about the, uh, the disruptive influence of school."
"Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And in Japan they would be, you know."
Right.
"But, uh, here again, you get back into a political thing, where, uh,"
Yeah
"there's, there's,"
right.
"There's definitely too much leeway as far as,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,"
Uh-huh.
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
"and I, I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,"
"but, I appreciate more what I had."
Uh-huh.
"And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,"
"Yeah,"
were you at Baylor?
and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
"Yeah,"
did you go to Baylor?
"No,"
"I went to U T at Austin,"
uh-huh.
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I'm, uh,"
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
Yeah.
"I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now"
Uh-huh.
"you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
there's not as much slapstick anymore.
"Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,"
so we may see more slapstick.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, that's true,"
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.
"Yeah,"
"it is, it is,"
"and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,"
have you ever seen any of the movies?
Excuse me?
The French movies that .
"No,"
"not really,"
"the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different."
"Um, he's, uh,"
"well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,"
and his wife's all excited
"but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,"
"but, um. O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,"
Um.
"it was a very famous, uh, popular movie."
"Norman Gray,"
Norman Gear.
"No,"
And when he retires I'm retiring.
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,"
Uh-huh.
"that's it,"
Yeah.
"you know, no more"
"Well, but, the,"
"did you, did you go to Florida in a van?"
As though
Uh-huh
"And we wanted to travel,"
"well, that was really nice traveling"
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?"
Yeah.
"And see what they think of them,"
the different kinds
Yeah.
"because I've only ridden in the one,"
"What, what kind was it?"
that's it.
"Uh, shoot"
I can't even think of the name of it now.
"What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,"
"we have two kids,"
and we went to Disney World
Uh-huh.
"uh, actually I grew up in Alabama,"
"and I went to see my mother,"
"and then went on down to Disney World,"
"and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon."
"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,"
Yeah.
that's interesting.
"Yeah,"
"the only pet that I've had, uh,"
"I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now"
Uh-huh.
"and in my, in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine"
"and, uh, it was an amazing dog,"
it really was.
"They had, he had gotten it from the pound"
"and, uh, it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino. Kind of looks like a a Dalmatian"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
"and we trained it from a pup,"
"and basically it, right now it, it's fully trained"
and it can do a lot of things.
"It will get beer for you out of the fridge,"
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff.
"So, it's really, it's, it's kind of a show piece"
"and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino you know ."
"Oh, I think so."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh,"
"she's been a real good, a real good dog"
"and, uh, just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm I'm away from it now."
"I, I I actually live in Florida"
Uh-huh
but I'm on an internship up here for a year
"and then I go back down,"
"but, uh,"
"yeah,"
Domino's a real good dog.
Yeah.
exactly.
they have to just go through everything.
Exactly.
"And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down,  something will slow you down."
Uh-huh.
Do you know what I'm saying?
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling the roses,"
"and I know that sounds trite,  and all that."
"Yeah,"
"I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way,"
"I know, I'm probably feeling that way because it's, everything's geared towards young.  You know"
Uh-huh.
"and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young,  young, young, young."
Oh it is.
"You can't be a model after thirty,"
"you can't do this after twenty, you know"
"and,  everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen.  You know,"
That's right.
Uh-huh.
and so I feel like I'm old.
"It's like I sing,  I sing"
"and I would really love to become,  uh, a professional singer,"
Uh-huh.
"but I think I'm too old now,"
"Oh, you're not,"
no.
"and I'm twenty-three,"
No.
"because everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen.  You know,"
That's true
"Yeah,"
"well, we, we've had, uh,"
"let's see,"
"we had, uh, we had a, uh,"
let me think.
ause We had a fifty-three
"and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story"
"Uh, and we had a sixty-five"
and then we had this eighty-two.
Uh-huh.
"So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really."
"Yeah,"
we've been real pleased with ours.
"I think we've had, one, two, three"
Yeah.
"and most,"
"we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven."
Uh-huh.
Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
and we've had the ninety-eight.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"but I don't know,"
"we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year"
"and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, I don't know what we're going to buy."
"I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,"
"but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty"
Well
"So,"
I could be wrong.
"Uh, I do not know what, what it is percentage wise"
"but I,"
I do not know for sure either.
"But it always seems well, it just felt different like when we were in Texas."
It had a different feel to it.
Yeah.
"It is, it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin, which is further south."
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it is not dry.
"And, and I have lived here for many years,"
and I think it has gotten more humid over the years.
"Where the water is coming from, I don't know."
Uh-huh.
"Well, it could be."
"I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, uh,"
"Oh, does he live near the lake?"
"Well, there is a lake not far"
"but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that."
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"And, uh, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's, you know, it, it collects there."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times."
"That is, that is a problem, uh,"
"they tell you when you are looking for a house or, or, or buying land to build on, to be very careful and check the drainage because, uh, it is, it is deceptive."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Because of that.
"Which was, uh,"
"I, I find that fascinating that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I do, too."
Do you ever listen to the radio
"or any,"
"I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio."
Uh-huh.
And I actually listen to C N N radio.
Do you know it was on radio now?
"No,"
I don't.
It's on eleven ninety.
"Um. I really, uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music"
"and, uh,"
"Well, when I go to work I listen."
"Yeah,"
my husband does
"and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, you know, if it's something really interesting"
"and and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it,"
Yeah.
but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.
"Well, with, with your, you know,"
"if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is"
and then they start repeating everything.
Uh-huh.
"And, and so it's kind of a, oh,"
"that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,"
"I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local."
I listen to a little of that
and I listen to a little of ninety point one.
"I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher."
"Where, where are you?"
I'm in Dallas.
"Oh, yeah."
Are you in Dallas also?
"No,"
I'm in San Antonio.
"Oh, really,"
okay.
I get my news from a combination of sources.
I take the paper every day
Uh-huh.
"and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news."
Uh-huh.
"I normally find that uh, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning."
Yeah.
"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television"
Uh-huh.
and I enjoy that quite a bit.
Yeah.
"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
Uh-huh.
So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
Yeah.
"I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada."
"Uh, well part of it, touring."
"And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on."
"There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec"
Yeah.
and I had never heard any of that before.
"Yeah,"
"you know, there was, a, a,"
"what is it called,"
is it Meech Lake Accord?
Uh-huh.
"Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of"
"and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it."
"And, and came"
it was a big thing going on there
and I came back here
and nothing in the papers.
"Right,"
right.
I didn't see a thing about it.
"So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess."
It's improved.
"And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news."
"Even, even there's, uh, uh,"
it's it's semireligious in some respects.
But what is it?
"It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,"
"uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel."
"The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR."
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, I, it surprised me."
"Oh,"
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
Pardon.
"Uh, do you all start planning real far ahead of time?"
"Well, no."
There is kind of a set pattern to it.
"There is, uh,"
"so, uh, the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually."
"Oh, really"
Yeah.
"Uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in"
Yeah.
"and, uh, everybody brings lots of food"
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
Eat a lot.
"Oh, gosh."
It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out
Yeah.
"and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time."
Schedule vacation time
and yeah.
We
"uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon."
Uh-huh.
"Usually, it is like Sunday afternoon"
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"is that one of your, uh,"
"I mean, uh,"
"Well, where I am calling from is southern Mississippi."
"So, we have got, uh, uh, my wife and I have, uh, a bit longer ways to go than most."
Yeah.
"I tell you what,"
"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
I will admit the same thing.
"And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer"
"And I,"
"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program"
Yeah.
"and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing."
I tell you what.
"The uh, the war spot in"
"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
Uh-huh.
"Because I was watching C N N,"
"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
"and it was just,"
I was amazed.
Uh-huh.
"I, I didn't have that experience."
"I, I don't have cable"
Oh.
"so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I've got one question for you."
I you say you take the newspaper.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
"So, it's, it's like everybody is into it,"
it's just greed. Human greed.
Yeah.
"Interestingly in Honduras, It's very pro-American."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And we have I,"
"my girlfriend used to, uh, be in the Navy"
"and she was based, uh, based in Panama."
Uh-huh.
"In Honduras, very, uh, uh, pro-American."
Uh-huh.
"And there's a lot of men, I don't know how many American, uh,"
"soldiers are there,"
but there's a lot.
"I mean, they, uh,"
"I had wondered sometimes,"
"I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort"
"and a lot of work went into a lot of that,"
"and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know,"
"like, uh,"
Uh-huh
"Yeah,"
"I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know,"
"I mean, why should we push English,"
Uh-huh
and a lot of people were down there teaching English
"and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal."
"I did teach economics at the university one night a week,"
"and the textbook was in English,"
"but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test."
Oh.
and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find.
Exactly.
It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S
"I was reading,"
"Right,"
"I was reading something in, uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact."
"They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever."
Yeah.
"Uh, like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger"
"and, and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi."
Huh.
"You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?"
"Yeah,"
really.
"But, uh, that's the way it is."
"I don't know,"
"I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes"
"and, you know, people, more than manufacturers should get a clue"
"and, you know, they should start making quality products."
"Yeah,"
I think they're beginning to.
"The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away"
"and,"
"That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they've got all the American, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,"
"and, uh, essentially, I I don't see much of a trend."
"I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there."
"There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars."
But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy
"Lützow’s Wild Hunt (German: ""Lützows wilde verwegene Jagd"") is the title of a patriotic German song and a 1927 German silent war film."
"The poem was written by young German poet and soldier Theodor Körner, who served in the Lützow Free Corps during the Wars of Liberation. It was set to music by Carl Maria von Weber and became very popular."
"The song praises the deeds of the Free Corps that became an essential part of Germany’s national identity in the 19th century due to its famous members. Besides Körner, “Turnvater” Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, the famous poet Joseph von Eichendorff, the inventor of the kindergarten Friedrich Fröbel, and Eleonore Prochaska, a woman who had dressed as a man in order to join the fight against the French, served in the Corps."
"The tune was adopted as the regimental march of the 1st Surrey Rifles, a Volunteer unit of the British Army."
"The 1927 German silent war film was directed by Richard Oswald and starring Ernst Rückert, Arthur Wellin and Mary Kid. The film’s art direction was by Ernst Stern. It is part of the cycle of Prussian films and portrays the fight of Prussian troops under the command of Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow against the French during the Napoleonic Wars, commemorated in the poetry of Theodor Körner."

This busy shopping street for pedestrians is lined with buildings mostly dating from the 15th century to the 18th century, which are classified as monuments historiques."
"The Rue de la Liberté was named Rue de Condé before the French Revolution. A part of the street, from the Coin du Miroir to the Place d'Armes (now Place de la Libération), was drilled in 1724. Previously, the street included the Rue des Forges and reached the back of the Palais des Ducs. The name ""Coin du Miroir"" is linked to a hotel in the old Rue Saint-Jean at the corner of the streets Guillaume and Gondrans and which belonged to the Abbaye Notre-Dame du Miroir. This hotel, composed of a square tower which displays on its first floor large ogival openings in the wall, crenellated and surrounded by ditches, was demolished in 1767."

= = = Thomas Shorts = = =
"Thomas Dolman Shorts was a Canadian sailor, and one of the early captains on the Okanagan Lake. Shorts started the lakeboat service on Okanagan Lake in the Penticton area."
"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

= = = William Meschin = = =
"William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress."
"Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters."
"Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097."
"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

"Tin(II) hydroxide, Sn(OH), also known as ""stannous hydroxide"", is an inorganic compound tin(II). The only related material for which definitive information is available is the oxy hydroxide SnO(OH), but other related materials are claimed. They are all white solids that are insoluble in water."
"Crystals of SnO(OH) has been characterized by X-ray diffraction. This cluster is obtained from solution of basic solutions of tin(II). The compound consists of an octahedron of Sn centers, each face of which is capped by an oxide or a hydroxide. The structure is reminiscent of the MoS subunit of the Chevrel phases.. The structure of pure Sn(OH) is not known."
Sn(OH) has been claimed to arise from the reaction of (CH)SnOH with SnCl in an aprotic solvent:
No crystallographic characterization is available on this material.
Stannous hydroxide is easily oxidized to stannic oxide (SnO) by air.

"Shepperd's Dell is a small canyon in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, located at"
which is less than one-third mile (500 m) southeast of Rooster Rock State Park.
"The Historic Columbia River Highway runs over the dell on a bridge that was the answer to one of the engineering challenges of the highway's construction. The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park. Omitting the apostrophe when referring to the dell itself is consistent with the policies of the United States Board on Geographic Names, which strongly discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names."

"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."
"In December 1940 ""Calabria"" was ""en route"" to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake.

"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning.

In 1882 he married Mary Harte, daughter of a J. Harte of Sligo. She died in 1894. He became owner of ""The Sligo Champion"" in 1885. He was Mayor of Sligo in 1888, and again in 1895-98 and 1900. He was elected to Sligo County Council on its establishment in 1899 and became its first chairman."
"He was elected MP for North Leitrim as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist in 1892, winning comfortably over the Unionist candidate with 87% of the vote. He retained the seat unopposed in 1895. At this election he also challenged the Parnellite Willie Redmond in East Clare, losing by only 57 votes in a poll of over 6,500. In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing. In 1906 he was returned unopposed both for North Leitrim and for North Sligo, and chose to sit for the latter constituency, which he represented until his death in 1909."
A monument erected to him outside the main post office was moved to the town hall in the 1970s; 2007 plans to move it again during roadworks were opposed by the council.

The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations."
"In ""Leila"", as the double title suggests, there is a double storyline: the domestic story of the daughter (Leila) and the public story of the nation. Leila's father, Almamen, switches allegiances between Christian and Moor in what eventually becomes the famous Siege of Granada. Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza. He inadvertently delivers her into the hands of the Christian monarchs, and Leila is subjected to the procedures of conversion by the queen's intermediary, Donna Inez. In the double story line, the conquest of Muslim Granada runs parallel to the conversion of the Jewish Leila.

= = = William G. Greene = = =
"William G. ""Slicky Bill"" Greene, Jr. (1812–1894) was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and a businessman in Menard County, Illinois. Greene founded Tallula, Illinois in 1857, and Greenview, Illinois is named after him."
"Greene, along with his brother L.M. Greene, and William F. Berry, attended Illinois College in Jacksonville."
"By September 1831, Greene's parents lived 2 miles (3 km) southwest of New Salem; Greene, then age 19, was hired by recent arrival Abraham Lincoln to assist at Lincoln's mill and store. In early January 1833, Greene bought the inventory of Reuben Radford's store in New Salem for $400; Lincoln drew up and witnessed the mortgage. The same day, Greene sold the same inventory to Lincoln and Berry, now Lincoln's store partner, for over $600. When Lincoln had a debt judgement entered against him in 1834, requiring Lincoln to surrender his horse, Greene turned in his own horse instead; this horse was probably the one Lincoln had paid him with in 1833. Lincoln eventually paid Greene back after becoming an attorney."
"Greene was also an acquaintance of Richard Yates, and introduced Yates and Lincoln in New Salem; Yates became Governor of Illinois during the Civil War and Lincoln became President."
"Greene and Lincoln remained friends; though Greene was a Democrat, Lincoln, as president, appointed Greene as internal revenue collector for the Peoria district. In ""Lincoln's New Salem"", author Benjamin Thomas relates a story in which Lincoln introduced Greene to Secretary of State William H. Seward by saying that Greene had taught Lincoln grammar: When Greene later reminded Lincoln that all Greene had done was held the grammar book and checked the answers, and was not very good at grammar himself, Lincoln is said to have replied ""Well, that was all the teaching of grammar I ever had."""
"Greene had nine children. By March 1853, Greene and his wife, Louisa Green, lived on a farm near Havana, Illinois; their seventh child, Gaines Greene (1853–1918), was born there on March 3. Sons Carlin, McNult, Byrd, and Vance, and daughter Julia Greene, died before Gaines; sons Scott and Frank and daughter J. S. Noble outlived Gaines."
"Within months after the birth of Gaines Green, the family moved near Tallula, and William Greene spent most of his life in Tallula Precinct. Greene, along with Yates, J. G. Greene, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears, laid out the village of Tallula itself in late 1857. William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877."
"Greenview was laid out in October 1857. It was named after William Greene because he convinced the railroad to come through the town: located on the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis Railroad, Greenview was incorporated by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in May 1869."
"Greene died on June 30, 1894, aged 82 years, 5 months, 3 days, and is buried as ""W. G. Greene"" in Greenwood Cemetery (East) in Tallula."

Veiss being appointed Chief of the Auxiliary Police. At the end of 1941, he became First Deputy Director General of the Director General of the Interior when the Latvian Self-Administration was reorganized."
"As early as autumn 1941 Latvian auxiliary police units, temporarily attached to the Wehrmacht, were first used in front line duties. This occasional employment continued until the 2nd Latvian Brigade was formed from six Latvian battalions, four of which had combat experience. At the end of April 1943 a three battalion formation fighting under name of Latvian Legion was withdrawn from the front line and renamed 1st Volunteer Regiment of the SS (Latvian), with a change of Wehrmacht ranks to those of Waffen-SS.

Aside from Grand Prix, where he won four matches at the round-robin qualifying stage and finished third in his group, he was to struggle for wins during his debut season and was relegated from the tour."
"With the introduction of Q School, Patrick came agonisingly close to regaining his tour place, twice losing his final match both in 2011 and 2012. Nevertheless thanks to his high Q School ranking Patrick was able to compete in all the major ranking tournaments of the 2012/13 season as an amateur. He enjoyed his best ever performance at the 2013 German Masters, where he beat Michael White and Martin Gould to qualify to the venue stages and was leading Ali Carter 3–1 before eventually losing 5–3. He also recorded an impressive 10–6 win against Luca Brecel at the World Championship qualifiers. Patrick was to end the season on a high note, as in the final round of Q School Event 3 he edged out Ashley Carty 4–3 to regain his place on the main tour."
"Patrick managed to win just three matches during the 2013/2014 season, all of them in the minor-ranking European Tour events, to end up ranked world number 119."
"His 2014/2015 season was much better as he started it by beating Jimmy White 5–2 to qualify for the 2014 Wuxi Classic. In Patrick's debut at a Chinese ranking event he lost 5–3 to Sam Baird.

= = = Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang = = =
The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

"Sevier was born in 1896 in Madison Parish, Louisiana, a son of the former Roxie Roberta Allen and James Douglas Sevier, Sr., a native of Port Gibson, in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. His parents moved to Madison Parish in 1880, where his father became a planter. Sevier attended local segregated schools for his lower education. He graduated in 1917 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge."
"His father's family were descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and pioneer and first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. His line became prominent in northeastern Louisiana. One of Henry's cousins was Andrew L. Sevier, who served as a Louisiana State Senator with repeated reelection, from 1932 until his death in office in 1962."
"During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals."
"After the war, in 1918 Sevier married the former Retta Brooks (1899-1992) of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. The couple had three children: Carolyn S. Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish."
"Sevier and his wife went to New York City, where he completed postgraduate work at Columbia University in 1921. He graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center, and they settled in Tallulah."
"There Sevier entered into practice with Jefferson B. Snyder of Tallulah, the political boss of the delta parishes in northeastern Louisiana. Snyder wielded power for more than 40 years as the regional district attorney, from 1904 to 1948."
"Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978)."
"Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested."
"After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.) The senior Sevier was also president of the Tallulah State Bank and Trust Company. Given these additional responsibilities, and having served eight terms in the state house, he chose not to run again after his term ending in 1952."
"Like Snyder, Sevier was active in the Democratic State Central Committee. He was the national committeeman during the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis. Afterward he was selected as the state Democratic Party chairman under Governor Earl Kemp Long."
"He belonged to the Presbyterian church with his wife. He was affiliated with the 6th Judicial District Bar Association, Rotary International, and the Masonic lodge."

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Archanes-Asterousia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of . Population 5,042 (2011). It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis."
"In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River."
"Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III–Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite."
"The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds."
"A large paved area, dissected by walkways that form a triangle, is found in Theatre Area"" or ""Aghios Nikolaos"" (Saint Nicholas). Two stepped altars are found here, one on a walkway and one on the pavement. There is a painting of a reconstruction of this area in Sakellarakis' ""Crete Archanes"" guidebook on page 49, which does this area more justice than a written description."
"The economy revolves around grape and olive processing and marketing. Both products account for some 96% of its total agricultural products. The Agricultural Cooperative of Archanes, set up in 1931, is one of the oldest in Greece, and consists of 1119 members. A quarter of the wine production is exported to Germany, France and the Netherlands, and the rest of the production is largely marketed domestically. Since the late 1990s, attempts have been made to convert part of wine making step by step to organic and integrated farming, beginning with the cultivation of table grapes."

The Rockets went 27–44 under Albeck to finish the season with a record of 30 wins and 54 losses. They tied the Texas Chaparrals for fourth place in the Western Division (28 games behind the Indiana Pacers) and on April 1, 1971 lost a one-game playoff to the Chaparrals, 115–109, to determine who would advance into the ABA Western Division semifinals. During the season Denver's average home attendance dropped to 4,139 fans per game from 6,281 the year before. One week after the playoff loss, on April 8, 1971, Albeck was replaced by Alex Hannum as Denver's head coach.

"John Francis Dodge (October 25, 1864 – January 14, 1920) was an American automobile manufacturing pioneer and co-founder of Dodge Brothers Company."
"Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands."
"In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit."
"In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan."
"For ten years (1903–1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks."
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
"Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan."
"The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819–1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823–1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863–1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855–1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820–1860)."
John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864–1901) in September 1892. They had three children:
"Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883–1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda:"
"In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate."
His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III.
"John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues."
"Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21."
"After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson."
"In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University."

"Nachman Goldstein of Tcherin (1825 – 1894), also known as the Tcheriner Rav (rabbi of Tcherin, a town in eastern Ukraine), was a leading disciple of Nathan of Breslov (known as ""Reb Noson""), who in turn was the chief disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic dynasty."
"A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, ""Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of ""you""?"" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works."
"Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled ""Tovot Zichronot""."

It then follows the north shore of Bras d'Or Lake, bypassing Baddeck on a short Super two controlled access segment. Still running in a general northeast direction, at St. Anns the highway begins ascending the west slope of Kelly's Mountain on the Cape Dauphin Peninsula.

"Eminsang travelled back to the Gold Coast on the same ship that carried Nagtglas there. Upon arrival, Nagtglas appointed Eminsang as a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast. When it became apparent that the Dutch were negotiating a treaty to transfer their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom, Eminsang led the attempts by the Elminese to stop the transfer, and together with other Dutch loyalists paid for a visit to The Hague by David Mill Graves, in an ultimate attempt to stop the ratification of the treaty. Eminsang wrote a letter to the German ambassador in The Hague asking German Emperor William I for mediation and protection, to be handed over by Mill Graves."
"After it became clear that Mill Graves's mission could not prevent the handing over of Elmina to the British, Eminsang withdrew his protest, keen on keeping his influential positions in the colonial government. Apart from being a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast, Eminsang had also become a substitute judge on the Court of Justice, a sworn attorney, and a justice of the Small Causes Court. Eminsang's ""volte face"" proved very worthwhile for him, as he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Regularisation of the Affairs of the Netherlands on the Coast of Guinea headed by J. M. C. W. Joost, as well as notary and public registrar."
"When Elmina was finally transferred to the British on 6 April, the British Governor of the Gold Coast John Pope Hennessy appointed Eminsang Civil Commandant, Collector of Customs, Postmaster and Deputy Superintendent of Police. As it appeared that Eminsang was rewarded for his sudden change of opinion, many Elminese grew angry with the situation. On 26 April, people from various ""asafo"" wards, mainly numbers 6, 7 and 8, marched with muskets, knives and Dutch flags to Eminsang's house, where a meeting was held between the Regularisation Committee and colonel De Haes, the Dutch military officer who had been entrusted with effecting the transfer of sovereignty. An altercation followed on the streets and eventually shots were fired, which hit J. M. C. W. Joost, who died of his wounds the next day."
"Eminsang could no longer remain in Elmina and fled to Cape Coast. He was released of his duties to the Regularisation Committee by colonel De Haes on 30 April. Eminsang later returned to Elmina, however, and served as acting consul general of the Netherlands in Elmina in 1878 and 1879 during the absence of Pieter Simon Hamel, and as consul to the Congo and the United States in Cape Coast in 1890."
"In the preface of his book ""Fanti Customary Laws"", John Mensah Sarbah wrote:"
"Eminsang had at least three children with Anna Abraba Smith. One of them, Marianne Eminsang (about 1859–1915), was grandmother to Robert Patrick Baffour. Anna Abraba Smith previously had a child with Cornelis Nagtglas."
"Eminsang married Mary Ellen De Lyons on 14 April 1860 at the American Episcopal Church in Harper, Liberia. She however abandoned him for the British colonial administrator Herbert Taylor Ussher. Eminsang then tried to indict Ussher for fornication and adultery at the Cape Coast court of justice, but after this attempt failed he decided to divorce De Lyons. The divorce was finalised on 11 September 1867."
Eminsang also had a child with Sarah Rühle and a son with a woman named Adayesa.

It was named for the family that owned Clover Forest Plantation. Nearby is Howard's Neck Plantation, listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"This hamlet was named for the owners of Clover Forest Plantation. The settlement overlooks the James River and was once a hub of rural trading activity. A dam and canal lock were built on the James at Pemberton to enable passage by boats. The lock lowered boats from the Kanawha Canal into the James River just below Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia and connected with Tamworth, Virginia and its mill. Trade moved from the Cartersville port and Willis River downriver on the James."
"Pemberton became connected to other markets via the Cartersville-Fredericksburg State Road, that began in Cartersville, crossed the James, and continued northward. The Cartersville Bridge, built across the James River in 1824, connected Cartersville and Pemberton; it was the first James River bridge built in Goochland County. At the time, all other river crossings were by ferry."
"In the late 1800s the Richmond-Allegheny Railroad (later the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, and currently CSX) was built through the area along the tow path of the abandoned Kanawha Canal. Pemberton was one of the railroad stops. Trains arrived in the village daily, carrying passengers and mail."
"By the early 1920s the rural village of Pemberton consisted of a large combined general store and post office, a lumber mill and pulp yards. Prominent Goochland County residents living in Pemberton included William Henry (Bill) Hall, a veteran of the American Civil War; and Bland Selden Hobson, the only Goochland woman known to have served overseas in World War I."

"The Siege of Ctesiphon took place on 27 April 629 between the forces of Shahrbaraz and Ardashir III. Shahrbaraz managed to capture Ctesiphon with a small force, revealing to all the weakness of the Sasanian Empire."
"In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands."
"Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt."
"Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire. Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men, besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabīl and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp."
"After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession."

"Lev Zacharovitch Aronson (Lew Aronson, Lev Aronoff, Lev Aronov, Lev Arnoff, Lew Arnow, Lew Arnoff-Aramon, Lew Arnoff-Aronson) (February 7, 1912 – November 12, 1988) was an Eastern European-American cellist and cello teacher."
"Lev Aronson was born February 7, 1912, in Mönchengladbach, Germany. Aronson's parents, Zorach and Pessa, along with their first infant son, had moved to Germany in 1911 so Zorach could study tailoring at the Fachhoschule (School of Fashion) in Berlin. Zorach and Pessa's infant son died in 1911. Lev was born a few weeks before his father graduated from the Fachhoschule. About three weeks after Lev's birth, the family returned to their home in Mitava in the Courland region of the Russian Empire (presently Jelgava, Latvia)."
"Aronson's sister, Gerda, was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and World War I began. The Russian government, fearing that German and Yiddish-speaking Jews might be or become German spies, took action quickly. On April 18, 1915, the Decree of Expulsion was issued by Czarist Russia, and many Jews were forcibly moved to the interior of Russia. The Aronsons and many other Jews were deported on cattle cars to Voronezh, southeast of Moscow."
"Aronson first heard the cello played by a child of a non-Jewish neighbor in Voronezh. Soon after this, a relative on his mother's side, Nikolai Arnoff, who was a professional cellist, came to Voronezh to give a concert and stayed with the Aronson family. He taught Lev how to hold the instrument and the bow. Lev's father bought him a small cello and arranged with a fellow immigrant, Aron Rafaelovitsch Rubinstein, to teach the child his first cello lessons. Lev was seven."
"In 1920, the family was allowed to leave Voronezh, and they chose to move to Riga, Latvia. Lev attended school in Riga and continued to study cello. As a youth, he performed occasionally with the orchestra at silent movies. Aronson studied cello with Paul Berkowitz, a well-known physician and cellist in Riga."
"Upon his graduation from high school at 16, Aronson moved to Berlin to study law. During his first semester he met a doctor who was an amateur cellist. The doctor, after hearing Aronson play, introduced him to Julius Klengel in Leipzig. Aronson began studying cello with Klengel and soon gave up law to focus on music. After a year with Klengel, Lev began his studies with Alfred von Glehn at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin. When von Glehn died, Gregor Piatigorsky took over his class. Piatigorsky was to become Aronson's life-long mentor and friend. Aronson began performing locally with three German friends in the Peters String Quartet in 1931."
"In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Anti-Jewish violence in Germany and throughout Europe was on the rise. Aronson decided to change his name to Lev Arnoff, which sounded more Russian than Jewish in an attempt to escape attention and continue performing. Aronson found a patroness, Mrs. Daliba Jones, whom he met in Florence through American conductor Vladimir Shavitch, and began to build a successful performing career throughout Europe as a soloist. He won a competition in Russia. He made several recordings for the Bellacord Electro label. In 1937, he became principal cellist for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Libau. During the late 1930s, Aronson also began teaching cello in Riga, awakening a passion for education that would stay with him for the rest of his life."
"German forces invaded and occupied Riga in June 1941. Aronson's cellos were confiscated. Aronson began work as a slave laborer for the Gestapo. The Jews were moved to a ghetto in the so-called Moscow suburb of Riga. Between November 29 and December 8, 1941, thousands of Jews living in the Riga Ghetto were taken to the Rumbula forest, shot, and buried in mass graves. Among them were Aronson's parents."
"Aronson worked at the clothing depot, Ausekla, for much of the period between the German invasion and 1943. In 1943, the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp system was formally established. Many Jews already lived and worked at satellite work camps in the region, which were now considered to be part of the Kaiserwald system. The Riga Ghetto was liquidated, moving the Jews from one horrible situation to another. Most Jews from the ghetto or satellite camps passed through Kaiserwald briefly on their way to work assignments within the system. Aronson worked at the Lenta subcamp, and outgrowth of Ausekla."
"In the fall of 1944, the Germans fled Latvia ahead of the Russian advance. Aronson and a number of other Jews from Kaiserwald and its subcamps, including his sister, were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. Aronson's sister died at Stutthof."
"From Stutthof, Aronson was transferred to Burggraben and worked in the Danzig shipyards. In 1945, the Germans again moved their Jewish prisoners ahead of the Ally advance. Aronson was among one of the many groups of Jews sent on death marches in the early months of 1945. His group made it to Gotentov (near Lauenberg), where they were liberated on March 10, 1945, by the Russians."
"Aronson, along with many other survivors, was sent to a Soviet repatriation camp in Torun, Poland. Aronson managed to escape and made his way with the help of the Jewish underground through Poland and Germany to the American militarized zone, where he spent nearly two years waiting to be allowed to immigrate to the United States. During his flight, Aronson met dancer Nina Bukowska, and the two fell in love and were married in 1947."
"Some of the musicians from the Riga ghetto survived the war in the same camps as Aronson; the tenor Gregor Shelkan was one of them. After the war, Aronson and Shelkan, memorializing those who died in the war, composed several original pieces. A few of these compositions were published in the Displaced Persons camp Schlachtensee in the American zone of Berlin."
"Aronson and Bukowska immigrated to the United States in 1948. He accepted a contract with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and moved to Texas. Aronson served as assistant principal cellist in the Dallas Symphony for the 1948-1949 season and then as principal until 1967. Aronson taught cello at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1967 until 1980. In 1980, Aronson began teaching at Southern Methodist University. In the 1970s, Aronson collaborated with Croatian cellist and composer, Rudolf Matz, producing the two volume work, The Complete Cellist."
"Bukowska and Aronson moved to Dallas together but later divorced. Aronson married Deane Wright in 1959 and was subsequently divorced. He married Harriet Snodgrass, a fellow cellist and former pupil, in 1979."
"Lev Aronson died in Dallas on November 12, 1988. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the ""Chevalier du violoncello"" by the Janzer Foundation."
"Though a talented performer, Lev Aronson is perhaps best-known as an influential teacher of the cello. During his tenure in the Dallas Symphony, he taught several private cello students. After his retirement from the orchestra, he dedicated more time to teaching, privately and at his university appointments. He founded and conducted the Dal-Hi Chamber Players, a group of young musicians who performed in the United States and abroad in the 1970s. He taught and judged at numerous music festivals, workshops, and competitions. He even taught a course for the Southern Methodist University Continuing Education program, which introduced adults to western art music."
"Aronson's students include Lynn Harrell, Ralph Kirshbaum, Kristi Curb, Brian Thornton, John Sharp, Adron Ming, Brook Pearce, James R. Denton, Christopher Adkins, Laurie Arnold, Alicia Randisi-Hooker, Karen Terbeek, Carol Haski, Philip Taggart, Kevin Dvorak, Richard Pope, Jonathan Reimer, Rebecca Young, and Mitch Maxwell."

= = = Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation = = =
"The Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (often shortened to BBC) was a Philippine television network that began operations on November 4, 1973 and ceased transmission on March 20, 1986."
"DWWX-TV (formerly DZAQ-TV) station owned by ABS-CBN was shut down following the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, and served as the flagship station of BBC. Roberto Benedicto, a crony of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and owner of the Kanlaon Broadcasting System, took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center complex on Bohol (now Sergeant Esguerra) Avenue in Quezon City after the KBS Studios along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City (which were ironically sold to them by ABS-CBN in 1969) were destroyed by fire on June 6, 1973, a few months before BBC went on air. The new network was named the ""Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation"" after Mount Banahaw, a dormant volcano located in southern Luzon known for its hot springs and mystical associations."
"In July 1978, BBC, RPN and another Benedicto-owned network, the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) (which originally aired from San Juan del Monte), transferred to the Broadcast City compound in Old Balara, Quezon City, with the transmitter located along Panay Avenue, Quezon City (now being used by ABS-CBN), with the then newly upgraded 35 kW transmitter for better broadcast reception. This left Channel 4 (a frequency formerly owned by ABS-CBN and taken over by the government through National Media Production Center (NMPC) as Government Television in 1974) at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center complex, then renamed MBS Broadcast Plaza (MBS being Maharlika Broadcasting System, the name that Channel 4 acquired in 1980)."
"By December 1973, the network also operated DYCB-TV 3 in Cebu and DYXL-TV 4 in Bacolod, both of which were also originally owned by ABS-CBN. Their call signs were also changed to DYCW-TV and DYBW-TV, respectively. The Cebu and Bacolod stations switched affiliations to GTV (Government Television; later the Maharlika Broadcasting System) in 1978 and reverted to their former call letters."
"BBC-2 was rebranded as City 2 Television from 1980 until 1984. In 1984, it was rebranded again back as BBC-2 (not to be confused with the British television channel). BBC ended operations on March 20, 1986 after People Power Revolution along with RPN and IBC (temporarily), after reformist soldiers disabled the transmitter that was broadcasting Marcos' inauguration from Malacañang Palace. Upon Corazón C. Aquino's subsequent accession to the presidency, BBC, RPN and IBC (collectively known as ""Broadcast City"") were sequestered and placed under the management of a Board of Administrators tasked to operate and manage its business and affairs subject to the control and supervision of Presidential Commission on Good Government. ABS-CBN resumed broadcasting on September 14, 1986 and its Cebu and Bacolod stations were returned to its original owner. DWWX-TV is still used as the callsign of the network's flagship station in Metro Manila."
"BBC became well-remembered for its trademark jingle, ""Big Beautiful Country"", composed by José Mari Chan and sung by various OPM singers of the 70s. By 1980, its relaunch as City 2 made history as the first national station to incorporate computer-generated graphics using the Scanimate system for its station identity and promo spots, followed only by Radio Philippines Network in 1981-82."

"Second-order election is a term that appeared for the first time in Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt's ""Nine second-order national elections – A conceptual framework for the analysis of European election results"" article for the [European Journal of Political Research, in 1980]. It was used to analyze the first European Parliament elections, held in 1979 in the, then, nine member states of the European Economic Community. According to the ""second-order elections"" approach, European Parliament elections were ""second-order"" in that they were viewed as less important by voters, parties and the media than first-order elections."
"First-order elections are those that determine the government and/or executive power in a political system, i.e., national elections. They are first-order in that they are seen as more important by parties, voters and the media. Local and regional elections are also considered second-order elections."
"Second-order elections present the following characteristics: turnout is expected to be lower than in national elections, voters are more prone to vote for protest parties, or parties in the periphery of the political system, rather than the usual mainstream parties they would vote for in a national election. As a result, second-order elections are often used by voters to punish or reward the current governing parties."
"Regarding EP elections, empirical evidence has shown that all six EP elections (1979, 1985, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004) have been second-order elections. However, the second-order elections approach has not been confirmed for the twelve new member states of the European Union (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)."

It also leased the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, a former Reading Company branch, from Elsmere Jct. (Wilmington, Delaware) to South Modena (Modena, Pennsylvania). The company then created a connection between the two lines at Chadds Ford."

"Joel Lester Oppenheimer (Jacob Hammer) (February 18, 1930 – October 11, 1988) was an American poet associated with both the Black Mountain poets and the New York School. He was the first director of the St. Marks Poetry Project (1966–68). Though a poet, Oppenheimer was perhaps better known for his columns in the ""Village Voice"" from 1969 to 1984."
"Oppenheimer was born in Yonkers, New York, attended Cornell University for one year in 1948, spent less than one semester at the University of Chicago, and in 1950 enrolled at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. At Black Mountain, he studied with Paul Goodman and poet Charles Olson, became friends with Fielding Dawson and Ed Dorn, and worked in the school's print shop."
"In his earliest poetry, Oppenheimer shows clearly the influence of William Carlos Williams, but he soon developed his own style. While at Black Mountain, Oppenheimer met and married his first wife, Rena Furlong. He left the school in January 1953 without taking a degree, eventually settling in New York and working in a print shop while continuing to write poetry."
"His first publications were ""The Dancer"" (1951), as ""Jargon"", no. 2, 1951, by The Sad Devil Press/Black Mountain College; ""The Dutiful Son"" (1956) by Jonathan Williams's Jargon Society, reprinted by LeRoi Jones's Totem Press in 1961, ""The Love Bit and Other Poems"" (1962), again with Totem. His satiric Western drama ""The Great American Desert"" was the first play produced by Robert Nichols, directed by Lawrence Kornfeld, who had been with the Living Theatre, at the Judson Poets' Theatre. It opened on November 18, 1961."
"Oppenheimer's poetry has been collected in two volumes: Robert J. Bertholf (editor, introduction), ""Collected Later Poems of Joel Oppenheimer,"" with eleven drawings by John Dobbs, The Poetry Collection, 1997 and ""Names & Local Habitations (Selected Earlier Poems 1951-1972),"" editor Jonathan Williams, The Jargon Society, 1988."
"He also published two nonfiction works, ""The Wrong Season,"" Bobbs-Merrill 1973, about the New York Mets, and ""Marilyn Lives,"" Delilah, 1984, on Marilyn Monroe. ""Drawing from Life"", posthumously published in 1997, gathered 92 columns written for the ""Village Voice"". Library Journal wrote that ""Drawing from Life"" ""emphasizes several favorite themes: baseball, politics, and the role of the changing seasons in our lives""."
"Oppenheimer died at 58 of lung cancer in Henniker, New Hampshire on October 11, 1988."
"""Don’t Touch the Poet: The Life and Times of Joel Oppenheimer,"" by Lyman Gilmore, was published by Talisman Press in 1998."

The estate agent's particulars pointed out that the house is not a listed building, nor is the land a conservation area, meaning that the developer would be somewhat freer of constraints than in many similar sites. One of the St Congar directors referred to the Hanstead Park as a brownfield site, i.e. previously developed land, although it sits within the Green Belt."

= = = Robert Keeton = = =
"Robert Ernest Keeton (December 16, 1919 – July 2, 2007) was an American lawyer, jurist, and legal scholar. As a law professor at Harvard Law School and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts he was known for his work on torts, insurance law, and practical courtroom tactics. Keeton, with Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia School of Law, played a key role in the advancement of no-fault automobile insurance."
"Keeton was born in Clarksville, Texas. He was the second youngest of five children of William Keeton (who owned a general store) and Ernestine Teuton Keeton. One of his brothers, W. Page Keeton, also became a prominent lawyer and educator. Keeton earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Texas School of Law. As an undergraduate he became one of three students inducted into the Friar Society, an honor society at the University of Texas. In law school he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the ""Texas Law Review"". Keeton went into private practice with the law firm of Baker & Botts in Houston before joining the United States Navy in World War II. As a lieutenant serving aboard the escort aircraft carrier USS ""Liscome Bay"" (CVE-56) he survived the sinking of the ship on November 24, 1943, by a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-175. Keeton, clinging to debris for hours, was later pulled from the ocean. He was awarded a Purple Heart. Keeton returned to Baker & Botts in 1945 after the war. He later taught at Southern Methodist University."
"Keeton joined Harvard Law School in 1953, where he would remain until 1979. In 1954, he wrote ""Trial Tactics and Methods"", a book of practical advice on courtroom skills. Keeton later developed a program at Harvard (later used at other law schools) in which experienced trial lawyers taught students. One rule of Keeton's program was to not ask hostile witnesses open-ended questions. In 1956, Keeton received his Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard. In 1973, he was named the Langdell Professor of Law. Keeton served as associate dean from 1975–1979. In the early 1970s, Keeton worked with University of Virginia School of Law professor Jeffrey O'Connell on a study that contributed to the development of no-fault automobile insurance, later adopted by many states. Under a no-fault system, damages below a certain level are paid by insurance companies, thus avoiding a determination of who was at fault."
"Keeton was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on January 25, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 21, 1979, and received his commission on March 23, 1979. He assumed senior status on February 28, 2003. His service terminated on September 8, 2006, due to retirement. In 1979 Chief Justice Warren Burger appointed him chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a body responsible for developing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
"Keeton presided over the 1988-1989 mail fraud and obstruction of justice trial of Lyndon LaRouche and eleven associates, which ended with Keeton declaring a mistrial. He also presided over the 1995 ""Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc."" trial involving the extent of software copyright, a case that later was decided by the Supreme Court. In 1984 Keeton, along with older brother Page as lead author, and professors Dan Dobbs and David Owen, published the 5th edition of ""Prosser and Keeton on Torts"". The book, based on William Prosser's influential ""Prosser on Torts"" (1941), became a foundational text of tort law and has become frequently used as a law textbook and reference work for many law students, lawyers, and jurists."

Its studios are in Metairie and its transmitter is in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana."
"Costello was program director at WRNO-FM from 1976 to 1991 and also hosted the morning show as ""Michael In The Morning"" (M&M). Additionally, he hosted the Sunday night edition of ""The Rock 'N'Roll Hall Of Fame"". He then acquired the former KLEB-FM from the Harold Callais family which was a country music outlet in 1995 and flipped it to its current oldies format. The station is modeled after the original Top 40 AM station WTIX, which was a very successful Top 40 outlet in New Orleans from the 1950s through the 1970s. He increased the transmitted power and moved the antenna from its original location to its present location in 1998 to better serve the New Orleans metro area. Mike Costello also handles GM, PD, and also hosts the morning show. Many of the jingles used on WTIX-FM are the originals used by WTIX/690 in the 1960s and 1970s.

The ""old Scots Bible"" was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy."
"White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis."
"White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862. He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Distant relative Reverend Moses D. Hoge of the Southern Presbyterian Church, Bishop Duncan of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and Bishop Minegerode of the Southern Protestant Episcopal Church participated in White's funeral services."
"White's friends and family believed that he ""died of grief"" caused by the loss of his property in Romney and his concern for the safety of the records in the Hampshire County Courthouse during the conflict. In their ""History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present"" (1897), West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher said of White:"
"White was married first to Alcinda Louisa Tapscott of Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), on December 15, 1815. Tapscott was White's cousin through his mother, Arabella Baker White. White and his first wife Alcinda had three children together:"
"White was married for the second time to Frances Ann Streit (March 19, 1811 – November 12, 1866), a daughter of Lutheran Reverend Christian Streit of Winchester, Virginia. Streit and her family were of Swiss descent. White and his second wife, Frances, had ten children (one of which died in infancy):"
"White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street (Northwestern Turnpike) which was later known as ""Liberty Hall"". Due to his upbringing in an affluent family, White was a person of means from a young age, and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a ""large brick mansion"" at this location. His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857, and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War. White's home was a ""seat of true old Virginia hospitality"" and it was frequented by all socio-cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region."
"During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in front of his residence. White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence."

"“Dala” means home in Dholuo, the language of the Luo who inhabit Kisumu and its environs. Dala Sevens is about returning rugby home and is hosted by Kisumu RFC. Kisumu Dala Sevens was first hosted in May 2003, with defunct Kenya army side Ulinzi winning that event. The Kenya Rugby Football Union Seven aside competition which was hosted by Kenya Rugby Football Union was awarded to Kisumu RFC and they renamed it ‘Dala’. At that inaugural event Saint Mary’s School Yala became the first school side to qualify for the Main Cup Competition with school-boy wonder-boy Teddy Omondi in imperious form."
"In 2004 Kakamega High School defied all the odds to defeat 1st division sides Nakuru RFC and Nondescripts RFC. The event was dropped from the National Sevens Circuit in 2007 due to dire financial straits on the part of hosts Kisumu RFC before making its return in 2009. 32 teams participate in Dala, making it the biggest event in Kenya, East Africa and probably Africa. Anyway, that was before, Kabeberi, Driftwood, Prinsloo, and Christie's followed suit and expanded their tournament's to 32 teams. The Dala Sevens is the primary fundraising event for Kisumu RFC. Kisumu Polytechnic is the venue of the sevens."

"Gedion Zelalem (born January 26, 1997) is a German-born American professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Major League Soccer club New York City FC."
"After playing for various youth teams in Germany and the United States, Zelalem initially played with Arsenal's youth squads after joining the team in early 2013, and made his senior squad debut for Arsenal in an FA Cup match in January 2014."
"Internationally, Zelalem made appearances for Germany's under-15 team, under-16 team and under-17 team during 2012 and 2013. He became a U.S. citizen on December 2, 2014, and FIFA subsequently approved his eligibility to play for the United States on May 13, 2015."
"Zelalem was born in Berlin, Germany, to Ethiopian parents. He started playing football at the age of five for German club BFC Germania 1888. After this, he changed to Bundesliga side Hertha BSC's academy."
"Zelalem emigrated to the United States with his father in 2006, following his mother's death in the previous year, and settled in Washington, D.C.. He played with several teams: first with MSC United, Bethesda Soccer Club and BNC Revolution, before joining the elite club team Olney Rangers and the varsity team at Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, Maryland."
"Arsenal scout Danny Karbassiyoon discovered Zelalem in the United States playing for Olney Rangers during a Dallas Cup match. After contacting his coaches, Zelalem was flown to London for summer training with the Arsenal youth academy; following the end of this camp, he was offered a permanent place in the Academy. Zelalem started out playing in Arsenal's under-16s squad, before graduating into the under-21s in April 2013. His début for the under-21 side came against Liverpool U21 that month, but was unable to prevent Arsenal slipping to a 3–2 defeat at Anfield; however, he drew praise for his performance. He made his second appearance for the side less than a week later in a 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers U21, once again drawing praise for his performance."
"In July 2013, Zelalem was included in Arsenal's 24-man squad for their Asia tour. Although regarded as a surprise inclusion, strong performances against an Indonesia Dream Team, the Vietnam national team and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus led to him being touted as a future star, and being compared favorably to Cesc Fàbregas."
"Following these strong performances, Zelalem stated that he hoped to make a few appearances during the 2013–14 season. He remained in the team for the Emirates Cup match against Galatasaray on August 4, but was unable to keep Arsenal from sliding to a 2–1 defeat. Zelalem was selected on the bench in Arsenal's second Premier League game of the season, a 3–1 victory over Fulham on August 24, but did not make an appearance. However, on September 10 Zelalem announced on Twitter that he had sustained an injury that would keep him out of action for up to two months. Although he announced his return to training in late October, Arsène Wenger confirmed that he would not be fit enough for the League Cup match against Chelsea on October 29, dismissing a previous rumor. He returned to action for Arsenal's youth side a week later in a UEFA Youth League fixture against Borussia Dortmund on November 6, playing the entire match in a 2–2 draw."
"On January 24, 2014, Zelalem made his debut with Arsenal's senior squad, coming on as a substitute for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 71st minute of their 4–0 home FA Cup victory against Coventry City. And later that year, on March 18, 2014, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal to last until 2017. Zelalem soon made his second appearance for Arsenal, coming on as a substitute in the beginning of the second half, in a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in UEFA Champions League on December 9, 2014."
"On August 24, 2015, Zelalem was loaned to Rangers until January. He made his debut in a 5–0 win over Airdrieonians in the Scottish League Cup, setting up goals for Martyn Waghorn and James Tavernier. He made his league debut in Rangers' Scottish Championship game against Queen of the South which Rangers won 5–1. In January 2016 his loan was extended through to the end of the season."
"He played in 21 Championship matches, helping Rangers clinch the second-tier title, and was an unused substitute as they beat Peterhead 4–0 to win the 2015–16 Scottish Challenge Cup. A week later, Rangers played old firm rivals Celtic in the Scottish Cup semifinal. Zelalem converted a penalty in the shootout to help his club progress to the final, and started in that match, which Rangers lost 3–2 to Hibernian."
"On January 24, 2017, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal and accepted a loan move to Dutch second-tier club VVV-Venlo, lasting until the end of the season. He made nine league appearances as VVV Venlo won the 2016-17 Eerste Divisie title."
"After no first team appearances at Arsenal upon returning in 2017, Zelalem joined MLS club Sporting Kansas City for free on March 10, 2019."
"After Zelalem's option was not picked up by Sporting Kansas City, he signed for fellow Major League Soccer side New York City FC on January 11, 2020."
"Zelalem began training with the United States under-15 side in 2012, but was unable to play in matches at that time due to being classified as a permanent resident, but not yet a U.S. citizen. In May 2014, it was reported that Zelalem's father, Zelalem Wolydes, held U.S. permanent residency and intended to apply for U.S. citizenship. If Wolydes gained U.S. citizenship before his son turned 18, then under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Gedion would also acquire U.S. citizenship and become eligible to represent the United States internationally. He would also be able to retain his German passport which allows him to live and work in the European Union without restrictions."

"The 1st Ohio reported to Port Tampa, Florida on July 12, for transportation to Cuba, but its sailing was delayed due to a shortage of transports and as a result, the regiment did not see action in the Spanish–American War. Day however, later saw action in the Philippines against the Moros. After postings to various units, he served as the colonel of his old unit, the 9th Cavalry, for a year before retiring from the army in 1912."

= = = Ernesto Tornquist = = =
"Ernesto Carlos Tornquist (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) was an Argentinian entrepreneur and businessman, considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century. The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province."
"Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871."
"Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ""Ernesto Tornquist y Cia"". With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ""Refineria Argentina"", in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the ""Bieckert"" brewery, the ""Seeber"" margarine manufacturer and the ""Bianchetti"" scale manufacturer."
"On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ""Sansinena"" and its cold-storage plant ""La Negra"" in Riachuelo and set up the plant ""Cuartreros"" in Bahía Blanca."
"Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the ""Compañía Argentina de Pesca"", oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital."
"Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil."
"In 1903 he built the estancia, ""Sierra de la Ventana"", in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays."
He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of José Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910).
"In 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires."
He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

= = = Kisumu RFC = = =
"Kisumu Rugby Football Club is a Kenyan rugby union club based in Kisumu. Also known as Lakeside RFC, for the 2015-16 season the club competes in the Nationwide League."
"Kisumu was founded in 1982, by David Mshila, Dennis Awori, Job Owino, Jack Ogal, Jim Owino, and Jos Odaga. They were originally based at the Kisumu Railway Club and the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu. Kisumu Boys High School also served as a training venue for years. Kisumu Technical High School (later called Kisumu Polytechnic - Makasembo) (1997) was used as a venue for games because of the good grass facility. In 1983 Kisumu combined with Kakamega, Kitale and Eldoret to form KITUSUMU: an acronym for Kitale and Kisumu.J.B Nyamwange, Jack and Walter Omaido came in from Kitale. Reg ’Pape” Sembi of Kakamega, a Canadian member of the Peace Corps Johnson Travis and Paul Scott of Eldoret. Records indicate that Barclays bank RFC travelled to Kakamega in 1985 playing Kisumu in the Enterprise Cup match. Barclays won the game 47-4. Kisumu and Kitusumu played mainly as a Western Kenya touring side but folded up in 1988."
"It is host to the Dala Sevens tournaments in the Kenya Rugby Football Union Calendar, one part of the Kenya National Sevens Circuit, today Safaricom Sevens series."
"Kisumu RFC was revived in late 1990 by rugby enthusiasts led by Mike Omondi, Bella Maguys, Gordon Raila, Peter Openda, Jim Owino, Dennis Otti, Joseph Owino, Eric Ogot, Sammy Ogot, Susan Nyaribo, Bob Bengo, Paul Okong’o, Nasser Midamba, Trevor Mugwanga, John Mark Magana, Oyunga Pala, Felix Okech and Issa Mohamed Issa amongst others. After the initial positive response to training, Jimmy Owino was appointed club coach. His initial task was to build a team with more commitment and solidarity, and to weed out the complacent ‘feel good attitude’ that had led to the dissipation of the original Kisumu RFC."
"Jimmy’s approach bore rapid results, but the next major obstacle became finance. At a team, ""Kamukunji"" it was unanimously agreed that Charles Lutta Kasamani be appointed Club patron, should he agree. He agreed. He donated playing kit, rugby balls and a first aid box. Some of the Kisumu-based personalities who raised funds tirelessly at the ""infamous"" Club Night at the Kisumu Hotel(Hotel Royale) pool side included Nilmar Darbar, Widar Krogsund, Ogweno Omwaga, Franz Bonn, Noel Okoth, Mike Humphreys, Morris Odhiambo, Jacko Omino, Peter Odaga, Paul Okullu, Peter Openda, Jos Odaga Charles Okuthe and many more whose names we cannot include here. An interim office of Charles Okuthe (Chairman) and Bella Maguys (Secretary) organized the first ever rugby tournament in Kisumu which was ‘not too good not too bad ‘in October 1991."
"The same office later organized Kisumu RFC elections which saw a new office of Peter Openda (Chairman) and Paul Okullu (Hon- Secretary) take over, with most of the interim office bearers not seeking re-election."
"From 1991 to 1996, Kisumu steadily concentrated on building a strong foundation by taking part in tournaments such as the Great Rift Valley 10-aside in Nakuru and Mombasa’s Driftwood Sevens. This was by choice because of a small player base and financial limitations. At the same time, the Club hosted the Kisumu Ten-aside event held between 1991 and 1994. With a rich hinterland of players from Maseno School, St. Mary's School Yala, Nyang'ori High School, Moi University and Maseno University there was light at the end of the tunnel. Mombasa businessman Edwin Yinda donated playing kit to the team after the Driftwood finals contested between Mean Machine RFC and Kisumu."
"Kisumu RFC first came to the fore when they reached the Driftwood 7s in Mombasa in 1994 losing in sudden death to Mean Machine RFC. Come 1997, Kisumu again reached the Finals of the Driftwood 7s in 1997 losing to the United States International University Africa."
"It is a Sunday in June 1997 and the George Mwangi Kabeberi Memorial 7s is on at the Nairobi Railway Club. Kenya is playing, using the one-day event as preparation for the Tusker Safari 7s in a couple of week’s time. The squad is composed of Sammy Khakame, Paul Murunga, Tolbert Onyango, Ken Thimba, Gordon Anampiu, Felix 'Toti' Ochieng', Manuel Okoth, Steve Gichuki & Co. Kisumu RFC are also present and the players on show are Andrew Okwaro, Fred Jura, Frank Ndong' Steve Oloo, Issa Matan Issa, Moses Kola, Tony Lamba, Job Odonde and Dan Alego, Gordon Raila, Felix Oketch, Bob Bengo. Two weeks before at the driftwood sevens in Mombasa the lakeside outfit finished runners -up losing 19-7 to USIU-Africa."
"Kisumu had moved away from mere participation to competition and the rugby fraternity had taken notice. Expectations from both the playing unit and fanatics were high. Mean Machine RFC arrived and in the side was Eric 'Shaggy' Mwangi, Biko Ambesta, Ted Okinda, Ken Aswani, Kanyi Gitonga, Eric Musuva, Oyunga Pala, Kevin Matabutu, Sundiya Halwenge and Paul Okong'o."
"And the event kicked off and the usual winners and losers and it looked like a ""kawa"" event, till Kenya met Kisumu and there was fireworks. Kenya despite her constellation of international players with exposure in Selkirkshire, Dubai, Spain and Singapore struggled to beat Kisumu, but that was just round one. To the semis of the Main Cup and Kisumu again met Kenya while Mean Machine RFC played Nakuru RFC. Nakuru with Ben 'Benways' Otieno, Caleb Langat and the hard hitting and sometimes illegal play were too strong for Machine and that was the end for Machine."
"To the second semi and Kisumu versus Kenya and this was a nip and tuck battle. The crowd at the Railway Club was at full cry behind Kisumu. Tony Lamba after many years in the Ninja's outfit found a new life, and with a new team was in imperious form setting up, Jura, Okwaro, Kola and Co. However Kenya composed themselves and closed the match off to set up a final versus rift Valley side Nakuru. It was not Kenya's day as New winger Caleb Langat scored try after try, taking Kenya's winger's apart. Winners Nakuru RFC"
"By Monday of the new week, Call ups to Kenya, Andrew Okwaro and Fred Jura."
"A tour to Uganda in October saw them leave an indelible mark with their trademark hard running, tackling and skills level in a country which was just beginning to pick the game after a lull of over 20 years. The visitor's led 13-7 at halftime before the hosts recovered to win 47-13 in the second-half. This was a 'test' versus Uganda. Putting it mildly, 1997 marked the turning point for Kisumu Rugby. They did not look back and Kisumu became a fertile rugby nursery nurturing young players just out of school into mature club and national team material."
"Kisumu joined the Second division ESS in 1998 after winning the Bowl league in 1997. The ESS would prove tricky for Kisumu. The challenge came from two quarters, one depth in terms of players and two finances to honor 11 away games with most teams based in Nairobi. The league would be honored on and off between 1998 and 2002."
"Away from that the Management Board of Kisumu actively engaged the Union in trying to secure a future. In behind the scenes talks the Kisumu management Board asked the Union for one leg of the National Sevens Circuit. At talks in Moshi, Tanzania in December 2002 a hush-hush deal was done with the Hon-Secretary of the Union Richard Omwela who was scheduled to contest for the Chairmanship in a number of months."
"With Mount Kilimanjaro providing a spectacular backdrop, to the conversation he proposed a deal. In exchange for support from the Lakeside team at the election he agreed to give Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit. Present at the talks were Omwela, Aggrey Chabeda, John Akelola, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o. Kisumu also actively engaged Max Muniafu who was then Director for Development at the Union and argued for the same. Prior to Moshi talks were held with Max, David Akelola, Phillip Ocholla, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o at the Junction Inn restaurant in Kisumu to push for the same."
Surely enough one of the first acts by Omwela & Chabeda on their election as Chair and Secretary of the Kenya Rugby Football Union was to award Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit in early 2003 by 'Executive order'.

= = = Yerrapalli Formation = = =
"The Yerrapalli Formation is a Triassic rock formation consisting primarily of mudstones that outcrops in the Pranhita–Godavari Basin in southeastern India. The Yerrapalli Formation preserves fossils of freshwater and terrestrial vertebrates as well as trace fossils of invertebrates. The tetrapod fauna includes temnospondyl amphibians, archosauromorph reptiles, and dicynodonts."
Most of the Yerrapalli Formation consists of red mudstones. The mudstones were deposited across a floodplain during the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. Smaller lenses of calcareous sandstone represent ephemeral streams that branched off from the larger channels that were the source of the floodplain sediments. The climate of the region during the time is thought to have been monsoonal with both wet and dry seasons.
"The Yerrapalli Formation overlies the Kamthi Formation, underlies the Bhimaram Formation, and is conformable with both formations. Two members of the Yerrapalli Formation have been recognized; a lower member consisting of layers of red and purple clay with lenses of pale green clay and an upper member consisting of alternating layers of clay and fine-grained sandstone."
"The paleobiota of the Yerrapalli Formation is similar to that of the overlying Maleri Formation, which also preserves fossils of temnospondyls and archosauromorphs. The main difference between the Yerrapalli and the Maleri faunae is the presence of dicynodonts in the former. The discovery of dicynodont fossils in the Pranhita-Godavari Basin in 1964 was one of the earliest indications that the Yerrapalli Formation represented a distinct paleofauna. Before this discovery, Yerrapalli strata were grouped within the Maleri Formation. The dicynodonts of the Yerrapalli Formation are similar to those of the Ntavere Formation in Zambia, which also dates back to the Anisian. During the Middle Triassic, what is now India and southern Africa formed one continuous landmass as part of the supercontinent Gondwana."

"Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, son of hotelier Colin Kalman and Pearl (Rabinowitz) Hirschhorn, He attended the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, receiving a B.A. in 1960."
"While still a student at the University of Witwatersrand, Hirschhorn wrote ""A State of Innocence"", a play which was presented at the Library Theatre in Johannesburg. Between 1960 and 1963, he was deputy film and theater critic of the Johannesburg's ""Sunday Times"" and freelanced for both ""The Rand Daily Mail"" and the ""Johannesburg Sunday Express""."
"Hirschhorn left South Africa for London in April, 1963 and in 1964 became a story editor at the UK's ABC, a franchise holder for the ITV network."
"The following year, he briefly worked as a pop-columnist for the ""Daily Mail"", before joining the ""Sunday Express"" in 1965 as an interviewer. In 1966, in addition to his feature writing, he was appointed the paper’s film and theater critic, a position he held for nearly 30 years, until he left the paper in 1995. Among the many luminaries Hirschhorn interviewed and profiled for the Sunday Express were Tennessee Williams, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West (who was also the subject of a biography by Hirschhorn), Noël Coward, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Judy Garland (in her very last interview), Rita Hayworth, Bing Crosby, Billy Wilder, George Burns, James Stewart, Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Rosalind Russell, Betty Grable, David Niven, Rex Harrison, Yul Brynner, Sammy Davis, Jr., Julie Andrews, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Mickey Rooney, and Ginger Rogers."
"In 1996, Hirschhorn became editor of the theater magazine ""Applause"" and since 1998 has been the theater critic of the magazine ""This Is London""."
"Beyond the many features, reviews and interviews written for the Sunday Express, Hirschhorn is the author of several well-received books about the film industry and its stars:"
"""Library Journal"" called his authorized biography of Gene Kelly ""well-researched"" and praised its ""warmth and immediacy"". Writing in the ""Chicago Tribune Book World"", Richard Christiansen named ""The Warner Bros. Story"" a ""bounteous treasure trove of information and entertainment"" while remarked that Hirschhorn's entries for the films were ""frequently witty and even critical…they are reviews as much as they are narratives"". ""Newsweek"" admired ""The Hollywood Musical"" because Hirschhorn ""aims at a kind of completeness entirely in keeping with the grandiosity of his subject"", a sentiment echoed by Seymour Peck in ""The New York Times Book Review"", who noted that Hirschhorn ""sets himself the goal of absolute completeness…and seems to have achieved it."""
"Nauck was the artist of the much-publicized five-page back-up story that appeared in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" #583, which was published in January 2009, and featured a cameo appearance by then-President-elect Barack Obama."
"Nauck's art was featured in the eighth season finale of the reality television show """", which aired May 15, 2011. In the episode, he and colorist John Rauch, on behalf of Marvel Custom Solutions, designed life-sized Marvel Comics superheroes on the bedroom wall of the show's beneficiary, Patrick Sharrock, a 9-year-old boy with brittle bone disease, and depicted Sharrock himself as a superhero named Dr. Scorcher. They also provided similar art for the episode's scene transitions, which depicted Ty Pennington, Xzibit, and the rest of the show's cast as superheroes as well."
"Nauck would continue his work with Marvel Custom Solutions, teaming with writer C. B. Cebulski and kitchenware retailer Williams-Sonoma to raise awareness of child hunger for Share Our Strength in ""Spider-Man and the Avengers"" #1. The twelve-page story features Edwin Jarvis hosting a cooking demonstration interrupted by the Frightful Four."
"In 2012, Nauck signed on with Robert Kirkman's Skybound Entertainment at Image Comics to draw the second volume of the ""Invincible"" spin-off series, ""Guarding the Globe"", which ran for six issues before relaunching in 2013 as ""Invincible Universe"" which ran for twelve issues."
"In 2018, Nauck joined Dark Horse Comics to draw the six mini-series ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Comic"", drawing the ""host segments"" of the comic."

He is one of the most highly cited chemists in the world, with a Thomson Reuters H-Index of 121 as of 2020. He is the Graham Perdue Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Center for Computational Chemistry at the University of Georgia."
"Schaefer is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Physical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Royal Society of Chemistry, American Chemical Society, and an honorary fellow of the Chemical Research Society of India, among others."
"Schaefer is an outspoken Christian. He has described himself as sympathetic to teleological arguments, but primarily a ""proponent of Jesus."""
"Schaefer was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was educated in Syracuse, New York; Menlo Park, California; and East Grand Rapids, Michigan."
"He was awarded a B.S. degree in chemical physics by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966, where he had the opportunity to work with scientists including George Whitesides, John C. Slater, F. Albert Cotton, Richard C. Lord, and Walter R. Thorson."
"He then received a National Defense Education Act Fellowship which enabled him to earn a Ph.D. degree in chemical physics from Stanford University in 1969. At Stanford he worked with Frank E. Harris on ""ab initio"" electronic structure theory and quantum chemistry. For his Ph.D. thesis work, he examined the electronic structure of first-row atoms and the oxygen molecule. He published 12 articles in journals including ""Physical Review"" and ""Physical Review Letters"" prior to defending his dissertation."
"Schaefer became an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, with access to Berkeley's Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600 mainframe computer. Through collaborations with other researchers, he also gained access to resources at the University Computing Company (UCC) in Palo Alto, which had a UNIVAC 1108. He worked at Berkeley from 1969 to 1987, with one exception. Schaefer spent 1979-1980 as the Wilfred T. Doherty Professor of Chemistry and inaugural Director of the Institute for Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin, before deciding to return to Berkeley. During his time at Berkeley, Schaefer published 375 papers and several books, including ""The Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules: A Survey of Rigorous Quantum Mechanical Results"" (1972) and ""Quantum Chemistry: The Development of Ab Initio Methods in Molecular Electronic Structure Theory"" (1984), a survey of research with commentary."
In August 1987 Schaefer moved to the University of Georgia as Graham Perdue Professor of Chemistry and Director of the newly formed Center for Computational Chemistry. With the help of an IBM 3090-200E mainframe (as well as later models) he and his research group developed various computer-based methods for advanced quantum chemistry.

"CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System is a non-profit regional health care provider based in Tyler, Texas that operates eight hospitals and 82 clinic locations in East Texas."
"In the early 1930s, the Sisters of The Holy Family of Nazareth came to Tyler, Texas from the Sacred Heart Province in Chicago to open Mother Frances Hospital. The hospital was named in honor of Frances Siedliska, the founder of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. The hospital opened on March 18, 1937 – one day ahead of schedule – to care for victims of the New London School explosion."
"In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth completed the purchase of the hospital from the City of Tyler and in October 1965, Mother Frances Week was celebrated in Tyler, dedicating a new wing. This $4.5 million wing added 110 new patient beds and a new cafeteria to the hospital."
"In 1934, The Trinity Clinic began as The Bryant Clinic. It was founded by Dr. William Howard Bryant and Dr. Sidney W. Bradford. The Bryant Clinic received the first call for help in Tyler to treat the victims of the New London tragedy. In 1948, The Bryant Clinic changed its name to The Medical & Surgical Clinic and later, with the addition of two other Tyler-area medical practices, became Trinity Clinic. Today, Trinity Clinic is the area's biggest multi-specialty medical group, with over 300 providers representing 38 specialties in 36 clinic locations in East Texas."
"In 1995, Mother Frances Hospital and Trinity Clinic merged, creating Trinity Mother Frances Health System, one of the first integrated health care systems in the United States. In 2007, Trinity Mother Frances Health System changed its name to Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics."
"In May 2016, Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics merged with CHRISTUS Health to create CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System and CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic."
"In June 2016, CHRISTUS Health and Hopkins County Memorial Hospital in Sulphur Springs, Texas finalized an agreement to create CHRISTUS Hopkins Health Alliance and make Hopkins County Memorial Hospital a part of CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System. The agreement included a change of name for the hospital to CHRISTUS Mother Frances Hospital - ""Sulphur Springs"" and its clinics to CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic - Sulphur Springs and CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic - Emory."
"In July 2017, Magnolia Health Systems - Physicians of East Texas (MHS) became a part of CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances. This includes clinic locations in Palestine, Elkhart, Fairfield, Grapeland and Buffalo, Texas."

= = = John T. Shayne &amp; Company = = =
"John T. Shayne & Company, a Chicago-based hatter, haberdasher and furrier was founded on November 6, 1884, by John Thomas Shayne (born August 26, 1852) an importer/manufacturer, civic leader and Democratic politician. The firm was formally incorporated on May 23, 1899, and held the distinction of being ""the largest business of its kind outside of New York City."" The store was first located at 187-189 South State Street in the Chicago Loop (the city of Chicago's central business and shopping district) and later moved to the John Crerar Library building at 150 North Michigan Avenue where it remained until the department store ceased operations in 1979. At the time of its closing, Shayne's was a department store specializing in women's ready-to-wear, couture and furs."
"The achievements of the Shayne brothers in the manufacture of fine furs helped to bring a newfound respect for American manufactured furs which were primarily reserved only for the elite European manufacturing houses of Russia, France and Germany. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago's World Fair), ""The New York Times"" reported, ""The joint exhibit of C.C Shayne of New-York and John T. Shayne of this city has received awards which, by reason of their number and their language, leave no doubt that the Shayne fur products surpass those made in any part of the world."""
"On July 10, 1894, John T. Shayne commented to the Committee of Finance of the United States Senate that U.S. furriers were losing significant income from garments that were manufactured overseas and then brought back to this country duty-free by tourists. Shayne stated to the Committee of Finance, ""I could get up a petition that would almost reach from the Senate Chamber to the White House, but do not wish to encroach upon your valuable time."""
John T. Shayne & Company was one of the earliest Chicago retailers to join in America's burgeoning mail order business during the turn of the 20th century. Shayne's first mail order publication dates back to 1906 and is featured in the Chicago Public Library Trade Catalog Collection at the Harold Washington Library.
"Mail order merchandising played an important role in retail distribution during the 20th century. These catalogues provided rural communities access to an array of merchandise; items ranging from tooth paste to prefabricated houses were marketed to small towns and remote rural communities, transforming the way American's purchased goods."
"Chicago area retailers were among the nation's first companies to publish mail orders. The city was ideally suited for America's growing mail order business due to its central location, access to a national rail system and advances made in mail delivery. Chicago became a nationally recognized city through the many images that found their way into these mail order catalogs. These publications shaped the nation's perspective of Chicago and encouraged tourism to the city."
"On March 21, 1899, ""The New York Times"" reported, ""John T. Shayne, a wealthy furrier, and a prominent Democratic politician, brother of C.C. Shayne of New York, was shot, and probably fatally wounded, this afternoon by Harry H. Hammond, a tailor. The shooting occurred in the cafe of the Auditorium Annex, where Shayne was sitting at lunch with Mrs. Hammond, the divorced wife of Hammond, and two other ladies."" Shayne did miraculously recover from the shooting incident."
"Patrick Dennis, author of the bestselling novel ""Auntie Mame"" referenced John T. Shayne and Company in his subsequent novel ""Little Me"". The main character of the novel, Belle Poitrine, describes her shopping spree ""I went on a mad round of shopping -diamonds and pearls- from Peacock's, glossy furs from John T. Shayne, dresses of every description from Field's and Carson, Pirie, Scott with shoes to match from O'Connor and Goldberg."""
"Subsequent ownership included Tom Considine, Jr. who in turn sold the company to Martin Feldman. The Feldman family acquired the business in 1958 whereupon Martin and son Barry Feldman, along with Edwin Smith operated the business until it closed in 1979."

"Affine gauge theory is classical gauge theory where gauge fields are affine connections on the tangent bundle over a smooth manifold formula_1. For instance, these are gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media when formula_2, the generalization of metric-affine gravitation theory when formula_1 is a world manifold and, in particular, gauge theory of the fifth force."
"Being a vector bundle, the tangent bundle formula_4 of an formula_5-dimensional manifold formula_1 admits a natural structure of an affine bundle formula_7, called the ""affine tangent bundle"", possessing bundle atlases with affine transition functions. It is associated to a principal bundle formula_8 of affine frames in tangent space over formula_1, whose structure group is a general affine group formula_10."
"The tangent bundle formula_4 is associated to a principal linear frame bundle formula_12, whose structure group is a general linear group formula_13. This is a subgroup of formula_10 so that the latter is a semidirect product of formula_13 and a group formula_16 of translations."
There is the canonical imbedding of formula_12 to formula_8 onto a reduced principal subbundle which corresponds to the canonical structure of a vector bundle formula_4 as the affine one.
Given linear bundle coordinates
"on the tangent bundle formula_4, the affine tangent bundle can be provided with affine bundle coordinates"
"and, in particular, with the linear coordinates (1)."
"The Royal Shakespeare Company in the UK has produced two major Shakespeare festivals in the twenty-first century.

The Propeller company have taken all-male cast productions around the world. Phyllida Lloyd has continually staged all-female cast versions of Shakespeare in London.
"More than 420 feature-length film versions of Shakespeare's plays have been produced since the early 20th century, making Shakespeare the most filmed author ever. Some of the film adaptations, especially Hollywood movies marketed to teenage audiences, use his plots rather than his dialogue, while others are simply filmed versions of his plays."
"For centuries there had been an accepted style of how Shakespeare was to be performed which was erroneously labeled ""Elizabethan"" but actually reflected a trend of design from a period shortly after Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare's performances were originally performed in contemporary dress. Actors were costumed in clothes that they might wear off the stage. This continued into the 18th century, the Georgian period, where costumes were the current fashionable dress. It was not until centuries after his death, primarily the 19th Century, that productions started looking back and tried to be ""authentic"" to a Shakespearean style. The Victorian era had a fascination with historical accuracy and this was adapted to the stage in order to appeal to the educated middle class. Charles Kean was particularly interested in historical context and spent many hours researching historical dress and setting for his productions. This faux-Shakespearean style was fixed until the 20th century. As of the twenty-first century, there are very few productions of Shakespeare, both on stage and on film, which are still performed in ""authentic"" period dress, while as late as 1990, virtually every true film version of a Shakespeare play was performed in correct period costume. The first film in English to break this pattern was 1995's ""Richard III"" which updated the setting to the 1930s but changed none of Shakespeare's dialogue."
