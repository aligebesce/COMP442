I think it's just a different kind of brochure.
Sorry?
"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
cried the startled pirates .
"`` The cabin 's as black as a pit , '' Cecco said , almost gibbering , `` but there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ''"
"The exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were seen by Hook ."
"`` Cecco , '' he said in his most steely voice , `` go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo . ''"
"Cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying `` No , no '' ; but Hook was purring to his claw ."
"`` Did you say you would go , Cecco ? ''"
he said musingly .
"Cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly ."
"There was no more singing , all listened now ; and again came a death-screech and again a crow ."
No one spoke except Slightly .
"`` Three , '' he said ."
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . ''
"'S ` death and odds fish , '' he thundered , `` who is to bring me that doodle-doo ? ''"
"`` Wait till Cecco comes out , '' growled Starkey , and the others took up the cry ."
"`` I think I heard you volunteer , Starkey , '' said Hook , purring again ."
"`` No , by thunder ! ''"
Starkey cried .
"`` My hook thinks you did , '' said Hook , crossing to him ."
"`` I wonder if it would not be advisable , Starkey , to humour the hook ? ''"
"`` I 'll swing before I go in there , '' replied Starkey doggedly , and again he had the support of the crew ."
`` Is this mutiny ? ''
asked Hook more pleasantly than ever .
`` Starkey 's ringleader ! ''
"`` Captain , mercy ! ''"
"Starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now ."
"`` Shake hands , Starkey , '' said Hook , proffering his claw ."
"Starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him ."
"As he backed up Hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye ."
With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea .
"`` Four , '' said Slightly ."
"`` And now , '' Hook said courteously , `` did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ''"
"Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , `` I 'll bring out that doodle-doo myself , '' he said , and sped into the cabin ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:"
"""Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear."
"No there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."""
"""Good-bye, ducky,"" said Nurse. ""Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."""
"So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"""
"He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time."
"As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand."
"""I thought we were a Republic,"" said Lionel. ""I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."""
"""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"" said the Prime Minister, ""and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown so much a week, you know, according to people's means sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."""
"""But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"""
"""Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."""
"Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery."
"Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked."
"After tea Lionel said: ""I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"""
"""Bless the child,"" said Nurse. ""You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."""
"So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now when Lionel cried out: ""Oh, what a worldful of books!"
"Are they yours?"""
"""They are yours, Your Majesty,"" answered the Chancellor. ""They were the property of the late King, your great-great """
"""Yes, I know,"" Lionel interrupted. ""Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."""
"""If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"" said the Prime Minister, ""I should not read these books. Your great """
"""Yes?"" said Lionel, quickly."
"""He was a very good King oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little well, strange."""
"""Mad?"" asked Lionel, cheerfully."
"""No, no"" both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. ""Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was er too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."""
Lionel looked puzzled.
"""The fact is,"" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, ""your great """
"""Go on,"" said Lionel."
""" was called a wizard."""
"""But he wasn't?"""
"""Of course not a most worthy King was your great """
"""I see."""
"""But I wouldn't touch his books."""
"""Would there were folk hereaway,"" thought Halvor, ""that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together."""
"When he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle."
"""Good evening,"" said Halvor."
"""Good evening,"" said the old wife."
"""But what errand can you have in coming hither?"" she went on, ""for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more."""
"Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to Soria Moria Castle, and asked if she knew the way thither."
"""No,"" said the old wife, ""that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything?"""
"So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the tree-tops, the old wife went out."
"""THOU MOON, THOU MOON,"" she screamed, ""canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"""
"""No,"" said the Moon, ""that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."""
"""Wait a bit still,"" said the old wife to Halvor, ""bye and bye comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."""
"""Nay, nay,"" said the old wife when she went out again, ""you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door."""
Then she ran on:
"""But won't you swop him away to me? we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to Soria Moria Castle."""
"That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy."
"""For now,"" she said, ""I shall be able to ride to church. I, too, think of that."""
"As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry."
"""Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes."""
"So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again."
Out ran the old wife.
"""THOU WEST WIND, THOU WEST WIND! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."""
"""Yes, I know it very well,"" said the West Wind, ""and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."""
Out ran Halvor.
"""You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,"" said the West Wind."
"So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up."
"""Well,"" said the West Wind, ""now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."""
"In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding."
"""Aye, aye, that I have,"" said Halvor, ""he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It'll not be long before he's here,"" and then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle."
"So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be."
"So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor. He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass."
Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
"""Who is most worthy to have one of us,"" she said, ""he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom?"""
"""Very well,"" said the crow, ""open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down and see."" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very quickly. ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach,"" said the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. ""Oh, jackal,"" said the Rohu, ""do tell me what I have inside me."""
"""How can I tell?"" said the jackal. ""I cannot see unless I go inside you."" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."" So off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. ""Oh,"" says the fish, ""do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.'"""
"The snake said, ""Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it is."" The snake went down: when he returned he said, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you."" ""If you do that, I shall die,"" said the Rohu. ""Oh, no,"" said the snake, ""you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again."" So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili."
"She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and they asked her what she wanted. ""I want King Majnun,"" she said."
"So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, ""An old woman outside says she wants you."" ""I cannot leave this place,"" said he; ""send her in here."" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted."
"""I want to marry you,"" she answered. ""Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for you."" Prince Majnun said, ""Very good."""
"""Pray to Khuda,"" said Laili, ""to make us both young again, and then we shall be married."" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, ""Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire, she and you will become young again."" When he touched Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again."
"And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother."
"Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, ""Laili, Laili, Laili."" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time with him."
"They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves."
"One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, ""Let us go through this jungle."""
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle."
"And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, ""I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see."" So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes."
"Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. ""I will only have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,"" said Prince Majnun."
"""How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"" said the father."
"""Then I'll not have any wife at all,"" said Prince Majnun."
"Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."""
"At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said to Khuda, ""Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'"
"and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun."""
"""Well,"" said Khuda, ""you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed."""
"So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal's garden. ""Now,"" he said, ""it is Khuda's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a little white dog."" He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form."
"Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when he married Laili."
"As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. ""Oh, look, look!"" he cried, ""see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us."" Laili looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness; but this only frightened Majnun the more. ""It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them."
"""What nonsense,"" said his father. ""Fancy two grown men being so frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten you."" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more."
"The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed."
"But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, ""What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!"" Poor Laili answered, ""Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more."" Majnun, however, said ""How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,"" and he was in great terror."
"In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. ""An old woman! an old woman! always an old woman!"" said his father. ""You do nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?"" However, when he saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back at night, he advised him to say to her, ""I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as you are?"""
"That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog, crying ""Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you."" ""Well,"" said Majnun, ""if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry you."""
"Laili said, ""Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on."" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and disappeared in the garden."
"Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit."
"""Oh!"" said the Prince, ""I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."""
"But Nurse said: ""Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."""
"Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all."
"Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: ""We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and everything!"""
"And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward."
"Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book."
"""After all,"" they said, ""soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it."""
"Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough."
"All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage."
"Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something. The question was, what?"
"The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all the creatures in The Book of Beasts could not be wicked, like the Dragon, and he thought: ""Suppose I could get another beast out who would fight the Dragon?"""
"So he took The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He could only see ""cora,"" but he felt the middle of the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: ""What animal ends in 'cora'?"""
"The Chancellor answered: ""The Manticora, of course."""
"""What is he like?"" asked the King."
"""He is the sworn foe of Dragons,"" said the Chancellor. ""He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago worse luck!"""
"Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had ""cora"" on it, and there was the picture Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written, ""Manticora."""
"In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well."
"And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty."
"The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with."
"At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: ""Nurse, wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more."""
"Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King."
"""Crying,"" said she, ""never did anyone any good yet."""
"""I don't know,"" said the little King, ""I seem to see better, and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I must try to see if I can't save the people."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said Nurse, ""but don't tear your clothes or get your feet wet."""
So off he went.
"The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden, and opened it very quickly, so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the page, ""Hippogriff,"" and before Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the roses."
"The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: ""But for the wings you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse."" And the Blue Bird's song was very loud and sweet."
"Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught up The Book of Beasts and jumped on the back of the gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the sharp, white ear: ""Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste."""
"And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise."
"When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think what they would wear for Court mourning."
"But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste."
"Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there is no sand all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a hundred miles of it."
"Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped The Book of Beasts and laid it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles."
"President Lincoln was not admired by a class of people in the North and South who heard with horror that he had at one time worked for ten dollars a month. They thought the President's salary too much for him, and feared that he would buy watermelons with it. They also feared that some day he might tell a funny story in the presence of Queen Victoria."
The snobocracy could hardly sleep nights for fear that Lincoln at a state dinner might put sugar and cream in his cold consommé.
"Jefferson Davis, it was said, knew more of etiquette in a minute than Lincoln knew all his life."
"The capture of Sumter united the North and unified the South. It made ""war Democrats"" i.e., Democrats who had voted against Lincoln join him in the prosecution of the war. More United States property was cheerfully appropriated by the Confederacy, which showed that it was alive and kicking from the very first minute it was born."
"Confederate troops were sent into Virginia and threatened the Capitol at Washington, and would have taken it if the city had not, in summer, been regarded as unhealthful."
"The Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, hurrying to the capital, was attacked in Baltimore and several men were killed. This was the first actual bloodshed in the civil war which caused rivers and lakes and torrents of the best blood of North and South to cover the fair, sweet clover fields and blue-grass meadows made alone for peace."
"The general opinion of the author, thirty-five years afterwards, is that the war was as unavoidable as the deluge, and as idiotic in its incipiency as Adam's justly celebrated defence in the great ""Apple Sass Case."""
"Men will fight until it is educated out of them, just as they will no doubt retain rudimentary tails and live in trees till they know better."
It's all owing to how a man was brought up.
"Of course after we have been drawn into the fight and been fined and sent home, we like to maintain that we were fighting for our home, or liberty, or the flag, or something of the kind. We hate to admit that, as a nation, we fought and paid for it afterwards with our family's bread-money just because we were irritated. That's natural; but most great wars are arranged by people who stay at home and sell groceries to the widow and orphan and old maids at one hundred per cent. advance."
"Arlington Heights and Alexandria were now seized and occupied by the Union troops for the protection of Washington, and mosquito-wires were put up in the Capitol windows to keep the largest of the rebels from coming in and biting Congress."
"Fort Monroe was garrisoned by a force under General Benjamin F. Butler, and an expedition was sent out against Big Bethel. On the way the Federal troops fired into each other, which pleased the Confederates very much indeed. The Union troops were repulsed with loss, and went back to the fort, where they stated that they were disappointed in the war."
"West Virginia was strongly for the Union in sentiment, and was set off from the original State of Virginia, and, after some fighting the first year of the war over its territory, came into line with the Northern States. The fighting here was not severe. Generals McClellan and Rosecrans (Union) and Lee (Confederate) were the principal commanders."
"The first year of the war was largely spent in sparring for wind, as one very able authority has it."
"In the next chapter reference will be made to the battle of Bull Run, and the odium will be placed where it belongs. The author reluctantly closes this chapter in order to go out and get some odium for that purpose."
CHAPTER XXV.
BULL RUN AND OTHER BATTLES.
"On the 21st of July, 1861, occurred the battle of Bull Run, under the joint management of General Irwin McDowell and General P. G. T."
"Beauregard. After a sharp conflict, the Confederates were repulsed, but rallied again under General T. J. Jackson, called thereafter Stonewall Jackson. While the Federals were striving to beat Jackson back, troops under Generals Early and Kirby Smith from Manassas Junction were hurled against their flank.[5] McDowell's men retreated, and as they reached the bridge a shell burst among their crowded and chaotic numbers. A caisson was upset, and a panic ensued, many of the troops continuing at a swift canter till they reached the Capitol, where they could call on the sergeant-at-arms to preserve order."
"As a result of this run on the banks of the Potomac, the North suddenly decided that the war might last a week or two longer than at first stated, that the foe could not be killed with cornstalks, and that a mistake had been made in judging that the rebellion wasn't loaded.[6]"
Half a million men were called for and five hundred million dollars voted. General George B. McClellan took command of the Army of the Potomac.
"The battle of Ball's Bluff resulted disastrously to the Union forces, and two thousand men were mostly driven into the Potomac, some drowned and others shot. Colonel Baker, United States Senator from Oregon, was killed."
"The war in Missouri now opened. Captain Lyon reserved the United States arsenal at St. Louis, and defeated Colonel Marmaduke at Booneville."
"General Sigel was defeated at Carthage, July 5, by the Confederates: so Lyon, with five thousand men, decided to attack more than twice that number of the enemy under Price and McCulloch, which he did, August 10, at Wilson's Creek. He was killed while making a charge, and his men were defeated."
"General Frémont then took command, and drove Price to Springfield, but he was in a short time replaced by General Hunter, because his war policy was offensive to the enemy. Hunter was soon afterwards removed, and Major-General Halleck took his place. Halleck gave general satisfaction to the enemy, and even his red messages from Washington, where he boarded during the war, were filled with nothing but kindness for the misguided foe."
"Davis early in the war commissioned privateers, and Lincoln blockaded the Southern ports. The North had but one good vessel at the time, and those who have tried to blockade four or five thousand miles of hostile coast with one vessel know full well what it is to be busy. The entire navy consisted of forty-two ships, and some of these were not seaworthy."
Some of them were so pervious that their guns had to be tied on to keep them from leaking through the cracks of the vessel.
"Hatteras Inlet was captured, and Commodore Dupont, aided by General Thomas W. Sherman, captured Port Royal Entrance and Tybee Island. Port Royal became the dépôt for the fleet."
"It was now decided at the South to send Messrs. Mason and Slidell to England, partly for change of scene and rest, and partly to make a friendly call on Queen Victoria and invite her to come and spend the season at Asheville, North Carolina. It was also hoped that she would give a few readings from her own works at the South, while her retinue could go to the front and have fun with the Yankees, if so disposed."
"These gentlemen, wearing their nice new broadcloth clothes, and with a court suit and suitable night-wear to use in case they should be pressed to stop a week or two at the castle, got to Havana safely, and took passage on the British ship Trent; but Captain Wilkes, of the United States steamer San Jacinto, took them off the Trent, just as Mr. Mason had drawn and fortunately filled a hand with which he hoped to pay a part of the war-debt of the South and get a new overcoat in London."
"Later, however, the United States disavowed this act of Captain Wilkes, and said it was only a bit of pleasantry on his part."

[1473] The cymbal certainly belonged to Demeter also (see Miss

"[1474] Psellus (_Quaenam sunt Graecorum opiniones de daemonibus_, 3,"

I cannot agree with Miss J. Harrison (_Prolegomena to the Study of
"Greek Religion_, p. 569) as to the importance of Psellus’ testimony"
in any respect. He appears to me to give no more than a _résumé_ of
"information derived from Clement’s _Protreptica_, misunderstood and"
even more confused.

CHAPTER I
HIS LORDSHIP
Madame Gilbert's war service ended when Austria fell out. She had been
in Italy busied with those obscure intrigues for the confounding of an
"enemy which are excused, and dignified, as patriotic propaganda. She is"
"satisfied that on the Italian Front she, and those who worked with her,"
really won the war.
"The war satisfactorily won, Madame Gilbert sped home to revel in the"

almost historical importance in the events of the German occupation.
But the reader must interpret its meaning for himself.
LA GUERRE
"Ma soeur, vous souvient-il qu'aux jours de notre enfance,"
"En lisant les hauts fails de l'histoire de France,"
"Remplis d'admiration pour nos frères Gaulois,"
Des généraux fameux nous vantions les exploits?
"En nos âmes d'enfants, les seuls noms des victoires"
Prenaient un sens mystique evocateur de gloires;
On ne rêvait qu'assauts et combats; a nos yeux
Un général vainqueur etait l'égal des dieux.
Rien ne semblait ternir l'éclat de ces conquétes.
Les batailles prenaient des allures de fêtes
Et nous ne songions pas qu'aux hurrahs triomphants
"Se mêlaient les sanglots des mères, des enfants."
"Ah! nous la connaissons, hélas, l'horrible guerre:"
"Le fléau qui punit les crimes de la terre,"
Le mot qui fait trembler les mères à genoux
Et qui seme le deuil et la mort parmi nous!
Mais ou sqnt les lauriers que réserve l'Histoire
A celui qui demain forcera la Victoire?
Nul ne les cueillira: les lauriers sont flétris
Seul un cypres s'élève aux torubes de nos fils.]

adequate knowledge of both Croce's and Gentile's work.

INTRODUCTION
Mr. Oliphant Smeaton has asked me to write a few words of preface to
"this little book. If I try, it is only because I am old enough to have"
had the privilege of knowing some of those who were most closely

DR. J. C. BOSE ENTERTAINED
PARTY AT RAM MOHAN LIBRARY
"On Saturday, 24th July, 1915, the members of the Ram Mohan Library and"
"Reading room received Dr. J. C. Bose, the President of the Library in a"
"right royal fashion, on his return to India from his Scientific"
Deputation to the West.
"There was a large and influential gathering, and the spacious hall was"
tastefully decorated.
Dr. J. C. Bose arrived at 6:15 p.m. and was received at the gate by Mr.
"D. N. Pal, Secretary. Dr. Bose then went round the hall accompanied by"
the members of the Executive Committee while the Bharati Musical
Association played excellent Jaltaranga Orchestra.

brilliant speech welcoming Dr. Bose and detailing the great services
done to the country by him.

"In 1796 (leap year) the numbers in the table of months, so far as"
"concerns all dates between Feb. 28 and Sept. 22, will have to be"
"_reduced by one_, owing to the intercalation of Feb. 29, which is not"
compensated for until the end of the republican year.
The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans
"reckoned An VIII as a leap year, though it is not one in the Gregorian"
"Calendar. Hence that year ended on Sept. 22, and An IX and succeeding"
years began on Sept. 23. Consequently in the above table of months the
"numbers of all days from Vendémiaire 1, An IX (Sept. 23, 1800), to"
"Nivôse 10, An XIV (Dec. 31, 1805), inclusive, will have to be"

"9, An XII, and Vendémiaire 1, An XIII (Feb. 28-Sept, 23, 1804), when"

The front matter is often put into type after the composition of
"the body has been completed, so that the number of pages is rarely"
"definitely determined at the beginning of the work. For this reason,"
publishers have favored the expedient of numbering the preliminary
"pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios for the text itself."
The front matter and the chapter pages running through the book
offer opportunities for embellishment and distinctive typographical
"treatment, and therefore should be kept in exact accord, whether"
elaborate decorations are used or the severest form of typographical
simplicity.

I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE POINTS
OF COMPARISON WITH THIS FELTON CASE.
"LOOK FOR A YOUNG GUY, BURT."
NOW YOU'RE GUESSING.
PRE-MEDITATED MURDER
"BY A PSYCHO, AND NOT HIS FIRST."
HE DIDN'T LEAVE ANY FINGERPRINTS.

Absolutely.

GO SEE EVELYN FIRST.
THANKS.
I SEPARATED FROM DOUG A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I TRIED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER FOR JASPER'S SAKE.
THAT'S OUR SON.
BUT IT WAS HARD ON HIM LISTENING TO US FIGHT ALL THE TIME.
"HE STARTED ACTING UP AT SCHOOL, AND THEN DOUG TURNED ON HIM,"
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.
I'M SURE YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
HE TOOK HIM.
"HE PICKED HIM UP EARLY AT SCHOOL ONE DAY, AND HE DISAPPEARED."
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?
"YEAH, EVERY DAY."
"BUT TECHNICALLY WE'RE STILL MARRIED,"
AND HE'S JASPER'S FATHER.
"SO WITHOUT A CUSTODY ORDER, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING."
"PLEASE, I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE COURTS TO SORT THIS OUT."
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM?
NONE.
"I HAVE NO IDEA, BECAUSE I'VE HARDLY SPOKEN TO HIM IN MONTHS."
DO YOU HAVE PICTURES?
YEAH.
"HERE, THAT'S JASPER."
PLEASE.
LUCY SAID YOU COULD FIND HIM.
I NEED TO KNOW THAT HE'S OKAY.
There's Tore back in his home!
Absolutely incredible!
In all my days!
Here we get a wonderful throw from a responsible champion!
It's absolutely fantastic.
It's a triumph for Stian Hermansen!
For a wonderful final stage.
- Look at him.
- He's hungry.
This was delightful.
It was an exceptionally tough looking game.
But we have a boy who refused to give up.
And that on the touchline proves to be a champion of responsibility.
- Brilliant.
- Tore is where he should be.
"And you can finally sleep, Stian, with a clear conscience."
- You're good at taking care of Tore.
- Yes very.
"Goodnight, Stian."

"OKAY, I WILL."
BYE.

"SIR, I BELIEVE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,"
"WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING,"
ARE FLUCTUATIONS IN GRAVITY.
THE MOON IS NOT CAPABLE OF MANIPULATING GRAVITY
AT THIS LEVEL.
"THERE IT IS, SIR, POSSIBLE."
WE WERE FAR TOO CONSERVATIVE IN OUR ESTIMATES.
THE MOON HAS MOVED INTO AN EVEN NARROWER
ELLIPTICAL ORBIT.
THE HYPERMASS WILL NOT ESCAPE OUR GRAVITY.
THE MOON WILL MAKE IMPACT WITH EARTH IN 39 DAYS.
WHAT HAPPENS TO EARTH?
"MR. PRESIDENT, AN ASTEROID NINE MILES ACROSS"
KILLED THE DINOSAURS.
"THE MOON IS MORE THAN 2,200 MILES IN DIAMETER."
THERE WON'T BE A PLANET EARTH.

And Bobby's gotthe magic like a goddamn rock star.
They climb all over each other justto touch his clothes.
He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Hmm.
Lfthings remain as they are.
He's got the anti-warvote.
"Or he'll steal it, like his brother."
"Bobby's a mean little son of a bitch, Edgar."
He had the I.R.S. Auditmy mother when she was dying in the nursing home.
YOU'RE DOING THE BEST THING.
"BELIEVE ME, I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."
"I'VE STAYED, AND I'VE LEFT."
SOMETIMES LEAVING IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
"IT MUST BE LONELY, WHAT YOU DO."
I COULDN'T LIVE THAT WAY.
"IN MY LINE OF WORK,"
I CAN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GET TOO CLOSE.
WHAT IF YOU MET SOMEONE...
AND THERE'S A SPARK?
WOULD YOU IGNORE IT?
COULD YOU?
"I WOULD, UH..."
CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE JOB DONE.
I GOT TO HEAD OVER TO DOUG'S.
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.
OKAY.
"WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG, SAM?"
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR TOUCH?
I DIDN'T KNOW DOUG WOULD HAVE A NINE-PIN DIMPLE LOCK --
"YOU KNOW, THE NEW KIND, THE KIND I HAVEN'T PRACTICED ON?"
"OKAY, MY FINGERS ARE BLEEDING NOW."
THERE'S SOME PAIN INVOLVED.
"YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE AROUND HERE"
WITH BARS ON ITS WINDOWS.
I WONDER WHAT DOUG WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT.
"COME ON, BABY."
THERE BETTER BE SOMETHING GOOD IN HERE.
THERE WE GO.
GOT IT.
LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH.
I'VE WORKED WITH LESS.
"Go ahead, 7 Mary 4."
We found the baby food.
It has been eaten by an infant.
We're in Tapia Park on Malibu Canyon Road.
We'll need our copter to get the baby out.
The canyon is all jammed up.
"Negative, 7 Mary 4."
The CHP helicopter is halfway to Palm Springs on a blood run.
Sheriff has a chopper out of Malibu.
Let's get it!
"10-23, 7 Mary 4."
This is CHP to Station B.
- How's it going?
- Hang in.
I'm trying to get a chopper.
"7 Mary 4, negative on the sheriff's helicopter."
It's at Aero Bureau in Long Beach.
Its ETA would be 20 minutes.
"7 Mary 3, contact UC paramedics and advise victim eight months old, weighs 20 pounds."
Ingested approximately three ounces of pudding within the last 10 minutes.
Respond with instructions.

They'll tell us.
"Hey, you know, he's cute."

YOU'D BETTER STAND ON IT YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
"HE MEANS IF THE OLD MAN DIDN'T KILL HER,"
IT'S LIBEL.
LIBEL!
YOU COULD BE SUED.
ANY NEWSPAPER THAT USES YOUR WIRE SERVICE
COULD BE SUED.
"WELL, WHAT KIND OF A WIRE SERVICE ARE YOU RUNNING, ANYWAY?"

"Blitzen, Washington?"
That'll be $31.10.
"Here you are, $26.40."
You're short.
"I know, but Dad was very tall."
You need $4.70 more.
"Oh, no, I think you're wrong, sir."
"You see, because last year when I came from Blitzen, Washington to Los Angeles, it cost $26.40."
"Now it doesn't seem fair to go from Los Angeles to Blitzen, Washington for $31.10, so I think something's wrong."
"Plus the fact, this is all the money I have."
I saved it up.
Rates went up last February.
"Please, I'm in a hurry."
"I'm sorry, lady, but..."

It was 10 seconds in an elevator.

"I'M SORRY,IT'S THE LARGEST ONE I HAVE."
I WILL NOT BE THE BIG GUY IN THE TINY HAT.
THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS PARTY I'M THROWING
AS HEAD OF THE PARTY PLANNING COMMITTEE.
"THE THEME IS ""NIGHT IN MOROCCO."""
THIS ISN'T YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S CHRISTMAS PARTY.
"UNLESS,OF COURSE, SHE'S FROM MOROCCO,"
IN WHICH CASE IT'S VERY ACCURATE.
"HEY,PHYLLIS,"
DO I NEED THIS INVITE TO GET INTO THE PARTY?
- YES.
- AWESOME.
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS PARTY EVER.
ANGELA...
"YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THIS FOR THE PARTY,RIGHT?"
IT'S NOT OUR THEME.
IT'S THE NATIVITY SCENE.
ALL RIGHT...
"YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CAMEL,"
"- SHEEP,ELEPHANT."
- HEY.
AND THE NORTH AFRICAN KING CAN STAY.
EVERYTHING ELSE GOES IN THE DRAWER.
I AM NOT GONNA JUDGE PHYLLIS FOR DESECRATING CHRISTMAS.
"THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO WILL,THOUGH."
AND PHYLLIS JUST STUFFED HIM INTO A DRAWER.
I NEED YOU TO GET RID OF THE TREE.
- BUT--
"YOU KNOW, UM, DO A ""DAY IN THE LIFE"" KIND OF THING."
"WELL, OUR MEETINGS ARE USUALLY CONFIDENTIAL,"
BUT I'M SURE WE CAN ARRANGE SOMETHING.
"LOOK, I GOT TO GET JAMES TO SCHOOL."
YOU GOT ANY MORE QUESTIONS?
YES.

MAMA'S GONNA PICK YOU UP.
YOUR FATHER SEEMS TO THINK HE'LL GO FAR
IF HE CAN HANDLE THE PRESSURE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME.
"OH, HE'S JUST SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS MOTHER, THAT'S ALL."
"MM, WELL, I THINK HE'S INTIMIDATED"
BY THE SIZE OF MY REPUTATION.
HMM?
HOW ARE YOU TWO DOING?

"Choices we made to survive got mundo, J.D. and me 1 0 to 25."
"OH, HOW ABOUT YOUR REPORT CARD, HUH?"
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN VALEDICTORIAN
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SUSPENDED SO MANY TIMES
FOR GETTING INTO FIGHTS.
"MOM, I DON'T NEED MY REPORT CARD."
YOUR FATHER USED TO GET SO ANGRY.
"I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT DAD, MA."
I JUST NEED MY STUFF.
"FINE, HERE."
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK YOU'RE KEEPING THOSE.
"NO, I'M JUST GONNA MAKE COPIES."
I'M GONNA TAKE A TRIP -- WORK.
"THE LAST TIME YOU SAID THAT, YOU LEFT FOR 10 YEARS, MICHAEL."
IT'S NOT THAT KIND.
"DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT LEAVING, MOM?"
WHAT?
DID IT EVER GET BAD ENOUGH WITH DAD
THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT LEAVING?
OF COURSE I DID.
"I WANTED TO KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER, MICHAEL,"
THROUGH THE GOOD AND THE BAD.
YOU KIDS WERE SO CUTE.
Sam:
"WELL, IT'S LIKE LUCY SAID."
"CHANCES ARE, HE'S PROBABLY STILL IN THE AREA."
"THERE'S NO RECENT CREDIT-CARD ACTIVITY, NO CAR RENTALS."
"THE ONLY BLIP, MIKE, IS WHERE HE WORKS --"
GREENWAY WORLDWIDE CARGO OFF OF 57th.
I TALKED TO MY ATF BUDDY.
"THERE'S SOME KIND OF INVESTIGATION THERE,"
SOME LINK TO ORGANIZED CRIME.
GREAT.
(COUGHING)
-What is this?
"-I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum."
"Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee."
DODO:
You'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"It wasn't a dream at all, it was a memory."
"This place is real, and so are you and so is the Hatter."
And the Jabberwocky.
"Remember, the Vorpal sword knows what it wants."
All you have to do is hold on to it.
"Fairfarren, Alice."
Perhaps I will see you in another life.
(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
"-Hello, Iracebeth."
"-Hello, Mirana."
(PLAYING TRUMPET)
"On this, the Frabjous Day, the Queens Red and White shall send forth their champions to do battle on their behalf."
"Oh, Racie."
We don't have to fight.
I know what you're doing.
"You think you can blink those pretty little eyes and I'll melt, just like Mummy and Daddy did."
Please.
No!
It is my crown!
I am the eldest!
Jabberwocky!
(WHIMPERING)
(GASPING)
(ROARING)
This is impossible.
"BECAUSE I SPENT MY YOUTH AND $30,000"
"ON WHISKEY AND DEVOTION TO THE JOB,"
"BECAUSE I HAVE A LONG-SUFFERING WIFE AND TWO SWELL KIDS,"
AND BECAUSE YOU AND I TOGETHER ARE GOING TO CRACK THIS MURDER THING.
MR. LOVING WANTS ED ON HIS TEAM.
YEAH?
"WELL, HE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE HIM,"
BECAUSE ED'S GOING TO HELP ME!
AND LET ME GET ONE THING CLEAR-
I DON'T PROMISE YOU A THING FOR YOURSELF.
NOT A THING!
"WELL, LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR, JON."
I DON'T CARE WHO GETS THE JOB.
"FOR ONE THING, I'VE BEEN OFF A CRIME BEAT FOR 5 YEARS,"
"AND FOR ANOTHER, I'M NOT GOING TO GET"
MY THROAT TORN OPEN IN ANY DOGFIGHT.
"NOW, ED, I'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO YOU."
"NANCY, TELL ED I'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO HIM."
Mildred:
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG...
JUST KNEW I WAS GOING TO FIND A FRIENDLY FACE DOWN HERE.
"WELL, MY FACE IS FRIENDLY."
HI.
"HELLO, YOU LOVELY PEOPLE."
"I ALWAYS SEE YOU TWO TOGETHER, DON'T I?"
YOU COULD DO A COLUMN ABOUT IT.
"OH, I'D LOVE TO, DARLING."
I'M ALL FOR ROMANCE.
HAVE A RUM ON THE ROCKS OR SOMETHING.
"WELL, NOW, THANK YOU, JON."
THAT'S RIGHT FRIENDLY OF YOU.
AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY FRIENDLY
"ROBERT, DON'T SAY THAT."
WHY NOT?
"IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?"
"WHEN YOU ADOPTED ME, YOU WANTED A GIRL, DIDN'T YOU?"
AND HE WANTED A BOY!
"NEITHER ONE OF YOU WAS SATISFIED, WERE YOU?"
I REMEMBER ONCE WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD-
8 YEARS OLD!
"I WAS HELPING YOU DUST THE HOUSE,"
"AND THAT WOMAN FROM ACROSS THE STREET CAME OVER AND SAID,"
"""MY, MY."""
"AND YOU SAID, ""YES, I KNOW."
"""HE'S EXACTLY LIKE A LITTLE GIRL, ISN'T HE?"""
"BUT, ROBERT, YOU ARE MY SON"
AND MY DAUGHTER
AND ALL THE CHILDREN I EVER WISHED I COULD HAVE HAD.
DON'T YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER?
SHALL I SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE MY MOTHER?
"OH, I HAVE SUCH A GOOD BOY!"
NOW I'LL BRING YOUR BREAKFAST.
YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY.
Mobley:
"AND SO, WITH THIS MOST HAPPY NEWS"
"ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE,"
I CLOSE UNTIL I VISIT WITH YOU AGAIN
AT 11:00 TONIGHT.
"IN THE MEANTIME,"
"FOR ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE OF THE LIPSTICK KILLER,"
"READ THE SENTINEL, WHICH HITS YOUR NEWSSTANDS"
WITH ITS FIRST EDITION AT 7:00 THIS EVENING.
Griffith:
DID HE REALLY GET NANCY'S OK ON THIS THING?
Shotgun!
"There's a road leading out of town, no one will find her for years."
"The lights weren't on when we left, were they?"
Ah...
Ah...
What?
Something I meant to tell you guys.
"Oh, hey guys!"
I know you.
"Yeah, Daniel Cooper."
You know my olds.
My Dad worked with your wife.
"Yes, I remember."
"And you were right, this place really is the backend of nowhere."
"Dad, Daniel's my boyfriend."
From Sydney.
MAN AS JACKIE ROBINSON:
"I AM PROUD OF MY BLACKNESS,"
PROUD OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF BLACK PEOPLE.
THINK OF ME AS THE KIND OF NEGRO
WHO COMES TO THE CONCLUSION
"THAT HE ISN'T GOING TO BEG FOR ANYTHING,"
THAT HE WILL BE REASONABLE
BUT HE DAMNED WELL IS TIRED OF BEING PATIENT.
JACKIE ROBINSON.
HOWARD BRYANT:
"MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,"
WHAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE WANTED FROM AMERICA IS
A SEAT AT THE TABLE.
"JACKIE ROBINSON KNEW ONCE HE GOT IN THE DOOR,"
HE COULD KNOCK DOWN ALL OF THESE CONVENTIONS.

"EVERYBODY SAID, ""YES, MR. ROBINSON."""
"HE SAID, ""NO, NO, NO."
CALL ME JACKIE.
"CALL ME JACKIE."""
I WAS SO EXCITED...
MY KNEES WERE KNOCKING...
TO SEE A REAL HERO WHO LOOKED LIKE US.
WE SHUFFLED OUR FEET.
WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY ANYTHING.
"BUT HE SPOKE, YOU KNOW, GAVE US KIND OF A PEP TALK."

"IT'S A LITTLE WORN, BUT IT WILL DO THE TRICK."
ARE THESE BULLET HOLES?
"YEAH, I BROKE IT IN FOR YOU."
IT'S A SHORT RIDE TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

"EASY,NOW."
"ASSASSINATION IS 1% SHOOTING, 99% PREPARATION --"

"USUALLY,THAT'S WHEN A TARGET IS ON THE MOVE --"
WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY VARIABLES TO CONTROL THEM ALL.
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.
"MICHAEL,WHATEVER HAPPENS, THANK YOU."
Johnny Roselli was one ofthe gangsters... who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
"No, I know his name."
Itwas Bob Engel.
"Oh, well, I know all aboutthat."
I don't understand that.
Track 2 is Chile.
"[Nixon] Yeah, Chile, the Congo, Guadalajara, Iran, Cuba."
"Whereverthere was need for an executive action capability, there's Track 2."
"In Cuba, Track 1 was, uh, the Bay of Pigs invasion."
[Chuckles] Track 2 was our idea.
We thoughtthat the invasion wouldn'twork... unless we got rid ofCastro.
"So we asked ourselves, uh, who else wants Castro dead?"
Was itthe Mafia ormoney people?
So we puttogether Track 2.
[Gunfire]
"Firstassassination attempt was, uh, in '60."
"- Uh, just before the election."
- Before?
- Eisenhower approved that?
- Yeah.
"Well, he didn'tveto it."
"I ran the White House side... and, uh, the mob contact wasJohnny Roselli."
One ofthe C.I.A. Guys was this jackass...
Howard Hunt.
Jesus.
Yeah.
"Not just Howard Hunt, but Frank Sturgis... and all those other Cubans."
All ofthem in Watergate...
"Uh, they're all involved in Cuba."
"Yeah, Hunt reported to my military aide."
"I don't know how much Hunt knows, or, orthe Cubans, but... you never know."
So you wanted Castro dead.
BY EVERY OTHER ONE IN THE COUNTRY.
"WHY, IT'S JUST ANOTHER MURDER."
I SUGGEST THAT THE LIFE OF A HUMAN BEING

"AND SLIDE THESE ON FOR ME, IF YOU DON'T MIND."
"THIS IS YOU, ISN'T IT?"
"UH, KIND OF HARD TO TELL FROM HERE."
"PUT THOSE ON FOR ME, IF YOU DON'T MIND."
"IN SOME SITUATIONS, A TACTICAL RETREAT IS YOUR BEST OPTION."
"LISTEN, WELL, I'M SORRY AS I CAN BE ABOUT THIS."
BUT A GUY LIKE ME DON'T STAY IN BUSINESS VERY LONG
UNLESS HE SLIPS THE FBI A BONE EVERY NOW AND THEN.

"AND AS SPRING TRAINING BEGAN,"
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT THEY HAD THE BEST LINEUP IN BASEBALL.
"BY MID-MAY, ROBINSON WAS BATTING OVER .400"
AND THE DODGERS WERE IN FIRST PLACE.
BUT HE WAS STILL A TARGET.
"BEFORE A GAME IN CINCINNATI,"

CLAIMING THAT JACKIE ROBINSON WOULD BE SHOT
IF HE TOOK THE FIELD.

"I WON'T USE THE WORDS THAT THEY USED, BUT THEY SAID,"
"""IF YOU SHOW UP TODAY AT CROSLEY FIELD, YOU ARE GOING TO DIE."""
"JACKIE SAID, ""WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?"""
"I SAID, ""WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"""
"HE SAID, ""ARE YOU GOING TO THE BALLPARK TODAY?"""
"I SAID, ""ARE YOU GOING?"" HE SAID, ""YES, I'M GOING."""
"I SAID, ""WELL, I'M GOING, TOO."""

THAT WAS DEADLY SERIOUS.
"THEY HAD F.B.I. MEN THROUGHOUT THE BALLPARK,"
ON THE ROOFTOPS.
AND THEY HAD A MEETING BEFORE THE GAME.
IT WAS PRETTY TENSE.
AND IT GOT PRETTY QUIET.

BRYANT:
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF ROBINSON'S GREAT MISSTEPS.
THE GOVERNMENT WAS USING HIM
TO DESTROY ANOTHER AFRICAN AMERICAN.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT STRATEGY TO HAVE
ONE BLACK PERSON CRITICIZE ANOTHER
TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
AND IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.
NARRATOR:
THE INVESTIGATION RUINED ROBESON'S CAREER.
THE SINGER HIMSELF DECLINED TO CRITICIZE ROBINSON

AS AN INSULT TO ALL NEGRO PEOPLE.
"MEANWHILE, ROBINSON CONTINUED TO EXCEL ON THE FIELD."

"STILL, 1949 WAS ROBINSON'S FINEST YEAR."
[NEWSREEL MUSIC PLAYING]
ANNOUNCER:
AT HIS ST.
"ALBANS,"
"NEW YORK, HOME, BROOKLYN DODGER"
JACKIE ROBINSON LEARNS THAT
THE SPORTSWRITERS HAVE VOTED HIM THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER
IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.
"THERE'S A WIFELY KISS FOR JACKIE,"
WHO LED THE LEAGUE IN BATTING AND STOLEN BASES.
"... congregateinparks, free from fear..."
... ourfamiliesmingling...
"... ourchildrenlaughing, our hearts joined... ."
"Until that day, we have no city."
You can label me a failure until that day.
"The first, and perhaps only great mayor, was Greek."
He was Pericles of Athens...

... andhesaid:
"""""All things good of this earth..."

Just livable?
There was a palace...
... thatwasacity.
It was a palace!
"It was a palace, and it can be a palace again!"
I've heard every single word of it.
"Her body was mangled, still wearing her cute school uniform."
"I heard she was pretty tough though, and she didn't beg for her life."
"Her last words were ""I'm sorry."""
I wonder who they were meant for?
It brings tears to my eyes!
Y-You're lying!
It's true!
"I wanted to show you a picture of her body so I could see the despair on your face, but I think I'm going to resist."
"'Cause you know what, the damage is written all over your face, Kashim!"
My woman in Tokyo!
I'm already too late!
"Aww, poor Kaname- chan!"
"She was such a nice girl, too!"
Gauron!
"That's right, I killed her."
Now hate me.
"Go on, hate me, Kashim!"

If you stay by my side...
I'll stretch my hand out

I want to be the light that protects
"Your fleeting dreams, your tears"
Break free from your cruelty-stained destiny
I believe in it
The other truth of my destiny
To another world
"It really sucks, working hard, struggling."
"If I just sleep, nothing will happen."
I was satisfied with that.
But... see...

"IT'S A HOMER FOR ROBINSON,"
WHO ONLY A MOMENT BEFORE HAD KEPT BROOKLYN ALIVE
WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE DIVING
THIRD-OUT CATCH WITH BASES LOADED.
NARRATOR:
THE DODGERS FINISHED THE SEASON TIED FOR FIRST PLACE
AND WOULD NOW FACE THE GIANTS IN A 3-GAME PLAYOFF
FOR THE NATIONAL LEAGUE TITLE.
THE WINNER WOULD EARN A TRIP TO THE WORLD SERIES
AGAINST THE YANKEES.
RALPH BRANCA:
SO NOW WE HAVE A PLAYOFF.
AND WE WON THE TOSS.
"AND CHARLIE DRESSEN,"
HE DECIDED WE'D PLAY THE FIRST ONE AT HOME
"AND THE NEXT TWO AWAY, WHICH IS ASININE."
YOU NEED LAST AT-BATS.
NARRATOR:
"THE DODGERS LOST GAME ONE AT HOME,"
AND THEN CRUSHED THE GIANTS 10-0 THE NEXT DAY IN MANHATTAN.
ANNOUNCER:
NEW YORK IS BASEBALL WILD OVER A CLIMACTIC WIND-UP
FOR THE SUDDEN DEATH GAME IN THE PLAYOFF
BETWEEN THE FALTERING DODGERS AND THE STRETCH-RUNNING GIANTS.
NARRATOR:
"ON OCTOBER 3, 1951,"
THE DODGERS AND GIANTS FACED EACH OTHER
FOR A FINAL DECIDING GAME AT THE POLO GROUNDS.
GORDON McLENDON:
"AFTER 156 GAMES EACH,"
"TWO MORE THAN THE REGULAR SCHEDULE CALLS FOR,"
"THE BUMS FROM BROOKLYN, THE GIANTS FROM NEW YORK"
IN THESE DAYS OF CRITICAL COLD WAR TENSIONS?
NARRATOR:
"THE HOUSE COMMITTEE WAS TARGETING THE SINGER,"
"ACTIVIST, AND FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL STAR PAUL ROBESON"
AND WAS SURE THAT JACKIE ROBINSON
WOULD REFUTE ROBESON'S CLAIM THAT BLACKS
WOULD NOT FIGHT IN CASE OF WAR AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION.
PAUL ROBESON: [music] HE DON'T PLANT TATERS [music] [music] HE DON'T PLANT COTTON [music] [music] AND THEM THAT PLANTS 'EM [music] [music] IS SOON FORGOTTEN... [music]
ROGER KAHN:
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A BASS BARITONE SING
UNTIL YOU HEAR A RECORDING OF ROBESON.
ROBESON: [music] ...
JUST KEEPS ROLLING ALONG [music]
HE WAS ALSO A SERIOUS RADICAL.
HE WAS A GREAT FAN OF THE SOVIET UNION.
AND HE SPOKE HIS MIND.
ROBESON:
I' AND YOU LAND IN THE JAIL...
I'
HARRY BELAFONTE:
"FOR ME, PAUL ROBESON WAS"
THE TALLEST TREE IN OUR FOREST.
"ROBESON STOOD THAT STRONG IN OUR MIDST AS THE KIND OF VOICE,"
"NOT ONLY FOR THE ISSUES AFFECTING BLACK PEOPLE,"
"BUT FOR ISSUES AFFECTING POOR PEOPLE, SAYING,"
"""THIS IS ALSO OUR SPACE, THIS IS ALSO OUR TURF,"
"THIS IS ALSO OUR COUNTRY."""
NARRATOR:
"BRANCH RICKEY, FERVENTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST,"
HAD URGED ROBINSON TO TESTIFY.
I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS
ON PAUL ROBESON'S STATEMENTS IN PARIS
I WANT A BALLPLAYER
WITH GUTS ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT BACK.
THINK YOU'VE GOT GUTS ENOUGH TO PLAY THE GAME
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS?
NARRATOR:
"BUT IT WAS A ONE-DIMENSIONAL PORTRAIT,"
HELPING TO SOLIDIFY MYTHS ABOUT ROBINSON
THAT WOULD PROVE STUBBORNLY HARD TO DISLODGE.
SO I HAUL OFF AND PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE CHEEK.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
"MR. RICKEY, I'VE GOT TWO CHEEKS."
GOOD.
[SPECTATORS CHATTERING]
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, JACKIE'S ASSERTIVENESS"
BEGAN TO RANKLE MANY IN THE BASEBALL WORLD.
ROBINSON WAS CERTAIN THAT UMPIRES
WERE TREATING HIM DIFFERENTLY...
"MAKING BAD CALLS, TAUNTING HIM,"
THROWING HIM OUT OF GAMES WITH LITTLE PROVOCATION
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.
"LATER, THE ""SPORTING NEWS"" WOULD CALL HIM A ""CHRONIC GRIPER,"""
AND HE WOULD BE FALSELY ACCUSED
OF KICKING IN THE DOOR OF THE UMPIRES' DRESSING ROOM.
EARLY:
HE HAD A KIND OF FURY IN HIM.
"I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC, IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM"
TO SEE A BLACK MAN ARGUING AND BEING FEISTY.
IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT
THAN TO SEE THE ROBINSON THEY SAW AT FIRST.
NARRATOR:
"MEANWHILE, BRANCH RICKEY"
IN HIS PERCEPTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DAY'S NEWS-
IT'S ALREADY ON THE WIRE.
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR.
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
"AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING, IN OUR CITY,"
ONE HUMAN BEING TOOK THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.
"IN OUR WORLD, ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE NOT RARE."
"AND SO MY EXCUSE,"
"OR, I SHOULD SAY, MY REASON,"
"FOR GIVING IMPORTANCE TO THIS PARTICULAR STORY,"
IS MY HOPE THAT THE KILLER MAY BE LISTENING TO ME.
FOR I BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PROGRESS TO THE CHAIR
OR TO THE INSANE ASYLUM
"THAT HE HAS REACHED A WAY STATION,"
WHERE HIS SICK AND WARPED EGO DEMANDS TO BE FED
WITH THE MILK OF SELF-IMPORTANCE.
"AND SO, WITH THE CONSENT OF A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,"
"WHO IS BY WAY OF BEING A REMARKABLE CRIMINOLOGIST,"
"BUT WHO HAS ALSO ASKED THAT HIS NAME NOT BE CREDITED,"
"I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW THINGS TO THE KILLER,"
FACE TO FACE.
ITEM 1-
"MR. UNKNOWN,"
YOU WILL NOT FOR VERY LONG REMAIN UNKNOWN.
ITEM 2-
YOU'RE HUSKY.
STRONG ENOUGH TO HAVE CHOKED TO DEATH THIS MORNING
A POOR SCHOOLTEACHER BY THE NAME OF LAURA KELLY.
ITEM 3-
YOU ARE THE SAME KILLER
"WHO, LAST WEEK, BLUDGEONED TO DEATH"
A GIRL BY THE NAME OF JUDITH FELTON.
See‎?
Everything is arranged‎.
‎
"- Thank you‎, Danny boy‎. ‎"
- Do not call me‎.
‎
- That's your nickname‎. ‎
- I do not want a nickname‎.
Everyone has a nickname‎.
"The Nelson's ""Ping Pong""‎."
‎
"- Simms is ""Judy"" ‎.‎.‎. ‎"
"- Wait ‎.‎.‎. ¿""Judy""‎?"
Yes‎.
Your first name is Cary‎.
¿Cary Grant‎?
Sorry‎.
I do not understand‎.
"Judy‎, Judy‎, Judy‎."
"He said‎, ""Bring me a baby‎."""
"No‎, no‎, no‎, no‎, no‎.‎.‎."
"You mistook Larry Storge‎, comedian‎."
He made a representation of Cary Grant Judy on stage‎.
"""Susan‎, Susan‎, Susan""‎."
"That said Cary Grant in ""Get me a baby‎."""
Exactly‎.
Thank you‎.
Good‎.
"I have no problem calling him ""Susan""‎."
Ping Pong‎.
You were promoted to be a charger to replace Kelly‎.
"Now you will work with the trigger‎, right‎?"
‎
- Clear‎. ‎
- Ongoing‎.
Sargento Atwood‎.
McConkie want to see you and Whitaker quickly‎.
¡Max‎!
‎
- Is it really bad or not‎?
‎
- Although you can achieve‎.
I bet it will be so fast that I will Pocotello‎.
Or you can exchange it for a new one‎.
Those are fighting words‎.
Do not ever talk about her‎.
What‎?
"Think you can with me‎, Daddy‎?"
Any day of the week and twice on Sundays‎.
"¿Ah‎, si‎?"
Sure you can grandfather‎.
You failed‎.
What do you think‎?
Look at that‎.
I have a Nelson in Nelson‎.
Sorry‎.
"Do not apologize to me‎, ‎.‎.‎."
‎
- Apologize to the girl‎. ‎
"- Sorry‎, lady"
‎
- She's a lady‎.
"I'm sorry‎, ma'am‎."
"It was very rude of me‎, and will not happen again‎."
"Jesse‎,‎.‎.‎."
‎
"- To the east there is‎, right‎?"
‎
- Yes‎.
‎
- Then we go around ‎.‎.‎. ‎
- Yes‎.
We removed the main road‎.
¿Cua is the situation‎?
The trace of a mile but escaped‎.
Go and check the grinder‎.
"Okay‎, guys‎."
Listen‎!
Let's take an alternate route‎.
So ‎.‎.‎.
Vamos a la 520 por Saint Andreasber‎.
¡Saint Andreasberg‎!
You're not going to leave you alone‎.
"Right‎, Max‎?"
"By Saint Andreasberg‎, then we'll cross the river‎."
Lieutenant ‎.‎.‎.
Come look at this‎.
Let us go up to the tower‎.
Let's see where we are‎.
Okay‎?
Yes‎.
Depart‎.
Come on‎.
Stop it‎!
Max‎.
Why do not you come and practice your German‎?
But they do not know how to wait‎.
Thank you‎.
"Hey‎, what's wrong‎?"
We have to take an alternative path for Saint Andreasberg‎.
"So we get to ""emptiness"" and go‎."
"Sorry‎, gentlemen‎."
We were told that the bridge is broken‎.
So we have to divert another way‎.
I do not mind the trip‎.
It is actually pleasant‎.
"But here we have a guy on the other hand‎, it ‎.‎.‎."
I'm not sure who likes shortcuts‎.
"You can go in the cabin if you want‎, sir‎."
I'm Lieutenant Goss‎.
Sergeant Jesse Owens‎.
"A pleasure to meet you‎, Lieutenant‎."
"Jesse Owens‎,‎.‎.‎."
How Olympic medalist Jesse Owens‎?
Exactly‎.
"Must be nice to confuse you with him‎, I guess‎."
‎
- Looks like a good guy‎. ‎
- Do you think‎?
‎
"- The man won 3 gold medals‎. ‎- 4 medals‎, sir‎."
Four‎?
It broke a world record‎.
I did seem to others as fools‎.
I can be liked‎.
¡Going‎!

"OTHER TEAMS WERE BEGINNING TO INTEGRATE,"
BUT NO CLUB MOVED AS QUICKLY AS THE DODGERS.
CATCHER ROY CAMPANELLA HAD HIT ALMOST .500
IN APRIL.
DON NEWCOMBE THREW A COMPLETE GAME SHUTOUT
IN HIS FIRST BIG-LEAGUE START
AND WON 5 OF HIS FIRST 6 DECISIONS.
BUT THE THREE MEN WERE ASSIGNED LOCKERS
"IN A CORNER OF THE CLUBHOUSE,"
"AND THEY SHOWERED SEPARATELY FROM THEIR WHITE TEAMMATES,"
MANY OF WHOM WERE STILL UNCOMFORTABLE
PLAYING WITH BLACKS.
[NEWSREEL MUSIC PLAYING]
ANNOUNCER:
"EBBETS FIELD, BROOKLYN,"
SCENE OF THE 16th ANNUAL ALL-STAR GAME.
JACKIE ROBINSON UP.
JACKIE RIFLES A SHOT INTO LEFT FIELD.
"THE FIRST NEGRO PLAYER TO APPEAR ON AN ALL-STAR GAME,"
THE BROOKLYN DODGERS SPEED MERCHANT DOESN'T STOP RUNNING
TILL HE FLIES INTO SECOND WITH A DOUBLE.
NARRATOR:
"IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPECTACULAR 1949 SEASON,"
ROBINSON WAS ASKED TO TESTIFY
"BEFORE THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE,"
WHICH WAS INVESTIGATING INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS
SUSPECTED OF HAVING COMMUNIST SYMPATHIES.
REPORTER:
"THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES,"
"ITSELF THE CENTER OF NO LITTLE CONTROVERSY,"
WAS DELVING THIS WEEK INTO STILL ANOTHER QUESTION OF COMMUNISM:
WHERE LIES THE LOYALTY OF OUR NEGRO POPULATION
- You forget‎?
You forget ‎.‎.‎.
How could you forget‎!
You're the charger‎.
You drive more than anyone on this team armory‎.
Do not know why I forgot ‎.‎.‎.
Remember that‎.
Or send us all to hell along with you‎.
‎
- Got it‎?
‎
"- Yes‎, Sergeant‎."
Sometimes I wonder what happens to you‎.
"You do not have to ask more‎, it has been confirmed‎."
The results of Barlow negative IQ arrived this morning‎.
"Here you go‎, Danny boy‎."
"Sorry for the delay‎, gentlemen‎."
But finally out of here‎.
Lieutenant‎.
Do you feel good‎?
I'm fine‎.
Just a little tired‎.
"Then‎, ‎.‎.‎."
What happened up there‎?
What made Shonbeck‎?
Good ‎.‎.‎.
It's a long story‎.
"I do not know where it came from‎, but we caught past the farm‎."
Shonbeck nos llevó al bosque‎.
And we were confident that we would be killed‎.
Teniente Goss‎.
12 kilometers is very far‎.
Take it‎!
I do not want to be the one chosen‎.
That would be very unfair‎.
It's simple‎.
"Now‎, if you do not want to consider my offer ‎.‎.‎."
I can kill all the a trip or push them until they do‎.
Very well‎.
"Well‎, Mitchell‎."
Move us‎.
"Mitchell‎, vamos andando‎."
Say prayer‎.
‎
"- Amen‎, Sergeant‎!"
‎
- Amen‎.
What is happening‎?
Last night the Germans blew up the bridge‎.
They flew around the area‎.
They have engineers working on repairs‎.
And the rest of the convoy‎?
"We let them take risks‎, but the last to cross ‎.‎.‎."
got caught between the bridge and the river‎.
Luckily no one died‎.
It will take all day to repair that bridge‎.
So what do we do‎?
You have to take the 520‎.
That is why Saint Andreasberg‎.
It has a small bridge where you can cross‎.
And how far is that‎?
About 20 miles‎.
It's like an hour‎.
You better wait here‎.
"WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM WHAT OPPONENTS COULD EXPECT FROM HIM,"
"ROBINSON REPLIED, ""THEY BETTER BE ROUGH ON ME,"
"BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE ROUGH ON THEM."""
RACHEL ROBINSON:
"JACK SAID, ""WE'VE GOT THIS THING GOING."
"""THE TEAM IS WINNING."
I'M DOING WELL.
"I'M GONNA SPEAK OUT."""
AND SO HE BEGAN TO CHALLENGE OTHER BALLPLAYERS
AND CHALLENGE UMPIRES WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE.
MAN AS JACKIE:
SPORTSWRITERS SEEMED TO COME DIRECTLY TO ME
WHENEVER THERE WAS A HINT OF A STORY.
THEY KNEW I WOULD SAY WHAT I THOUGHT.
THEY KNEW I WOULDN'T BACK DOWN IF I GOT INTO TROUBLE...
THAT I WOULDN'T WHINE THAT I WAS MISQUOTED.
"IT FELT GOOD TO BREATHE FREELY, TO SPEAK OUT WHEN I WANTED TO."
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, ROBINSON PLAYED BETTER THAN HE EVER HAD."
"BY MID-JULY, HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN HITS, BATTING AVERAGE,"
"STOLEN BASES, AND RUNS BATTED IN."
"WHEN ALL THE VOTES WERE TALLIED FOR THE 1949 ALL-STAR GAME,"
ONLY RED SOX OUTFIELDER TED WILLIAMS HAD RECEIVED MORE.
CARL ERSKINE:
"YOU KNOW, KIDS, THEY'RE HONEST."
"AND WHEN A KID CAME BACK 3 TIMES FOR MY AUTOGRAPH, I SAID,"
"""WHY WOULD YOU WANT THREE OF MINE?"""
"WELL, HE WAS HONEST."
"HE SAID, ""ACTUALLY I WANT SIX."""
"""IF I CAN GET SIX OF YOURS,"""
"""I COULD TRADE IT FOR ONE OF JACKIE ROBINSON'S."""

"- Danny‎, give a weapon to Lieutenant‎. ‎"
"- Well‎, I will‎."
"Simms‎, dame una 50th"
"Here it is‎, sir‎."
Where exactly are these Germans‎?
A few miles from here‎.
Very well‎.
"Show us the place‎, Lieutenant‎."
No sign of any German‎.
There are other places that we should review‎.
Good‎.
They will not go so soon‎.
Is a tank‎.
It's about 30 meters east of the road‎.
It is a Panzer ‎.‎.‎.
They leave well hidden ‎.‎.‎.
and always in position to fire‎.
And that is the chief command‎.
Klaus Shonbeck‎.
Is a retired tank commander‎.
Taught in training brigades‎.
Good‎.
"Apparently‎, ‎.‎.‎."
has come out of retirement‎.
"Hey‎, Mitchell‎."
Is everything okay‎?
No ‎.‎.‎. you're just leaking a bit‎.
"You know what they say: ""The old Helcats not leak oil‎."""
Yes‎.
Just mark their territory‎.
Everybodywanted Castro dead.
"You know, if Hunt and the others are C.I.A., why don'twe just dump this back in the C.I.A.'s lap, let Dick Helms take the fall?"
- Because.
- [Drink Pouring]
"Because Helms knows, knows too much."
"Lfthere's anyone in this country who knows more than me, it's Hoover and Helms, and you don'tfuck with Dick Helms, period."
All right.
"Butwhy, if Kennedy was so clean in all this,"
- didn't he cancel Track 2?
- Because he didn'teven know about it.
"The C.I.A., uh, nevertold him."
They just kept it going.
"It had a life of its own like itwas some, uh, kind of a thing, you know?"
It doesn'teven know itexists.

"- [""Fever""]"

- You nevertold him?
- I didn'twant him to getthe credit.
He said I'd stabbed him in the back... and called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
Fever if I kissed you fever if I held you tight

- Fever in the morning
- Feverall through the night

It was kind of a funny summer.
"During vacation, nothing but strange things seemed to happen."
And the boy a rose did see
Give it up!
That organ!
No‎.
Hold on to what they have‎.
And what about Nelson‎?
Has experience‎.
We can promote it and boot it in your group‎.
It is a good solution‎.
Let's go with that‎.
With Hitler dead and the Russians take Berlin ‎.‎.‎.
maybe this is the last action you see‎.
All this will be over within a week‎.

"Hey‎, Simms‎.‎.‎."
I like it‎.
It's a good name‎.

"After our troops crossed the line‎, they moved like 15 millaspor day‎."
These are the remains‎.
We can go home and the people of this country gets to see this‎.
Like driving trucks‎?
"As they say‎, it's better than being in the back of the bus‎."
Sorry‎.
I'm not familiar with that term‎.
It's what the bus drivers told us in America‎.
"Blacks had to be at the end of the bus‎, even if it were empty‎."
What kind of behavior is that‎?
In me it seems fair‎.
"That I say‎, sir‎."
What happened there later‎?
Back off‎!
¡Let's go‎!
"¡Vamos‎, walking‎!"
The City hunter... is you!
He recklessly ran around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor... became like that because of you!
You killer!
"Entered the country on April 13, 2011."
"On May 2nd, he came to work in Network Security and Communication in the Blue House."
"When the Blue House's IP was used during the Lee Kyung Wan incident, I met Professor Lee Yoon Sung in this room."
"When the Blue House's IP was used to hack the police CCTV system, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo came."
He was even there in the library looking for the Blue House Security Agent Album from 83'.
Is it Lee Yoon Sung?
Seoul Prosecutor's Office's Investigator Jang Pil Jae is here.
Okay.
Let him in.
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo was investigating two people he thought might be the City Hunter...
Lee Jin Pyo and professor Lee Yoon Sung.
Lee Jin Pyo and Lee Yoon Sung?
Lee Jin Pyo was part of the Special Forces team.
And before 1983 he was definitely a bodyguard at the Blue House.
"However, he went missing after that."
So Prosecutor Kim Young Joo thought he definitely has something to do with the Sweep Mission.
"He now uses a new identity as Steve Lee, a Korean living in America."
But that's actually fake.
He was a drug lord in the Triangle...
although it's not confirmed yet.
Triangle.
Then Lee Yoon Sung?
"As expected, another Blue House bodyguard in 1983 who came from the Special Forces named Park Mu Yeol, and a woman named Lee Kyung Hee gave birth to him."
Park Moo Yeol and Lee Kyung Hee's...?
From what I found out...
Lee Jin Pyo took Lee Yoon Sung when he was 1 month old and raised him in the Triangle.
Wait.
I think the president noticed something.
TO THE EFFECT THAT AMERICAN NEGROES WOULD REFUSE TO FIGHT
IN ANY WAR AGAINST RUSSIA BECAUSE WE LOVE RUSSIA SO MUCH.
"I HAVEN'T ANY COMMENT TO MAKE EXCEPT THAT ON THAT STATEMENT,"
"EXCEPT THAT IF MR. ROBESON ACTUALLY MADE IT,"
IT SOUNDS VERY SILLY TO ME.
IT ISN'T VERY PLEASANT FOR ME TO FIND MYSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC ARGUMENT
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STANDING OF THE BROOKLYN DODGERS
IN THE PENNANT RACE OR EVEN TO
THE PAY RAISE I'M GOING TO ASK MR. BRANCH RICKEY FOR NEXT YEAR.

- Good Morning‎. ‎
- Where did you get that‎?
Lo Tome por AHI‎.
I had to make something for my brother and thus prove I was here‎.
You know I'll never let you take it home‎.
Never say Never‎.
Did you find more treasure‎?
Behind the graves‎.
They excarvaron and left all these things before you leave here‎.
Speaking of treasures ‎.‎.‎.
"I have some novels you love‎, but want your cigarillos‎."
Here they are‎.
Are you serious‎?
Is that a fair exchange‎?
"No smoke‎, but read‎."
What is the problem‎?
Have you heard of the robbery on the highway‎?
All that crap you have a package worth just there‎.
These are hard to find‎.
All right‎.
What will I do with cigarettes‎?
That's true‎.
Do you know the Helcats‎?
Yes‎.
I spent two years training maneuvers in the field with 827‎.
I came here and started to be in action in November‎.
Does the 827‎?
Seriously‎?
It is part of Division 12‎.
Correct‎.
So where did they get the Helcats‎?
‎
- I have no idea‎.
Only appeared in March‎. ‎
- Marzo‎?
"We were in Togans for most of the war and then change us by M18‎, just 2 weeks of training maneuvers‎."
Why‎?
Helcats is that we removed in February and look at this log ‎.‎.‎.
and it seems quite familiar‎.
Seriously‎?
"¿Oye‎, Simms‎?"
What‎?
Think you telling the truth‎?
Which part‎?
Do you think your Helkath was run by a bunch of black guys‎?
No‎.
He's lying‎.
I know why I do not like‎.
¿Fuistes you who assaulted the officer with an ax‎?
I know some white soldiers assigned to your battalion‎.
You hear all kinds of crazy stories‎.
Always leave the Helcats unguarded‎.
"They are always looking for pissing places to sleep‎, hide‎."
"He thinks you are planning an attack at the school with someone, he doesn't know it's with me."
What are we doing here?
I'm getting you safe.

"There is something inside that box and they're after it, so where is it?"
Ben Grimes
What is it?
It's a list.
Sleeper cells.
"These codes go out, they launch attacks all over the country."
Where's the chip?
"Government wants this list,"
They're gonna have to pay up.

A CONVlCTlON APPEARED IMMlNENT... (Ruby) AAH!
Japonian martxotik aurrera iristen hasi zitzaizkigu heien antzeko sintomen kontakizunak.
Hasi nintzen susmatzen menturaz osasun kalteak handiagoak zirela telebistetan kontatuak baino.
"Ikerketan hasita, amak galdezkatu nituen, eta ohartu nintzne egoera zinez arriskutsua zela."
Hau martxo bukaera aldean gertatu zen.
Apirila bukatutakoan Japonia osotik hasi nintzen jasotzen hitz egiteko gonbiteak.
"Noan leku guztietan, Txernobylen gertatutakoen antzekoak entzuten ditut."
Haurretan oso antzeko sintomak aurkitzen ditugu.
Zu eta zure taldeak antolatu zenuten Japonian haurrentzako lehenbiziko kontsulta.
Esango diguzu zein izan zen gurasoen erantzuna?
Nola esango nizuke...
"Gure lehen asmoa zen besterik gabe gurasoei aukera ematea Txernobylgo haurrak ikusiak zituzten medikuekin hitz egiteko, lasaitu zitezen."
Baina teléfono deiak ez zitzaizkigun gutxitu.
Ohartu ginen konbidatu genituen medikuak ez zirela aski.
Berehala dei egin behar izan genien mediku boluntarioei.
"Hala ere sekulako jendetzak deitzen zuen, askori esan behar izan genien ez etortzeko."
Ikusten ari garen osasun arazoak ez dituzte erakutsi komunikabide nagusietan.
Baina SOS dei asko jaso dituzue.
Egia da.
Geuk ere begiratu dugu ea zer ari den gertatzen oraintxe.
"Fukushimako osasun kontsultaz eta osasun arazoen zainketa independienteaz egin dugu erreportajea; mesedez, ikusi ondoko bideoa."
"Fukushima hiria, Fukushima probintzian [zentral nuklearretik 60 kilometrora]."
Ekainean ekin zitzaion haurren osasun kontsultari.
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Fukushimako Sarea""ren ekipoak antolatu zuen."
Hasieran 150 haurrentzako behar zuen.
Baina eskariz gainezka zeuden.
"Azkenerako, 500 ume etorri ziren."
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Pediatren Sare Nazional""eko kideek aztertzen zituzten."
Nola dago hau?...
OK?
Ikus'tagun hemen...
OK.
Min egiten dizu?
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
Our good vibes are out for her.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, it doesn't."
BETH HOYT:
Who's the next one?
I just don't want to end up like my mother.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"""Girl, Interrupted."""
TED LEO:
"I would say ""Girl, Interrupted"" as well."
BETH HOYT:
You're both correct.
Points.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
We're going to drink anyway.
BETH HOYT:
You can drink anyway.
"Cheers, yeah."
Cheers because you got it correct.
All right.
I see how this game goes.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
This is not bad for boxed wine.
BETH HOYT:
It's actually quite good.

Hyung-nim!

Come back safely!
Be quiet!
I will get caught because of you.
"It's the first time you are leaving alone, so I am full of worries."
Hyungnim!

Ataman!
Help us!
My cow!
My cow!
Ataman!
Those bandits have taken away my last cow.
"What did you expect, you fool?"
Get freedom without paying for it?
Didn't you scream when you gave birth to children?
And you expect to give birth to a new world without pain?
With no pain at all?
I've got small children.
It was my very last cow.
Your last!
"Remember this, silly woman:"
"Today they took away one cow, and tomorrow... they'll give you back ten!"
"- What do you mean, ten?"
- Just that.
Who had all the cows?
Who?
Hona GurePlaneta-TBk ikusleengandik jasotako emailak.
"Eskatu genienean osasunean nabaritutako aldaketa ez-ohikoak kontatzeko, aste vbtean ia 500 email jaso genituen."
Sudurretik odol jario handia.
Eten ezinezko diarrea.
Eztarria irritatuta.
Neke handia.
"Ez haurrek bakarrik, adin ezberdinetako jende batzuek ere antzeko sintomak aipatzen dituzte."
"Masamichi Nishio doktorea, Hokkaidoko Kantzer Zentroko burua:"
"Diarrea, nekea, eztarriko mina, odola sudurretan..."
"Jende askok baldin badituzte antzeko sintomak, medikuek ohartu behar dute erradiazio dosi apalen síntoma klinikoak direla."
(emaila:
"""Estomatitisa justu istripuaren ondoren"")."
Ez dituzte mesprexatu behar sukarraldi baten sintomak balira bezala.
"""Txernobyl:"
"Hondamendiaren eraginak gizakietan eta ingurumenean""."
Liburu hau The New York Academy of Sciences-ek argitaratu zuen 2009an.
"Egileak hiru aditu dira, tartean Alexey V. Yablokov doktorea, Bielorrusiakoa, Sobiet Batasunean Gorbatxov presidentearen aholkulari zientifiko izana."
"Aztertu zituzten 2004 aurretik plazaratutako 5.000 txosten zientifiko baino gehiago, ondorioztatuz milioi bat jende hilgo zela istripuaren eraginez."
"Kopuru horrek 20 aldiz bikoizten du ofizialki ICRP erakundeak aipatu izan dituen ""4.000 jendeen heriotzak""."
Yablokov doktoreak ohartarazten du sudurreko odola eta guruin linfatikoen handitzea erradiazioen kalteen sintomak direla.
Ofizialki esan da Txernobylek 4.000 jenderen heriotza ekarri zuela.
Baina horretarako oinarritzen dira ICRP bezala industria nuklearrari lotutako erakundeen txostenetan.
"Ez dago garbi nork duen arrazoi [ICRPk ala Yablokovek], baina bistakoa da bien artean sekulako tartea dagoela."
Nola ulertu tarte hori?
"Begira, ICRPk izendatu zuen batzorde bat gorputz barruko erradiazioak ikertzeko, baina desegin egin zuten."
Zergatik?
Batzorde horrek hainbeste urtean behin azterketa bat egin behar zuelako.
"Baina txosten horretan egia kontatuko balute, gorputz barruko erradiazioen arriskuak azalduko lituzkete, eta ezingo lukete jarraitu energía nuklearra sustatzen."
"Jende asko kaltetu baldin baditu barruko erradiazioak, ... iruditzen zait garaia dela kontutan hartzeko erradiazio mota horren kalteak."
"Bideoan ageri denez, Interneten zabalduta zegoen martxotik ari zela zerbait berezia gertatzen."
"Baina orduan istorio horiek hutsalak edo gezurrezkoak ziruditen, zientzialari batzuek berehala esaten baitzuten aldaketok ez zutela zerikusirik erradiazioekin."
Horrelako giroan jende asko ez zen ausartu hitz egitera edo arazo horien zergaitiak ikertzera.
"THEY WANT TO BE SURPRlSED ABOUT THE BABY, BUT NOT ABOUT THE GlFTS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WAlT."
"I'D HAVE TO KNOW THE SEX. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU MEAN, YOU WlLL HAVE TO KNOW THE SEX. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S WHY SO MANY CHlLDREN HAVE YELLOW AND PURPLE ROOMS."
GENDER-NEUTRAL COLORS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PURPLE...
"FOR A BOY? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, KEVlN."
"THE COLOR OF ROYALTY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; OR A BABOON'S BUTT. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT WOULD BE SCARLET, I THlNK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALSO PRETTY ROYAL,  I SUPPOSE. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE POlNT IS IT'S BETTER TO KNOW, SlNCE YOU CAN. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CAN.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WlLL. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, WHAT DlD WE GET THE LlTTLE BUGGER? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW ABOUT A MONKEY? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WlTH A PURPLE BUTT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; OR SCARLET."

What?
"828 01:08:03,433 --&amp;gt; 01:08:07,900 You should tell me."
After me you were with him the whole night.
"829 01:08:08,000 --&amp;gt; 01:08:10,800 The house was on fire because of you two."

"Because, I..."

"HOW, IF YOU WERE COLLABORATlNG,"
YOU COULD SURRENDER YOUR OWN WRlTER'S VOlCE
"AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE COLLABORATlNG ON PLAYS,"
THE ONLY VOlCE OR VOlCES THAT MATTER
ARE THE VOlCES OF THE CHARACTERS.
"IT'S NOT YOUR VOlCE,  IT'S THElR VOlCES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE NlCE THlNG IS,  YOU KNOW,"
WHEN YOU REACH THAT POlNT IN A STORY OR A POEM

Well done to you!

"903 01:14:18,067 --&amp;gt; 01:14:21,300 I am sorry but I am not in a good mood."
"904 01:14:23,000 --&amp;gt; 01:14:25,635 Do you know what is your problem ?"

"914 01:15:02,000 --&amp;gt; 01:15:05,400 Hopefully!"
My mom is excited.
"915 01:15:05,483 --&amp;gt; 01:15:07,351 You should get excited, you."

"JlN Dal-rae, from Youngbyun, Yaksan!"
"Dad, you named me, so don't forget it."

"Dad, you're losing weight."
"Good morning! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's Ji-hwan, a friend from neighborhood.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

Hi!
Keep practicing.
I missed you.
Changed your hair.
It's pretty.
Let me walk you to the lecture hall.
That's okay.
Hey...
Took three months just to grab your hand.
Feels good!
Looking for Ji-hwan?
Yes.
I don't see him anywhere.
Hasn't come to practice.
Doesn't answer the phone either.
Hmm...
Do it for love of movies.
"Hi, how are you?"
"Good, how are you?"
"Excuse me, but..."
Can you hand me the tissues?
Damn!
Stop!
I'll kill you!

"1019 01:24:52,800 --&amp;gt; 01:24:57,700 The storm happened because of your prejudgments."
"1020 01:24:57,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:00,100 Anyway the water stopped now."
"1021 01:25:00,200 --&amp;gt; 01:25:04,700 Let's hope that a reverse wind won't blow lateen!"

"1026 01:25:37,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:41,700 How can I be so unlucky?"
"1027 01:25:54,054 --&amp;gt; 01:25:56,135 How're you doing?"
"1028 01:25:57,800 --&amp;gt; 01:26:00,400 Pretty well.."
"1029 01:26:18,951 --&amp;gt; 01:26:21,839 This is my last night here ."
"1030 01:26:23,059 --&amp;gt; 01:26:25,419 Really?"
"1031 01:26:26,400 --&amp;gt; 01:26:30,200 It means that after tonight everyone will be back to their world ."
"1032 01:26:30,381 --&amp;gt; 01:26:32,236 Exactly.."

"1036 01:27:20,398 --&amp;gt; 01:27:23,083 Where were you?"
"You took the day off too... 1037 01:27:23,200 --&amp;gt; 01:27:26,900 It was Nerges's birthday, I swear I stayed two hours."
"YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD SAlD SOMETHlNG ABOUT SPEAKlNG BRlEFLY"
ABOUT COLLABORATlNG?
"HOW DO WE DO IT?  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S THE HARD PART. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SAD ANSWER IS,  IT'S A GlFT."
I THlNK THERE ARE SEVERAL THlNGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF.
YOU HAVE TO SURE OF YOUR OWN TALENT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD RECOGNlTION AND FEEL SECURE.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE TALENT OF THE PERSON WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WRlTING.
"AND IF YOU DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE A COLLABORATlNG KlND OF PERSON... (chuckling) IF YOU CAN GET ALONG WlTH PEOPLE,"
IF YOU CAN GlVE UP SOMETHlNG YOU THlNK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
"AND ONLY FlGHT ABOUT THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THlNGS,"
"AND YOU TRUST THE TALENT OF THE OTHER PERSON COLLABORATlNG WORKS,"
"BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE WANT IT THElR WAY."
"WE COLLABORATED WlTH A WOMAN IN CHlCAGO AND IT DlDN'T WORK AT ALL,"
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T WlLLlNG  TO GlVE AN INCH
"ON WHETHER YOU SAY THlS IS A ""TAXl""  OR THlS IS A ""CAB."""
"I MEAN, ON THE LlTTLE THlNGS-- AND IT DlDN'T WORK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WASN'T A COLLABORATlON.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO."
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHlNG TO ADD TO THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH...
NO.
"ONLY THAT, UH, THE WAY WE WORK IS..."
"ONE OF US WlLL WRlTE  SOME STUFF,"
"AND THEN, TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER"
AND THE OTHER  HAS THE OPTlON
OF IMPROVlNG ON  WHATEVER HE OR SHE GOT
AND GOlNG ON FROM THERE.
AND THAT WAY-- ONE OF THE THlNGS WE WERE TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
DEBBlE WAS TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
IS HOW NlCE IT IS  WHEN PLOTS SURPRlSE YOU.
"AND YOU KNOW, WHERE THlNGS, YOU KNOW, COME UP UNEXPECTEDLY."
"WELL, THE NlCE THlNG ABOUT COLLABORATlNG  IS YOU SURPRlSE EACH OTHER,"
"SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY SURPRlSING EACH OTHER,"
YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF SURPRlSING THE AUDlENCE.
"SO, IT'S A LlTTLE LlKE CHEATlNG..."
Zuek kasu asko ikusi dituzue kontsultak antolatu zenituztenetik.
Guk ere informazio asko jaso ditugu ikusleetatik.
Emaiozue begiratu bat mapa honi...
Hemen saikatu ditugu jaso ditugun 550 informeak.
"Ikus dezakezunez, síntoma ohikoenak dira eztarriko gorabeherak, zehazkiago, eztarri minbera."
Hirutik batek aipatzen du arazo hau.
"Bigarrena da sudurreko odol jarioa, %20 inguruk daukate."
"Ez bakarrik haurrek, baina 30, 40, 50 edo 60koek ere, edozein adinetakoek."
"Hirugarren síntoma ohikoena, diarrea."
Eta ondoren neke handia.
Kausak ez dira identifikatu oraindik.
Baina kezkatu nintzen ikusi nuenean 500 jendeotatik bakoitzak antzeko sintomak zituela.
Zer uste duzu emaitz horiez?
"Begira, Txernobyl inguruetan leku kutsatuetan bizi diren haurren artean sarri ikusi ditugun sintomak dira."
Horregatik ez nintzen harritu.
"Ez da harritzekoa, zeren eta gure gainean sekulako erradiazio kopurua erori baita."
Japoniako doktoreak ez daude ohituta gorputzean arnastuta edo irentsita sartutako errazioarekin.
"Horregatik, norbait ohartzen denean zerbait ari zaiola gertatzen osasunean eta erradiazioagatik dela... ... ospitalera jotakoan doktoreek esango diote urduriegi dagoela, edo ez diote entzungo."
"Horregatik jo dute jende horiek Internetera, edo gure webgunera."
"Ospitaleko diagnostikoarekin ez bazaituzte konbentzitzen, hobe duzu sospetxatzea zure arazoak erradiazioarekin duela zerikusia."
Batez ere orain.
Ez da harrigarri guri emailak bidali dizkigutenetatik gehienak ospitalera ez joan izana.
"Sudurretik odoletan ari zarelako ez zoaz ospitalea, ala?"
Ezta jarioa handia bada ere.
Ospitalera diarrea larriarekin iritsitako askori diarrea birikoa diagnostikatu zioten.
Baina birusen testak negatibo ematen zuen.
Quite a few people came home with the cause of their problems unidentified.
"As has been the case with ""A-bomb bura bura disease"" and Chernobyl-related health problems, medical tests don't reveal any abnormalities for such symptoms."
"If you take a blood test, nothing abnormal is found."
But the medicine you got won't stop your diarrhea.
"So the doctor, not knowing what to do, keep giving you stronger medicines or antibiotics."
"But if the cause is radiation, medicines are hardly effective and the mdical tests don't reveal any abnormalities."
It's insufficient as much as I would thank you.
"869 01:11:20,359 --&amp;gt; 01:11:24,475 That day when police took me, I begged so much to Mr. Selim saying 870 01:11:24,475 --&amp;gt; 01:11:28,437 I entrust you my son."
"By God, God bless you!"
"871 01:11:28,500 --&amp;gt; 01:11:31,500 You're really good people!"
"872 01:11:31,700 --&amp;gt; 01:11:35,700 Mrs. Nevin, while you are here, 873 01:11:36,700 --&amp;gt; 01:11:40,400 I have a proposal for Yaman - Let Yaman stay here."
"874 01:11:41,600 --&amp;gt; 01:11:46,300 His average grade is very high, his placement scores are very high too 875 01:11:47,100 --&amp;gt; 01:11:51,500 in a good school you... -For example at Asim Sekip Kaya University... 876 01:11:52,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:53,500 Yes."
"877 01:11:55,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:59,400 He can gain the possibility for a 100% scholarship 878 01:11:59,700 --&amp;gt; 01:12:03,000 This is it!"
This is it!
This is it man!
"879 01:12:03,010 --&amp;gt; 01:12:06,749 But if he isn't involved in trouble again... 880 01:12:07,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:08,800 What do you say?"
"881 01:12:08,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:13,800 What can he say?"
He says God!
Oh I thank you my gracious God!
"882 01:12:13,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:15,300 Yaman."
"883 01:12:15,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:19,508 What can I say, of course it's great, but only if it's 100% scholarship, 884 01:12:19,508 --&amp;gt; 01:12:20,971 if I succeed in exam 885 01:12:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:12:23,758 You will succeed dot com dot tr (.com.tr)."
That's all!
"886 01:12:23,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:27,500 As school is close to here you can continue staying here now 887 01:12:27,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:30,400 No, I will come and go."
"888 01:12:31,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:35,400 Here is the possibility for you."
Work and win!
Ok?
"889 01:12:35,500 --&amp;gt; 01:12:37,200 Okay..?"
-Okay.
"890 01:12:37,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:42,100 My God, what kindness did I do for you that you brought these people in front of my son?"
"891 01:12:42,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:45,500 Ah thanks God!"
Thanks God!
"892 01:12:46,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:49,600 God bless you..."
"893 01:13:11,000 --&amp;gt; 01:13:15,100 Everything is ok, right?"
There is nothing to be taken or given.
"894 01:13:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:13:18,400 This time you beat the rap Mr. Faruk 895 01:13:18,422 --&amp;gt; 01:13:23,704 but we won't be so tolerant with you next time."
"896 01:13:25,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:28,200 There won't be a next time."
"897 01:13:40,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:43,485 Wow, did you dress?"
I will get prepared right away.
"1038 01:27:27,200 --&amp;gt; 01:27:31,500 I swear, if your dad finds out, I won't be able to save you from his hands 1039 01:27:32,106 --&amp;gt; 01:27:34,512 You have been drinking, may you be save from the bad things!"
"1040 01:27:34,600 --&amp;gt; 01:27:38,600 No, they gave us liquor chocolates, I swear 1041 01:27:38,767 --&amp;gt; 01:27:41,473 What happened?"
Didn't you prepare the table yet?
"1042 01:27:41,505 --&amp;gt; 01:27:43,470 Right away dear dad, just let me wash my hands 1043 01:27:43,483 --&amp;gt; 01:27:46,809 Wait, may you be save from the bad things, 1044 01:27:46,900 --&amp;gt; 01:27:51,300 may God make your final the best!"
What can I say?
"1045 01:28:13,838 --&amp;gt; 01:28:16,398 Don't, I am feeling dizzy, leave me please 1046 01:28:16,500 --&amp;gt; 01:28:20,500 Whenever I look at you I feel dizzy"
"1047 01:28:21,909 --&amp;gt; 01:28:24,593 I am setting it Kjazim, be patient."
"1048 01:28:25,200 --&amp;gt; 01:28:29,500 As you're setting a Sultan's table, I am starving."
"1049 01:28:50,791 --&amp;gt; 01:28:53,240 I struggled a lot for this organization 1050 01:28:53,321 --&amp;gt; 01:28:54,987 but it looks like it was worth of it ."
"1051 01:28:55,025 --&amp;gt; 01:28:58,547 Everything is wonderful but how can these come here?"
"1052 01:28:58,576 --&amp;gt; 01:29:01,826 Ender is humiliating your party."
"1053 01:29:03,300 --&amp;gt; 01:29:08,200 A fair needs for street's colors you know..."
"1054 01:29:20,275 --&amp;gt; 01:29:23,021 Ok mom, I will take care of it."
- Are you in bad terms with Mira?
"1055 01:29:23,100 --&amp;gt; 01:29:26,100 No!"
- Why you're not with her then?
"1056 01:29:26,756 --&amp;gt; 01:29:28,967 Don't suffocate the kid!"
"1057 01:29:30,268 --&amp;gt; 01:29:33,457 I will find the boys."
"1058 01:29:41,494 --&amp;gt; 01:29:43,825 Straighten your face now, please!"
"1059 01:29:46,029 --&amp;gt; 01:29:48,186 The night you left me and went because of this blighter 1060 01:29:48,238 --&amp;gt; 01:29:51,536 :"
I didn't go for anyone.
I left because you annoyed me.
"1061 01:29:51,600 --&amp;gt; 01:29:55,100 Don't blame the others for your mistake!"
"1062 01:29:56,264 --&amp;gt; 01:29:58,864 In fact, do you know which our problem is?"
"1063 01:29:59,727 --&amp;gt; 01:30:02,661 We encountered very early with you"
"1064 01:30:03,751 --&amp;gt; 01:30:05,910 So..."

"Don't, don't."
"762 01:02:23,755 --&amp;gt; 01:02:27,083 If you will cry like thisdon't play."

"764 01:02:37,800 --&amp;gt; 01:02:41,100 I couldn't leave him there."
"I paid his caution 765 01:02:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:02:45,400 She will be staying with us until his mom is released."
"766 01:02:52,830 --&amp;gt; 01:02:55,106 Who's that women?"

"772 01:03:49,832 --&amp;gt; 01:03:52,435 -You were awesome."
-Thank you.
"773 01:03:52,496 --&amp;gt; 01:03:58,155 I am afraid that this talent will fall away between these four walls"
"774 01:03:59,400 --&amp;gt; 01:04:02,000 But the music in my heart will never keep silent."
"775 01:04:02,100 --&amp;gt; 01:04:05,800 Because of I knowing that , I did something without asking you 776 01:04:05,942 --&amp;gt; 01:04:11,106 I wrote a reference letter for you to the New York Conservatoire."
"777 01:04:11,106 --&amp;gt; 01:04:15,395 I sent them one of your records too...- no.. 778 01:04:15,500 --&amp;gt; 01:04:21,400 Dear Mira, I want you to have an education which would make you happy."
You are very talented.
"779 01:04:21,600 --&amp;gt; 01:04:26,600 But I don't want to be a concert pianist 780 01:04:26,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:32,100 I just want to sing."
I want to do my own music.
"781 01:04:32,200 --&amp;gt; 01:04:34,800 Do what you want!"
"782 01:04:34,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:38,800 Please don't set up dreams which will never come true."
"783 01:04:38,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:41,000 It will make me unhappier after."
"784 01:04:41,100 --&amp;gt; 01:04:46,500 Are you going to be happy studying in the financial department of Asim Sekip Kaya University ?"
"785 01:04:46,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:51,700 My agenda was programmed, you know..."
"It's impossible to fight with my mom 786 01:04:51,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:56,200 I will study for finances at Asim Sekip Kaya University, later masters in America."
"787 01:04:56,300 --&amp;gt; 01:05:01,000 When I return, I will work in one of the companies until I get married 788 01:05:01,100 --&amp;gt; 01:05:08,600 Of course this is not a bad program but you you will be happy if you do what you like."
"789 01:05:15,428 --&amp;gt; 01:05:18,251 15 missed calls..."
"Orkun (5), dad (2), mom (5), Mert (3 790 01:05:18,251 --&amp;gt; 01:05:21,668 Ohh there is the fair!"
"791 01:05:26,500 --&amp;gt; 01:05:29,000 What happened that he took back his complaint?"
"792 01:05:29,024 --&amp;gt; 01:05:31,404 We don't know."
"-You scared us... 929 01:16:20,547 --&amp;gt; 01:16:22,697 I was scared too."
"930 01:16:31,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:34,800 Dad, please just a second."
"931 01:16:34,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:38,148 How are the preparations going?"
"932 01:16:38,148 --&amp;gt; 01:16:42,831 Don't ask from me something I can't do Mert 933 01:16:42,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:47,500 Dad, please don't send Yaman like this."
"If you love me, let him stay here a night more please!"
"934 01:16:47,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:50,900 You will come without being late, right?"
"935 01:16:50,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:56,500 Your guest can come too, please!"
"By the way, I am Mira."
Hello!
"936 01:16:56,512 --&amp;gt; 01:16:57,759 Hello."
"937 01:16:57,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:01,400 Mrs. Nevin, Yaman's mom"
"938 01:17:02,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:07,600 Is that so?"
Very pleased to meet you.- Me too.
"939 01:17:07,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:13,500 What a beautiful name you have, just like you... 940 01:17:13,600 --&amp;gt; 01:17:15,273 Thank you.- Mira!"
"941 01:17:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:17:19,100 Come on Safari, sweet."
"Err he escaped again 942 01:17:19,200 --&amp;gt; 01:17:23,400 I came to see where were you but... 943 01:17:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:27,500 I see that the problem still continues here ."
"944 01:17:30,504 --&amp;gt; 01:17:37,199 No, the problem isn't continuing."
To the contrary we're celebrating that we returned from a mistake dear Sude.
"945 01:17:39,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:45,900 Don't worry, we will be at the fair together with our guests a little after"
"946 01:17:48,100 --&amp;gt; 01:17:49,516 What fair?"
"947 01:17:49,516 --&amp;gt; 01:17:54,980 The foundation where my wife's dad is president is celebrating his 80th anniversary."
"948 01:17:54,980 --&amp;gt; 01:17:57,890 and tonight there is an aid night."
Everyone will be there.
"949 01:17:57,890 --&amp;gt; 01:18:02,000 I assume Mr. Asim will come too..- Of course he will be there too."
"950 01:18:02,060 --&amp;gt; 01:18:04,230 Wonderful .. 951 01:18:04,501 --&amp;gt; 01:18:07,827 We go get ready.."
"952 01:18:10,600 --&amp;gt; 01:18:14,900 Okay, then we are expecting you.. 953 01:18:15,600 --&amp;gt; 01:18:20,000 Come on ,Mira .- See you."
"954 01:18:22,240 --&amp;gt; 01:18:25,568 What happened?"
-We will talk with you later!
"955 01:18:27,800 --&amp;gt; 01:18:30,889 Come on, show your mom the room, I will take a shower 956 01:18:30,900 --&amp;gt; 01:18:33,500 No Mert , we are leaving.-Dad !"
"957 01:18:33,700 --&amp;gt; 01:18:36,334 Mr. Selim ,really we need to leave."
"958 01:18:36,334 --&amp;gt; 01:18:39,800 But look, if you go like this it will be like escaping as guilty, 959 01:18:39,915 --&amp;gt; 01:18:44,962 but if we go there as a whole family, all of us they will understand that all accuses are lies, 960 01:18:45,000 --&amp;gt; 01:18:48,100 and those who were up to something behind your back will be up a gum tree(surprised)."
"961 01:18:50,588 --&amp;gt; 01:18:55,066 If I were you I wouldn't let Mert down.- I love you."
"838 01:09:07,909 --&amp;gt; 01:09:11,238 We were in the first year at university when we got married 839 01:09:11,238 --&amp;gt; 01:09:14,728 Anyway I was together with them, during school."
"840 01:09:14,757 --&amp;gt; 01:09:16,957 He's funny."
"841 01:09:17,000 --&amp;gt; 01:09:19,900 - Am I lying?"
"- No, you're right."
"842 01:09:19,966 --&amp;gt; 01:09:23,428 I was 20 years old when I gave you the birth."
"843 01:09:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:09:27,100 God bless you."
-Amin!
"844 01:09:27,200 --&amp;gt; 01:09:30,000 No, I won't drink"
"845 01:09:33,200 --&amp;gt; 01:09:35,500 It affects my mom."
"846 01:09:35,514 --&amp;gt; 01:09:40,433 When I drink It starts playing a clarion in my blood."
"847 01:09:40,433 --&amp;gt; 01:09:42,675 Everyone understood it!"
"848 01:09:43,100 --&amp;gt; 01:09:44,741 :"
"It affects my cousin too, 849 01:09:44,741 --&amp;gt; 01:09:51,400 she has an increased level of endorphin in her body or something like that, with a single glass she gets drunk."
"850 01:09:51,502 --&amp;gt; 01:09:55,303 I have that thing increased then too, right Yaman?"
"851 01:09:59,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:02,536 You're a sound artist."
"852 01:10:02,600 --&amp;gt; 01:10:06,712 Ah mister who lost the artistry so that I could find it?"
"853 01:10:06,800 --&amp;gt; 01:10:08,700 I just sing songs... 854 01:10:08,900 --&amp;gt; 01:10:14,400 I brought up my children with my voice."
I earned my honor and bread with my voice.
"855 01:10:14,500 --&amp;gt; 01:10:18,500 When you were young you won a voice competition..."
"856 01:10:20,200 --&amp;gt; 01:10:23,269 err...in your childhood...I mean when you were major 857 01:10:23,269 --&amp;gt; 01:10:26,800 Be ate ease my kid, of course in my youth, I have wrinkles now 858 01:10:26,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:31,871 Not at all!"
"You're voice is very beautiful, Yaman told me."
"859 01:10:32,951 --&amp;gt; 01:10:36,227 Whereas he doesn't like me singing but 860 01:10:36,300 --&amp;gt; 01:10:40,000 Nothing like that, I just don't want you to work at night."
"861 01:10:40,179 --&amp;gt; 01:10:43,749 There is not any night club which works during the day, son!"
"862 01:10:43,874 --&amp;gt; 01:10:47,831 Thank you very much, I bothered you .May your hands be blessed!"
- Enjoy it!
"863 01:10:50,600 --&amp;gt; 01:10:55,100 When you're done we will leave! -okay."
"864 01:10:57,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:02,500 Yaman wants to walk away from us by running."
"- What a 865 01:11:03,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:07,800 I couldn't imagine a place like this even in my dreams."
Can one escape from here?
"866 01:11:07,900 --&amp;gt; 01:11:12,300 I wish I was this wall here so I would stay here ."
"867 01:11:12,600 --&amp;gt; 01:11:14,978 We can wait as much as you want."
"868 01:11:15,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:20,200 May God bless you."
"So, clearly, we had, at the time, a problem that deserved recognition."
And we recognized that lack of awareness was impeding a solution.

[Bleep].
I got it.
I've got it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Fire.
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We've got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stand back.
Just stand back.
[Bleep].
So it doesn't...
I've got it.
I've got it.
[Bleep].
"[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I yell fire,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and chef Ramsay comes over so valiantly."
[Bleep].
"Yeah, no, I just burned my hand &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when I had the clock there.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's fine.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Like a knight in shining armor.
- Everything's fine.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Brilliant. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Very brave.
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Okay.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You set the place on fire.
"- No, it's not funny."
"- You're right, you're right."
"Trust me, you've got your neck in a noose."
Be careful. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's crazy.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I think that's just the lack of experience. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're seeing a lot of people&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;who didn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to do trying to do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a little bit of everything.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

Whoo!
[Applause]
Well done.
"(Announcer) After observing and tasting throughout the challenge, the judges now take one final look to identify three standout dishes."
"Tom Hanks, Haley Joel Osment, and Robin Williams."
I'm going to connect together actors who were in movies together with lines that represents those movies.
"So Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a movie together called,"
"""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" that seemed like it was going to be very good but it was not."
"Bruce Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a movie together called ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America""--it was not a very popular movie."
"Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""The Terminal."""
"Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were in ""The Sixth Sense."" They were the stars of that movie."
"I will not tell you the ending, but Haley Joel Osment was also in ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks."
"Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Deconstructing Harry."""
"Cloris Leachman and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Gambit""."
"Danny Devito and Robin Williams were in ""Death to Smoochy."" All right!"
"Next I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Danny Devito, who were in a movie together called ""I'm Still Here."""
"And lastly, I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, who were in a movie called ""Billy Bathgate."""
All right!
"Now that we have the diagram, I'm going to start off with one of the actors."
Let's say Bruce Willis and I'm going to move around on this structure visiting all the movies exactly once and so let's see how that goes.
So there's lot of different choices to start off.
"Let's say, I'm going to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks to Stanley Tucci,"
"Stanley Tucci back to Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis to Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again, to Robin Williams to Danny Devito to Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment, and then to Tom Hanks, and now you can see that I've visited all of the movies exactly once and I ended up at Tom Hanks."
All right!
So let's try this again with a different set of actors.
"Now we've got Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts,"
"Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, and Meryl Streep."
And then we're going to put in some of the movies again.
"Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman who were in a movie together called ""Wag the Dog."""
"Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were in a movie together called ""Marvin's Room."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were in a movie together called ""Moonlight Mile."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Hook."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""Sleepers."""
"Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Stepmom."""
"Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts were in ""Flatliners."""
Nobody can tell from some of the movies and the actors that I've picked that I watched more movies in the 80s than I watch now.
"962 01:18:56,900 --&amp;gt; 01:18:59,383 If that's so, let's go and give joy to the fair 963 01:18:59,383 --&amp;gt; 01:19:03,900 But I am in this state, I mean my clothes are not so suitable, 964 01:19:03,900 --&amp;gt; 01:19:06,200 let me not embarrass you later."
"965 01:19:06,295 --&amp;gt; 01:19:08,652 We'll take care of it."
"966 01:19:16,600 --&amp;gt; 01:19:20,400 :"
One feels their self rich inside of this .
"967 01:19:20,700 --&amp;gt; 01:19:22,800 I wrote this favor somewhere 968 01:19:23,005 --&amp;gt; 01:19:24,661 They even talk differently."
"969 01:19:25,828 --&amp;gt; 01:19:28,584 One could be accustomed easy to this richness, 970 01:19:28,623 --&amp;gt; 01:19:30,383 One from me, one from you 971 01:19:30,424 --&amp;gt; 01:19:32,891 I say we should give an end to these deeds now ."
"972 01:19:32,891 --&amp;gt; 01:19:34,608 Agreed."
"973 01:20:07,962 --&amp;gt; 01:20:10,787 Have a nice time.."
"974 01:20:23,900 --&amp;gt; 01:20:29,300 Is this what they call a fair?"
- Easy!
"975 01:20:30,000 --&amp;gt; 01:20:33,900 We have 6 fairs per year in Tozluder.. 976 01:20:34,025 --&amp;gt; 01:20:36,100 all of them are ten times better than this."
"977 01:20:38,724 --&amp;gt; 01:20:42,106 Let's take fruit's juice ."
"978 01:20:43,200 --&amp;gt; 01:20:46,100 Hello, dear Eylul, did you see your dad, he was looking for you..."
"979 01:20:50,000 --&amp;gt; 01:20:52,500 Dear Gamze let's not walk around as a joint family."
"980 01:20:53,550 --&amp;gt; 01:20:56,308 See yin side of...°"
"981 01:21:03,732 --&amp;gt; 01:21:06,438 I have never seen so many rich people together ."
"982 01:21:19,300 --&amp;gt; 01:21:25,400 Mom, you stay here, okay?"
I will be right back.
"983 01:21:50,000 --&amp;gt; 01:21:54,900 I guess you would like this one in your hands to be real now."
"984 01:21:55,000 --&amp;gt; 01:21:58,700 It wouldn't be worth to spend my bullet for you"
"985 01:22:00,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:04,600 Are you begrudging Mira because of me?- Get out of my sight."
"986 01:22:04,900 --&amp;gt; 01:22:07,300 Nothing happened between us."
"987 01:22:07,719 --&amp;gt; 01:22:09,953 Got it.. 988 01:22:09,995 --&amp;gt; 01:22:12,295 the beating you ate was not enough for you 989 01:22:12,316 --&amp;gt; 01:22:16,238 If you want we can continue in a place, where is no risk of fire."
"990 01:22:16,866 --&amp;gt; 01:22:20,904 I don't expect you to thank me because I didn't give you away 991 01:22:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:22:26,600 but I thank you because you returned and took me out."
"992 01:22:28,019 --&amp;gt; 01:22:30,393 Get out of my sight!"
"993 01:22:30,500 --&amp;gt; 01:22:36,500 Someone who owes an apology to everyone shouldn't be so aggressive Orkun!"
"994 01:22:36,600 --&amp;gt; 01:22:41,000 We are aware of what you did and asked Yaman ."
"995 01:22:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:22:44,900 I am sure your family feels like that too."
"996 01:22:45,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:52,200 If they knew the truth they would have a big disappointment."
I am sure.
"997 01:22:52,269 --&amp;gt; 01:22:55,430 But as Yaman prefers to keep quiet about this issue... 998 01:22:55,700 --&amp;gt; 01:23:00,500 I will respect his decision too."
"999 01:23:00,753 --&amp;gt; 01:23:04,071 I want to help in compensating the expenses 1000 01:23:04,110 --&amp;gt; 01:23:08,110 I am happy to hear this from you but... 1001 01:23:08,200 --&amp;gt; 01:23:13,500 I will be happier if both of you work to renovate the house."

"Well, let's go write out the answer together in the interpreter."
"I'm going to start by defining my function small_words, and it takes a list of words as input."
I definitely want to iterate over each one.
"The problem definition said that we want those involving at most 3 letters, so those are the small words that we yield."
Now I'm going to add some debugging to see if I've gotten the right answer.
I'm going to use one of these list comprehensions because I love them so much.

It's real nice.
Yeah?
Been here all my life.
"Oh, no doubt."
Yeah.
Okay.
I've never been to Texas.
"I've been to Oklahoma,"

"Um, I haven't really picked a field."
"I haven't, I, I don't know, I've thought a lot about labor and delivery"
but I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Try that.
"That's what my mom does, labor and delivery."
"Oh, really."
Wow.
"Yeah,"
she loves it.
"She, she really, uh, enjoys."
Is she a nurse in Dallas?
"No,"
she's a nurse in San Antonio
Oh.
"but, uh, she's been, she's been working a, uh, on a late shift."
"She works the, uh, I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it."
Uh-huh.
She works the graveyard shift.
"And she's worked that for, oh, years, when I was small."
Um.
"Uh, I guess probably going on twenty years now."
Wow.
Really?
Yeah.
Have you ever been to a Cowboy's game?
"I haven't,"

"Um, it's pretty nice."
We we decided just to watch them at home
But.
That's good.
"At least you, uh, follow the game a little bit."
Yeah.
"Um, yeah,"
I'm not a fanatic about it.
I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are.
"I just like to watch,"
"and, and hopefully they win"
Uh-huh.
That's about the extent of it.
Yeah.
"Right now I'm in, um, college,"
"so I'm more into college football than professional, I think."
"Oh, I see."
"What, uh, school are you going to?"
"Um, I'm at B Y U."
"B Y U,"
okay.
"Yeah,"

It's the oldest town in Texas.
Is that right?
Yeah.
"Wow,"
that's pretty wild.
"We have, uh, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches,"
so we do a lot of boating on.
"Okay,"
so you got some lakes around you can do that on.
Yeah.
You do skiing and stuff

"and they're not, not used to it, you know, on a daily basis."
"They, they, uh,"
How old are your kids?
"Oh, from fourteen down to seven."
Okay.
You sound like you've got some small ones in the background.
One.
Is that right?
Our first.
He's about eleven weeks now.
"Oh, great."
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Where are you from?
"Uh, originally?"
Uh-huh.
West Virginia.
Okay.
"Um, I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country"
"but,"
I've been to Charleston.
"Charleston, West Virginia?"
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway?"
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"enjoy it, but not for profession, no."
Yeah.
And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good
I gave up.
Yeah.
"Course, my mom thought I was,"
"but, uh, you know,"
"Of course,"
parents always do.
"Oh, yeah,"
"so,"
They're nice that way.
Yes.
"Well, what else can we uh, talk about,"
"uh,"
"Uh, well, I don't,"
"so you listen to kind of church music, gospel?"
"No,"
"no,"
"I, I listen to K V I L."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So I listen to the radio,"
I like the pop music.
"Oh, yeah."
"I like people like Neil Diamond and all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like,"
but that's who I go for
"Oh, yeah,"
the jeezer music as I call it.
"Oh, the jeezer music."
Yeah.
"Right,"
"and I, I, I mean, I don't know how,  how old your mom is,"
"she's probably,"
"let's see my mother's in her early sixties,"
so.
"She's, she's about forty."
"Okay,"
"I'm thirty-eight,"

Uh-huh.
"No,"
"um, but it's okay,"
"don't ever let age,"
"I mean, I don't"
Okay.

"I, I just turned twenty-three, uh,  April twentieth,"
Uh-huh.
"and I'm still going, you know, oh my God, I'm getting so old."
"I just,"
"because me, myself, I just like to move really, really quickly."
"Yeah,"
"an,"

I'm thirty-eight
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
and they changed quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I,"
"this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago."
Uh-huh.
"And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know,"
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.
Uh-huh.
"Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it's hard to follow.
"Right,"
"and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL."
"Oh, I've never seen that one."
THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
"Okay,"
yeah.
"She,"
"I've seen a, uh, the previews for that."
It's very good.
"It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is it, uh, HANDYMAN."
"That's not what, uh,"
HOME IMPROVEMENT.
"Oh, we never miss that,"
or we try not to miss that.
"It's hysterical, isn't it?"
"Oh, we think it is, so funny."
Did you catch the Christmas?
"Oh, just part of it"
"I thought it was, you know,"
"and it had such a good story, too."
Uh-huh.
Did you see the end of it?
No.
"IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was."
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Are, you're a real life Trekkie?"
I think so
I really like them.
"I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,"
but
Uh-huh.
"uh,"
"Well, I've gone to, you know, one for real live Trek Convention"
"but,"
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"I saw James Doohan, you know, the guy that plays, uh, Scotty."
"Huh, did you get to talk to him?"
No
It was crowded.
Not in a crowd like that.
Huh-uh.
No.
"It was like, uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours."
Yeah.
Wow.
It was a pretty crowded place.
Huh. They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I,"
"it's, it's kind of funny."
"I, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. Uh, trying to think,"
"I can't quite remember the name of the book,"
We had a house in Port Aransas.
Oh okay.

"That's close to, uh, South Padre."
"Well, uh, South Padre is on down the bend"
Oh Corpus.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
"it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down, it would be in that region."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Small island.
Yeah.
"Uh,"
Yeah.
"I, I've been to Port Aransas"
"but, it was when I was a child."
"Oh, okay."
"Yes,"
"because I have relatives who live in Houston,"
"so when would go, and we would go to Port Aransas or then, on down to Corpus or further,"
"yeah,"
like what your talking about.
"Because I was just wondering, we went to Galveston this, this summer, even with all the oil spills and everything,"
"I mean, I was, oh, it was horrible."
Was it bad?
"I well never, ever go back."
"I don't think. Uh,"
"Oh, I hate to hear that."
"and,"
"yeah,"
"Um. Okay,"

what would you say?
"Well, I'd encourage it."
Uh-huh.
"I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California."
Did you?
"And that was, uh, California,"
"I was thrilled to death, because that's, you know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, you know,"
"and, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York"
"Oh, really."
and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning
"and I'll get people you know, from out of the, uh, out of the state."
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California."

"Huh, rough type, huh"
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh.
"Oh, yeah,"
motor homes can be a lot of fun.
"Yeah,"
they really are.
Yeah.
They really are.

"I've never actually done any, uh, like tent camping,"
"Uh, that can be a lot of fun, too."
Yeah.
How about you?
"Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping."
Uh-huh.
"This summer we went to, uh, the Smokey Mountain National Park. And, uh, stayed about three or four days in there."
"Oh, how great."
It was wonderful.
"Oh, yeah."
Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable.
Um.
And the days were nice and warm
"and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days."
Uh-huh.
That's great.
"my family, uh, didn't like Texas,"
"and I had a chance to, uh, transfer up."
"T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in ."
That's nice.
"So I got an opportunity to transfer back,"
and I took it.
"God,"
that's great.
"Uh, I'm a native Texan."
Uh-huh.
West Texan.
Yeah.
There is a difference.
"Yeah,"
"believe me,"
I know there is.
"I lived in Plano,"
and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano
Yeah.
"but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas."
Everybody else was an import.
"Well, I'm a West Texan."
Uh-huh.
"Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle."
Yes.
Yeah.
A different world from down there.
Yeah.
"So, uh, Colorado's been fun."
But they have a real problem.
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.
"And every time you look at a, look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar."
And she really enjoys it.
She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
"and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives"
Uh-huh.
and she's really enjoying herself.
She really likes it.
"Well, that's great."
"Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree."
Oh thanks
Hope you'll like it.
Yeah.
"Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?"
"Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas."
"Right now I'm in Utah, of course."
"Oh, uh-huh"
"So, um,"
"but, my family's there,"
"so,"
"yeah,"
I'd like to go back.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh, base of hospitals."
"Uh, I don't know about Dallas."
I think Dallas is pretty scattered.
Are you in San Antonio?
"No,"
"I'm, I'm in Dallas"
"Oh, okay."
but I'm originally from San Antonio
Um.
"and they've got large medical, uh, center down there."

Everybody
Yeah.
Yep.
That would have to be a blast.
"Yeah,"
"it really was, it was great."
"What,"
"well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area?"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"We went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon, again"
"and we stopped at, uh, uh, Las Vegas for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into Malibu in California over on the coast."
Yeah.
"And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, to, uh, Sequoia National Park."
Okay.
"Oh, wow."
"Okay,"
"Big Sur Highway, that's, uh, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, um,"
do you have any pets now?
"Well, we don't right now,"
no.
"We've, uh,"
"I grew up with, uh, with pets."
"My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,  some,  birds,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, right now we don't have anything."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, that,"
What about you?
"a matter of choice, or compulsion?"
"I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,"
"but that was years,"
"Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors."
Yeah.
"Some that, she had to, uh, label everything"
She had to label everything.
Yeah
"because,"
What was she driving?
It was a Cadillac.
Uh-huh.
"And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
and they quit making it.
Yeah.
They rebuilt it
"and it never did, never did run right again."
"Yeah,"
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
Yeah.
"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"

Yeah.
"They,"
The starters are kind of fragile.
Yeah
"and the,"
and have a happy Thanksgiving.

Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"The way,"
I'll go ahead and start
"the way I work, uh, the way I dress for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie,"
Uh-huh.
"or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day."
Uh-huh.
"A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day."
"I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, it was very different before."
How do you dress?
"Well, I'm a drafter,"
so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and I have sweatshirt on today.
Uh-huh.
And that's pretty much the norm for me.
"If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked"
"Yeah,"
I understand.
"They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress"
and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately
Once every five years?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, you have got a pretty big family."
Yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.
"Oh, yeah."
And you?
"Yeah,"
"we have a pretty big family,"
"but most of us,"
"well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia."
Uh-huh.
"Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania."
Yeah.
Most everybody is right in that area.
That makes it a lot easier.
A lot more convenient.
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.
Yeah.
because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
Yeah.
They put one together for our family about once every June.
"It was on my grandmother's birthday,"
"but she is, she is gone now."
"Yeah,"
see that is kind of what happened with ours.
That is why we have not had one in a long time.
Yeah.
Uh.
"So, so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do."
"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it was a wonderful environment.
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
Uh-huh.
I see.
"So, it worked well."
Oh.
How about you?
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
Yeah.
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
Uh-huh.
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
"Right,"
like half day programs.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
and this is one of the few churches that did it.
There were a couple downtown Dallas
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
and you can do a
it makes things very convenient.
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I've never tried using that,"
I don't know too much about it.
"What about,"
"have you, did you use commercially available software"
"or,"
"I have, I have used Lotus."
"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I,"
not heavy use.
"I've used, uh, D Base"
"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
I've been through three classes
Uh-huh.
and I have a great deal of respect for it.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
I do some
Uh-huh.
"and I,"
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
"I've never used D Base, um,"
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."

The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Jain calendar is known as Vira Nirvana Samvat and their year 2501 started with Diwali of year 1974. The Jain business people traditionally start their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:<br>
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया|<br>
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया||
Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.
"On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples across the world. The most important principle of Jains is Ahinsa or non violence, thus they tend to avoid firecrackers during Diwali as they cause harm to living organisms. Diwali is celebrated in atmosphere of austerity, simplicity, serenity, equity, calmness, charity, philanthropy and environment-consciousness. Jain temples, homes, offices, shops are decorated with lights and diyas. Relatives distribute sweets to each other. The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Swetambar jains observe two days of fasting in remembrance of the penance and sacrifice of Mahavira. In temples and homes, devotees sing and chant hymns and mantras from Jain religious texts in praise of the Tirthankar and congregate for a prayer and recite verses from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which contain the last teachings of Mahavira. Jains pay visit to Pawapuri,Nalanda in Bihar on this special day to offer their prayers. The Jain year starts with Pratipada, next day of Diwali."

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

"The Marion Football Club is an Australian rules football club first formed in 1891 as the Sturt Football Club (no relation to the SANFL’s Sturt Football Club). In 1912, Sturt joined the Sturt Football Association, playing against the Blackwood, Mitcham, Brighton, Sturt Ramblers and Glenelg Imperials clubs."
"In 1920, Sturt joined the Mid-Southern Football Association along with Blackwood and Brighton, winning the Premiership that season. The Mid-Southern Football Association became the Glenelg District Football Association in 1931, with Sturt once again winning the first premiership."
"During the Second World War, Sturt combined with the Brighton and Seacliff club from 1942 to 1945, winning two premierships as a combined entity."
"In 1956, Sturt renamed itself the Marion Football Club to avoid confusion with the SANFL team of the same name. Marion continued in the competition known as the Glenelg District Football Association, Glenelg-South-West District Football Association, Glenelg-South Adelaide Football Association and finally the Southern Metropolitan Football League until it folded at the end of the 1986 season."
"In 1987, Marion joined the Southern Football League Division 1 competition. In 2018 Marion joined the SAAFL in Division 7."
"Marion's Guernsey is predominantly green with a gold sash, like Richmond's Guernsey in the AFL. In 2018 the Rams will wear a new Guernsey design."
"Marion FC has produced one Australian Football League (AFL) player, Scott Welsh, formerly of the North Melbourne, Adelaide, and Western Bulldogs clubs."

"Anita Baldwin sold the land to the County of Los Angeles for $92,000 in 1918. A sand green golf course appeared following the closure of the school and Arcadia citizens took it over and operated it as a highly successful club."
"In 1935, through an act of Congress, the United States Department of War deeded 185 acres to Los Angeles County with the provision that it be used as a park and recreation center. The redevelopment of Ross Field was a Works Progress Administration project that included not just the golf course but a swimming pool, tennis courts, two baseball fields, a children's playground, and a lawn bowling complex."
"The Santa Anita Golf course opened in two stages. Nine holes were opened in April 1938 and the complete 18 opened on October 12, 1938."
"1938 also saw the birth of the Santa Anita Open—held each year until 1955, in the middle of October, to celebrate the opening of the Golf Course and to start the official Winter Golf Tournament season in Southern California. Prize money that first year was $1,000. Frank Moninger personally underwrote the first two tournaments. The Santa Anita Golf Club with the help of a few individual golfers underwrote the next few events. The County donated the Golf Course for the Santa Anita Open. The Course Record established in the days of ""The Open"" is 62 - held by Ellsworth Vines. Lloyd Mangrum won the first and second Opens with 274 and 278. Par at that time was 70."
In the 1960s the 9th hole was altered to make way for the construction of a baseball field at Arcadia Park. The original tee box was re-positioned to the South West of its original location and the hole was lengthened and turned into a par 5 thus changing par at the course to 71. The original dog leg left configuration and chute of trees has been lost and the hole now plays due east and relatively straight. Additionally significant changes were made to the short 281 yard par 4 17th hole where the large expanse of sand on the left side (south) was replaced with grass. The hole retains its name from the time (Desert) but has lost much character and altered the strategic challenge of its original configuration. Other changes from the era include the removal of several bunkers on the Par 5 Third hole and the sandy waste area between the 10th and 18th holes.
As part of the change in management in 1986 commitments were made to increase secondary facilities (clubhouse and dining) as well as substantive changes to the course itself during 1990-1991. The first hole and the driving range were swapped for safety reasons as errant shots from the range threatened cars on Santa Anita Avenue. The original dog leg left 1st hole was shortened from 409 yards to the current 367 yards. The 18th Green was moved forward to make way for clubhouse construction but the total yardage remained the same as the tee box was lengthened.
"During the 2000-2010 period small modifications were made to return a single bunker to the right of the 3rd hole (where the original design had three) and a large bunker in the center of the fairway of that same hole. Tee boxes on the 4th, 7th and 17th holes were modified. The detached tee boxes on 7th and 17th are seldom if ever used in open play though are occasionally used in tournament play."
"The current record is held by Blake Moore of Monrovia, California who shot a 9 under par 62 on Sunday, July 20, 2003. Moore is attributed with the current record as mentioned above several holes have been changed since ""The Open"" era and the course is now a par 71 rather than the original par 70."
