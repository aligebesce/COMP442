"Nine, fifty six  square root."
Er
Who taught you that?
"Well, I lis no one."
It's Mrs  said to Mark
Just a minute.
"he, he, he was getting the  controls wrong."
He pressed square root instead of equals .
Yes.
And so you've discovered
Eh!
"the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine."
But do you know what square root means?
What?
Well the square root of a number
Yes.
is the number which if multiplied by itself
Yes.
gives you back the number you started with.
"Take, for , the easiest one is  four."
The square root of four is two.
Try it on your machine.
Right.
What do I press?
"Four  four, square root  and it gives you two."
Because two times two  gives you four.
And thi and this
All the blokes on the one night on  they used to go in there.
They didn't!
I assure you they did  it's hard  working down there for so long it

"What, why have you put down that you have your regional accent and I have an Irish accent?"
I haven't.
"Well, you can't tell that I'm Irish but I can tell you're Irish."
Oh.
How can you do that?
I I  .
You're you're a frigging idiot you are.
How do you know that people can't tell you're Irish?
Nobody can.
Nobody can tell  that I'm Irish.
Only when I swear.
And you know I don't swear very often.
No.
Erm
kids  anyway.
But that could change when Patricia comes in.
And what  does erm why does Brian and Patricia not have a regional accent?
Well I don't think they have.
Think a brummie accent.
"They haven't got a brummie accent, no."
No.

Mm.
I'm only putting the truth down as I see it.

Mhm.
Oh
Why?

No cos it'll drown the microphone.
Oh!

Yeah.
But the weather was terrible.
"I was driving through what, eighteen inches of water."
Yeah  when you go through Switzerland.
Yeah.
It seems to be following you.
Yeah well Switzerland weren't too bad cos the road surfaces are pretty good.
Yeah.
But in Italy there's no drainage.
Ooh.
"but on, on a motorway  brand new motorway, no lines"
Yeah.
"no white lines, nothing."
No?
about eighteen inches of water.
Right?
Cor!
And the cars are just  straight on.
"You know,"
Went round taking  photos of old and the new.
See this is the new stuff that's going up.
"She was pretty upset, though, weren't she?"
"Well, she upsets herself."
Yeah.
She's a bit like that.
Bit

"Someone walked past her, and spilt all the drink down her front, that didn't go down very well."
Trip.
"Bloody hell, I try and get bloody dressed up, should be looking, stupid sod, drunk, got drink all down me."
"I think Dwayne, just, he was, just wasn't, wasn't that interested."
Can't blame him.
"He was just, oh, it was funny."
"he deliberately, I was standing next to him,he was just leaning on me."
That's Dwayne.
Just leaning on me.
"You know that    they all disgust me, and er, John went yeah, that's the sort of woman I like."
Comes carrying a load of  in her hand.
"It was like, shut up."
"He's a real prat, ain't he?"
"I was sitting there going,ha ha ha  got a  stuck."

That's a pint glass gone.
Naked woman on it.
"Ain't it, it's like out of a porno mag."
It is bad.
I don't know how he got that on there.
The
It's not painted.
"But when, when when the colour glass is full, she's got clothes on."
"Oh, really?"
Never.
until you get to London
Ah London is it mm?
I mainly do round the midlands now.
Mm.
Which suits me fine.
Mm.
to run all over the bloody place and
It's a shame.
If I'd have known you were coming I wouldn't have booked going out.
Oh  get yourself off.
If I don't do something with me life I spend my life sitting here all day
Here you are

Yeah.
that lovely ni nice warm day we had.
Ooh I spend a lifetime running around after my baby.
Yeah.
"And you measured it with a protractor,"
Mm.
"it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one."
Yeah.
"The gradient is the tan of the angle, but you can only read that off the graph if you've got the same units."
Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be  let's say someone gave you this  find an approximation for the gradient  erm Y equals X squared  minus one.
X squared?
"Y equals X squared minus one, at around the point where X equals three."
Someone wanted to know the gradient.
"So, so"
Ooh.
you d you'd have to find Y.
Okay.
So Y is three squared minus one.
Yeah okay.
be Y would equal eight.
Yeah.
Erm  so
Good.
"Right, draw a sketch, cos we need to know what we're working with here."
So Y could perhaps equal  three.
the rest of the graph
the opposite point.
Right.
Good.
It's symmetrical down the Y axis.
And  the lowest point.
It'd be about one .
About one.
"What's the graph going to look like here, when X is very big?"
.
Hello.
Come on.
Sing
I'm not singing honestly.
Show that this guide
I can't sing I'd embarrass myself .
Yeah but nobody can sing
I deter anybody who'd every wanted to get on one of the  buses .
No you wouldn't they'll all come on and say where's that girl that sings Robin Hood.
I don't think they would.
Are you not going to do this?
I'm not I'm sorry I'm not singing.

Okay could you let me talk to the driver?
Yes certainly.
Put the driver on I want to talk to the driver.
Robin Hood Robin  I like that it's great.
Haven't got another record queued up .
Hello.
Hi who are you?
Julie.
Are you a driver?
"Don't sound so surprised, that's really sexist."
Why?
The way you said that.
Just because I'm a female.
I'll bet it is.
Oh as I say I've seen the film.
"I, I liked the film of Hannibal, with Oliver Reed."
Now that's quite good.
Yeah.
Was it
I've never seen the film.
"It's very good, the film is."
But I mean round there it's absolutely steeped in history.
I couldn't believe it.
Mm.
I mean  er when they told  the tales of the  of the seven winds and the  was it seven winds?
Yeah.
"The seven winds and Romu Romulus and Remus and the, the, the wolf  it all happened round there."
And they reckon the golden wolf is still down
But
there somewhere.
Rome is supposed to be built on seven hills isn't it or something?
It is.
"Yeah, seven hills."
Yeah we saw the seven hills as we drove past Rome because you
Yeah
can see it.
Just like this can't you?
Yeah.
Amazing place.
"We didn't go into Rome, we went round it."
It spreads about twenty five mile
for the time of the year it's gorgeous isn't it?
Yeah look at the size of me though mum.
I ain't half a fatso.
And that's the main town the city.
"No, I don't."
I don't.
You put it in the bin.
"No, they, they've said in there you mustn't."
Where?
No not cooking oil.
"Er pet , car oil ."
Car oil.
That's a totally different story.
I'm sure
But I mean  the bottom bit obviously we've got to talk about whether we actually do want
bifocals today new.
.
But this guy seems to be well worth nurturing.
Yes.
Here you are.
It says here oh that's waste oil cooking fat and other liquids.
I know it says fat collection but I
Well that only should only be because erm  the bin's going to be soiled.
In in in  in the end  terribly smelly that's the reason.
I mean why there shouldn't be cooking oil in in in landfill.
I mean
Dad
Dad's not in
Mm
I can only think that  I mean it sticks to the sides of the bin  at the bottom
Well if it's if it was very hot could it could it melt the plastic?
It could even melt the plastic yes.
Or could it ignite?
Yeah.
No I I definitely  foodstuffs out of the water.
I mean  into the bin first and then wash the dishes.
Yeah.
"And the old stuff is much more interesting, don't like the new stuff."
Yeah.
This is a  a rest home for the nuns.
And they go there when they retire.
See that's  that's sort of there.
That was built sort of there.
That's the old stuff.
Yeah.
And this is the new.
There's timesharing and
Different
And this one

This one's another one.
That's in the next village.
It's a nice street innit?
It is nice.
Yeah.
"And that's, that's the fish in the palace park."
"And that's Switzerland, coming out of Switzerland."
And the other one is  what's on the front ?
That's Monte Casino
Very nice.
And that was Monte casino on that one.
That's a nice box for photographs innit?
Oh this one ain't much good actually.
This one ain't much good.
It's a nuisance.
The other one's absolutely chock-a-block.
"I'm keeping them together in their little bits because I've got them all sorted where they belong, so"
Have you seen these?
Didn't I tell you about that?
There's no petrol in the car.
You mean  every time I have that car I have to put petrol in.
No I put it in the last two times.
Twenty quid's worth.
So you'll have  you watch my little car.
Watch it or wash it?
Watch it.
Be careful.
I'll be very careful with your little car John.
Well it's not far to Chester.
It's not as far to Chester as it is to Swansea is it?
I don't suppose it is.
Mm?
No.
"Go the motorways though, if you can."
Oh.
"You'll have to watch for, for the roadworks."
I mean the roadworks on the M 6 are diabolical now.
Mm.
I it took us three and a half hours coming back from Swansea.
But we stopped off for half an hour as well.
And  I think it's longer coming back that way.
Over the bridge.
No it isn't.
It isn't.
You sure?
I'd be positive.
Shorter.
Cos  th I remember the first time I went down that way over the bridge.
It was about a hundred and eighty miles I clocked up.
Er but coming back I only clocked up about a hundred and twenty.
"I've been burping an awful lot, in my stomach."
What's worrying you?
"Och, I don't know."
I haven't the foggiest.
Have
I feel awfully depressed as well.
Right.
Whether it's this pain that's doing it I know I don't know.
Let's get this head of your x-rayed and see what's going on.
I don't know what's causing it.
"Just not going away, even the tablets that you gave me, they wasn't even taking it away, it, away like ."
The ?
"Aye,."
"I mean for a while I think it was maybe my glasses, but these are just new"
No.
lenses I've got.
Now then.
I thought  the change of life would be starting on me as well.
Well this is the other thing that could could be starting.
Ah.
You're a bit young.
"Ah but even me ma me mammy she was young and all,she was thirty seven."
"She was just thirty seven, was she ?"
Aye.

Mm mm.
I'm very aware of
Not encouraging him.
Yes.
"So, I I didn't er, I didn't instigate a conversation at all."
But it sounds as though he doesn't realize that.
I didn't ask him whether he got back

Ooh I reckon there was an accident today on the A seventeen  erm
What time?
And like I went down for that one Monday.
Yeah.
"And erm, I knew he was going to prison."
It was for something that happened about five or six years ago.
"He was in a fight with these erm, squatters."
Really?
And it's taken all this time to come round.
"Yeah, yeah, and now it's come round"
Three years.
"Three years  er  three years, five years if he misbehaves, and Clayton,you say, eighteen."
Yeah
Two years if he's good.
Bloody hell.
"I mean, he's been into court but not for that long."
"It's more of a shock, because, yeah, I know, because nobody knew."
"We thought he would just get like a, a community service"
from Lee.
I don't know.
I didn't know from Lee.
"Jim phoned me up and told me, he was like upset."
"Oh, shit."
Oh dear.
"it's sad though, because"
What has his mates done.
We're collecting loads of things for him to keep him occupied.
"Like drawing books and that, and pencils,you buy him trains and stuff."
"What a waste of time, cos he'll only sell them for things he"
"Yeah, course he will."
"It's like, it's ge you know, he's really upset about it, but I'm just thinking"
Be different if you can do that.
Yeah.
"Yeah, he's really upset, I feel sorry for him, cos he's been upset about it, but"
Yeah.
Ah dear!
So that was a bit of a giggle!
So  do you
What?
think Clare will come?
"I don't, I doubt it, I don't think so."
Ah ah oh!
"Pity, Emma's decided she's bringing a camera now  and she reckons he bringing his!"
And I said no fucking way you'll get any pictures of me having a bang!
"And Andrew goes  oh, is this going to be  let Joanne  everybody with a picture!"
I've
Well it's gonna be really bad because I'm gonna be doing this and taking pictures!
You're not doing it at the party?
Yeah!
Oh God I'll be so pissed!
Well so!
Wahhh
"I'll do it, I'll do it"
You'll be doing it while we're going to sleep.
"No way, when we all lie down"
"fucking hell are you, no!"
"Picking up all the juicy gossip around here, you're not doing that then!"
"No, I won't do it then I'll do it  I'll do it in the early evening when no one 's too drunk."
"Then a bit later, but not well don't do it when we are gonna go to sleep because  cos we end ups tal talking about  who's dad's got the biggest plonker!"
"Is your, is your dog still a virgin?"
I know.
"Like, you know what, my dog's still  a virgin !"
Virgin !
"I always say, you're drunk that night."
So they all go  and all.
Are they?
But it's something wrong somewhere Margaret.
"Somewhere,som something wrong somewhere so we'll have him out on Monday."
But he said the balance correct and I can't get it correct with what you've got in your book.
What?
And what do you say it is?
I make it the
Cos I've got not as much as it
No
er
it's more.
"It's forty one more in your book  and loans, than she does according to that book."
Well how much does your say?
Eh?
How much is yours then?
I mean all I can do is  when Dave gives me money write it in here  that's all I
Yes.
can do.
That's all she does.
And I check it after her.
And I write in here.
"Yeah, but how much, how much did you have there altogether?"
According to that  about hundred and fifty quid in all.
What?
According to what?
In that.
No.
Hundred and forty three.
How else ?
See the  this  th the there's got to be summat wrong.
"But if you, if you add all them up, and then add up all what there is in there  there's summat wrong."
Mm.
"What, what balance is it in, on that bit of paper Dave?"
So here we've got
This is less than one.
squared.
squared it gets smaller and smaller.
So that's going to be nought point four.
Mm.
So the gradient at that point is about two.
Erm what wh where were we  where did I say find the gradient?
Where X equal to three?
Yeah.
Sorry  something wrong that.
"So we'd be, oh, okay, that's good cos you can do it."
When X is three?
"So when X is two point nine, say."
"Two point nine, and then"
Y
when X  one see what Y is down here.
It was three point one.
"Don't forget you can look at this, Y equals X plus one times X minus one, which, when you see it that way tells you where it's going to, where its roots are."
Where it's going to cut the axes.
Yeah.
X  So there Y will be two point nine plus times two point nine minus one.
Right.
"Which is three point nine times nought point nine,"
Okay.
"But f we can, we can, we can save that to the end because  I think that was"
Aye.
confusing probably wasn't it?
"When we're doing it this way, we can forget about the, with this X, X two is going to be three point one squared"
Minus one .
minus one.
"This one is going to be two point nine squared, minus one."
We compromised.
Okay.
Here's Mr .
You better get your head down  Wesley.
"When we used to sit with you in Humanities  sat next to you right, and I was saying like erm  erm, you were saying  I got you to say  so who are gonna bring down the school to beat me up?"
And we got on this subject.
And I said no one.
And you said you bring the mother-fuckers down.
And I got you talking about all the porno magazines.
We got all that on tape.
Have you had it all lesson?
Yeah I've still got it.
When have you gotta give it back then?
Do you tape ?
When have you gotta give that back?
"No, not this."
I had a dictaphone.
I've got a dictaphone.
I've brung it into school loads of times.
Have you still got everything?
Yeah.
"Oh no, I think I taped over it."
I've still got bits of it about the porno magazines and that though.
What's that down there?
"Karen, you've gotta cut them across like that."
Yeah.
It was quite funny listening to that actually.
"Cos I go, Steven goes erm, Steven goes bring the, to Shelley, he goes bring the mother-fuckers down like that."
"And I go, and it didn't pick it up and I goes, pardon?"
Could you say that again.
Bring the what down?
And he was going  and I was going  the mother what?
"Well, they would have showed a wider picture of the actual picture, and apparently they take,co , the photographers had taken a baby away from it's mother  he's standing in the middle of a desert , and there's a picture of them with a baby and all these photographers  photographing it !"

Too tight across the shoulders so I'm gonna have to
Got me a large strap for it.

"Aye, yeah."
Blue sky!

Especially if you've got nothing  to do.
Is Curly working or not?
No.
He hasn't had a job for ages has he?
A no.
Well there's no point in him working cos he just loses his
I jus I can't believe that that  can be true!
I mean
"Annie, Annie works twenty four hours a we , Annie works twenty four hours a week in this shop right  and the , she claims family credit as well and i i ,we if Adrian works  all the benefits go under  he has to"
Yeah but yo

It isn't like that!
It is!
"Well yeah, er okay I can accept that  but I think  mentally"
Yeah.
"you know, I think I mean, I mean he even to  going back to college doing a couple of  A levels wouldn't alter his benefit."
"I mean, do something, you know!"
Yeah.
I could not live like that!
No I couldn't.
I'd go mad!
Especially out there over that shop in Kings Dainton.
We've got loads the same.
I think you usually tend to get
Yeah.
"when we, we come back from holiday"
That's
your dad usually finds he's taken the same picture two or three times or more or less and
Keep them in the same bits won't you?
Yes
same place but a different angle.
This is
"this is all out of his back window  the views out of upstairs, out of his kitchen window."
All these.
"That's the photos I took of it, yeah  at the palace."
It's only like a little village isn't it?
"It's not a, not a big town."
"Oh it's, well it's three little villages together."
See there's no difference really from the postcards.

When the chain brakes she said
Oh blimey!
if it brakes down   there's there's  taking it up to top sprocket so it comes off you see.
Yeah.
Then it don't quite work right then.
Yeah.
Well  it shouldn't  it  it did i but if you just went up to the top they got a pair of  I should think about  four or five lengths  they had to take it off the sprocket  and er  course you see  they
Grandma
"let in front, then they've gone down!"
Yeah.
And Ken said no way can we do  we gotta take  take some off.
Aha.

Mm.
But can you take it back to garages as well?
No.
No.
No.
Halfords  Halfords in Harlow is one that that that we found out took it.

"Mm, mm"

Please yourself
And what are you saying it is now?
Fifty eight pound a day.
That's an awful lot more isn't it?
Yeah.
There's  I mean so many of them have caught on.
"Jan for example, when we had the  the town hall thing, that was five pound a day."
Yeah.
It's twenty five pound a day now.
I think they've just all jumped on the bandwagon.
They don't provide anything really do they?
"Well no, that's it."
So as soon as she said that it was in use Monday Wednesday I sort of
If we went to
subconsciously ruled it out.
"village hall, church hall"
Yeah ?
"which is a church hall, they don't have a charge, you have to make a contribution."
Where's this sorry?
"Well you, you need to, it's pretty grotty, it's a grim place"
Mm.

And erm  so he will have a phone number of the vicar and so on.
Mm okay.
Okay.
"I mean in a w well  I can't, did we, I wonder if we recharge this to the Welsh Office or not?"
We probably do.

What?
Well Manchester City versus Wimbledon.
Nearly all those will be home fans.
Wouldn't they?
Yes.
Twenty two and a half thousand!
Ooh.
And Manchester City are doing well don't forget.
"I knew, good old Wimbledon."
That's how they stay up.
That's how Wimbledon stay up.
They go up to those games
Nil nil.
"and they make it nil nil  they've drawn wi , now with Manchester City and Liverpool in two successive weeks, nil nil."
You cannot break them down.
that's why we stay quite near the top.
Wasn't it?
Oh!
Well Villa went above us.
Or Villa are above us.
We're sixth.
Yeah I know.
No they can go above us.
They always was above us.
But they're above us on cos our goal average must look absolutely  diabolical now.
The goal average must
left it clean?
They haven't been here!

How long do I keep that for?
"Somebody else been here,."
This water heater is not to be used as it failed to reach the er  oh well I  now!
"Wait, and I'll go and find out!"

"Yes I know, but he  he said people are in last week!"
But that's what
They're overflowing with bookings for the summer!
Oh!
And now?
"Yeah, cos they could have three times as many caravans!"
By June  they'd let them go!
They're overflowing with them!
Not now!
"Of course, you see, it's you that's using the caravan this week so they can come here  they  can they?"
No.
Somebody comes quick and wants the caravan  they're supposed to be there ready!
Oh!

Family fun day  Much Hadham village hall?
Yeah.
Do you know where that is in Much Hadham?
Opposite the Bull pub isn't it?
Right.
Er  he wants to know  do we want to have a stall there and that's gonna cost us five pounds.
If we have that.
Erm
Well you could get produce  for that.
And then if you  ordered now.
I bet they probably be really competing with them in a way won't we cos they've got all the same sort of stuff.
Won't they?
Yeah.
Greenpeace  sell them  mugs and  re-use labels and  sort of things like that.
I don't know what you think.
Erm  and there's er
I would suggest
If it's a fun day why don't we do a game or something.
"Why do, you know."
Well it's.
They're celebrating their twentieth birthday celebrations.
Erm  and then th in the evening there's an event.
"Which starts at eight o'clock with two live bands, cabaret, disco and bar."

Well they've got  what they've got on here is they've got  whale watch talk and slides.
I know.
"I know we're hard up, but you can ten pence."
"You never know, might be  to make enough money to take you out somewhere for a decent Christmas do."

He works at  with plenty of overtime.
Benjy.
"Colin phoned him up, and er, it it  he mentioned, how he was starting up, and he said he might be interested, anyway Colin phoned him a couple of weeks ago to see if he was still interested in."
"Anyway he says he'd pay him the same money as what he's on there, 'cos he'd have to really, wouldn't just say, say"
"You've, you've got to, but how the hell get it, if he don't get paid up front."
What do ya mean?
"Well, wages,"
Got to
"Well, it have to come out of capital, at first."
Yeah.
"put by ten or eleven thousand, or whatever it is, just come out of that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Through them  they have to have first option.
They're the one that gets the benefit!
Well  two weeks ago
But then they can't sell it!
They can't sell it!
And that's only the new one!
"Cos they said, I won't be able sell it cos they  they've got so many new ones on the site!"
Last week there was people in here!

They're all very unhappy!
I tell you!
"This woman doesn't know anything, like!"
"She just said there's two boys out on there on site  and the one, the, the ginger haired boy knows the  you know  the problem."
And I
Why?
Because you don't pull out in front of a car going seventy miles an hour

"And P Way work cos that's what you've said it does and you, you're"
We are doing.
I'm afraid I'm not helped much
We are doing.
"I'm, I'm gonna call a halt to this here because without David  here who"
Right.
"knows the detail we, all we're gonna do is enjoy the sound of our own voices."
I think.
"So what I'm, what I propose, is that this goes out because I don't think it changes anything significantly."
"Erm Jim you, you, you need to present it in a certain way to your staff, and er after you've considered that, if you don't feel it's workable then I think you need to talk to David and I."
Yeah.
"Well I've already, for a number, a number of cases, spoken to Dave about it."
And he knows this can't be worked.
That's why
Well I
"I'm rather surprised that it's, we're"
Will it work?

"Well yeah that's how they go don't they, yeah."

Can go in the hall can't they?
They can all go in the hall  and then that'll leave me free to go out first like I should do.
Well that's right yeah.
I was told I should lend that classroom to them  I can't ge really get out first  and that should be my turn to be out first today.
Yeah cos I definitely shan't be out first shall I?
No.
"No and if not that'll be  Margaret out first, out of the hall, won't it?"
Yeah.
I mean she'll be out  two days on the trot.
"Yeah and that's not fair, and that's cold today isn't it?"
Not that you need to be any fitter than you are.
Well they are fit cos they get on and off at any of the stops they go along to the attraction that they want to do.
Yeah I walk from my front door to my car as well and people say that's not enough exercise.

"I said cos I shall phone the bank first thing Monday and I shall say right, he's took the car so you can run to him for the money cos you'll be getting none out of me."
Then I had a letter from the social  security.
They've been paying me thirty nine pound sixty haven't they?
"And I've been, been  to fifty five pound  seventy five every week."
Oh.
So you'll get a bit back then?
Yeah.
So I think
it's better
Well they're on about backdating it to the third.
But if I write back and say I haven't actually had any wages since the seventeenth of January  I might get it backdated from then.
What's that?
Did  do what he said he was gonna do then?
Yeah.
Oh.
Have you had any repercussions?
Yeah they went to work in it the next day.
Did they?
Yeah.
"What, with all the tyres done?"
Yeah.
How'd they get there?
Well I dunno.
"Michael said it were there at  erm five to twelve, when he  erm quarter past twelve when he come out of work they got in it."
But he don't know what time they got there cos he don't work in that warehouse.
So he was gonna ask  if they got in late because  they could have had time to get it repaired.
Oh I see.
Did mum tell you we went to see the Bachelors last night?
Hint!
Hint!
I mean what could I do?
And then as we approached the tube station the arm around me again and erm  and he
But was he a fellow choir man as well?
Yes!
It's awful you see because it's so
"I would have been, been very rude to him."
"But no, but I can't  couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir."
Well in future whenever he suggests something  I think what you've got to do
There's some in here.
Okay?
I've got  two here.
"is never  you know, join the breaks or whatever  and just make sure  you're not left alone"
Mm.
you're with other girls.
"Well, I'm sorry, he just came on so strong."
Mm.
"And, so I was forced into lying."
I said erm  I've enjoyed the concert but I'm afraid
Yeah.
"a , er you know, I don't want there to be any."
"misunderstanding, and he, he said explain."
So I had to lie.
Certainly.
"and I said erm, I'm going out with someone."
Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far.
"Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un , misunderstanding?"
And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it  and embarrassed both of us
Ha.
"so   there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man?"
Said oh  I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this .
Really really hurt it did!
"And it wasn't, oh God!"
And we only did it as a joke!you !
I didn't even know they were there to be quite honest.
I got
Mm.
"up the next morning  and, cos I had that  you know, that stripy top on?"
Yeah.
"And my mum, my mum was sat in  The Weathers with me  and I'd talked to her and everything and I didn't even know that that"
Yeah.
one was there!
"And like,but like, I got"
up the next morning and I just went  oh Jesus!
But there was
They were like
this one
still
and
up there and the one on my back as well!
"And Scott, Scott did this and like  and erm  he goes  oh it's not that bad!"
"And I goes, oh you stupid git!"
"Why did you have to do it there for, you know?"
"Put my school shirt on, oh you won't see it!"
Oh no won't see it with that flipping big collar on my school shirt!
"Actually, you couldn't see it, but you could see it through anyway so it didn't make really that much difference."
"But like, I got the mirror down and like, I looked at it  and whether it was the light or whether it just hadn't come up cos it was only like, a few seconds afterwards"
Mm.
"I looked at it and it was just like sort of, light brown  and I thought oh that's not too bad!"
"I got home and it was like, glowing  and I'm thinking oh my God!"
"There was like, arrows pointed to it still !"
"I mean, I only had that one on my neck and I thought  and like I was  I was   !"
"Wi , with your polos on !"
"Crumbly, is it?"
"I got it from, I don't know, I got it from Holston's and I haven't had any from there before."
I went into that Roberses the delicatessen part
Mm.
"and er  they were queuing up there so I couldn't be bothered  standing in the queue, so I didn't."
Didn't get it from there?
I didn't stay there for that.
"Mm, that's distinctive isn't it  the smoked one!"
Mm.
Very nice!
I haven't had  this  particular one before but we used to get  a little used to be able to get it in little  about
Yeah.
"tha , that big  and er  no, I expect the"
"It's on    don't, they reckon they can make Cheshire anywhere now can't they?"
"No, it's not what it used to be."
There must be somebody who can get it?
Get what?
Cheshire cheese is not  necessarily  indigenous to Cheshire now.
"Oh  what,wha"
They make it in lots of places.
you mean it's been made in Devon
No
and called Cheshire cheese?
"Well I don't know about Devon, I'm not sure."
"No, I I do , I think it's erm"
Only made in Cheshire?
I would have thought so.
You mean they're using the recipe somewhere else?
Yes.
Oh.
Making and you
I don't think so.
And I ate me butty there on top.
In the pouring bloody rain and howling wind I expect.
"It was, yeah  it was horrible ."
So then I just had a drive round all the sites.
Did you find them all alright?
Yeah.
I know where I'm going now with er all of them.
"You know and getting to them, I know how to get from one to the other  without going, you know?"
All round the houses.
I've got a good idea of where everywhere is.
So I was quite pleased.
Mm.
When I got back  ooh  you know I told you about that job?
We've put a bid in for Arrow Park.
Mm.
Rob thinks we've got it.
Oh god.
Winning some bloody jobs aren't you.
"What have they done, dropped their prices?"
Well Rob's doing them isn't he?
Oh they have had to drop their prices.
"They've had to  go for the  we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park  and er  we've gotta, you know, really stick to this tight budget because it's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you  erm  about the recession being over, people still want things for nothing."
So  this survey might have to be done at the beginning of April.
But it's not a big one so
"Well when's these in Caernarvon, the end of April?"
Starting the twenty seventh of April.
It's the weekend after  's wedding?
Yeah.
So I shall be enjoying myself at  the wedding
Mm.
ready for my hard slog.
Eh?
Yeah.
Ooh I put loads of weight on out there.
"And then you've got all the outskirts around that, you know?"
"Cos you're talking about thirty, forty mile."
I'm supposed to be trying to watch me weight now.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's massive.
"I've er, I've lost about a stone in  a couple of months or so, that's all, but it's er  better than gaining I suppose."
Back to where I started I think.
"Unless you've got two pictures of that same street, no"
"No, you're back to where you started."
This is
Rocetta Clive.
Mm.
Funny little place.
Ah.
Right Rocetta Now where's this?
"Oh this is the palace  this is the, the  Monte Casino This is where"
It's the abbey
The abbey at Monte Casino Do you remember
Oh I've heard about the abbey  yeah.

You know where it all got bombed
Yeah.
and what they took all the treasures down into the  cellars so they were saved and they rebuilt it.
"In the same style as it was years ago, using some of their old bricks and everything that they could but  it's been"
Yeah.
rebuilt in the same style and all the treasures are still there.
"Yeah it's amazing, all these"
I've seen the film of this where they're trying to g and all around from outside you can see the graves  the graveyard.
Yeah.
she's a teacher and I think she thinks that teachers are the only ones that work!
Yeah.
Oh bloody hell!
And I said something
Cor!
to her like erm
Oh yeah .
Yeah.
"erm, what did I say?"
Something about  oh what did I say?
"She's a funny woman anyway, I said something like"
They are  peculiar breed!
I should think  I should think you  it's nice to have the six weeks  ahead of us  and she said  well it's not a holiday!
I thought well I wouldn't mind
Ooh no!
six weeks of not having to get up and you gotta go.
"No, not going into the shop at least, yeah."
Cor!
"She said  she said for the first week you unwind, I thought  if we have a weeks holiday that means that the time you unwind you're back to work again!"
You're back to work .
That's right.
She said and then I have two weeks  erm  homework to mark  and then we have a weeks holiday  I thought well that's two weeks
Yeah.
holiday
Cor!
really.
That's it.
She said and then the next week you're preparing to go back!
Well why can't she do that  two weeks marking in that first week she needs to unwind?
Yeah.
And then have a
"And yet  another client of mine who's a teacher, she said oh yeah she said it's lovely, she said  I suppose I ought to do the  marking and all that  at the beginning she said but I leave it, she said, and I sometimes do it in the last week."
So you'll take Paul to church in the morning will you?
Alright.
Well you can drop him off and pick him up.
"I could do, yeah."
Now you've found my keys for my  I really need to get those
What's that he's got?
What's that?
My .
You bought it?
Yeah.
More money than sense.
Wonder what he looks like now?
How old was he there?
"Nineteen sixty eight, so that's  twenty three years ago."
He was only twenty three then I should think.
Let us have a bit of the paper.
Listen to this.
Absent minded spinsters Beryl and Doris  lost their car in a repair shop .
Yeah I know!
I read that.
The sisters are eighty and eighty one reported the mini stolen
And bought another one.
got the  er three months later they received thirteen hundred pound pay off from insurance Commercial Union and promptly bought a replacement car.
"But when they booked their new car into Tristar Motors for its first service, they found their old model waiting for them ."
"That is  dreadful garage that didn't phone to find out why they hadn't picked it up though, isn't it?"
I'd have thought
Unless they lost their address.
Hee hee hee hee.
I mean the fact that this come  out is that the
That was in the Mail  That was in the Mail.
Yeah but the fact it's come out is that they've been honest.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
Why?
What are we talking about?
Mum what's Hamlet about?
Pardon?
What's Hamlet about?
Hamlet?
Yes.
"I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream."
to er see Rome and Juliet.
Mm.
And I think I need to make it up.
When is
I dunno.
Well you better find out then.
What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got
Well no if you can go.
You give me the money for it?
If it's within reason as I assume it will be.
Five Pounds.
That's okay.
W would it make much difference for you lending me the money.
Not a lot.
Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there  and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about.
Well
Yeah.
I thought a computer
"No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are  tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things  unless it's absolutely necessary."
Well
"And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can."
That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging.
I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet.
You s you serve it in a  you know the big chunky glasses you can get?
Well if you put them in the freezer
Mm mm.
"up, pour it straight in  and down."
Mm.
Do you still drink like that Brock?
Like  in Budgens   few weeks .
We'll get some of that when Eileen and Tony come.
Went down yesterday and they're out of stock.
It's expensive over here though innit?
"Er   I get it for three  quid, three  something like."
Is that the  the big bottle or the small one?
"No, they're the small ones, small bottles yeah."
It's expensive that.
"Oh yeah I know,"
We  we'd pay about four pound for twenty four bottles.
This beer called
Yeah.
"It's, it's er Belgian."
Oh.
And it's  it looks like ginger beer.
"When you pour it out you get a big head on it like this and it's, it's  lovely stuff."
It goes down like wine.
"It's, it's  smooth, real smooth."
Yeah.
They have quite a few er foreign beers in er  in Budgens these days cos the other week we saw some of that Brock
Oh yeah that's erm that's
then when he went down he said well he couldn't see any yesterday.
"No don't    I don't  I, I just get, I mean I, sometimes I have some like but  it's so easy to get hold of it out there mum."
I mean  we've always got drink in the house and s and occasionally we'll have a drink at night but sometimes we just don't touch it for ages unless anyone comes round.
It just sits there
Well I mean your dad's got
"Right, yeah."
I'm always worried that his enthusiasm is stretched to the limit
"No, no I mean the number of pe ."
I've just passed my A levels I've got loads of papers  going what can I do.
"Well I said, ring Birchanger scouts!"
And as far as I know he always .
I mean the address is on there  anyway.
"Yeah, oh right."

Oh.

quite  pertinent actually if we are actually going to do one.
What?
"To ask people  sorry in my, in the letter"
Yeah.
"to the press, ask  people to er  submit any information."
Yeah.
"Oh what you mean you're gonna put at the bottom  of the of, the same letter or"
"Well, yes."
Yeah.
just write down all the information we've got now so there is  can recycling at the swimming pool and at Tesco privately run.
Swimming pool
Erm  swimming pool
who's going to get the information who runs that?
Who?
Mm?
Well I can do that I suppose.
Well who runs what?
The swimming pool
Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them.
"Oh they're not, they're not asking  sorting, oh I see."
"Erm  so there must be somebody responsible and I think if, if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there"
That's the only thing.
Oh yeah.
If you could work it out and see how much it would be
Yeah.
and see if it's  any
Yeah.
"cheaper because  food's no erm  problem  I'll be taking loads with me anyway, which we would do anyway."
We'd be  on anyway
Yeah.
erm
and it's then hardly anything on food.
Well food's not that expensive out there.
"It's, it's the"
"same as  here isn't it, really?"
"Yeah but I mean the fruit and veg out there, that was"
Mm.
rea I mean that was cheaper wasn't it?
Seemed to be anyway somewhat.
Well they  do it by the kilo which  works out cheaper.
"The price per pound was the  same, I think."
I worked it out.
But  I dunno!
"I just thought that it seemed to be, you know?"
"Anyway, we don't eat much when we're in heat anyway do you?"
"The hot weather it doesn't, they don't really   do mashed potatoes and"
Yeah.
like Carol's doing and    those revolting French sausages!
"Went into the supermarket and it said   and it said  pour, not it said erm  pour le animal, well any fool would have thought that was poor   the animals, and Carol said that looks nice, we'll,we'll have a pile of that!"
I said you read the sign on it ?

"No, she didn't buy it!"
Oh my God there's  so much horse meat which puts me right off!

Cheaper to buy a blimming er  cheaper to insure a car  wouldn't it?
Mm.
Oh
"no matter what he gets, it's always over five hundred quid cos he's  he's"
Yeah.
"lost his licence in the past and  you know, when he was a kid like"
Mm.

Yeah.
It's all the
He is actually quite sane now though.
"Yeah, well it's like this fellow that got done for speeding."
When did he get done?
Er Thur no Wednesday.

Saw them catch him up coming along with all their blue lights thinking .
They'd been in er garage at bottom.
Mm.
Aye.
We'd had a little  car before he got there.
"He said are you speaking to the  no, no,around town he says, I don't mind doing a bit more, you know, out and about  not much about  they just sat in the traffic, you know."
Mm
"but erm  so  had it been a Foxhalls, something about a minute  no, he said only for about a mile, that was it."
"I said oh, about forty seconds and he sort of looked."
No.
"Er er er as far as they're concerned any extra work is just an enhancement of the rate to the bypass erm rate, point six two percent."
That was what  pointed out.
He pointed out?
Any
said we need approval for extra work
Yeah.
"he said well it's just, it's time costs, it's just an extension of the"
Right.
Except for the Caernarvon bit.

"I said, I said have you invited Aunty Joan and them?"
He said oh I've invited Aunty Joan but nobody else cos I didn't fancy  any of the others.
And has he invited Joan to the day do and that?
Yeah.
But he hasn't invited any  to the night .
I think I might have  his conscience by saying that I don't mind.
Well for what they see  I can understand him asking Joan and Graham  erm  maybe they've gotta watch how much they're
I know but an extra four people's not gonna cost that much more is it?
Shut up.
You little sod.
The cat?
Yeah.
Oh I'm shattered .
Why I asked him is because he had a  wedding invitation for Rob and Jen
Yeah.
Well to be honest I can understand why he's not asking them.
"You know they'll make up with friends  you know, what family they're not asking won't they?"
Put it in the dish.

"Yes, no not everyone, some  I know one person who's name's Adam, he finishes Tuesday"

I think the ones that are fifty pence are those blue and white striped ones off the  prom at Prestatyn
job lot.
And er  he didn't say how much the toilet was but that'll probably be separate.
"You know, it's a separate thing so there must be a separate price, it would cost a bloody fortune."
"Snapped this one off  er you know in an ac he fell over or whatever, on his"
"Yeah, that's right."

"What, oh dear, oh"
"It's not an oh dear word, no"
It's a verb
Well Dave'll be down there today.
"Well not you can't pay on the night, can you?"
Well I suppose   I'm sure Adrian won't mind if I paid him  the day after or a week after or something.
"You're unemployed I wouldn't have thought you could've stood a hundred and fifty, two hundred pounds withdrawal."
No I don't mind  saying it I I'm not gonna ask any more.
What?
Well so that yo about Adrian  after a few weeks it's  you know
Remind me to wash in these cupboards before Sunday.
Yeah.
"Have you seen Jan and Joan dress up to their their Victorian day  Jan came like a an upright stripped  erm working, not working class a sort of governess right she had"
Yeah.
frumpy shoes and a .
Where'd she get the clothes from?
"Oh she borrowed it, and a bonnet and a  white flowers an all and Joan turned up like a  a twenty five year old Victorian fashion model  you should have seen her!"
Black silk skirt  maroon  blouse  her hair done up in a bun  draped with gold jewellery oh  talk about looking the part!
What's wrong with that?
And John hired this thing like a cape
Who's idea  is it?
Was it?
"Oh it's it's quite common, everybody does it if you have a vic if you study Victorians anyone who a Victorian   and they all they did all done out, chairs er table space at the front, they did drill in the playground  they played with tops and hoops in the playground, all the children  the m parents hired costumes from Fairy Godmothers  Fairy Godmother's done a roaring trade especially"
"Ah I should think Fairy Godmothers put the ideas into somebody's head, I would have thought."
That's not
We might
It's just a very good way of er teaching chi I mean children will I mean that's the kind of experience
Yeah.
"you never forget, do you?"
Some of  but you can't do it for something like a Medieval's day or Roman
No.
"day it'd be grim, but Victorian"
Victorian
"people have got a, yeah"
just close enough to sti still remember a lot of the cloths and stuff.
Yes that's right er I er believe in fact I know because the Duke says so in the Racing Post today the reason he's gone there is to get Adrian Maguire because Adrian has ridden him already in Ireland and the owner wanting to stick with Maguire which you can't blame him for
Exactly
As David Nicholson said he'll be taking orders from the jockey today instead of the other way around.
I don't imagine he says that very often.
Perhaps he's given the Duke his orders.
Oh I'd like to do that.
Now well let's have a look at this horse and another schedule because as I say he was trained in Ireland by Arthur  and er we saw them at Punchestown back in April where he finished second to another of his rivals today  Bishops Hall.
"As they come to the final fence Second Schedule being pressed by Ebony Jane and Bishops Hall on the nearside and over the last Second Schedule and Bishops Hall on the nearside, Ebony Jane in third, in fourth place is Joe White and racing into the closing stages it's Second Schedule with Bishops Hall on the nearside Graham Bradley again as they go to the line, Bishops Hall wins it for Harry , Second Schedule is second, Joe White is third, Ebony Jane four."
Bishops Hall doing it nicely under Brad and it's good to see him in the saddle today because he was offered the ride on Morley Street but he'd already said yes and he's a man of his word and he agreed to ride this horse.
And there's been a lot of hoo-ha in the Press about should be ride Morley Street or shouldn't he.
"Once you say yes you gotta stick to your word and Morley Street, good horse, but has a lot of weight today."
Lot of weight and again it's it's fences isn't it.
He'd last time tried over these he he wasn't at his best.
Erm  had a run on the flat so you know I mean I think we should be  but
"It's a it's a very bold thing of Toby Baldwin to run him in this race it seems to me, you know I mean he definitely appeared to not like  ."
Yes
It's only his third run and he's he's in the most competitive two and a half mile chase in the year.
But he oozes class and he's had a strange preparation.
You mention the flat race.
Let's let's have a look at that race.
It was at Newmarket just a couple of weeks ago.
And I can tell you he he does an an awful lot.
Here you can see him second last but making ground now.
Er My Patriarch and er is is taking the lead from Ritto who later ran so well in the Cesarovitch but just look at Morley Street now.
Here he comes past one past another past yet another into third place in the end  and that was an extraordinarily good performance.
No.
It's a very good turn of
foot for a for a jumper isn't it though ?
Very nice.
And he he very nearly won the Doncaster Cup wasn't it.
Yes I think it was the Doncaster Cup.
Yes mm.
Sore bested ? ''
returned the knight .
"`` Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard ."
"As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest ."
"Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick ."
"But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought ."
"Selden , a link here at the door ! ''"
"And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street , and , by the red glow of a torch , inspected his new troops ."
He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master ; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant .
"His dash , his proved courage , his forethought for the soldiers ' comfort , even his rough gibes , were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet ."
"`` Nay , by the rood ! ''"
"he cried , `` what poor dogs are these ?"
"Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear ."
"Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends ."
Mark me this old villain on the piebald !
A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly !
Ha !
"Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ?"
"Y ' are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull 's eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . ''"
"`` I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , '' returned Clipsby , sturdily ."
Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw .
"`` Why , well said ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to !"
I will forgive you for that merry word .
"Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . ''"
The knight re-entered the inn .
"`` Now , friend Dick , '' he said , `` fall to ."
Here is good ale and bacon .
"Eat , while that I read . ''"
"Sir Daniel opened the packet , and as he read his brow darkened ."
"When he had done he sat a little , musing ."
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
`` Let us run . ''
"`` Not so , '' returned Dick ."
`` See ye not ?
-- he is stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
"Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not ."
"Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''"
"`` I will pity him when he is by , '' replied Matcham ."
"The blind leper was now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face ."
"He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness , and even now he walked with a vigorous step ."
"The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , filled the lads ' bosoms with dismay ; and at every step that brought him nearer , their courage and strength seemed to desert them ."
"As he came about level with the pit , he paused , and turned his face full upon the lads ."
`` Mary be my shield !
He sees us ! ''
"said Matcham , faintly ."
`` Hush ! ''
whispered Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
"He is blind , fool ! ''"
"The leper looked or listened , whichever he was really doing , for some seconds ."
"Then he began to move on again , but presently paused once more , and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads ."
"Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes , as if by the mere sight he might become infected ."
"But soon the bell sounded , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods ."
"`` He saw us , '' said Matcham ."
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
"returned Dick , recovering some sparks of courage ."
`` He but heard us .
"He was in fear , poor soul !"
"An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried ` Peep . ' ''"
"`` Dick , good Dick , he saw us , '' repeated Matcham ."
"`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick ."
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
"'T is a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' are weak , forsooth !"
"Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !"
Tut !
fool words ! ''
"`` And yet ye beat me not , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Let be , '' said Dick -- `` let be ."
I will instruct you .
"Y ' ` ave been ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river ."
"Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself ."
"But , come , let us on ."
"An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . ''"
"But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham had forgiven him nothing ."
"His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he had slain -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , were things not easily to be forgotten ."
"`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' said Matcham ."
"`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone ."
"Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson ."
Fare ye well ! ''
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''"
"Each turned aside , and they began walking off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel ."
"But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was called , and Matcham came running after ."
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` it were unmannerly to part so coldly ."
"Here is my hand , and my heart with it ."
"For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you ."
Fare ye right well . ''
"`` Well , lad , '' returned Dick , taking the hand which was offered him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may ."
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' are too disputatious . ''
So then they separated for the second time ; and presently it was Dick who was running after Matcham .
"`` Here , '' he said , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''"
`` A cross-bow ! ''
said Matcham .
"`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it ."
"An ye were the devil , ye might go where ye will for me ."
Seek God 's forgiveness ; mine ye have freely .
But to go on to Holywood is different .
"I carry arms for York , and I will suffer no spy within their lines ."
"Hold it , then , for certain , if ye set one foot before another , I will uplift my voice and call the nearest post to seize you . ''"
"`` Ye mock me , '' said Sir Daniel ."
`` I have no safety out of Holywood . ''
"`` I care no more , '' returned Richard ."
"`` I let you go east , west , or south ; north I will not ."
Holywood is shut against you .
"Go , and seek not to return ."
"For , once ye are gone , I will warn every post about this army , and there will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrims that , once again , were ye the very devil , ye would find it ruin to make the essay . ''"
"`` Ye doom me , '' said Sir Daniel , gloomily ."
"`` I doom you not , '' returned Richard ."
"`` If it so please you to set your valour against mine , come on ; and though I fear it be disloyal to my party , I will take the challenge openly and fully , fight you with mine own single strength , and call for none to help me ."
"So shall I avenge my father , with a perfect conscience . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Sir Daniel , `` y ' have a long sword against my dagger . ''"
"`` I rely upon Heaven only , '' answered Dick , casting his sword some way behind him on the snow ."
"`` Now , if your ill-fate bids you , come ; and , under the pleasure of the Almighty , I make myself bold to feed your bones to foxes . ''"
"`` I did but try you , Dickon , '' returned the knight , with an uneasy semblance of a laugh ."
`` I would not spill your blood . ''
"`` Go , then , ere it be too late , '' replied Shelton ."
`` In five minutes I will call the post .
I do perceive that I am too long-suffering .
"Had but our places been reversed , I should have been bound hand and foot some minutes past . ''"
"`` Well , Dickon , I will go , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` When we next meet , it shall repent you that ye were so harsh . ''"
"And with these words , the knight turned and began to move off under the trees ."
"Dick watched him with strangely-mingled feelings , as he went , swiftly and warily , and ever and again turning a wicked eye upon the lad who had spared him , and whom he still suspected ."
"There was upon one side of where he went a thicket , strongly matted with green ivy , and , even in its winter state , impervious to the eye ."
"Herein , all of a sudden , a bow sounded like a note of music ."
"An arrow flew , and with a great , choked cry of agony and anger , the Knight of Tunstall threw up his hands and fell forward in the snow ."
It did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him .
If he had hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her .
He preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity .
`` Are you the young minister up at Rexton ? ''
she asked bluntly .
`` Yes . ''
`` I thought so .
Lynde said she had seen you on the shore once .
Well '' -- she cast an uncertain glance over her shoulder at the house -- `` I 'm much obliged to you . ''
"Alan had an idea that that was not what she had thought of saying , but as she had turned aside and was busying herself with the pails , there seemed nothing for him to do but to go ."
`` Wait a moment . ''
"She faced him again , and if Alan had been a vain man he might have thought that admiration looked from her piercing eyes ."
`` What do you think of us ?
I suppose they 've told you tales of us up there ? ''
-- with a scornful gesture of her hand in the direction of Rexton .
`` Do you believe them ? ''
"`` I believe no ill of anyone until I have absolute proof of it , '' said Alan , smiling -- he was quite unconscious what a winning smile he had , which was the best of it -- `` and I never put faith in gossip ."
Of course you are gossipped about -- you know that . ''
"`` Yes , I know it '' -- grimly -- `` and I do n't care what they say about the Captain and me ."
We are a queer pair -- just as queer as they make us out .
"You can believe what you like about us , but do n't you believe a word they say against Lynde ."
She 's sweet and good and beautiful .
It 's not her fault that she never went to church -- it 's her father 's .
Do n't you hold that against her . ''
The fierce yet repressed energy of her tone prevented Alan from feeling any amusement over her simple defence of Lynde .
"Moreover , it sounded unreasonably sweet in his ears ."
"`` I wo n't , '' he promised , `` but I do n't suppose it would matter much to Miss Oliver if I did ."
She did not strike me as a young lady who would worry very much about other people 's opinions . ''
"If his object were to prolong the conversation about Lynde , he was disappointed , for the old woman had turned abruptly to her work again and , though Alan lingered for a few moments longer , she took no further notice of him ."
But when he had gone she peered stealthily after him from the door until he was lost to sight among the pines .
"`` A well-looking man , '' she muttered ."
`` I wish Lynde had been home .
He felt an instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde Oliver with Isabel King .
"`` I saw her only for a moment , '' he said coldly , `` but she impressed me as being a beautiful woman . ''"
"`` They tell queer stories about her -- but maybe they 're not all true , '' said Isabel , unable to keep the sneer of malice out of her voice ."
At that moment Alan 's secret contempt for her crystallized into pronounced aversion .
He made no reply and they went the rest of the way in silence .
"At her gate Isabel said , `` You have n't been over to see us very lately , Mr. Douglas . ''"
"`` My congregation is a large one and I can not visit all my people as often as I might wish , '' Alan answered , all the more coldly for the personal note in her tone ."
"`` A minister 's time is not his own , you know . ''"
`` Shall you be going to see the Olivers ? ''
asked Isabel bluntly .
`` I have not considered that question .
"Good-night , Miss King . ''"
On his way back to the manse Alan did consider the question .
Should he make any attempt to establish friendly relations with the residents of Four Winds ?
"It surprised him to find how much he wanted to , but he finally concluded that he would not ."
They were not adherents of his church and he did not believe that even a minister had any right to force himself upon people who plainly wished to be let alone .
"When he got home , although it was late , he went to his study and began work on a new text -- for Elder Trewin 's seemed utterly out of the question ."
Even with the new one he did not get on very well .
At last in exasperation he leaned back in his chair .
Why ca n't I stop thinking of those Four Winds people ?
"Here , let me put these haunting thoughts into words and see if that will lay them ."
That girl had a beautiful face but a cold one .
Would I like to see it lighted up with the warmth of her soul set free ?
"Yes , frankly , I would ."
She looked upon me with indifference .
Would I like to see her welcome me as a friend ?
"I have a conviction that I would , although no doubt everybody in my congregation would look upon her as a most unsuitable friend for me ."
"Do I believe that she is wild , unwomanly , heathenish , as Mrs. Danby says ?"
"No , I do not , most emphatically ."
"I believe she is a lady in the truest sense of that much abused word , though she is doubtless unconventional ."
"Having said all this , I do not see what more there is to be said ."
And -- I -- am -- going -- to -- write -- this -- sermon .
said the grocer ' I gave an old woman some coffee for the book .
If you like to give me twopence you can have the rest . '
"` Yes , ' said the student , ` give me the book instead of the cheese ."
I can eat my bread without cheese .
It would be a shame to leave the book to be torn up .
"You are a clever and practical man , but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there ! '"
"And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned , but the grocer laughed , and so did the student ."
It was only said in fun .
But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter .
"When it was night and the shop was shut , and everyone was in bed except the student , the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer 's wife 's tongue ."
"She did not use it when she was asleep , and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak , and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged ."
"But only one thing at a time could use it , and that was a good thing , or they would have all spoken together ."
The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers .
"` Is it true , ' he asked , ' that you know nothing about poetry ? '"
` Certainly not ! '
answered the tub .
"` Poetry is something that is in the papers , and that is frequently cut out ."
"I have a great deal more in me than the student has , and yet I am only a small tub in the grocer 's shop . '"
"And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffee-mill , and how it began to grind !"
"He put it on the butter-cask , and on the till , and all were of the same opinion as the waste-paper tub ."
and one must believe the majority .
` Now I will tell the student ! '
and with these words he crept softly up the stairs to the attic where the student lived .
"There was a light burning , and the Goblin peeped through the key-hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop ."
But how bright it was !
Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student .
"Every leaf was alive , and every flower was a beautiful girl 's head , some with dark and shining eyes , others with wonderful blue ones ."
"Every fruit was a glittering star , and there was a marvellous music in the student 's room ."
"The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight , much less seen it ."
"He stood on tiptoe gazing and gazing , till the candle in the attic was put out ; the student had blown it out and had gone to bed , but the Goblin remained standing outside listening to the music , which very softly and sweetly was now singing the student a lullaby . '"
I have never seen anything like this ! '
said the Goblin . '
I must not even come here any more .
You understand that ? ''
`` Yes . ''
There was an unconscious revelation in the girl 's mournful eyes as she turned them on Alan .
It thrilled him to the core of his being .
She loved him .
"If it were not for that empty marriage form , he could win her , but the knowledge was only an added mocking torment ."
Alan had not known a man could endure such misery and live .
A score of wild questions rushed to his lips but he crushed them back for Lynde 's sake and held out his hand .
"`` Good-bye , dear , '' he said almost steadily , daring to say no more lest he should say too much ."
"`` Good-bye , '' Lynde answered faintly ."
When he had gone she flung herself down on the moss by the spring and lay there in an utter abandonment of misery and desolation .
Pain and indignation struggled for mastery in Alan 's stormy soul as he walked homeward .
So this was Captain Anthony 's doings !
He had sacrificed his daughter to some crime of his dubious past .
Alan never dreamed of blaming Lynde for having kept her marriage a secret ; he put the blame where it belonged -- on the Captain 's shoulders .
Captain Anthony had never warned him by so much as a hint that Lynde was not free to be won .
It had all probably seemed a good joke to him .
Alan thought the furtive amusement he had so often detected in the Captain 's eyes was explained now .
He found Elder Trewin in his study when he got home .
The good Elder 's face was stern and anxious ; he had called on a distasteful errand -- to tell the young minister of the scandal his intimacy with the Four Winds people was making in the congregation and remonstrate with him concerning it .
"Alan listened absently , with none of the resentment he would have felt at the interference a day previously ."
A man does not mind a pin-prick when a limb is being wrenched away .
"`` I can promise you that my objectionable calls at Four Winds will cease , '' he said sarcastically , when the Elder had finished ."
"Elder Trewin got himself away , feeling snubbed but relieved ."
"`` Took it purty quiet , '' he reflected ."
`` Do n't believe there was much in the yarns after all .
Isabel King started them and probably she exaggerated a lot .
I suppose he 's had some notion like as not of bringing the Captain over to the church .
"But that 's foolish , for he 'd never manage it , and meanwhile was giving occasion for gossip ."
It 's just as well to stop it .
"He 's a good pastor and he works hard -- too hard , mebbe ."
"For all that , if ye have any affection for my neck -LRB- to say nothing of your own -RRB- ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly ."
"I am going to do a bit of play-acting , the bottom ground of which is just exactly as serious as the gallows for the pair of us ."
"So bear it , if ye please , in mind , and conduct yourself according . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said I , `` have it as you will . ''"
"As we got near the clachan , he made me take his arm and hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness ; and by the time he pushed open the change-house door , he seemed to be half carrying me ."
"The maid appeared surprised -LRB- as well she might be -RRB- at our speedy return ; but Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation , helped me to a chair , called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips , and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nursery-lass ; the whole with that grave , concerned , affectionate countenance , that might have imposed upon a judge ."
"It was small wonder if the maid were taken with the picture we presented , of a poor , sick , overwrought lad and his most tender comrade ."
"She drew quite near , and stood leaning with her back on the next table ."
`` What 's like wrong with him ? ''
said she at last .
"Alan turned upon her , to my great wonder , with a kind of fury ."
`` Wrong ? ''
cries he .
"`` He 's walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his chin , and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets ."
"Wrong , quo ' she !"
"Wrong enough , I would think !"
"Wrong , indeed ! ''"
"and he kept grumbling to himself as he fed me , like a man ill-pleased ."
"`` He 's young for the like of that , '' said the maid ."
"`` Ower young , '' said Alan , with his back to her ."
"`` He would be better riding , '' says she ."
`` And where could I get a horse to him ? ''
"cried Alan , turning on her with the same appearance of fury ."
`` Would ye have me steal ? ''
"I thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon , as indeed it closed her mouth for the time ."
"But my companion knew very well what he was doing ; and for as simple as he was in some things of life , had a great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these ."
"`` Ye neednae tell me , '' she said at last -- `` ye 're gentry . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Alan , softened a little -LRB- I believe against his will -RRB- by this artless comment , `` and suppose we were ?"
Did ever you hear that gentrice put money in folk 's pockets ? ''
"She sighed at this , as if she were herself some disinherited great lady ."
"`` No , '' says she , `` that 's true indeed . ''"
"I was all this while chafing at the part I played , and sitting tongue-tied between shame and merriment ; but somehow at this I could hold in no longer , and bade Alan let me be , for I was better already ."
I met another clever man a few evenings ago .
A lot of us went for a sail on the harbour .
Mrs. Braddon 's house party came too .
We had three big white boats that skimmed down the moonlit channel like great white sea birds .
"There was another boat far across the harbour , and the people in it were singing ."
"The music drifted over the water to us , so sad and sweet and beguiling that I could have cried for very pleasure ."
One of Mrs. Braddon 's guests said to me : `` That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness refined away . ''
I had n't thought about him before -- I had n't even caught his name in the general introduction .
"He was a tall , slight man , with a worn , sensitive face and iron-grey hair -- a quiet man who had n't laughed or talked ."
"But he began to talk to me then , and I forgot all about the others ."
I never had listened to anybody in the least like him .
"He talked of books and music , of art and travel ."
"He had been all over the world , and had seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they had n't too , I think ."
"I seemed to be looking into an enchanted mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back to me , but made , oh , so much more beautiful !"
On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody asked me how I liked Paul Moore !
"The man I had been talking with was Paul Moore , the great novelist !"
I was almost glad I had n't known it while he was talking to me -- I should have been too awed and reverential to have really enjoyed his conversation .
"As it was , I had contradicted him twice , and he had laughed and liked it ."
"But his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth , through the insight he himself has given me ."
It is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me .
But much of its abiding sweetness comes from my friendship with Margaret Raleigh .
You will be weary of my rhapsodies over her .
"But she is such a rare and wonderful woman ; much older then I am , but so young in heart and soul and freshness of feeling !"
"She is to me mother and sister and wise , clear-sighted friend ."
To her I go with all my perplexities and hopes and triumphs .
She has sympathy and understanding for my every mood .
I love life so much for giving me such a friendship !
This morning I wakened at dawn and stole away to the shore before anyone else was up .
I had a delightful run-away .
"The long , low-lying meadows between `` The Evergreens '' and the shore were dewy and fresh in that first light , that was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of one of my white roses ."
"On the beach the water was purring in little blue ripples , and , oh , the sunrise out there beyond the harbour !"
All the eastern Heaven was abloom with it .
"He could sleep in the air without falling , by merely lying on his back and floating , but this was , partly at least , because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster ."
"` Do be more polite to him , ' Wendy whispered to John , when they were playing ` Follow my Leader . '"
"` Then tell him to stop showing off , ' said John ."
"When playing Follow my Leader , Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark 's tail in passing , just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing ."
"They could not follow him in this with much success , so perhaps it was rather like showing off , especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed ."
"` You must be nice to him , ' Wendy impressed on her brothers ."
` What could we do if he were to leave us ? '
"` We could go back , ' Michael said ."
` How could we ever find our way back without him ? '
"` Well , then , we could go on , ' said John ."
"` That is the awful thing , John ."
"We should have to go on , for we do n't know how to stop . '"
This was true ; Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop .
"John said that if the worst came to the worst , all they had to do was to go straight on , for the world was round , and so in time they must come back to their own window ."
"` And who is to get food for us , John ? ' '"
"I nipped a bit out of that eagle 's mouth pretty neatly , Wendy . '"
"` After the twentieth try , ' Wendy reminded him ."
"` And even though we became good at picking up food , see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand . '"
Indeed they were constantly bumping .
"They could now fly strongly , though they still kicked far too much ; but if they saw a cloud in front of them , the more they tried to avoid it , the more certainly did they bump into it ."
"If Nana had been with them , she would have had a bandage round Michael 's forehead by this time ."
"Peter was not with them for the moment , and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves ."
"He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight , to have some adventure in which they had no share ."
"He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star , but he had already forgotten what it was , or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him , and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening ."
It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid .
"` And if he forgets them , so quickly , ' Wendy argued , ` how can we expect that he will go on remembering us ? '"
"Indeed , sometimes when he returned he did not remember them , at least not well ."
Wendy was sure of it .
She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on ; once even she had to tell him her name .
"` I 'm Wendy , ' she said agitatedly ."
He was very sorry . '
"I say , Wendy , ' he whispered to her , ` always if you see me forgetting you , just keep on saying `` I 'm Wendy , '' and then I 'll remember . '"
I hung on to my blue straw sailor as long as I could .
How I hate the green velvet hat !
It is so elaborate and conspicuous .
I do n't see how I could ever have liked it .
But I vowed to wear it and wear it I will .
`` Shirley and I went down to the station this morning to take Little Dog Monday a bang-up Christmas dinner .
"Dog Monday waits and watches there still , with just as much hope and confidence as ever ."
Sometimes he hangs around the station house and talks to people and the rest of his time he sits at his little kennel door and watches the track unwinkingly .
We never try to coax him home now : we know it is of no use .
"When Jem comes back , Monday will come home with him ; and if Jem -- never comes back -- Monday will wait there for him as long as his dear dog heart goes on beating ."
`` Fred Arnold was here last night .
He was eighteen in November and is going to enlist just as soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have .
"He has been coming here very often lately and though I like him so much it makes me uncomfortable , because I am afraid he is thinking that perhaps I could care something for him ."
"I ca n't tell him about Ken -- because , after all , what is there to tell ?"
And yet I do n't like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be going away so soon .
It is very perplexing .
I remember I used to think it would be such fun to have dozens of beaux -- and now I 'm worried to death because two are too many .
`` I am learning to cook .
Susan is teaching me .
"I tried to learn long ago -- but no , let me be honest -- Susan tried to teach me , which is a very different thing ."
I never seemed to succeed with anything and I got discouraged .
But since the boys have gone away I wanted to be able to make cake and things for them myself and so I started in again and this time I 'm getting on surprisingly well .
"Susan says it is all in the way I hold my mouth and father says my subconscious mind is desirous of learning now , and I dare say they 're both right ."
"Anyhow , I can make dandy short-bread and fruitcake ."
"I got ambitious last week and attempted cream puffs , but made an awful failure of them ."
They came out of the oven flat as flukes .
I thought maybe the cream would fill them up again and make them plump but it did n't .
I think Susan was secretly pleased .
She is past mistress in the art of making cream puffs and it would break her heart if anyone else here could make them as well .
"I wonder if Susan tampered -- but no , I wo n't suspect her of such a thing ."
"`` Miranda Pryor spent an afternoon here a few days ago , helping me cut out certain Red Cross garments known by the charming name of ` vermin shirts . '"
"Susan thinks that name is not quite decent , so I suggested she call them ` cootie sarks , ' which is old Highland Sandy 's version of it ."
"Ask my man Tom , if ye misdoubt me ."
"Seven pieces of good Gascon wine , a ship that was mine own , and was my father 's before me , a Blessed Mary of plane-tree wood and parcel-gilt , and thirteen pounds in gold and silver ."
Hey !
what say ye ?
"A man that fought the French , too ; for I have fought the French ; I have cut more French throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out of Dartmouth ."
"Come , a penny piece . ''"
"Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word , lest he should recognise their voices ; and they stood there as helpless as a ship ashore , not knowing where to turn nor what to hope ."
"`` Are ye dumb , boy ? ''"
inquired the skipper .
"`` Mates , '' he added , with a hiccup , `` they be dumb ."
"I like not this manner of discourtesy ; for an a man be dumb , so be as he 's courteous , he will still speak when he was spoken to , methinks . ''"
"By this time the sailor , Tom , who was a man of great personal strength , seemed to have conceived some suspicion of these two speechless figures ; and being soberer than his captain , stepped suddenly before him , took Lawless roughly by the shoulder , and asked him , with an oath , what ailed him that he held his tongue ."
"To this the outlaw , thinking all was over , made answer by a wrestling feint that stretched the sailor on the sand , and , calling upon Dick to follow him , took to his heels among the lumber ."
The affair passed in a second .
"Before Dick could run at all , Arblaster had him in his arms ; Tom , crawling on his face , had caught him by one foot , and the third man had a drawn cutlass brandishing above his head ."
"It was not so much the danger , it was not so much the annoyance , that now bowed down the spirits of young Shelton ; it was the profound humiliation to have escaped Sir Daniel , convinced Lord Risingham , and now fall helpless in the hands of this old , drunken sailor ; and not merely helpless , but , as his conscience loudly told him when it was too late , actually guilty -- actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose ship he had stolen and lost ."
"`` Bring me him back into the alehouse , till I see his face , '' said Arblaster ."
"`` Nay , nay , '' returned Tom ; `` but let us first unload his wallet , lest the other lads cry share . ''"
"But though he was searched from head to foot , not a penny was found upon him ; nothing but Lord Foxham 's signet , which they plucked savagely from his finger ."
"`` Turn me him to the moon , '' said the skipper ; and taking Dick by the chin , he cruelly jerked his head into the air ."
`` Blessed Virgin ! ''
"he cried , `` it is the pirate ! ''"
`` Hey ! ''
cried Tom .
"`` By the Virgin of Bordeaux , it is the man himself ! ''"
repeated Arblaster .
"`` What , sea-thief , do I hold you ? ''"
he cried .
`` Where is my ship ?
Where is my wine ?
Hey !
have I you in my hands ?
"I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it ; and for my part , gossip Arblaster , methinks there is some sense in this young man ."
"Shall we go hear him , indeed ?"
"Say , shall we go hear him ? ''"
"`` I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale , good Master Pirret , '' returned Arblaster ."
"`` How say ye , Tom ?"
But then the wallet is empty . ''
"`` I will pay , '' said the other -- `` I will pay ."
"I would fain see this matter out ; I do believe , upon my conscience , there is gold in it . ''"
"`` Nay , if ye get again to drinking , all is lost ! ''"
cried Tom .
"`` Gossip Arblaster , ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty , '' returned Master Pirret ."
`` Would ye be led by a hired man ?
"Fy , fy ! ''"
"`` Peace , fellow ! ''"
"said Arblaster , addressing Tom ."
`` Will ye put your oar in ?
"Truly a fine pass , when the crew is to correct the skipper ! ''"
"`` Well , then , go your way , '' said Tom ; `` I wash my hands of you . ''"
"`` Set him , then , upon his feet , '' said Master Pirret ."
`` I know a privy place where we may drink and discourse . ''
"`` If I am to walk , my friends , ye must set my feet at liberty , '' said Dick , when he had been once more planted upright like a post ."
"`` He saith true , '' laughed Pirret ."
"`` Truly , he could not walk accoutred as he is ."
"Give it a slit -- out with your knife and slit it , gossip . ''"
"Even Arblaster paused at this proposal ; but as his companion continued to insist , and Dick had the sense to keep the merest wooden indifference of expression , and only shrugged his shoulders over the delay , the skipper consented at last , and cut the cords which tied his prisoner 's feet and legs ."
"Not only did this enable Dick to walk ; but the whole network of his bonds being proportionately loosened , he felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely , and could hope , with time and trouble , to entirely disengage it ."
So much he owed already to the owlish silliness and greed of Master Pirret .
"That worthy now assumed the lead , and conducted them to the very same rude alehouse where Lawless had taken Arblaster on the day of the gale ."
"It was now quite deserted ; the fire was a pile of red embers , radiating the most ardent heat ; and when they had chosen their places , and the landlord had set before them a measure of mulled ale , both Pirret and Arblaster stretched forth their legs and squared their elbows like men bent upon a pleasant hour ."
"The table at which they sat , like all the others in the alehouse , consisted of a heavy , square board , set on a pair of barrels ; and each of the four curiously-assorted cronies sat at one side of the square , Pirret facing Arblaster , and Dick opposite to the common sailor ."
"`` And now , young man , '' said Pirret , `` to your tale ."
"It doth appear , indeed , that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster ; but what then ?"
In a month it had carried Walter 's name to every corner of the globe .
"Everywhere it was copied -- in metropolitan dailies and little village weeklies -- in profound reviews and `` agony columns , '' in Red Cross appeals and Government recruiting propaganda ."
"Mothers and sisters wept over it , young lads thrilled to it , the whole great heart of humanity caught it up as an epitome of all the pain and hope and pity and purpose of the mighty conflict , crystallized in three brief immortal verses ."
A Canadian lad in the Flanders trenches had written the one great poem of the war .
"`` The Piper , '' by Pte. ."
"Walter Blythe , was a classic from its first printing ."
Rilla copied it in her diary at the beginning of an entry in which she poured out the story of the hard week that had just passed .
"`` It has been such a dreadful week , '' she wrote , `` and even though it is over and we know that it was all a mistake that does not seem to do away with the bruises left by it ."
And yet it has in some ways been a very wonderful week and I have had some glimpses of things I never realized before -- of how fine and brave people can be even in the midst of horrible suffering .
I am sure I could never be as splendid as Miss Oliver was .
`` Just a week ago today she had a letter from Mr. Grant 's mother in Charlottetown .
And it told her that a cable had just come saying that Major Robert Grant had been killed in action a few days before .
"`` Oh , poor Gertrude !"
At first she was crushed .
Then after just a day she pulled herself together and went back to her school .
"She did not cry -- I never saw her shed a tear -- but oh , her face and her eyes ! '' '"
"I must go on with my work , ' she said ."
` That is my duty just now . '
`` I could never have risen to such a height .
"`` She never spoke bitterly except once , when Susan said something about spring being here at last , and Gertrude said , '' ` Can the spring really come this year ? '"
"`` Then she laughed -- such a dreadful little laugh , just as one might laugh in the face of death , I think , and said , '' ` Observe my egotism ."
"Because I , Gertrude Oliver , have lost a friend , it is incredible that the spring can come as usual ."
"The spring does not fail because of the million agonies of others -- but for mine -- oh , can the universe go on ? ' ''"
"` Do n't feel bitter with yourself , dear , ' mother said gently ."
` It is a very natural thing to feel as if things could n't go on just the same when some great blow has changed the world for us .
We all feel like that . '
`` Then that horrid old Cousin Sophia of Susan 's piped up .
"She was sitting there , knitting and croaking like an old ` raven of bode and woe ' as Walter used to call her . ''"
"` You ai n't as bad off as some , Miss Oliver , ' she said , ` and you should n't take it so hard ."
There 's some as has lost their husbands ; that 's a hard blow ; and there 's some as has lost their sons .
You have n't lost either husband or son . ' ''
"` No , ' said Gertrude , more bitterly still ."
"`` I do n't reckon there 'd be much amusement in it ... more worry and bother than anything else , I should say ."
It would n't be so risky if they were even as old as you were when I took you .
I would n't mind Dora so much ... she seems good and quiet .
But that Davy is a limb . ''
Anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins .
The remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still .
"She knew that Marilla 's only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty , and Anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line ."
"`` If Davy is naughty it 's all the more reason why he should have good training , is n't it , Marilla ?"
"If we do n't take them we do n't know who will , nor what kind of influences may surround them ."
"Suppose Mrs. Keith 's next door neighbors , the Sprotts , were to take them ."
Mrs. Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you ca n't believe a word his children say .
Would n't it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that ?
Or suppose they went to the Wiggins ' .
Mrs. Lynde says that Mr. Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk .
"You would n't like your relations to be starved , even if they were only third cousins , would you ?"
"It seems to me , Marilla , that it is our duty to take them . ''"
"`` I suppose it is , '' assented Marilla gloomily ."
`` I daresay I 'll tell Mary I 'll take them .
"You need n't look so delighted , Anne ."
It will mean a good deal of extra work for you .
"I ca n't sew a stitch on account of my eyes , so you 'll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes ."
And you do n't like sewing . ''
"`` I hate it , '' said Anne calmly , `` but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty ."
It does people good to have to do things they do n't like ... in moderation . ''
"VIII Marilla Adopts Twins Mrs. Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window , knitting a quilt , just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when Matthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what Mrs. Rachel called `` his imported orphan . ''"
"But that had been in springtime ; and this was late autumn , and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown ."
The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill .
Mrs. Rachel peered at it eagerly .
"`` There 's Marilla getting home from the funeral , '' she said to her husband , who was lying on the kitchen lounge ."
"Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do , but Mrs. Rachel , who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household , had not as yet noticed this ."
"`` And she 's got the twins with her , ... yes , there 's Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony 's tail and Marilla jerking him back ."
Dora 's sitting up on the seat as prim as you please .
"`` James must have tint his wits , '' said Alan ."
"`` If this was the soldiers instead of you and me , he would be in a bonny mess ."
"But I dare say he 'll have a sentry on the road , and he would ken well enough no soldiers would find the way that we came . ''"
"Hereupon he whistled three times , in a particular manner ."
"It was strange to see how , at the first sound of it , all the moving torches came to a stand , as if the bearers were affrighted ; and how , at the third , the bustle began again as before ."
"Having thus set folks ' minds at rest , we came down the brae , and were met at the yard gate -LRB- for this place was like a well-doing farm -RRB- by a tall , handsome man of more than fifty , who cried out to Alan in the Gaelic ."
"`` James Stewart , '' said Alan , `` I will ask ye to speak in Scotch , for here is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other ."
"This is him , '' he added , putting his arm through mine , `` a young gentleman of the Lowlands , and a laird in his country too , but I am thinking it will be the better for his health if we give his name the go-by . ''"
"James of the Glens turned to me for a moment , and greeted me courteously enough ; the next he had turned to Alan ."
"`` This has been a dreadful accident , '' he cried ."
`` It will bring trouble on the country . ''
And he wrung his hands .
`` Hoots ! ''
"said Alan , `` ye must take the sour with the sweet , man ."
"Colin Roy is dead , and be thankful for that ! ''"
"`` Ay '' said James , `` and by my troth , I wish he was alive again !"
"It 's all very fine to blow and boast beforehand ; but now it 's done , Alan ; and who 's to bear the wyte * of it ?"
"The accident fell out in Appin -- mind ye that , Alan ; it 's Appin that must pay ; and I am a man that has a family . ''"
* Blame .
While this was going on I looked about me at the servants .
"Some were on ladders , digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings , from which they brought out guns , swords , and different weapons of war ; others carried them away ; and by the sound of mattock blows from somewhere farther down the brae , I suppose they buried them ."
"Though they were all so busy , there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts ; men struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their burning torches ; and James was continually turning about from his talk with Alan , to cry out orders which were apparently never understood ."
"The faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry and panic ; and though none spoke above his breath , their speech sounded both anxious and angry ."
It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying a pack or bundle ; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan 's instinct awoke at the mere sight of it .
`` What 's that the lassie has ? ''
he asked .
"`` We 're just setting the house in order , Alan , '' said James , in his frightened and somewhat fawning way ."
"`` They 'll search Appin with candles , and we must have all things straight ."
"We 're digging the bit guns and swords into the moss , ye see ; and these , I am thinking , will be your ain French clothes ."
"We 'll be to bury them , I believe . ''"
`` Bury my French clothes ! ''
cried Alan .
"I helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room , and then she said , ` Rob -- is -- living , ' as if the words were torn out of her , and flung herself on her bed and cried and cried and cried ."
I never saw anyone cry so before .
All the tears that she had n't shed all that week came then .
"She cried most of last night , I think , but her face this morning looked as if she had seen a vision of some kind , and we were all so happy that we were almost afraid ."
`` Di and Nan are home for a couple of weeks .
Then they go back to Red Cross work in the training camp at Kingsport .
I envy them .
"Father says I 'm doing just as good work here , with Jims and my Junior Reds ."
But it lacks the romance theirs must have .
`` Kut has fallen .
"It was almost a relief when it did fall , we had been dreading it so long ."
It crushed us flat for a day and then we picked up and put it behind us .
Cousin Sophia was as gloomy as usual and came over and groaned that the British were losing everywhere . ''
"` They 're good losers , ' said Susan grimly ."
` When they lose a thing they keep on looking till they find it again !
"Anyhow , my king and country need me now to cut potato sets for the back garden , so get you a knife and help me , Sophia Crawford ."
It will divert your thoughts and keep you from worrying over a campaign that you are not called upon to run . '
"`` Susan is an old brick , and the way she flattens out poor Cousin Sophia is beautiful to behold ."
"`` As for Verdun , the battle goes on and on , and we see-saw between hope and fear ."
But I know that strange dream of Miss Oliver 's foretold the victory of France .
` They shall not pass . ' ''
"CHAPTER XX NORMAN DOUGLAS SPEAKS OUT IN MEETING `` Where are you wandering , Anne o ' mine ? ''"
"asked the doctor , who even yet , after twenty-four years of marriage , occasionally addressed his wife thus when nobody was about ."
"Anne was sitting on the veranda steps , gazing absently over the wonderful bridal world of spring blossom , Beyond the white orchard was a copse of dark young firs and creamy wild cherries , where the robins were whistling madly ; for it was evening and the fire of early stars was burning over the maple grove ."
Anne came back with a little sigh .
"`` I was just taking relief from intolerable realities in a dream , Gilbert -- a dream that all our children were home again -- and all small again -- playing in Rainbow Valley ."
"It is always so silent now -- but I was imagining I heard clear voices and gay , childish sounds coming up as I used to ."
"I could hear Jem 's whistle and Walter 's yodel , and the twins ' laughter , and for just a few blessed minutes I forgot about the guns on the Western front , and had a little false , sweet happiness . ''"
The doctor did not answer .
"Sometimes his work tricked him into forgetting for a few moments the Western front , but not often ."
There was a good deal of grey now in his still thick curls that had not been there two years ago .
"Yet he smiled down into the starry eyes he loved -- the eyes that had once been so full of laughter , and now seemed always full of unshed tears ."
Father and mother went up to Avonlea .
"Father thought the change would do mother good , and they wanted to see poor Aunt Diana , whose son Jock had been seriously wounded a short time before ."
"They left Susan and me to keep house , and father expected to be back the next day ."
But he never got back for a week .
"That night it began to storm again , and it stormed unbrokenly for four days ."
It was the worst and longest storm that Prince Edward Island has known for years .
"Everything was disorganized -- the roads were completely choked up , the trains blockaded , and the telephone wires put entirely out of commission ."
`` And then Jims took ill .
"`` He had a little cold when father and mother went away , and he kept getting worse for a couple of days , but it did n't occur to me that there was danger of anything serious ."
"I never even took his temperature , and I ca n't forgive myself , because it was sheer carelessness ."
The truth is I had slumped just then .
"Mother was away , so I let myself go ."
"All at once I was tired of keeping up and pretending to be brave and cheerful , and I just gave up for a few days and spent most of the time lying on my face on my bed , crying ."
I neglected Jims -- that is the hateful truth -- I was cowardly and false to what I promised Walter -- and if Jims had died I could never have forgiven myself .
"`` Then , the third night after father and mother went away , Jims suddenly got worse -- oh , so much worse -- all at once ."
Susan and I were all alone .
Gertrude had been at Lowbridge when the storm began and had never got back .
At first we were not much alarmed .
Jims has had several bouts of croup and Susan and Morgan and I have always brought him through without much trouble .
But it was n't very long before we were dreadfully alarmed . '' '
"I never saw croup like this before , ' said Susan ."
"`` As for me , I knew , when it was too late , what kind of croup it was ."
I knew it was not the ordinary croup -- ` false croup ' as doctors call it -- but the ` true croup ' -- and I knew that it was a deadly and dangerous thing .
And father was away and there was no doctor nearer than Lowbridge -- and we could not ` phone and neither horse nor man could get through the drifts that night .
"`` Gallant little Jims put up a good fight for his life , -- Susan and I tried every remedy we could think of or find in father 's books , but he continued to grow worse ."
It was heart-rending to see and hear him .
"He gasped so horribly for breath -- the poor little soul -- and his face turned a dreadful bluish colour and had such an agonized expression , and he kept struggling with his little hands , as if he were appealing to us to help him somehow ."
"I found myself thinking that the boys who had been gassed at the front must have looked like that , and the thought haunted me amid all my dread and misery over Jims ."
And all the time the fatal membrane in his wee throat grew and thickened and he could n't get it up .
"`` Oh , I was just wild !"
I never realized how dear Jims was to me until that moment .
And I felt so utterly helpless . ''
"People thought the eager , enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used ."
Mrs. Lynde told them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them .
"Mr. Major Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense ; and Mrs. Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the `` Sassiety '' wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they need n't be afraid of her cow , for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds ."
"Even Mr. Harrison chuckled , if he chuckled at all , in private , and was all sympathy outwardly ."
"`` Never mind , Anne ."
"Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with , so it 's bound to fade prettier ."
And the roof is shingled and painted all right .
Folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on .
You 've accomplished so much anyhow . ''
"`` But Avonlea 's blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out , '' said Anne bitterly ."
And it must be confessed that it was .
"X Davy in Search of a Sensation Anne , walking home from school through the Birch Path one November afternoon , felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing ."
The day had been a good day ; all had gone well in her little kingdom .
St. Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name ; Prillie Rogerson 's face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity .
Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident ... spilling a dipper of water over the floor ... and Anthony Pye had not been in school at all .
`` What a nice month this November has been ! ''
"said Anne , who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself ."
`` November is usually such a disagreeable month ... as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it .
This year is growing old gracefully ... just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles .
We 've had lovely days and delicious twilights .
"This last fortnight has been so peaceful , and even Davy has been almost well-behaved ."
I really think he is improving a great deal .
How quiet the woods are today ... not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops !
It sounds like surf on a faraway shore .
How dear the woods are !
You beautiful trees !
I love every one of you as a friend . ''
Anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its cream-white trunk .
"Diana , rounding a curve in the path , saw her and laughed ."
"`` Anne Shirley , you 're only pretending to be grown up ."
I believe when you 're alone you 're as much a little girl as you ever were . ''
"`` Well , one ca n't get over the habit of being a little girl all at once , '' said Anne gaily ."
"`` There is no Black Dog here , '' said the doctor , `` except what you have on your own back ."
"You have been drinking rum ; you have had a stroke , precisely as I told you ; and I have just , very much against my own will , dragged you headforemost out of the grave ."
"Now , Mr. Bones -- '' `` That 's not my name , '' he interrupted ."
"`` Much I care , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` It 's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance ; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness , and what I have to say to you is this ; one glass of rum wo n't kill you , but if you take one you 'll take another and another , and I stake my wig if you do n't break off short , you 'll die -- do you understand that ?"
"-- die , and go to your own place , like the man in the Bible ."
"Come , now , make an effort ."
I 'll help you to your bed for once . ''
"Between us , with much trouble , we managed to hoist him upstairs , and laid him on his bed , where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting ."
"`` Now , mind you , '' said the doctor , `` I clear my conscience -- the name of rum for you is death . ''"
"And with that he went off to see my father , taking me with him by the arm ."
"`` This is nothing , '' he said as soon as he had closed the door ."
`` I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile ; he should lie for a week where he is -- that is the best thing for him and you ; but another stroke would settle him . ''
3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain 's door with some cooling drinks and medicines .
"He was lying very much as we had left him , only a little higher , and he seemed both weak and excited ."
"`` Jim , '' he said , `` you 're the only one here that 's worth anything , and you know I 've been always good to you ."
Never a month but I 've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself .
"And now you see , mate , I 'm pretty low , and deserted by all ; and Jim , you 'll bring me one noggin of rum , now , wo n't you , matey ? ''"
`` The doctor -- '' I began .
"But he broke in cursing the doctor , in a feeble voice but heartily ."
"`` Doctors is all swabs , '' he said ; `` and that doctor there , why , what do he know about seafaring men ?"
"I been in places hot as pitch , and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack , and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes -- what to the doctor know of lands like that ?"
"-- and I lived on rum , I tell you ."
"It 's been meat and drink , and man and wife , to me ; and if I 'm not to have my rum now I 'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore , my blood 'll be on you , Jim , and that doctor swab '' ; and he ran on again for a while with curses ."
"`` Look , Jim , how my fingers fidges , '' he continued in the pleading tone ."
"`` I ca n't keep 'em still , not I. I have n't had a drop this blessed day ."
"That doctor 's a fool , I tell you ."
"If I do n't have a drain o ' rum , Jim , I 'll have the horrors ; I seen some on 'em already ."
"I seen old Flint in the corner there , behind you ; as plain as print , I seen him ; and if I get the horrors , I 'm a man that has lived rough , and I 'll raise Cain ."
Your doctor hisself said one glass would n't hurt me .
"I 'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin , Jim . ''"
"He was growing more and more excited , and this alarmed me for my father , who was very low that day and needed quiet ; besides , I was reassured by the doctor 's words , now quoted to me , and rather offended by the offer of a bribe ."
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way everyone may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together , and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the fight , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully , and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- and she accepted them with a disturbing smile .
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by-and-by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying `` Hsh !
what was that ? ''
Tony beseeches her !
"`` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! ''"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
`` It is coming nearer ! ''
"she cries ; `` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , oh , Tony , oh ! ''"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly , not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again .
She has let it occur again .
"Where 's your aunt , miss ?"
"I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind ... a piece of J. A. Harrison 's mind , miss . ''"
"`` If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert , she is not my aunt , and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill , '' said Anne , with due increase of dignity at every word ."
`` I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats ... she is my cow and not Miss Cuthbert 's ... Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell . ''
"`` Sorry , miss !"
Sorry is n't going to help matters any .
"You 'd better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats ... trampled them from center to circumference , miss . ''"
"`` I am very sorry , '' repeated Anne firmly , `` but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in ."
It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition . ''
"`` My fence is all right , '' snapped Mr. Harrison , angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemy 's country ."
`` The jail fence could n't keep a demon of a cow like that out .
"And I can tell you , you redheaded snippet , that if the cow is yours , as you say , you 'd be better employed in watching her out of other people 's grain than in sitting round reading yellow-covered novels , '' ... with a scathing glance at the innocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne 's feet ."
Something at that moment was red besides Anne 's hair ... which had always been a tender point with her .
"`` I 'd rather have red hair than none at all , except a little fringe round my ears , '' she flashed ."
"The shot told , for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head ."
"His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at Anne , who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage ."
"`` I can make allowance for you , Mr. Harrison , because I have an imagination ."
I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things you 've said .
I promise you that Dolly shall never break into your oats again .
I give you my word of honor on THAT point . ''
"`` Well , mind you she does n't , '' muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat subdued tone ; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot ."
"Grievously disturbed in mind , Anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty Jersey up in the milking pen ."
"`` She ca n't possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down , '' she reflected ."
`` She looks pretty quiet now .
I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats .
"I wish I 'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted her last week , but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together ."
I believe it is true about Mr. Harrison being a crank .
Certainly there 's nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM . ''
Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits .
"Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the house , and the latter flew to get tea ready ."
"Howbeit , if he is to marry , marry him in the name of Mary , and be done ! ''"
"`` Nay , he is a brave lad -- I know it , '' said Lord Foxham ."
"`` Content ye , then , Sir Richard ."
"I have compounded this affair with Master Hamley , and to-morrow ye shall wed. '' Whereupon Dick judged it prudent to withdraw ; but he was not yet clear of the refectory , when a man , but newly alighted at the gate , came running four stairs at a bound , and , brushing through the abbey servants , threw himself on one knee before the duke ."
"`` Victory , my lord , '' he cried ."
"And before Dick had got to the chamber set apart for him as Lord Foxham 's guest , the troops in the holm were cheering around their fires ; for upon that same day , not twenty miles away , a second crushing blow had been dealt to the power of Lancaster ."
"CHAPTER VII -- DICK 'S REVENGE The next morning Dick was afoot before the sun , and having dressed himself to the best advantage with the aid of the Lord Foxham 's baggage , and got good reports of Joan , he set forth on foot to walk away his impatience ."
"For some while he made rounds among the soldiery , who were getting to arms in the wintry twilight of the dawn and by the red glow of torches ; but gradually he strolled further afield , and at length passed clean beyond the outposts , and walked alone in the frozen forest , waiting for the sun ."
His thoughts were both quiet and happy .
"His brief favour with the Duke he could not find it in his heart to mourn ; with Joan to wife , and my Lord Foxham for a faithful patron , he looked most happily upon the future ; and in the past he found but little to regret ."
"As he thus strolled and pondered , the solemn light of the morning grew more clear , the east was already coloured by the sun , and a little scathing wind blew up the frozen snow ."
"He turned to go home ; but even as he turned , his eye lit upon a figure behind , a tree ."
`` Stand ! ''
he cried .
`` Who goes ? ''
The figure stepped forth and waved its hand like a dumb person .
"It was arrayed like a pilgrim , the hood lowered over the face , but Dick , in an instant , recognised Sir Daniel ."
"He strode up to him , drawing his sword ; and the knight , putting his hand in his bosom , as if to seize a hidden weapon , steadfastly awaited his approach ."
"`` Well , Dickon , '' said Sir Daniel , `` how is it to be ?"
Do ye make war upon the fallen ? ''
"`` I made no war upon your life , '' replied the lad ; `` I was your true friend until ye sought for mine ; but ye have sought for it greedily . ''"
"`` Nay -- self-defence , '' replied the knight ."
"`` And now , boy , the news of this battle , and the presence of yon crooked devil here in mine own wood , have broken me beyond all help ."
"I go to Holywood for sanctuary ; thence overseas , with what I can carry , and to begin life again in Burgundy or France . ''"
"`` Ye may not go to Holywood , '' said Dick ."
`` How !
May not ? ''
asked the knight .
"`` Look ye , Sir Daniel , this is my marriage morn , '' said Dick ; `` and yon sun that is to rise will make the brightest day that ever shone for me ."
"Your life is forfeit -- doubly forfeit , for my father 's death and your own practices to meward ."
But I myself have done amiss ; I have brought about men 's deaths ; and upon this glad day I will be neither judge nor hangman .
"An ye were the devil , I would not lay a hand on you ."
"Both were glad to get out of sight , and dropped upon the steps red , rumpled , and breathless , after the late exciting scene ."
"Gus generously forebore to speak , though he felt that he was the least to blame ; and Frank , after eating a bit of snow to moisten his dry lips , said , handsomely , -- `` Now , do n't you worry , old man ."
"I 'll pay the damages , for it was my fault ."
"Joe will dodge , but I wo n't , so make your mind easy ."
"`` We sha 'n' t hear the last of this in a hurry , '' responded Gus , relieved , yet anxious , as he thought of the reprimand his father would give him ."
`` I hope mother wo n't hear of it till I tell her quietly myself .
"She will be so frightened , and think I 'm surely smashed up , if she is told in a hurry ; '' and Frank gave a shiver , as all the danger he had run came over him suddenly ."
`` I thought we were done for when we saw that train .
Guess we should have been if you had not had your wits about you .
"I always said you were a cool one ; '' and Gus patted Frank 's back with a look of great admiration , for , now that it was all over , he considered it a very remarkable performance ."
"`` Which do you suppose it will be , fine or imprisonment ? ''"
"asked Frank , after sitting in a despondent attitude for a moment ."
`` Should n't wonder if it was both .
"Running off with an engine is no joke , you know . ''"
`` What did possess me to be such a fool ? ''
"groaned Frank , repenting , all too late , of yielding to the temptation which assailed him ."
"`` Bear up , old fellow , I 'll stand by you ; and if the worst comes , I 'll call as often as the rules of the prison allow , '' said Gus , consolingly , as he gave his afflicted friend an arm , and they walked away , both feeling that they were marked men from that day forth ."
"Meantime , Joe , as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing the boys actually go off , ran away , as fast as his legs could carry him , to prepare Mrs. Minot for the loss of her son ; for the idea of their coming safely back never occurred to him , his knowledge of engines being limited ."
"A loud ring at the bell brought Mrs. Pecq , who was guarding the house , while Mrs. Minot entertained a parlor full of company ."
"`` Frank 's run off with No. 11 , and he 'll be killed sure ."
"Thought I 'd come up and tell you , '' stammered Joe , all out of breath and looking wild ."
"He got no further , for Mrs. Pecq clapped one hand over his mouth , caught him by the collar with the other , and hustled him into the ante-room before any one else could hear the bad news ."
"`` Tell me all about it , and do n't shout ."
What 's come to the boy ? ''
"she demanded , in a tone that reduced Joe to a whisper at once ."
"`` Go right back and see what has happened to him , then come and tell me quietly ."
I 'll wait for you here .
"I would n't have his mother startled for the world , '' said the good soul , when she knew all ."
"`` Oh , I dar ` s n't !"
"I opened the switch as they told me to , and Bill will half kill me when he knows it ! ''"
"cried Joe , in a panic , as the awful consequences of his deed rose before him , showing both boys mortally injured and several trains wrecked ."
`` Then take yourself off home and hold your tongue .
"There 's hills and heather enough between here and the two seas , David ; and I will own I 'm no very keen to stay where I 'm no wanted . ''"
"This pierced me like a sword , and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty ."
`` Alan Breck ! ''
I cried ; and then : `` Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in your chief need ?
You durs n't say it to my face .
My whole conduct 's there to give the lie to it .
"It 's true , I fell asleep upon the muir ; but that was from weariness , and you do wrong to cast it up to me -- '' `` Which is what I never did , '' said Alan ."
"`` But aside from that , '' I continued , `` what have I done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition ?"
"I never yet failed a friend , and it 's not likely I 'll begin with you ."
"There are things between us that I can never forget , even if you can . ''"
"`` I will only say this to ye , David , '' said Alan , very quietly , `` that I have long been owing ye my life , and now I owe ye money ."
Ye should try to make that burden light for me . ''
"This ought to have touched me , and in a manner it did , but the wrong manner ."
"I felt I was behaving badly ; and was now not only angry with Alan , but angry with myself in the bargain ; and it made me the more cruel ."
"`` You asked me to speak , '' said I. `` Well , then , I will ."
"You own yourself that you have done me a disservice ; I have had to swallow an affront : I have never reproached you , I never named the thing till you did ."
"And now you blame me , '' cried I , `` because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted ."
The next thing will be that I 'm to go down upon my knees and thank you for it !
"Ye should think more of others , Alan Breck ."
"If ye thought more of others , ye would perhaps speak less about yourself ; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word , you would be blithe to let it lie , instead of making it a stick to break his back with ."
"By your own way of it , it was you that was to blame ; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel . ''"
"`` Aweel , '' said Alan , `` say nae mair . ''"
"And we fell back into our former silence ; and came to our journey 's end , and supped , and lay down to sleep , without another word ."
"The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day , and gave us his opinion as to our best route ."
"This was to get us up at once into the tops of the mountains : to go round by a circuit , turning the heads of Glen Lyon , Glen Lochay , and Glen Dochart , and come down upon the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth ."
"Alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his blood-foes , the Glenorchy Campbells ."
"He objected that by turning to the east , we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts , a race of his own name and lineage , although following a different chief , and come besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were bound ."
"But the gillie , who was indeed the chief man of Cluny 's scouts , had good reasons to give him on all hands , naming the force of troops in every district , and alleging finally -LRB- as well as I could understand -RRB- that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the Campbells ."
"Alan gave way at last , but with only half a heart ."
"`` It 's one of the dowiest countries in Scotland , '' said he ."
"`` There 's naething there that I ken , but heath , and crows , and Campbells ."
But I see that ye 're a man of some penetration ; and be it as ye please ! ''
"It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation ; some time that night , or at latest before noon of the morrow , we should sight the Treasure Island ."
We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea .
"The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily , dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray ."
All was drawing alow and aloft ; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure .
"Now , just after sundown , when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth , it occurred to me that I should like an apple ."
I ran on deck .
The watch was all forward looking out for the island .
"The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself , and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship ."
"In I got bodily into the apple barrel , and found there was scarce an apple left ; but sitting down there in the dark , what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship , I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by ."
"The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it , and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak ."
"It was Silver 's voice , and before I had heard a dozen words , I would not have shown myself for all the world , but lay there , trembling and listening , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone ."
"11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel `` NO , not I , '' said Silver ."
"`` Flint was cap'n ; I was quartermaster , along of my timber leg ."
"The same broadside I lost my leg , old Pew lost his deadlights ."
"It was a master surgeon , him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sun-dried like the rest , at Corso Castle ."
"That was Roberts ' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their ships -- ROYAL FORTUNE and so on ."
"Now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , I says ."
"So it was with the CASSANDRA , as brought us all safe home from Malabar , after England took the viceroy of the Indies ; so it was with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , as I 've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"cried another voice , that of the youngest hand on board , and evidently full of admiration ."
"`` He was the flower of the flock , was Flint ! ''"
"`` Davis was a man too , by all accounts , '' said Silver ."
"`` I never sailed along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking ."
"I laid by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint ."
That ai n't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank .
"` Tai n't earning now , it 's saving does it , you may lay to that ."
Where 's all England 's men now ?
I dunno .
Where 's Flint 's ?
"Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff -- been begging before that , some on 'em ."
"Old Pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament ."
Where is he now ?
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing-time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"-LSB- Illustration : One day they were overheard by a fairy -RSB- He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , ` Is it to-day ? '"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him .
"` In case you should feel cold , ' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , ` I 'm afraid nurse would see me , so I sha n't be able to do it . '"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , ` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , ' and in a whisper , ` Then you can hide , ' and off they ran ."
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"` Brave , brave ! '"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight crept over the Gardens , and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , ` So that 's all right . '"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm-tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The little people weave their summer curtains from skeleton leaves -RSB- She was about to say , ' I never knew you could speak ! '"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , ' I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? '"
"and the elm replied , ` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , ' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
"Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing , and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her ."
"Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore , being stunned with the horror of that screaming ; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when Hoseason woke up , as if out of a muse , and bade them lay hands upon Alan ."
"They hung back indeed , having little taste for the employment ; but Hoseason was like a fiend , crying that Alan was alone , that he had a great sum about him , that he had been the means of losing the brig and drowning all their comrades , and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast ."
It was seven against one ; in that part of the shore there was no rock that Alan could set his back to ; and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him .
"`` And then , '' said Alan , `` the little man with the red head -- I havenae mind of the name that he is called . ''"
"`` Riach , '' said I. `` Ay '' said Alan , `` Riach !"
"Well , it was him that took up the clubs for me , asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment , and , says he ` Dod , I 'll put my back to the Hielandman 's mysel ' . '"
"That 's none such an entirely bad little man , yon little man with the red head , '' said Alan ."
`` He has some spunks of decency . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` he was kind to me in his way . ''"
"`` And so he was to Alan , '' said he ; `` and by my troth , I found his way a very good one !"
"But ye see , David , the loss of the ship and the cries of these poor lads sat very ill upon the man ; and I 'm thinking that would be the cause of it . ''"
"`` Well , I would think so , '' says I ; `` for he was as keen as any of the rest at the beginning ."
But how did Hoseason take it ? ''
"`` It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill , '' says Alan ."
"`` But the little man cried to me to run , and indeed I thought it was a good observe , and ran ."
"The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the beach , like folk that were not agreeing very well together . ''"
`` What do you mean by that ? ''
"said I. `` Well , the fists were going , '' said Alan ; `` and I saw one man go down like a pair of breeks ."
But I thought it would be better no to wait .
"Ye see there 's a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull , which is no good company for a gentleman like me ."
"If it hadnae been for that I would have waited and looked for ye mysel ' , let alone giving a hand to the little man . ''"
"-LRB- It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach 's stature , for , to say the truth , the one was not much smaller than the other . -RRB-"
"`` So , '' says he , continuing , `` I set my best foot forward , and whenever I met in with any one I cried out there was a wreck ashore ."
"Man , they didnae stop to fash with me !"
Ye should have seen them linking for the beach !
"And when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run , which is aye good for a Campbell ."
I 'm thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the brig went down in the lump and didnae break .
"But it was a very unlucky thing for you , that same ; for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high and low , and would soon have found ye . ''"
"CHAPTER XIX THE HOUSE OF FEAR Night fell as we were walking , and the clouds , which had broken up in the afternoon , settled in and thickened , so that it fell , for the season of the year , extremely dark ."
"The way we went was over rough mountainsides ; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner , I could by no means see how he directed himself ."
"At last , about half-past ten of the clock , we came to the top of a brae , and saw lights below us ."
"It seemed a house door stood open and let out a beam of fire and candle-light ; and all round the house and steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about , each carrying a lighted brand ."
"He went in a hurry in the end , because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
Oh !
"he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit -RSB- But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , ` Mother !"
mother ! '
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her !
"Ah , Peter !"
"we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right -- there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
The iron bars are up for life .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- V THE LITTLE HOUSE Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way every one may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together ; and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night , and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the light , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him , and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting , she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra -RSB- But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully ; and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
For generosity 's sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head ; but I thought of it none the less .
"I thought of it all the more , too , when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold , and the best part of another in small change ."
"True , it was more than I had ."
"But then Alan , with less than five guineas , had to get as far as France ; I , with my less than two , not beyond Queensferry ; so that taking things in their proportion , Alan 's society was not only a peril to my life , but a burden on my purse ."
But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion .
"He believed he was serving , helping , and protecting me ."
"And what could I do but hold my peace , and chafe , and take my chance of it ?"
"`` It 's little enough , '' said Alan , putting the purse in his pocket , `` but it 'll do my business ."
"And now , John Breck , if ye will hand me over my button , this gentleman and me will be for taking the road . ''"
"But the bouman , after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front of him in the Highland manner -LRB- though he wore otherwise the Lowland habit , with sea-trousers -RRB- , began to roll his eyes strangely , and at last said , `` Her nainsel will loss it , '' meaning he thought he had lost it ."
`` What ! ''
"cried Alan , `` you will lose my button , that was my father 's before me ?"
"Now I will tell you what is in my mind , John Breck : it is in my mind this is the worst day 's work that ever ye did since ye was born . ''"
"And as Alan spoke , he set his hands on his knees and looked at the bouman with a smiling mouth , and that dancing light in his eyes that meant mischief to his enemies ."
"Perhaps the bouman was honest enough ; perhaps he had meant to cheat and then , finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place , cast back to honesty as being safer ; at least , and all at once , he seemed to find that button and handed it to Alan ."
"`` Well , and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls , '' said Alan , and then to me , `` Here is my button back again , and I thank you for parting with it , which is of a piece with all your friendships to me . ''"
Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman .
"`` For , '' says he , `` ye have done very well by me , and set your neck at a venture , and I will always give you the name of a good man . ''"
"Lastly , the bouman took himself off by one way ; and Alan and I -LRB- getting our chattels together -RRB- struck into another to resume our flight ."
"CHAPTER XXII THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE MOOR Some seven hours ' incessant , hard travelling brought us early in the morning to the end of a range of mountains ."
"In front of us there lay a piece of low , broken , desert land , which we must now cross ."
"The sun was not long up , and shone straight in our eyes ; a little , thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke ; so that -LRB- as Alan said -RRB- there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser ."
"We sat down , therefore , in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should have risen , and made ourselves a dish of drammach , and held a council of war ."
"`` David , '' said Alan , `` this is the kittle bit ."
"Shall we lie here till it comes night , or shall we risk it , and stave on ahead ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I am tired indeed , but I could walk as far again , if that was all . ''"
"`` Ay , but it isnae , '' said Alan , `` nor yet the half ."
This is how we stand : Appin 's fair death to us .
"To the south it 's all Campbells , and no to be thought of ."
"To the north ; well , there 's no muckle to be gained by going north ; neither for you , that wants to get to Queensferry , nor yet for me , that wants to get to France ."
"Well , then , we 'll can strike east . ''"
`` East be it ! ''
"CHAPTER I PETER BREAKS THROUGH All children , except one , grow up ."
"They soon know that they will grow up , and the way Wendy knew was this ."
"One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden , and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother ."
"I suppose she must have looked rather delightful , for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried , ` Oh , why ca n't you remain like this for ever ! '"
"This was all that passed between them on the subject , but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up ."
You always know after you are two .
Two is the beginning of the end .
"Of course they lived at 14 , and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one ."
"She was a lovely lady , with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth ."
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes , one within the other , that come from the puzzling East , however many you discover there is always one more ; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get , though there it was , perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner ."
"The way Mr. Darling won her was this : the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her , and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling , who took a cab and nipped in first , and so he got her ."
"He got all of her , except the innermost box and the kiss ."
"He never knew about the box , and in time he gave up trying for the kiss ."
"Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it , but I can picture him trying , and then going off in a passion , slamming the door ."
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him .
He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares .
"Of course no one really knows , but he quite seemed to know , and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him ."
"Mrs. Darling was married in white , and at first she kept the books perfectly , almost gleefully , as if it were a game , not so much as a brussels sprout was missing ; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out , and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces ."
She drew them when she should have been totting up .
They were Mrs. Darling 's guesses .
"Wendy came first , then John , then Michael ."
"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her , as she was another mouth to feed ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her , but he was very honourable , and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling 's bed , holding her hand and calculating expenses , while she looked at him imploringly ."
"She wanted to risk it , come what might , but that was not his way ; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper , and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again ."
"` Now do n't interrupt , ' he would beg of her . '"
"I have one pound seventeen here , and two and six at the office ; I can cut off my coffee at the office , say ten shillings , making two nine and six , with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven , with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven , -- who is that moving ?"
"-- eight nine seven , dot and carry seven -- do n't speak , my own -- and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door -- quiet , child -- dot and carry child -- there , you 've done it !"
-- did I say nine nine seven ?
"yes , I said nine nine seven ; the question is , can we try it for a year on nine nine seven ? '"
"` Of course we can , George , ' she cried ."
"But she was prejudiced in Wendy 's favour , and he was really the grander character of the two ."
"` Remember mumps , ' he warned her almost threateningly , and off he went again ."
"In ten minutes , Mr. Bhaer and Silas were off to the wood , and Franz tearing down the road on old Andy to search the great pasture ."
"Mrs. Jo caught up some food from the table , a little bottle of brandy from the medicine-closet , took a lantern , and bidding Jack and Emil come with her , and the rest not stir , she trotted away on Toby , never stopping for hat or shawl ."
"She heard some one running after her , but said not a word till , as she paused to call and listen , the light of her lantern shone on Dan 's face ."
`` You here !
"I told Jack to come , '' she said , half-inclined to send him back , much as she needed help ."
"`` I would n't let him ; he and Emil had n't had any supper , and I wanted to come more than they did , '' he said , taking the lantern from her and smiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her feel as if , boy though he was , she had some one to depend on ."
"Off she jumped , and ordered him on to Toby , in spite of his pleading to walk ; then they went on again along the dusty , solitary road , stopping every now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to reply ."
"When they came to the great pasture , other lights were already flitting to and fro like will-o ' - the-wisps , and Mr. Bhaer 's voice was heard shouting , `` Nan !"
Rob !
Rob !
Nan ! ''
in every part of the field .
"Silas whistled and roared , Dan plunged here and there on Toby , who seemed to understand the case , and went over the roughest places with unusual docility ."
"Often Mrs. Jo hushed them all , saying , with a sob in her throat , `` The noise may frighten them , let me call ; Robby will know my voice ; '' and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone of tenderness , till the very echoes whispered it softly , and the winds seemed to waft it willingly ; but still no answer came ."
"The sky was overcast now , and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen , heat-lightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then , and a faint far-off rumble as of thunder told that a summer-storm was brewing ."
`` O my Robby !
my Robby ! ''
"mourned poor Mrs. Jo , wandering up and down like a pale ghost , while Dan kept beside her like a faithful fire-fly ."
`` What shall I say to Nan 's father if she comes to harm ?
Why did I ever trust my darling so far away ?
"Fritz , do you hear any thing ? ''"
"and when a mournful , `` No '' came back , she wrung her hands so despairingly that Dan sprung down from Toby 's back , tied the bridle to the bars , and said , in his decided way , `` They may have gone down the spring I 'm going to look . ''"
"He was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him ; but when she reached the spot , he lowered the lantern and showed her with joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring ."
"She fell down on her knees to examine the tracks , and then sprung up , saying eagerly , `` Yes ; that is the mark of my Robby 's little boots !"
"Come this way , they must have gone on . ''"
Such a weary search !
"But now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead the anxious mother , for presently Dan uttered a cry , and caught up a little shining object lying in the path ."
"It was the cover of the new tin pail , dropped in the first alarm of being lost ."
"Mrs. Jo hugged and kissed it as if it were a living thing ; and when Dan was about to utter a glad shout to bring the others to the spot , she stopped him , saying , as she hurried on , `` No , let me find them ; I let Rob go , and I want to give him back to his father all myself . ''"
"A little farther on Nan 's hat appeared , and after passing the place more than once , they came at last upon the babes in the wood , both sound asleep ."
Dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his lantern shone that night .
"He thought Mrs. Jo would cry out , but she only whispered , `` Hush ! ''"
"`` Better , sir . ''"
"`` Rather tired of the house , are n't you ? ''"
`` Guess I am ! ''
and Dan 's eyes roved away to the green hills and woods where he longed to be .
`` Suppose we take a little turn before the others come back ?
"That big , easy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable , and a breath of fresh air will do you good ."
"Get a cushion and a shawl , Demi , and let 's carry Dan off . ''"
"The boys thought it a capital joke , and Dan looked delighted , but asked , with an unexpected burst of virtue , `` Will Mrs. Bhaer like it ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes ; we settled all that a minute ago . ''"
"`` You did n't say any thing about it , so I do n't see how you could , '' said Demi , inquisitively ."
"`` We have a way of sending messages to one another , without any words ."
It is a great improvement on the telegraph . ''
"`` I know it 's eyes ; I saw you lift your eyebrows , and nod toward the carriage , and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again , '' cried Nat , who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time ."
`` Right .
"Now them , come on , '' and in a minute Dan found himself settled in the carriage , his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite , nicely covered with a shawl , which fell down from the upper regions in a most mysterious manner , just when they wanted it ."
"Demi climbed up to the box beside Peter , the black coachman ."
"Nat sat next Dan in the place of honor , while Uncle Teddy would sit opposite , to take care of the foot , he said , but really that he might study the faces before him both so happy , yet so different , for Dan 's was square , and brown , and strong , while Nat 's was long , and fair , and rather weak , but very amiable with its mild eyes and good forehead ."
"`` By the way , I 've got a book somewhere here that you may like to see , '' said the oldest boy of the party , diving under the seat and producing a book which make Dan exclaim , `` Oh !"
"by George , is n't that a stunner ? ''"
"as he turned the leaves , and saw fine plates of butterflies , and birds , and every sort of interesting insect , colored like life ."
"He was so charmed that he forgot his thanks , but Mr. Laurie did not mind , and was quite satisfied to see the boy 's eager delight , and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as he came to them ."
"Nat leaned on his shoulder to look , and Demi turned his back to the horses , and let his feet dangle inside the carriage , so that he might join in the conversation ."
"When they got among the beetles , Mr. Laurie took a curious little object out of his vest-pocket , and laying it in the palm of his hand , said , `` There 's a beetle that is thousands of years old ; '' and then , while the lads examined the queer stone-bug , that looked so old and gray , he told them how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy , after lying for ages in a famous tomb ."
"Finding them interested , he went on to tell about the Egyptians , and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them the Nile , and how he sailed up the mighty river , with the handsome dark men to work his boat ; how he shot alligators , saw wonderful beasts and birds ; and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel , who pitched him about like a ship in a storm ."
"`` Uncle Teddy tells stories ` most as well as Grandpa , '' said Demi , approvingly , when the tale was done , and the boys ' eyes asked for more ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Mr. Laurie , quite soberly , for he considered Demi 's praise worth having , for children are good critics in such cases , and to suit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of ."
"`` Here 's another trifle or two that I tucked into my pocket as I was turning over my traps to see if I had any thing that would amuse Dan , '' and Uncle Teddy produced a fine arrow-head and a string of wampum ."
`` Oh !
"tell about the Indians , '' cried Demi , who was fond of playing wigwam ."
"`` Dan knows lots about them , '' added Nat ."
"`` More than I do , I dare say ."
"Tell us something , '' and Mr. Laurie looked as interested as the other two ."
"But she often talked lovingly of Peter , and she knitted a kettle-holder for him , and one day when she was wondering what Easter present he would like , her mother made a suggestion ."
"-LSB- Illustration : If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ` Nothing , ' she said thoughtfully , ` would be so useful to him as a goat . '"
"` He could ride on it , ' cried Maimie , ` and play on his pipe at the same time . '"
"` Then , ' her mother asked , ` wo n't you give him your goat , the one you frighten Tony with at night ? '"
"` But it is n't a real goat , ' Maimie said ."
"` It seems very real to Tony , ' replied her mother ."
"` It seems frightfully real to me too , ' Maimie admitted , ` but how could I give it to Peter ? '"
"Her mother knew a way , and next day , accompanied by Tony -LRB- who was really quite a nice boy , though of course he could not compare -RRB- , they went to the Gardens , and Maimie stood alone within a fairy ring , and then her mother , who was a rather gifted lady , said -- ` My daughter , tell me , if you can , What have you got for Peter Pan ? '"
"To which Maimie replied -- ' I have a goat for him to ride , Observe me cast it far and wide . '"
"She then flung her arms about as if she were sowing seed , and turned round three times ."
"Next Tony said -- ` If P. doth find it waiting here , Wilt ne'er again make me to fear ? '"
And Maimie answered -- ` By dark or light I fondly swear Never to see goats anywhere . '
"She also left a letter to Peter in a likely place , explaining what she had done , and begging him to ask the fairies to turn the goat into one convenient for riding on ."
"Well , it all happened just as she hoped , for Peter found the letter , and of course nothing could be easier for the fairies than to turn the goat into a real one , and so that is how Peter got the goat on which he now rides round the Gardens every night playing sublimely on his pipe ."
"And Maimie kept her promise , and never frightened Tony with a goat again , though I have heard that she created another animal ."
"Until she was quite a big girl she continued to leave presents for Peter in the Gardens -LRB- with letters explaining how humans play with them -RRB- , and she is not the only one who has done this ."
"David does it , for instance , and he and I know the likeliest place for leaving them in , and we shall tell you if you like , but for mercy 's sake do n't ask us before Porthos , for he is so fond of toys that , were he to find out the place , he would take every one of them ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They will certainly mischief you -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- Though Peter still remembers Maimie he is become as gay as ever , and often in sheer happiness he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily on the grass ."
"Oh , he has a joyful time !"
"But he has still a vague memory that he was a human once , and it makes him especially kind to the house-swallows when they visit the island , for house-swallows are the spirits of little children who have died ."
"They always build in the eaves of the houses where they lived when they were humans , and sometimes they try to fly in at a nursery window , and perhaps that is why Peter loves them best of all the birds ."
And the little house ?
"Every lawful night -LRB- that is to say , every night except ball nights -RRB- the fairies now build the little house lest there should be a human child lost in the Gardens , and Peter rides the marches looking for lost ones , and if he finds them he carries them on his goat to the little house , and when they wake up they are in it , and when they step out they see it ."
"The fairies build the house merely because it is so pretty , but Peter rides round in memory of Maimie , and because he still loves to do just as he believes real boys would do ."
"But you must not think that , because somewhere among the trees the little house is twinkling , it is a safe thing to remain in the Gardens after Lock-out time ."
"If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out that night they will certainly mischief you , and even though they are not , you may perish of cold and dark before Peter Pan comes round ."
"He has been too late several times , and when he sees he is too late he runs back to the Thrush 's Nest for his paddle , of which Maimie had told him the true use , and he digs a grave for the child and erects a little tombstone , and carves the poor thing 's initials on it ."
"He does this at once because he thinks it is what real boys would do , and you must have noticed the little stones , and that there are always two together ."
He puts them in twos because they seem less lonely .
I think that quite the most touching sight in the Gardens is the two tombstones of Walter Stephen Matthews and Phoebe Phelps .
They stand together at the spot where the parish of Westminster St. Mary 's is said to meet the parish of Paddington .
"Here Peter found the two babes , who had fallen unnoticed from their perambulators , Phoebe aged thirteen months and Walter probably still younger , for Peter seems to have felt a delicacy about putting any age on his stone ."
"How long this might have gone on I do not know , for they seemed to have no sense of time : but at last the captain of the ship , who seemed near beside himself -LRB- and no great wonder -RRB- in the midst of this crying and confusion , came to the side and begged us to depart ."
"Thereupon Neil sheered off ; and the chief singer in our boat struck into a melancholy air , which was presently taken up both by the emigrants and their friends upon the beach , so that it sounded from all sides like a lament for the dying ."
"I saw the tears run down the cheeks of the men and women in the boat , even as they bent at the oars ; and the circumstances and the music of the song -LRB- which is one called `` Lochaber no more '' -RRB- were highly affecting even to myself ."
"At Kinlochaline I got Neil Roy upon one side on the beach , and said I made sure he was one of Appin 's men ."
`` And what for no ? ''
said he .
"`` I am seeking somebody , '' said I ; `` and it comes in my mind that you will have news of him ."
Alan Breck Stewart is his name . ''
"And very foolishly , instead of showing him the button , I sought to pass a shilling in his hand ."
At this he drew back .
"`` I am very much affronted , '' he said ; `` and this is not the way that one shentleman should behave to another at all ."
"The man you ask for is in France ; but if he was in my sporran , '' says he , `` and your belly full of shillings , I would not hurt a hair upon his body . ''"
"I saw I had gone the wrong way to work , and without wasting time upon apologies , showed him the button lying in the hollow of my palm ."
"`` Aweel , aweel , '' said Neil ; `` and I think ye might have begun with that end of the stick , whatever !"
"But if ye are the lad with the silver button , all is well , and I have the word to see that ye come safe ."
"But if ye will pardon me to speak plainly , '' says he , `` there is a name that you should never take into your mouth , and that is the name of Alan Breck ; and there is a thing that ye would never do , and that is to offer your dirty money to a Hieland shentleman . ''"
It was not very easy to apologise ; for I could scarce tell him -LRB- what was the truth -RRB- that I had never dreamed he would set up to be a gentleman until he told me so .
"Neil on his part had no wish to prolong his dealings with me , only to fulfil his orders and be done with it ; and he made haste to give me my route ."
"This was to lie the night in Kinlochaline in the public inn ; to cross Morven the next day to Ardgour , and lie the night in the house of one John of the Claymore , who was warned that I might come ; the third day , to be set across one loch at Corran and another at Balachulish , and then ask my way to the house of James of the Glens , at Aucharn in Duror of Appin ."
"There was a good deal of ferrying , as you hear ; the sea in all this part running deep into the mountains and winding about their roots ."
"It makes the country strong to hold and difficult to travel , but full of prodigious wild and dreadful prospects ."
"I had some other advice from Neil : to speak with no one by the way , to avoid Whigs , Campbells , and the `` red-soldiers ; '' to leave the road and lie in a bush if I saw any of the latter coming , `` for it was never chancy to meet in with them ; '' and in brief , to conduct myself like a robber or a Jacobite agent , as perhaps Neil thought me ."
"The inn at Kinlochaline was the most beggarly vile place that ever pigs were styed in , full of smoke , vermin , and silent Highlanders ."
"I was not only discontented with my lodging , but with myself for my mismanagement of Neil , and thought I could hardly be worse off ."
"But very wrongly , as I was soon to see ; for I had not been half an hour at the inn -LRB- standing in the door most of the time , to ease my eyes from the peat smoke -RRB- when a thunderstorm came close by , the springs broke in a little hill on which the inn stood , and one end of the house became a running water ."
"Places of public entertainment were bad enough all over Scotland in those days ; yet it was a wonder to myself , when I had to go from the fireside to the bed in which I slept , wading over the shoes ."
"Early in my next day 's journey I overtook a little , stout , solemn man , walking very slowly with his toes turned out , sometimes reading in a book and sometimes marking the place with his finger , and dressed decently and plainly in something of a clerical style ."
"This I found to be another catechist , but of a different order from the blind man of Mull : being indeed one of those sent out by the Edinburgh Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge , to evangelise the more savage places of the Highlands ."
"His name was Henderland ; he spoke with the broad south-country tongue , which I was beginning to weary for the sound of ; and besides common countryship , we soon found we had a more particular bond of interest ."
"For my good friend , the minister of Essendean , had translated into the Gaelic in his by-time a number of hymns and pious books which Henderland used in his work , and held in great esteem ."
"Indeed , it was one of these he was carrying and reading when we met ."
"We fell in company at once , our ways lying together as far as to Kingairloch ."
`` Could I have something to put these fellers in ?
"Mr. Hyde and I found 'em , and they are first-rate ones , so I 'd like to keep and watch 'em ; can I ? ''"
"asked Dan , forgetting his foot , and laughing to see the crabs go sidling and backing over the bed ."
`` Of course you can ; Polly 's old cage will be just the thing .
"Do n't let them nip Teddy 's toes while I get it ; '' and away went Mrs. Jo , leaving Dan overjoyed to find that his treasures were not considered rubbish , and thrown away ."
"Nat , Demi , and the cage arrived together , and the crabs were settled in their new house , to the great delight of the boys , who , in the excitement of the performance , forgot any awkwardness they might otherwise have felt in greeting the runaway ."
To these admiring listeners Dan related his adventures much more fully than he had done to the Bhaers .
"Then he displayed his `` plunder , '' and described each article so well , that Mrs. Jo , who had retired to the next room to leave them free , was surprised and interested , as well as amused , at their boyish chatter ."
`` How much the lad knows of these things !
how absorbed he is in them !
"and what a mercy it is just now , for he cares so little for books , it would be hard to amuse him while he is laid up ; but the boys can supply him with beetles and stones to any extent , and I am glad to find out this taste of his ; it is a good one , and may perhaps prove the making of him ."
"If he should turn out a great naturalist , and Nat a musician , I should have cause to be proud of this year 's work ; '' and Mrs. Jo sat smiling over her book as she built castles in the air , just as she used to do when a girl , only then they were for herself , and now they were for other people , which is the reason perhaps that some of them came to pass in reality for charity is an excellent foundation to build anything upon ."
"Nat was most interested in the adventures , but Demi enjoyed the beetles and butterflies immensely , drinking in the history of their changeful little lives as if it were a new and lovely sort of fairy tale for , even in his plain way , Dan told it well , and found great satisfaction in the thought that here at least the small philosopher could learn of him ."
"So interested were they in the account of catching a musk rat , whose skin was among the treasures , that Mr. Bhaer had to come himself to tell Nat and Demi it was time for the walk ."
Dan looked so wistfully after them as they ran off that Father Bhaer proposed carrying him to the sofa in the parlor for a little change of air and scene .
"When he was established , and the house quiet , Mrs. Jo , who sat near by showing Teddy pictures , said , in an interested tone , as she nodded towards the treasures still in Dan 's hands , `` Where did you learn so much about these things ? ''"
"`` I always liked 'em , but did n't know much till Mr. Hyde told me . ''"
"`` Oh , he was a man who lived round in the woods studying these things I do n't know what you call him and wrote about frogs , and fishes , and so on ."
"He stayed at Page 's , and used to want me to go and help him , and it was great fun , 'cause he told me ever so much , and was uncommon jolly and wise ."
Hope I 'll see him again sometime . ''
"`` I hope you will , '' said Mrs. Jo , for Dan 's face had brightened up , and he was so interested in the matter that he forgot his usual taciturnity ."
"`` Why , he could make birds come to him , and rabbits and squirrels did n't mind him any more than if he was a tree ."
Did you ever tickle a lizard with a straw ? ''
"asked Dan , eagerly ."
"`` No , but I should like to try it . ''"
"`` Well , I 've done it , and it 's so funny to see 'em turn over and stretch out , they like it so much ."
"Mr. Hyde used to do it ; and he 'd make snakes listen to him while he whistled , and he knew just when certain flowers would blow , and bees would n't sting him , and he 'd tell the wonderfullest things about fish and flies , and the Indians and the rocks . ''"
"`` I think you were so fond of going with Mr. Hyde , you rather neglected Mr. Page , '' said Mrs. Jo , slyly ."
"`` Yes , I did ; I hated to have to weed and hoe when I might be tramping round with Mr. Hyde ."
"Page thought such things silly , and called Mr. Hyde crazy because he 'd lay hours watching a trout or a bird . ''"
"`` Suppose you say lie instead of lay , it is better grammar , '' said Mrs. Jo , very gently ; and then added , `` Yes , Page is a thorough farmer , and would not understand that a naturalist 's work was just as interesting , and perhaps just as important as his own ."
"Now , Dan , if you really love these things , as I think you do , and I am glad to see it , you shall have time to study them and books to help you ; but I want you to do something besides , and to do it faithfully , else you will be sorry by and by , and find that you have got to begin again . ''"
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
So the man gave him a pair of snow-shoes.
"""When you get on these,"" he said, ""you'll come to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he is lord over all the birds of the air."
"Ask him. When you reach his house, just turn the shoes so that the toes point this way, and they'll come home of themselves."" So when the King reached the house, he turned the shoes as the lord of the beasts had said, and away they went home of themselves."
"So he asked again after Whiteland, and the man called all the birds with a blast of his horn, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay; but none of the birds knew. Now, long, long after the rest of the birds came an old eagle, which had been away ten round years, but he couldn't tell any more than the rest."
"""Well, well,"" said the man, ""I'll lend you a pair of snow-shoes, and, when you get them on, they'll carry you to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he's lord of all the fish in the sea; you'd better ask him. But don't forget to turn the toes of the shoes this way."""
"The King was full of thanks, got on the shoes, and when he came to the man who was lord over the fish of the sea, he turned the toes round, and so off they went home like the other pair. After that, he asked again after Whiteland."
"So the man called the fish with a blast, but no fish could tell where it lay. At last came an old pike, which they had great work to call home, he was such a way off. So when they asked him he said:"
"""Know it? I should think I did! I've been cook there ten years, and to-morrow I'm going there again; for now the queen of Whiteland, whose king is away, is going to wed another husband."""
"""Well!"" said the man, ""as this is so, I'll give you a bit of advice."
"Hereabouts, on a moor, stand three brothers, and here they have stood these hundred years, fighting about a hat, a cloak, and a pair of boots. If any one has these three things he can make himself invisible, and wish himself anywhere he pleases. You can tell them you wish to try the things, and, after that, you'll pass judgment between them, whose they shall be."""
"Yes! the King thanked the man, and went and did as he told him."
"""What's all this?"" he said to the brothers. ""Why do you stand here fighting for ever and a day? Just let me try these things, and I'll give judgment whose they shall be."""
"They were very willing to do this; but, as soon as he had got the hat, cloak, and boots, he said:"
"""When we meet next time, I'll tell you my judgment,"" and with these words he wished himself away."
"So as he went along up in the air, he came up with the North wind."
"""Whither away?"" roared the North Wind."
"""To Whiteland,"" said the King; and then he told him all that had befallen him."
"""Ah,"" said the North Wind, ""you go faster than I you do; for you can go straight, while I have to puff and blow round every turn and corner. But when you get there, just place yourself on the stairs by the side of the door, and then I'll come storming in, as though I were going to blow down the whole castle. And then when the prince, who is to have your Queen, comes out to see what's the matter, just you take him by the collar and pitch him out of doors; then I'll look after him, and see if I can't carry him off."""
"Well, the King did as the North Wind said. He took his stand on the stairs, and when the North Wind came, storming and roaring, and took hold of the castle wall, so that it shook again, the prince came out to see what was the matter. But as soon as ever he came, the King caught him by the collar and pitched him out of doors, and then the North Wind caught him up and carried him off. So when there was an end of him, the King went into the castle, and at first his Queen didn't know him, he was so wan and thin, through wandering so far and being so woeful; but when he shewed her the ring, she was as glad as glad could be; and so the rightful wedding was held, and the fame of it spread far and wide."
SORIA MORIA CASTLE
"Once on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name was Halvor. Ever since he was a little boy he would turn his hand to nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes. His father and mother often put him out to learn this trade or that, but Halvor could stay nowhere; for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders."
"Well, one day a skipper came, and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands. Yes, Halvor would like that very much; so he wasn't long in getting himself ready."
"How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about."
"Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, and Halvor asked the skipper's leave to go on shore and look about him; he would sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep."
"""Do you think now you're fit to show yourself before folk,"" said the skipper, ""why, you've no clothes but those rags you stand in?"""
"But Halvor stuck to his own, and so at last he got leave, but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow. So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat cornfields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul. Well, it began to blow, but Halvor thought he hadn't seen enough yet, and he wanted to walk a little farther just to see if he couldn't meet any folk. So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it."
"Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone. So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn't taken a bit to eat with him, he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got."
"In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and Halvor went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days. It was so grand and fine; there were vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a living soul. So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel."
"""Nay, nay, now!"" she called out, ""dare Christian folk come hither? But now you'd best be off about your business, if you don't want the Troll to gobble you up; for here lives a Troll with three heads."""
"And to her husband she said, ""My dear, why do you go on worrying about it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true but she may marry a clever man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as ever you cared to teach him."""
Then the King found his tongue.
"""If she does marry,"" he said, slowly, ""her husband will have to be a very clever man oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him."""
The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be disagreeable.
"""Ah,"" she said, ""don't punish the child because she loves her mother."""
"""I'm not going to punish her for that,"" said he. ""I'm only going to teach her to respect her father."""
"And without another word he went off to his laboratory and worked all night, boiling different-colored things in crucibles, and copying charms in curious twisted letters from old brown books with mold stains on their yellowy pages."
"The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the Lone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from everywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her."
"He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: ""Here you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your wedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child."""
"And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left, with the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools."
"The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she remembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the Queen told her all."
"""For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me,"" said the witch, ""I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is not much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her."
"But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till the spell is taken off the child."""
"""I would be a stone for a thousand years,"" said the poor Queen, ""if at the end of them I could see my dear again."""
"So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which travel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker than thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her."
"""Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,"" she cried, and hung around the Queen's neck as if she would never let go."
"""Now,"" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for them, ""I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a happy old woman."""
"Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand; but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good education."
"And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time, from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming, creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl, bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken their wise young heads and said: ""'Bout ship!"" and gone discreetly home to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms."
But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the years went by.
"Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince."
"Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world and it knows when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear."
"And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: ""What light is that?"""
"Then the skipper said: ""All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me, and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess, fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance, so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real."""
"So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to dread."
"But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman Kings."
"What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened, but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had thoughtfully brought with him."
See page 88.]
"So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait."
"By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with golden hair and a green gown and he went out to meet her."
"""I've come to save you,"" he said. ""How darling and beautiful you are!"""
"Once he was hard pressed for means, as he was trying to run a farm, and running a farm costs money: so he went to a bank to borrow. He hated to do it, because he had no special inducements to offer a bank or to make it hilariously loan him money."
"""How much did you think you would need, Mr. Webster?"" asked the President, cutting off some coupons as he spoke and making paper dolls of them."
"""Well, I could get along very well,"" said Webster, in that deep, resinous voice of his, ""if I could have two thousand dollars."""
"""Well, you remember,"" said the banker, ""do you not, that you have two thousand dollars here, that you deposited five years ago, after you had dined with the Governor of North Carolina?"""
"""No, I had forgotten about that,"" said Webster. ""Give me a blank check without unnecessary delay."""
We may learn from this that Mr. Webster was not a careful man in the matter of detail.
"His speech on the two-hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims was a good thing, and found its way into the press of the time."
"His speech at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, and his eulogy of Adams and Jefferson, were beautiful and thrilling."
"Daniel Webster had a very large brain, and used to loan his hat to brother Senators now and then when their heads were paining them, provided he did not want it himself."
"His reply to Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, in 1830, was regarded as one of his ablest parliamentary efforts. Hayne attacked New England, and first advanced the doctrine of nullification, which was even more dangerous than secession, Jefferson Davis in 1860 denying that he had ever advocated or favored such a doctrine."
"Webster spoke extempore, and people sent out for their lunch rather than go away in the midst of his remarks."
"Webster married twice, but did not let that make any difference with his duty to his country."
"He tried to farm it some, but did not amass a large sum, owing to his heavy losses in trying year after year to grow Saratoga potatoes for the Boston market."
"No American, foreign or domestic, ever made a greater name for himself than Daniel Webster, but he was not so good a penman as Noah; Noah was the better pen-writer."
"Noah Webster also had the better command of language of the two. Those who have read his great work entitled ""Webster's Elementary Spelling-Book, or, How One Word Led to Another,"" will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never lacked for a word by which to express himself."
He was a brainy man and a good speller.
One by one our eminent men are passing away. Mr. Webster has passed away; Napoleon Bonaparte is no more; and Dr. Mary Walker is fading away.
This has been a severe winter on Red Shirt; and I have to guard against the night air a good deal myself.
"It would ill become me, at this late date, to criticise Mr. Webster's work, a work that is now, I may say, in nearly every home and school-room in the land. It is a great book. I only hope that had Mr."
Webster lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.
"I hate to compare my books with Mr. Webster's, because it looks egotistical in me; but, although Noah's book is larger than mine, and has more literary attractions as a book to set a child on at the table, it does not hold the interest of the reader all the way through."
"He has introduced too many characters into his book at the expense of the plot. It is a good book to pick up and while away a leisure hour, perhaps, but it is not a work that could rivet your interest till midnight, while the fire went out and the thermometer stepped down to 47° below zero. You do not hurry through the pages to see whether Reginald married the girl or not. Mr. Webster did not seem to care how the affair turned out."
"Therein consists the great difference between Noah and myself. He doesn't keep up the interest. A friend of mine at Sing Sing, who secured one of my books, said he never left his room till he had devoured it. He said he seemed chained to the spot; and if you can't believe a convict who is entirely out of politics, whom, in the name of George Washington, can you trust?"
"Mr. Webster was certainly a most brilliant writer, though a little inclined, perhaps, to be wordy. I have discovered in some of his later books one hundred and eighteen thousand words no two of which are alike."
"This shows great fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The reader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author's wonderful word-painting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome."
"I had heard so much of Mr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is cold, methodical, dry, and dispassionate in the extreme, and one cannot help comparing it with the works of James Fenimore Cooper and Horace."
"As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of whiling away an idle hour. No one should travel without Mr. Webster's tale. Those who examine this tale will readily see why there were no flies on the author. He kept them off with this tale."
"It is a good book, as I say, to take up for a moment, or to read on the train, or to hold the door open on a hot day. I would never take a long railroad ride without it, eyether. I would as soon forget my bottle of cough-medicine."
"Mr. Webster's Speller had an immense sale. Ten years ago he had sold forty million copies. And yet it had this same defect. It was cold, dull, disconnected, and verbose. There was only one good thing in the book, and that was a little literary gem regarding a boy who broke in and stole the apples of a total stranger. The story was so good that I have often wondered whom Mr. Webster got to write it for him."
"The old man, it seems, at first told the boy that he had better come down, as there was a draught in the tree; but the young sass-box apple-sass-box, I presume told him to avaunt."
"They began one nest and had it nearly done, when Mr. Goldfinch said it was not in a good place, and tore it all to pieces. Mrs. Goldfinch felt very badly about this and talked it over with some of her Goldfinch neighbors. They told her not to mind it at all, that their husbands often did the same thing, and that sometimes they came to like the new place much better than the old. At any rate, there was no use in getting cross about it, because that was something she would have to expect."
"Mr. Goldfinch was sure that they had built too near the ground, and he had chosen a crotch above. Toward this he was dragging the bits of grape-vine and cedar-bark which were woven into their first nest. He said they could also use some of the grasses and mosses which they had gotten together, and he even told his wife of some fine thistle-down which he could bring for the inside, where the eggs were to be laid."
"Mrs. Goldfinch watched him tugging with bill and both feet to loosen the bits of bark, and she said to herself: ""Dear fellow! what a helper he is! I won't mind rebuilding if it makes him happy,"" and she went to work with a will."
"When the sun went down in the west the next night the second nest was done, and it was the last thing at which the Goldfinches looked before tucking their heads under their wings and going to sleep. It was the first thing that they saw the next morning, too, and they hopped all around it and twittered with pride, and gave it little tweaks here and little pokes there before they flew away to get breakfast."
"While they were gone, Mrs. Cowbird came walking over the grass and dry leaves to the foot of the tree. She wagged her head at every step, and put on as many airs as though she were showily dressed, instead of wearing, as she always does, a robe of dull brownish gray. She had seen the Goldfinches fly away, and she was looking for their home. She was a lazy creature in spite of her stirring ways, and she wished to find a nice little nest in which to lay an egg. You know Cowbirds never think of building nests. They want all of their time to take care of themselves, which is a very foolish way of living; but then, you could never make a Cowbird think so!"
"""That nest is exactly right,"" said Mrs. Cowbird. ""I will lay my egg there at once, and when Mrs. Goldfinch has laid hers she will have to hatch them all together and take care of my baby for me. What an easy way this is to bring up one's family! It is really no work at all! And I am sure that my children will get along well, because I am always careful to choose the nests of small birds for them. Then they are larger and stronger than the other babies, and can get more than their share of food."""
"So she laid a big white egg with gray and brown spots on it in the Goldfinches' new home, and then she flew off to the Cowbird flock, as gay and careless as you please. When the Goldfinches came back, they saw the egg in their nest and called all their neighbors to talk it over."
"""What shall I ever do?"" said Mrs. Goldfinch. ""I wanted my nest for my own eggs, and I meant to lay them to-morrow. I suppose I shall have to sit on this one too, but it won't be at all comfortable."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said one of her neighbors, a Yellow Warbler. ""I left my nest once when such a thing happened to me, and built a new one for my own eggs."""
"""Oh dear!"" cried Mrs. Goldfinch, ""we have built two already, and I cannot build another."""
"""Well, whatever you do,"" said a Vireo, ""don't hatch the big egg out with your own. I did once, and such a time as I had! The young Cowbird pushed two of my little Vireos out onto the ground, and ate so much that I was quite worn out by the work of hunting for him."""
"""My dear,"" said Mr. Goldfinch, ""I have an excellent plan. We will put another floor in our nest, right over this egg, and then by adding a bit all around the sides we can have plenty of room for our own children. It will be much less work than beginning all over again, and then the Cowbird's egg will be too cool to hatch."""
"Everybody called this a most clever plan, and Mr. Goldfinch was very proud to have thought of it. They went to work once more, and it was not so very long before the new floor was done and the new walls raised."
"Then, oh, wonder of wonders! there were soon four tiny, pearly eggs of their own lying on the thistle-down lining of the nest."
"Mrs. Goldfinch had to stay very closely at home now, but her husband went off with his friends a great deal. He bathed and sang and preened his feathers and talked about his queer nest and his bright little wife, after the manner of Goldfinches everywhere."
"His friends laughed at him for helping so much about the nest, for, you know, Goldfinches do not often help their wives about home. He cocked his handsome head on one side and answered: ""My wife seemed to need me then. She is not so very strong. And I do not know what she would ever have done about the strange egg, if I had not been there to advise her."""
"When he got back to his home that night, Mrs. Goldfinch said: ""I have been wondering why we did not roll the Cowbird's egg out on the ground, instead of going to all that trouble of building around it."""
"And Mr. Goldfinch declared that he believed she was the only bird who had ever thought of such a thing. ""It could have been done just as well as not,"" he said. ""I must tell that to the other birds in the morning."
"How lucky I am to have such a bright wife! It would be dreadful if such a clever fellow as I had a dull mate!"""
MRS. MOURNING DOVE'S HOUSEKEEPING
"Strange as it may seem, there had never been any Mourning Doves in the forest until this year, and when a pair came there to live, the people were much excited. They talked about the Doves' song, so sweet and sad, and about their soft coats of brown and gray, and they wondered very much what kind of home they would build. Would it be a swinging pocket of hairs, strings, and down, like that of the Orioles? Would it be stout and heavy like the nests of the Robins? Or would it be a ball of leaves and grasses on the ground, with a tiny doorway in one side, like that of the Ovenbird?"
"You can see that the forest people were really very much interested in the Mourning Doves, and so, perhaps, it is not strange that, when the new couple built their nest in the lower branches of a spruce tree, everybody watched it and talked about it."
"""Really,"" said one of the Blackbirds, who had flown over from the swamp near by, ""I never should think of calling that thing a nest! It is nothing but a few twigs and sticks laid together. It is just as flat as a maple-leaf, and what is to keep those poor little Doves from tumbling to the ground I can't see."""
"""I wouldn't worry about the little Doves yet,"" said a Warbler. ""I don't think there will ever be any little Doves in that nest. The eggs will roll off of it long before they are ready to hatch, and the nest will blow to pieces in the first storm we have."""
"""Well,"" said the Blackbird, as she started for home, ""I shall want to know how the Mourning Doves get on. If any of you are over my way, stop and tell me the news."""
"Some days after this, a Quail, passing under the Doves' home, happened to look up and see two white eggs in the nest. It was so very thin that she could see them quite plainly through the openings between the twigs."
"Later in the day, she spoke of this to a Grouse, saying, ""I came by the Mourning Doves' nest and saw two white eggs through the bottom."""
"After she went away, the Grouse said to a wild Rabbit: ""The Quail told me that the Mourning Dove's eggs went right through the bottom of her nest, and I don't wonder. It wasn't strong enough to hold anything."""
"At sunset, the Rabbit had a short visit with Mrs. Goldfinch, as she pulled a great thistle-head to pieces and made her supper from its seeds. He told her he had heard that the Mourning Dove's eggs had fallen through the bottom of the nest and broken on the ground, and Mrs."
"Goldfinch said: ""Oh, that poor Mrs. Mourning Dove! I must go to see her in the morning."" Then she fled home to her own four pearly treasures."
"Now, of course the Rabbit was mistaken when he said anybody had told him that those two eggs were broken; just as much mistaken as the Grouse was when she said somebody had told her that the eggs had fallen. They both thought they were right, but they were careless listeners and careless talkers, and so each one had changed it a bit in the telling."
131 Fair Katrinelje and Pif-Paf-Poltrie
"“Good-day, Father Hollenthe.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your daughter?” “Oh, yes, if Mother Malcho (Milch-cow), Brother High-and-Mighty, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.”"
"“Where is Mother Malcho, then?” “She is in the cow-house, milking the cow.”"
"“Good-day, Mother Malcho.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your daughter?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Brother High-and-Mighty, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.” “Where is Brother High-and-Mighty, then?” “He is in the room chopping some wood.” “Good-day, Brother High-and-Mighty.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your sister?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.” “Where is Sister Käsetraut, then?” “She is in the garden cutting cabbages.” “Good-day, sister Käsetraut.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your sister?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Brother High-and-Mighty, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you may have her.”"
"“Where is fair Katrinelje, then?” “She is in the room counting out her farthings.” “Good day, fair Katrinelje.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “Wilt thou be my bride?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Brother High-and-Mighty, and Sister Käsetraut are willing, I am ready.”"
"“Fair Katrinelje, how much dowry do hast thou?” “Fourteen farthings in ready money, three and a half groschen owing to me, half a pound of dried apples, a handful of fried bread, and a handful of spices."
"And many other things are mine, Have I not a dowry fine?"
"“Pif-paf-poltrie, what is thy trade? Art thou a tailor?” “Something better.” “A shoemaker?” “Something better.” “A husbandman?” “Something better.” “A joiner?” “Something better.” “A smith?” “Something better.”"
"“A miller?” “Something better.” “Perhaps a broom-maker?” “Yes, that’s what I am, is it not a fine trade?”"
132 The Fox and the Horse
"A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master would no longer give him anything to eat and said, “I can certainly make no more use of thee, but still I mean well by thee; if thou provest thyself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain thee, but now take thyself away out of my stable,” and with that he chased him into the open country. The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. Then the fox met him and said, “Why dost thou hang thy head so, and go about all alone?” “Alas,” replied the horse, “avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plough well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out.” “Without giving thee a chance?” asked the fox. “The chance was a bad one. He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that.”"
"The fox said, “I will help thee, just lay thyself down, stretch thyself out, as if thou wert dead, and do not stir.” The horse did as the fox desired, and the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, “A dead horse is lying outside there, just come with me, thou canst have a rich meal.” The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, “After all, it is not very comfortable for thee here I tell thee what I will fasten it to thee by the tail, and then thou canst drag it into thy cave, and devour it in peace.”"
"This advice pleased the lion: he lay down, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept quite quiet. But the fox tied the lion’s legs together with the horse’s tail, and twisted and fastened all so well and so strongly that no strength could break it."
"When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, “Pull, white horse, pull.” Then up sprang the horse at once, and drew the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew out in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him over the country to his master’s door. When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, “Thou shalt stay with me and fare well,” and he gave him plenty to eat until he died."
133 The Shoes That Were Danced to Pieces
"There was once upon a time a King who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other. They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the King locked the door, and bolted it. But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass. Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be King after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life. It was not long before a King’s son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses’ sleeping-chamber."
"His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open."
"But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles. On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his head was struck off without mercy. Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives. Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King lived. There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. “I hardly know myself,”"
"answered he, and added in jest, “I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become King.”"
"“That is not so difficult,” said the old woman, “you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep.” With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, “If you put on that, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.” When the soldier had received this good advice, he went into the thing in earnest, took heart, went to the King, and announced himself as a suitor. He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him. He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the ante-chamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop. Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep. The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, “He, too, might as well have saved his life.” With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance. Only the youngest said, “I know not how it is; you are very happy, but I feel very strange; some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.” “Thou art a goose, who art always frightened,” said the eldest. “Hast thou forgotten how many Kings’ sons have already come here in vain? I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, in any case the clown would not have awakened.” When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves quite secure. The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it; it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first. The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest. Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress; she was terrified at that, and cried out, “What is that? who is pulling my dress?” “Don’t be so silly!” said the eldest, “you have caught it on a nail.” Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought, “I must carry a token away with me,” and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report. The youngest cried out again."
"“Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?” But the eldest said, “It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly.” After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds; he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes. They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest. Then her prince said, “I can’t tell why the boat is so much heavier to-day; I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across.” “What should cause that,” said the youngest, “but the warm weather? I feel very warm too.”"
"On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums."
"They rowed over there, entered, and each prince danced with the girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when one of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty when she carried it to her mouth; the youngest was alarmed at this, but the eldest always made her be silent. They danced there till three o’clock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off; the princes rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest. On the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return the following night. When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up slowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him, and they said, “So far as he is concerned, we are safe.” They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down. Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and again went with them. Then everything was done just as it had been done the first time, and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces. But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token. When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the twelve stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say. When the King put the question, “Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night?” he answered, “In an underground castle with twelve princes,”"
"and related how it had come to pass, and brought out the tokens. The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all."
"Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have to wife? He answered, “I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.” Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom was promised him after the King’s death. But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve."
134 The Six Servants
"In former times there lived an aged Queen who was a sorceress, and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. The old woman, however, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever wished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die. Many had been dazzled by the daughter’s beauty, and had actually risked this, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do, and then no mercy was shown; they had to kneel down, and their heads were struck off. A certain King’s son who had also heard of the maiden’s beauty, said to his father, “Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage.” “Never,” answered the King; “if you were to go, it would be going to your death.” On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and for seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him. When the father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he said to him, “Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other means of curing you.” When the son heard that, he rose from his bed and was well again, and joyfully set out on his way."
"And it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from afar something like a great heap of hay lying on the ground, and when he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man, who had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small mountain."
"When the fat man saw the traveller, he stood up and said, “If you are in need of any one, take me into your service.” The prince answered, “What can I do with such a great big man?” “Oh,” said the Stout One, “this is nothing, when I stretch myself out well, I am three thousand times fatter.” “If that’s the case,” said the prince, “I can make use of thee, come with me.” So the Stout One followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the turf. “What art thou doing there?” asked the King’s son. “I am listening,” replied the man. “What art thou listening to so attentively?” “I am listening to what is just going on in the world, for nothing escapes my ears; I even hear the grass growing.” “Tell me,”"
"said the prince, “what thou hearest at the court of the old Queen who has the beautiful daughter.” Then he answered, “I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer’s head.” The King’s son said, “I can make use of thee, come with me.” They went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body. When they had walked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to the head also. “Why,” said the prince, “what a tall rascal thou art!” “Oh,” replied the Tall One, “that is nothing at all yet; when I really stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and taller than the highest mountain on earth."
"I will gladly enter your service, if you will take me.” “Come with me,”"
"said the prince, “I can make use of thee.” They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes. The prince said to him, “Hast thou weak eyes, that thou canst not look at the light?”"
"An effort was made to get up a fight between the French fleet and the English at Newport for the championship, but a severe storm came up and prevented it."
"In July the Wyoming Massacre, under the management of the Tories and Indians, commanded by Butler, took place in that beautiful valley near Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania."
"This massacre did more to make the Indians and Tories unpopular in this country than any other act of the war. The men were away in the army, and the women, children, and old men alone were left to the vengeance of the two varieties of savage. The Indians had never had gospel privileges, but the Tories had. Otherwise they resembled each other."
"In 1779 the English seemed to have Georgia and the South pretty well to themselves. Prevost, the English general, made an attack on Charleston, but, learning that Lincoln was after him, decided that, as he had a telegram to meet a personal friend at Savannah, he would go there. In September, Lincoln, assisted by the French under D'Estaing, attacked Savannah. One thousand lives were lost, and D'Estaing showed the white feather to advantage. Count Pulaski lost his life in this fight. He was a brave Polish patriot, and his body was buried in the Savannah River."
"The capture of Stony Point about this time by ""Mad Anthony Wayne"" was one of the most brilliant battles of the war."
"Learning the countersign from a negro who sold strawberries to the British, the troops passed the guard over the bridge that covered the marsh, and, gagging the worthy inside guard, they marched up the hill with fixed bayonets and fixed the enemy to the number of six hundred."
"The countersign was, ""The fort is won,"" and so it was, in less time than it takes to ejaculate the word ""scat!"" Wayne was wounded at the outset, but was carried up the hill in command, with a bandage tied about his head. He was a brave man, and never knew in battle what fear was. Yet, strange to say, a bat in his bed would make him start up and turn pale."
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE CLOSE OF THE REVOLUTION.
"The atrocities introduced into this country by the Tories and Indians caused General Sullivan to go out against the measly enemy, whip him near Elmira, and destroy the fields of corn and villages in the Genesee country, where the Indian women were engaged in farming while their men-folks attended to the massacre industry."
The weak point with the Americans seemed to be lack of a suitable navy.
"A navy costs money, and the Colonists were poor. In 1775 they fitted out several swift sailing-vessels, which did good service. Inside of five years they captured over five hundred ships, cruised among the British isles, and it is reported that they captured war-vessels that were tied to the English wharves."
"Paul Jones had a method of running his vessel alongside the enemy's, lashing the two together, and then having it out with the crew, generally winning in a canter. His idea in lashing the two ships together was to have one good ship to ride home on. Generally it was the one he captured, while his own, which was rotten, was allowed to go down. This was especially the case in the fight between the Richard and the Serapis, September 23, 1779."
"In 1780 the war was renewed in South Carolina. Charleston, after a forty days' siege, was forced to surrender. Gates now took charge of the South, and also gave a sprinting exhibition at Camden, where he was almost wiped off the face of the earth. He had only two troops left at the close of the battle, and they could not keep up with Gates in the retreat. This battle and the retreat overheated Gates and sowed the seeds of heart-disease, from which he never recovered. He should have chosen a more peaceful life, such as the hen-traffic, or the growth of asparagus for the market."
"Benedict Arnold has been severely reproached in history, but he was a brave soldier, and possibly serving under Gates, who jealously kept him in the background, had a good deal to do with the little European dicker which so darkened his brilliant career as a soldier."
"Unhappy man! He was not well received in England, and, though a brilliant man, was forced to sit in a corner evening after evening and hear the English tell his humorous stories as their own."
"The Carolinas were full of Tories, and opposition to English rule was practically abandoned in the South for the time, with the exception of that made in a desultory swamp-warfare by the partisan bands with such leaders as Marion, Sumter, and Pickens."
Two hundred thousand dollars of Continental money was the sum now out.
"Forty dollars of it would buy one dollar's worth of groceries; but the grocer had to know the customer pretty well, and even then it was more to accommodate than anything else that he sold at that price."
"The British flooded the country with a counterfeit that was rather better-looking than the genuine: so that by the time a man had paid six hundred dollars for a pair of boots, and the crooked bills had been picked out and others substituted, it made him feel that starting a republic was a mighty unpopular job."
"General Arnold had married a Tory lady, and lived in Philadelphia while recovering from his wounds received at Quebec and Saratoga. He was rather a high roller, and ran behind, so that it is estimated that his bills there per month required a peach-basket-full of currency with which to pay them, as the currency was then quoted. Besides, Gates had worried him, and made him think that patriotism was mostly politics. He was also overbearing, and the people of Philadelphia mobbed him once. He was reprimanded gently by Washington, but Arnold was haughty and yet humiliated. He got command of West Point, a very important place indeed, and then arranged with Clinton to swap it for six thousand three hundred and fifteen pounds and a colonelcy in the English army."
"Major André was appointed to confer with Arnold, and got off the ship Vulture to make his way to the appointed place, but it was daylight by that time, and the Vulture, having been fired on, dropped down the river. André now saw no way for him but to get back to New York; but at Tarrytown he was met by three patriots, who caught his horse by the reins, and, though André tried to tip them, he did not succeed. They found papers on his person, among them a copy of Punch, which made them suspicious that he was not an American, and so he was tried and hanged as a spy. This was one of the saddest features of the American Revolution, and should teach us to be careful how we go about in an enemy's country, also to use great care in selecting and subscribing for papers."
"In 1781, Greene, who succeeded Gates, took charge of the two thousand ragged and bony troops. January 17 he was attacked at Cowpens by Tarleton. The militia fell back, and the English made a grand charge, supposing victory to be within reach. But the wily and foxy troops turned at thirty yards and gave the undertaking business a boom that will never be forgotten."
"Morgan was in command of the Colonial forces. He went on looking for more regulars to kill, but soon ran up against Cornwallis the surrenderer."
"General Greene now joined Morgan, and took charge of the retreat. At the Yadkin River they crossed over ahead of Cornwallis, when it began for to rain. When Cornwallis came to the river he found it so swollen and restless that he decided not to cross. Later he crossed higher up, and made for the fords of the Dan at thirty miles a day, to head off the Americans. Greene beat him, however, by a length, and saved his troops."
"The writer has seen the place on the Yadkin where Cornwallis decided not to cross. It was one of the pivotal points of the war, and is of about medium height."
"A fight followed at Guilford Court-House, where the Americans were driven back, but the enemy got thinned out so noticeably that Cornwallis decided to retreat. He went back to Washington on a Bull Run schedule, without pausing even for feed or water. Cornwallis was greatly agitated, and the coat he wore at the time, and now shown in the Smithsonian Institution, shows distinctly the marks made where the Colonists played checkers on the tail."
"The battle of Eutaw Springs, September 8, also greatly reduced the British forces at that point."
"Arnold conducted a campaign into Virginia, and was very brutal about it, killing a great many people who were strangers to him, and who had never harmed him, not knowing him, as the historian says, from ""Adam's off ox."""
"His heart was good, but his blood was bad,       Sing Glory hallelujah.""[3]"

CHAPTER VIII.
THE DUTCH AT NEW AMSTERDAM.
"Soon after the discovery of the Hudson, Dutch ships began to visit that region, to traffic in furs with the Indians. Some huts were erected by these traders on Manhattan Island in 1613, and a trading-post was established in 1615. Relics of these times are frequently turned up yet on Broadway while putting in new pipes, or taking out old pipes, or repairing other pipes, or laying plans for yet other pipes, or looking in the earth to see that the original pipes have not been taken away."
"Afterwards the West India Company obtained a grant of New Netherland, and New Amsterdam was fairly started. In 1626, Minuit, the first governor, arrived, and, as we have stated, purchased the entire city of New York of the Indians for twenty-four dollars."
"Then trouble sprang up between the Dutch and the Swedes on the Delaware over the possession of Manhattan, and when the two tribes got to conversing with each other over their rights, using the mother-tongue on both sides, it reminded one of the Chicago wheat market when business is good. The English on the Connecticut also saw that Manhattan was going to boom as soon as the Indians could be got farther west, and that property would be high there."
"Peter Stuyvesant was the last Dutch governor of New York. He was a relative of mine. He disliked the English very much. They annoyed him with their democratic ideas and made his life a perfect hell to him. He would be sorry to see the way our folks have since begun to imitate the English. I can almost see him rising in his grave to note how the Stuyvesants in full cry pursue the affrighted anise-seed bag, or with their coaching outfits go tooling along 'cross country, stopping at the inns on the way and unlimbering their portable bath-tubs to check them with the ""clark."""
"Pete, you did well to die early. You would not have been happy here now."
"While Governor Stuyvesant was in hot water with the English, the Swedes, and the Indians, a fleet anchored in the harbor and demanded the surrender of the place in the name of the Duke of York, who wished to use it for a game preserve. After a hot fight with his council, some of whom were willing even then to submit to English rule and hoped that the fleet might have two or three suits of tweed which by mistake were a fit and therefore useless to the owners, and that they might succeed in swapping furs for these, the governor yielded, and in 1664 New York became a British possession, named as above."
"The English governors, however, were not popular. They were mostly political hacks who were pests at home and banished to New York, where the noise of the streets soon drove them to drink. For nine years this sort of thing went on, until one day a Dutch fleet anchored near the Staten Island brewery and in the evening took the town."
"However, in the year following, peace was restored between England and Holland, and New Amsterdam became New York again, also subject to the Tammany rule."
"Andros was governor for a time, but was a sort of pompous tomtit, with a short breath and a large aquiline opinion of himself. He was one of the arrogant old pie-plants whose growth was fostered by the beetle-bellied administration at home. He went back on board the City of Rome one day, and did not return."
"New York had a gleam of hope for civil freedom under the rule of the Duke of York and the county Democracy, but when the duke became James II. he was just like other people who get a raise of salary, and refused to be privately entertained by the self-made ancestry of the American."
"He was proud and arrogant to a degree. He forbade legislation, and stopped his paper. New York was at this time annexed to the New England Colony, and began keeping the Sabbath so vigorously that the angels had great difficulty in getting at it."
"Nicholson, who was the lieutenant tool of iniquity for Andros, fled with him when democracy got too hot for them. Captain Leisler, supported by Steve Brodie and everything south of the Harlem, but bitterly opposed by the aristocracy, who were distinguished by their ability to use new goods in making their children's clothes, whereas the democracy had to make vests for the boys from the cast-off trousers of their fathers, governed the province until Governor Sloughter arrived."
"Sloughter was another imported Smearkase in official life, and arrested Leisler at the request of an aristocrat who drove a pair of bang-tail horses up and down Nassau Street on pleasant afternoons and was afterwards collector of the port. Having arrested Leisler for treason, the governor was a little timid about executing him, for he had never really killed a man in his life, and he hated the sight of blood; so Leisler's enemies got the governor to take dinner with them, and mixed his rum, so that when he got ready to speak, his remarks were somewhat heterogeneous, and before he went home he had signed a warrant for Leisler's immediate execution."
"When he awoke in the morning at his beautiful home on Whitehall Street, the sun was gayly glinting the choppy waves of Buttermilk Channel, and by his watch, which had run down, he saw that it was one o'clock, but whether it was one o'clock A.M. or P.M. he did not know, nor whether it was next Saturday or Tuesday before last. Oh, how he must have felt!"
"His room was dark, the gas having gone out to get better air. He attempted to rise, but a chill, a throb, a groan, and back he lay hastily on the bed just as it was on the point of escaping him. Suddenly a thought came to him. It was not a great thought, but it was such a thought as comes to those who have been thoughtless. He called for a blackamoor slave from abroad who did chores for him, and ordered a bottle of cooking brandy, then some club soda he had brought from London with him. Next he drank a celery-glass of it, and after that he felt better. He then drank another."
"""Keep out of the way of this bed, Julius,"" he said. ""It is coming around that way again. Step to one side, Julius, please, and let the bed walk around and stretch its legs. I never saw a bed spread itself so,"" he continued, seeming to enjoy his own Lancashire humor. ""All night I seemed to feel a great pain creeping over me, Julius,"" he said, hesitatingly, again filling his celery-glass, ""but I see now that it was a counterpane."""
"Eighty years after that, Sloughter was a corpse."
"We should learn from this not to be too hasty in selecting our birthplaces. Had he been born in America, he might have been alive yet."
"From this on the struggles of the people up to the time of the Revolution were enough to mortify the reader almost to death. I will not go over them again. It was the history of all the other Colonies; poor, proud, with large masses of children clustering about, and Indians lurking in the out-buildings. The mother-country was negligent, and even cruel. Her political offscourings were sent to rule the people. The cranberry-crops soured on the vines, and times were very scarce."
"It was during this period that Captain William Kidd, a New York ship-master and anti-snapper from Mulberry Street, was sent out to overtake and punish a few of the innumerable pirates who then infested the high seas."
"Studying first the character, life, and public services of the immoral pirate, and being perfectly foot-loose, his wife having eloped with her family physician, he determined to take a little whirl at the business himself, hoping thereby to escape the noise and heat of New York and obtain a livelihood while life lasted which would maintain him the remainder of his days unless death overtook him."
"Dropping off at Boston one day to secure a supply of tobacco, he was captured while watching the vast number of street-cars on Washington Street. He was taken to England, where he was tried and ultimately hanged. His sudden and sickening death did much to discourage an American youth of great brilliancy who had up to 1868 intended to be a pirate, but who, stumbling across the ""Life and Times of Captain Kidd, and his Awful Death,"" changed his whole course and became one of the ablest historians of the age in which he lived."
This should teach us to read the papers instead of loaning them to people who do not subscribe.
"and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King. The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground. When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about? He answered, “I am fishing.” The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there? The peasant said, “It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.” The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was? The peasant must confess this at once. The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should! the idea was his own."
"They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen."
"When the King reached home again, he said to his wife, “Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me? I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant’s hut.” One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said, “Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,” and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, “Good God! where am I?” He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said, “My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.” Tears rose to the King’s eyes and he said, “Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine,” and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living."
95 Old Hildebrand
"Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her. The peasant woman, too, was quite willing. One day, therefore, he said to the woman, “Listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together. I’ll tell you what; on Wednesday, you must take to your bed, and tell your husband you are ill, and if you only complain and act being ill properly, and go on doing so until Sunday when I have to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be, and makes a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where you can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother, the sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored to health immediately.”"
"“I will manage it,” said the woman promptly. Now therefore on the Wednesday, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when Sunday came the woman said, “I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before my end I should like to hear the parson’s sermon that he is going to preach to-day.” On that the peasant said, “Ah, my child, do not do it—thou mightest make thyself worse if thou wert to get up. Look, I will go to the sermon, and will attend to it very carefully, and will tell thee everything the parson says.”"
"“Well,” said the woman, “go, then, and pay great attention, and repeat to me all that thou hearest.” So the peasant went to the sermon, and the parson began to preach and said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer."
"Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried, “Hurrah! dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if thou wert well! The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and will at once begin my journey so that thou mayst get well the faster,” and thereupon he went away. He was, however, hardly gone before the woman got up, and the parson was there directly."
"But now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the Göckerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs. “May you be blessed,” said the gossip, “where are you off to so fast?”"
"“To all eternity, my friend,” said the peasant, “my wife is ill, and I have been to-day to hear the parson’s sermon, and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and made a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother, the sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my pilgrimage.” “But listen, gossip,” said the egg-merchant to the peasant, “are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing as that? Don’t you know what it means? The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way.”"
“My word!” said the peasant. “How I’d like to know if that’s true!”
"“Come, then,” said the gossip, “I’ll tell you what to do. Get into my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will see for yourself.” So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home."
"When they got to the house, hurrah! but all was going merry there! The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the parson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there. “It is I, gossip,” said the egg-merchant, “give me shelter this night; I have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry them home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able to do it, for it is dark already.”"
"“Indeed, my friend,” said the woman, “thou comest at a very inconvenient time for me, but as thou art here it can’t be helped, come in, and take a seat there on the bench by the stove.” Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parson, however, and the woman, were as merry as possible. At length the parson said, “Listen, my dear friend, thou canst sing beautifully; sing something to me.” “Oh,” said the woman, “I cannot sing now, in my young days indeed I could sing well enough, but that’s all over now.”"
"“Come,” said the parson once more, “do sing some little song.”"
"On that the woman began and sang,"
“I’ve sent my husband away from me To the Göckerli hill in Italy.”
"Thereupon the parson sang,"
"“I wish ’twas a year before he came back, I’d never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.”"
Hallelujah.
"Then the gossip who was in the background began to sing (but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand), so the gossip sang,"
"“What art thou doing, my Hildebrand dear, There on the bench by the stove so near?”"
Hallelujah.
"And then the peasant sang from his basket,"
"“All singing I ever shall hate from this day, And here in this basket no longer I’ll stay.”"
Hallelujah.
"And he got out of the basket, and cudgelled the parson out of the house."
96 The Three Little Birds
"About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting. Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, “If I do not get that one, I will have none.” Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King’s right hand, “Hilloa! hilloa! If I do not get him, I will have no one.”"
"These, however, were the two ministers. The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. This they would not tell him, so the King asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? Then she said, “Yes,” and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the Queen, who had hair like flax."
"But the two sisters had no children, and once when the King was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the Queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. When they had thrown him in (I believe it was into the Weser) a little bird flew up into the air, which sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."

A great cry came from Francesco's lips.

CHAPTER IX
THE DAWN
An undefined melancholy overshadowed the world. Autumn breathed in the
"wind. The year, red-bosomed, was rushing to its doom."
"On the summit of a wood-crowned hill, rising like a pyramid above moor"
"and forest, stood two men silent under the shadows of an oak. In the"

"Crane waited. He waited for what seemed like ages, but a glance at his"
watch told him it had been less than five minutes. He disconnected and
dialed again.
"""This is Crane. We got cut off. I want to talk to Porter."""
"""I'm sorry but Mr. Porter has gone for the day."""
"""Well, where can I reach him? It's important."""
"""I'm sorry. Mr. Porter left no number."""
"""When will he be back?"""
"""He didn't say."""
"Crane slammed the phone down. ""The bastards!"" he snarled. ""The lousy,"
crummy bastards. Running like a pack of scared rats. Bureaucrats!
"Damned, cowardly, self-appointed opportunists!"""
He stopped cursing and sat for a while.
When he got up and left the office he looked and felt old but he had
faced a truth. It would not be necessary to campaign next year.
It wouldn't be of any use.
The folly of Love’s sacrifices.
LES INDOLENTS.

"Suppose we die together, eh?"

"Suppose, then, that we die together?"

"influential persons in Spain, he had no objection."
They took leave of the abbé.
"“All this has to go slowly,” said Kennedy."
“Of course. One cannot insist that it should happen all at once.”
_BERNINI_
"“If you have nothing to do, let’s take a walk,” said the Englishman."
“If you like.”
“Have you noticed the fountains in this square?”
“No.”
“They are worth looking at.”
Cæsar contemplated the central obelisk. It is set on top of a rock
"hollowed out like a cavern, in the mouth of which a lion is seen."
Afterwards they looked at the fountains at the ends of the square.
"“The sculptures are by Bernini,” explained Kennedy. “Bernini belonged to"
"an epoch that has been very much abused by the critics, but nowadays he"
is much praised. He enchants me.”
"“It is rather a mixed style, don’t you think?”"
"like another one behind it, with a raft of piles."""
"""I thought all the Company traps were up-stream."""
"""So they are. I can't tell what they're up to."""
"A half-hour later, when the new flotilla had come to anchor a short"

"""What?"""
"""Marsh aims to 'cork' us."""
"""What is that?"""
"""He's going to build a trap on each side of this one and cut off our"

"""Sure. Why not? The law gives us six hundred yards both ways. As long"

"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the
orders cutting you down--a matter of routine--I had to follow through.
"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"
"you."""
"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"
"sprayed charm through the phone like perfume from an atomizer. ""But if"
"you quote me, I'll deny it."""
"""Oh, I wouldn't think of quoting you, old man,"" Taber replied in a"
kindly voice and put down the phone.
He sat back and closed his eyes. Three people dead. One person maimed.
Blood in the streets.
Good job well done.
"""I am a soldier,"" answered Vaviloff, with a modest air."
"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"
"without much trouble."""
"""Just so."""
"""Good!  You have the law on your side, and will, of course, win your"
"case.  I want to tell you this at the very beginning."""
"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"
"difficulty ...  I did not follow my own wishes, but those of others ..."
I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was
"too late."""
"""Oh!  I suppose some lawyer taught you this?"""
"""Someone of that sort."""
"""Aha!  Do you wish to settle the affair peacefully?"""
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""

"Shivering, she covered her eyes as if trying to banish the memory."
"""It has passed,"" she breathed after a pause, during which Francesco"
"had taken her in his arms, kissing her eyes, her lips, and the"
"sylph-like, flower-soft face. ""I see the dawn!"""
"""Our dawn!""--Francesco replied, pointing to the hillock beyond."
"For a time there was a great silence, as if the fates of two souls"
were being weighed in the scales of destiny.
It was Francesco who spoke.
"""How you have suffered!"""
"She crept very close to him, smiling up at him with the old-time smile"
through tear-dimmed eyes.
"""It counts for naught now! Are not you with me?"""
The sky burned azure above the tree-tops. Transient sunshafts quivered
"through the vaulted dome of breathless leaves, as slowly Francesco and"
Ilaria strode towards the camp of the Duke of Spoleto on the
sun-bathed hillock above the Nera.

"“Yes, my sister would like me to live here, in a foreign country, in"

least courageous.”
“You’re not?”
“Not at all. Not now. At moments I believe I could control myself and
take a trench without wavering.”
"“But you have some fixed plan, haven’t you?”"
"“Yes, I expect to go back to Spain, and work there.”"
“At what?”
“In politics.”
“Are you patriotic?”
"“Yes, up to a certain point. I have no transcendental idea of patriotism"
"at all. Patriotism, as I interpret it, is a matter of curiosity. I"
believe that there is strength in Spain. If this strength could be

_CORNERS OF ROME_
"They went back to the carriage, and having crossed through the centre of"
"Rome, got out in front of the Farnese Palace."
"“I will be out inside of ten minutes,” said Kennedy."
The Farnese Palace aroused great admiration in Cæsar; he had never
"passed it before. By one of the fountains in the _piazza,_ he stood"
"gazing at the huge square edifice, which seemed to him like a die cut"
from an immense block of stone.
"“This really gives me an impression of grandeur and force,” he said to"
himself. “What a splendid palace! It looks like an ancient knight in
"full armour, looking indifferently at everything, sure of his own"
worth.”
"Cæsar walked from one end of the _piazza_ to the other, absorbed in the"
majestic pile of stone.
Kennedy surprised him in his contemplation.
“Now will you say that you are a good philistine?”
"“Ah, well, this palace is magnificent. Here are grandeur, strength,"
overwhelming force.”
"“Yes, it is magnificent; but very uncomfortable, my French colleagues"
tell me.”
"""But the police?"" queried Boyd."
"""Oh, I squared them easy. It's you they want. Yes, sir, I _worked_."""
"Again he scanned their faces anxiously. ""I'm a scullery-maid."""
"""What?"""
"""That's what I said. I've rustled garbage-cans till the smell of food"
"gives me a cold sweat. I'm as hungry as a starving Cuban, and yet the"
"sight of a knife and fork turns my stomach."" He wheeled suddenly upon"
"Alton Clyde, whose burst of shrill laughter offended him. ""Don't cry."
"Your sympathy unmans me."""
"""Tell us about it,"" urged Cherry."
"""What's the use?"" he demanded, with a glare at Clyde. ""That bone-head"
"wouldn't understand."""
"""Go ahead,"" Boyd seconded, with twitching lips. ""You look as if you had"
"worked, and worked hard."""
"""Hard? I'm the only man in the world who knows what hard work is!"""

"'It should be in this direction,' Steve said, with an accent of doubt."
'But I cannot see. We shall have the horses down.'
"'Let me go first,' I said."
"'We must not separate,' he answered hastily."
"'No, no,' I said, my teeth beginning to chatter. 'But are you sure"
that there is an eyot here?'
"'I did not go to it,' he answered, scratching his head. 'But I saw a"
"clump of willows rising well above the level, and they looked to me as"
if they grew on dry land.'
"He stood a moment irresolutely, first one and then another of the"
horses shaking itself till the women could scarcely keep their seats.
'Why do we not go on?' my lady asked in a low voice.
"'Because Steve is not sure of the place, my lady,' I said. 'And it is"
"almost impossible to move, it is so dark, and the osiers grow so"
closely. I doubt we should have waited until daylight.'
"'Then we should have run the risk of being intercepted,' she answered"
feverishly. 'Are you very wet?'
"'No,' I said, though my feet were growing numb, 'not very. I see what"
we must do. One of us must climb into a willow and look out.'
We had passed a small one not long before. I plashed my way back to
"One bright delirious moment’s space,"
And then she passed: I followed slow
"Across the heath, and up and round,"
And watched the splendid death of day
"Upon the summits far away,"
And in her fateful beauty found
The fierce wild beauty of the light
"That startles twilight on the hills,"
"And lightens all the mountain rills,"
And flames before the feet of night.
IN THE ORATORY.
"THE incense mounted like a cloud,"
A golden cloud of languid scent;
"Robed priests before the altar bowed,"
Expecting the divine event.
"Then silence, like a prisoner bound,"
"Rose, by a mighty hand set free,"
"And dazzlingly, in shafts of sound,"
Thundered Beethoven’s Mass in C.
She knelt in prayer; large lids serene
"Lay heavy on the sombre eyes,"
As though to veil some vision seen
"The horseman leaned against his horse, his arm hooked over its neck."
He pointed to the valley.
"""Yonder lies Narni. Beyond the Campanile of St. Juvenal is a"
sanctuary. You can see it yonder by the ford. Two holy women dwell
"therein. To them, my lord, I commend you!"""
"""You know more!"""
The voice that spoke was terrible.
"""Spare me, my lord! The words are for women's lips, not for mine!"""
"""So be it!"""
"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.

"will be."""

"""That I could not speculate upon. The KGB seems to have a great"
interest in his activities. Perhaps they are guarding him in some more

you must forgive me for this rude intrusion. It is important for you to
be aware that the situation is not resolved. That you still have a
"chance to save yourself."""

"That much I have already arranged for. When that is completed, I will"
"consider my responsibilities discharged."""
"""Your responsibilities will never be discharged, Nogami-san. _Giri"
"_lasts forever."" His voice was cutting. ""The sooner you realize that,"
"the better."""
"""After tomorrow, it will be over, Sato-sama."" He stretched out his arm"
and tapped the inch-long ash into a trash basket beside the desk.
"""Tomorrow,"" Jiro Sato bowed, ""it only begins."""
Wednesday 2:25 A.M.
"""You've been very good to me--yes, very good."""
He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going
"to speak, but he did not."
"""Whatever happens, I shall always remember that with--with deep"
"gratitude."""
"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"
"one another now, as he replied gravely,"
"""Whatever you ask--let it be what it will--I will answer, truthfully."" A"
pause before the last word perhaps betrayed a momentary struggle.
"""What right have I? Why should you?"""
"""The right my--my desire to have your regard gives you. How can I ask"
"for that, unless I am ready to tell you all you can wish to know?"""
"""I have heard,"" she began falteringly, ""I have been told by--by people"
"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his
"trouble, but he came to her rescue."
"""I don't know how it reached you,"" he said. ""Perhaps I think you might"
have been--you need not have known it. But there is only one thing you
some light on it.”
The clang of an ambulance bell outside told that the aid summoned by
Winters had arrived.
We left the body in charge of the surgeon and of a policeman who
"arrived about the same time, and followed Winters."
Muller lived in a cheap boarding house in a shabbily respectable street
"downtown, and without announcing ourselves we climbed the stairs to his"
room. He looked up surprised but not disconcerted as we entered.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
"“Muller,” shot out Winters, “we have just found Mr. Schloss dead!”"
“D-dead!” he stammered.
The man seemed speechless with horror.
"“Yes, and with his grips packed as if to run away.”"
"Muller looked dazedly from one of us to the other, but shut up like a"
clam.
"“I think you had better come along with us as a material witness,”"
burst out Winters roughly.
"Kennedy said nothing, leaving that sort of third degree work to the"
"detective. But he was not idle, as Winters tried to extract more than"
"the monosyllables, “I don’t know,” in answer to every inquiry of Muller"
about his employer’s life and business.
wings.
"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"
The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into
"solitude in the woods, alone with the good darkness round me. This is the"
last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"
"others and can endure only one's own, but because of their quality of"
"loftiness and religion. Strange how all things pass distantly, yet all is"
near; we sit in an omnipresence. It must be God. It must be ourselves as a
part of all things.
"What would my heart, where would I stray?"
Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.
"If you reply that men and beasts are different, they will answer that in"
this point they do not recognise the difference. 'Poor beast! let him
live out his little life.' And they will give him grass and water till
he dies.
"This is the exception that I meant, but now, after I have written it, I"
am not so sure. Is it an exception?
CHAPTER XXI
ALL LIFE IS ONE
"'I heard a voice that cried,"
"""Balder the Beautiful"
"Is dead, is dead,"""
And through the misty air
Passed like the mournful cry
Of sunward-sailing cranes.'
TEGNER'S _Drapa_.
"All romance has died out of our woods and hills in England, all our"
fairies are dead long ago. Knowledge so far has brought us only death.
Later on it will bring us a new life. It is even now showing us how this
"may be, and is bringing us face to face again with Nature, and teaching"
us to know and understand the life that there is about us. Science is
"telling us again what we knew long ago and forgot, that our life is not"
"apart from the life about us, but of it. Everything is akin to us, and"
"when we are more accustomed to this knowledge, when we have ceased to"
"Gratefully yours,"
Robert Ashburton.
"The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy."
"“De gent wants an answer,” said the messenger. “Wot’s de word?”"
"The lady’s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet."
"“Tell that guy on the other bench,” she said, with a happy, tremulous"
"laugh, “that his girl wants him.”"
THE FURNISHED ROOM
"Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of"
the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.
"Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to"
"furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in"
"heart and mind. They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry"
their _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a
picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
"Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,"
"should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but"
it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the
wake of all these vagrant guests.
"'Then now go! Go out, do you hear?' she cried, stamping her foot with"
passion. 'I want nothing. Go!'
I turned and crept towards the door like a beaten hound. But I was not
"to go; when my hand was on the latch, her mood changed."
"'No, stay,' she said in a different tone. 'You may come back. After"
"all, Martin, I had rather it was you than any one else.'"
"She dried her tears as she spoke, standing up very straight and proud,"
and hiding nothing. I felt a pang as I looked at her. I had neglected
her of late. I had been thinking more of others.
"'It is nothing, Martin,' she said after a pause, and when she had"
quite composed her face. 'You need not be frightened. All women cry a
"little sometimes, as men swear,' she added, smiling."
"'You have been looking at that thing outside,' I said, grumbling."
"'Perhaps it did upset me,' she replied. 'But I think it was that I"
felt--a little lonely.'
"That sounded so strange a complaint on her lips, seeing that the echo"
"of the young sparks' laughter was barely dead in the room, that I"
"stared. But I took it, on second thoughts, to refer to Fraulein Max,"
"whom she had kept at a distance since our escape, never sitting down"
"with her, or speaking to her except on formal occasions; and I said"
bluntly--
"'You need a woman friend, my lady.'"
"Well, it was not much to go away with, but perhaps that doesn't matter. As"
long as one has a reason to go away.

"Later in the forenoon Eilert returned home. He was alone, but he came up"
the path carrying one of the knapsacks--the larger one. He was in a
"furious temper, and kept saying they'd better not try it on him--no,"
they'd just better not.
Of course it was the bill again.
"""She'll probably have a good deal of this sort of trouble,"" I thought to"
"myself, ""but no doubt she'll get used to it, and take it as nonchalantly"
"as it should be taken. There are worse things."""
"But the fact remains that it was I that upset them, I that had driven them"
away without their clothes; perhaps they had really expected some money to
be sent here--who knows?
"I got hold of Eilert. How big was the bill? What, was that all? ""Good"
"heavens! Here you are, here's your money; now row across to them at once"
"with their clothes!"""
"But it all proved in vain, for the strangers had gone; they had arrived"
"just in time for the boat, and were aboard it at that very moment."
"Well, there was no help for it."
"""Here's their address,"" says Eilert. ""We can send the clothes next"
"Thursday; that's the next trip the boat goes south again."""
"But fortunately for women, Infidels are more numerous than they ever"
"were before, and the power of the Church is dying of dry rot, or as Col."
"Ingersoll wittily says, of the combined influence of softening of the"
brain and ossification of the heart.

"""You mean that you have forsaken Edith and returned to her?"" he"
"observed, raising his brows slightly in surprise."
"""No; don't put it in that way,"" I implored.  ""I have not yet forsaken"
"Edith."""
"He smiled, just a trifle superciliously, I thought."
"""And the Countess is also in possession of this mysterious secret--eh?"""
"""Of that I am not at all certain,"" I replied."
He sniffed in distinct suspicion that what I had told him was not the
"truth.  At the same instant, however, the Countess entered and demanded"
to know the condition of her child.
"""She is much better, madame,"" he answered.  ""Perfect quiet is, however,"
"necessary, and constant observation of the temperature.  To-morrow, or"
"the day after, you may, I think, see her."""
"""Not till then!"" she cried.  ""I cannot wait so long."""
"""But it is necessary.  Your daughter's life hangs upon a single thread."""
"She was silenced, for she saw that argument was useless."
A few minutes later Jean entered with a message from Trepard asking Dick
"and myself to consult with him.  We therefore left the Countess again,"
and passed along the corridor to the room in which my love of long ago
find the tiger alternating with the monkey. There the dominant note on
"the walls is the patriotic note, insults to politicians, calling them"
"assassins and thieves, and also sentiments of revenge expressed by"
"an _‘A mort Dupin!’_ or _‘A mort Duval!’_ Moreover, there is a great"
enthusiasm for the guillotine.”
“And Madrid?”
"“Madrid is at heart a rude, moral town with little imagination, and"
the epigraphs on the walls and benches are primitive.”
“And in Rome what do you find?”
"“Here one finds a mixture of pornography, romanticism, and politics."
"A heart pierced by an arrow and poetic phrases, alternate with some"
enormous piece of filthiness and with hurrahs for Anarchy or for the
_‘Papa-re.’_”
“Well done!” said Kennedy; “I can see that the branch of epigraphy you
practise amounts to something. It should be systematized and given a
name.”
“What do you think we should name it? Wallography?”
“Very good.”
“And one of these fine days we can systematize it. Now we might go and
get dinner.”
"They took a tram which was coming back from St. Paul’s beyond the Walls,"
and returned to the heart of the city.
“Do you go in for modern epigraphy?” asked Kennedy.
"“Yes. It is one of the things I take pleasure in reading, in the towns"
I go to; the advertisements in the newspapers and the writings on the
wall.”
“It’s a good kind of curiosity.”
"“Yes, I believe one learns more about the real life in a town from such"
inscriptions than from the guide- and text-books.”
“That’s possible. And what conclusions have you drawn from your
observations?”
“They are not of much value. I haven’t constructed a science of
"wall-inscriptions, as that fake Lambroso would have done.”"
"“But you will construct it surely, when you have lighted on the"
underlying system.”
“You think my epigraphical science is on the same level as my financial
science. What a mistake!”
“All right. But tell me what you have discovered about different towns.”
"“London, for instance, I have found, is childish in its inscriptions and"
somewhat clownish. When some sentimental foolishness doesn’t occur to a
"Londoner of the people, some brutality or rough joke occurs to him.”"
"“You are very kind,” said Kennedy, laughing."
"“Paris has a vulgar, cruel taste; in the Frenchman of the people you"
"has the time. Then one evening someone finds him reading under a lamppost,"
"stops suddenly and stares, takes a few steps toward him, and bends"
forward searchingly.
"""Isn't it--? Oh, no, excuse me, I thought--"""
"""Yes, it is. Good evening, Miss Torsen."""
"""Why, good evening. I thought it looked like you. Good evening. Yes, thank"
"you, very well. And thanks for the knapsack; I understood all at once--I"
"quite understand--"""
"""Do you live here? What a strange coincidence!"""
"""Yes, I live here; those are my windows. You wouldn't like to come up,"
"would you? No, perhaps you wouldn't."""
"""But I know where there are some benches down by the shore. Unless you're"
"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""
"We went down to a bench, looking like a father and daughter out walking."
"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.
"Then she told me first the short chapter of her journey home, some of it"
"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"
"deeply bowed, sometimes, when I asked a question, replying by a brief word"
or a shake of the head. I write it down from memory; it was important to
"her, and it became important for others as well."

At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his
suitcase.
"She wore a plain, black suit with a ridiculous little black hat and she"
was so beautiful he was angry with her. He hated her. This good-bye
wasn't necessary. Why had she come?
But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he
said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are
"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes

"""It's like this, you see,"" he went on hurriedly. ""Captain Dove's"
"absolutely at the end of his wits for money, and now--I can pay him his"
price for you if you'll keep your promise to me by and by. Otherwise I
"can't; no matter how willing I might be, I can't, I swear to you."
"""He feels, too, that you owe it to him to make up in one way or another"
for some part at least of what he and I have lost through your--your
"interfering so much lately in his affairs. And, if you don't back me up"
"now, he'll have to take the _Olive Branch_ East as best he can. He'll"
"take you too, and--you'll never come back."
"""You don't understand. I'm not really trying to force you to marry me,"
but to save you from a fate far worse than the worst you could imagine.
"You don't understand that it's really freedom I'm offering you, and that"
your only option is slavery.

CHAPTER XIII
A MASTERSTROKE
"Sallie sat down quickly in a cushioned chair, and lay back, trembling"
like a captured bird.
"""The human animal is a strange creature. He's so capable of refusing to"
"believe what he doesn't want to believe."""
"""Maybe he's smarter than we think. Maybe there's no point in looking at"
a pending disaster from every angle. The what-will-be-will-be attitude
isn't necessarily like that of the ostrich which sticks its head in the
"sand."""
"""Do the people inside really believe?"" Entman asked."
"""It's pretty difficult to tell. Sometimes I wonder what my own real"
"feelings are."""
"""I wasn't completely briefed on how it ended,"" Entman said delicately."
"""I think the phony specifications got through."""
"""If they did--if things are really as they appear--"""
"Taber smiled in the darkness. ""Are _you_ beginning to doubt, Doctor?"""
"""Oh, be quiet,"" Entman said with friendly petulance. ""I was going to say"
that I was rather proud of those details. If our hostiles out there
"follow my specifications, they'll create androids with much smaller"
lungs and non-porous skin that will give them no end of trouble when
they start chasing frightened householders down the streets of the
"world."""
"Taber chuckled. ""I remember a story about the Japanese Navy. They were"
supposed to have built some ships to specifications stolen in England.
"When launched, they slid out into the bay and tipped over."""
project will require financial and strategic skills well beyond those
"possessed by the people who have worked for me in the past."""
"""All those petty criminals and hoods, you mean."""
"""I will choose to ignore that,"" he continued. ""Whatever you may wish to"
"call them, they are not proving entirely adequate to the task at hand."
You bested my European people repeatedly and brought me a decided
"humiliation."""
"Speaking of which, Vance found himself suddenly wondering, a thought"
"out of the blue, what's happened to Vera? She's been European point"
woman for this whole scam. Where's she now?
"Mino continued. ""Therefore I must now either take you into my"
"organization or . . ."" He paused. ""It's that simple. Which, I wonder,"
"will it be?"""
"Vance studied him. ""A lot depends on what happens to Eva."""
"""The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your decision. So perhaps I"
"should give you some time to think it over."" He leaned back. ""Or"
"perhaps some inducement."""
Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and looked
behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
"of Tanzan Mino's personal _kobun_, two of whom he recognized from"
"London. The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but"
he needed no translation as they moved forward.
"""You say that all I must do in the meantime is to sign some papers,"" she"
"interrupted. ""You say you won't ask me to marry you right away. Will you"
"wait--a year?"""
"""A year! I couldn't, Sallie!"" he cried, and her pale lips drooped"
piteously again.
"""How long, then?"" she asked in a whisper. ""Six months?"""
"He had made up his mind to be generous, and he felt that he had not"
"failed in his intention as he answered, ""Three months, and not a day"
"longer, Sallie."""
"She sat still and silent for a while, considering that, and then, ""All"
"right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""Take me safe home, and I'll marry you three"
months from the day we get there--if we're both alive when the time
"comes."""
He turned away from her for a moment. He had won all he wanted in the
"meantime, and he could scarcely contain himself. When he presently held"
"out a hand to her, she took it, to bind that bargain."
"""And you won't have any cause to regret it, Sallie,"" he assured her, his"
voice somewhat hoarse in spite of his effort to speak quite naturally.
"""So now, as soon as you're ready, we'll all go ashore together, and--"""
"""I'll be ready in twenty minutes,"" she told him, clasping her hands at"
"her heart, her eyes very eager. ""And, Jasper--you must let me take"
"Ambrizette with me."""
"'North,' he whispered."
"After that they were nothing to me, but I went with the rest. Our lair"
"was in some rocks overhanging the road. By the time we looked over,"
"the horsemen were below us, and we could see nothing of them; though"
"the sullen tramp of their horses, and the jingle of bit and spur,"
reached us clearly. Presently they came into sight again on the road
"beyond, riding steadily away with their backs to us."
'That is not General Tzerclas?' my lady muttered anxiously.
'Nor any of his people!' Steve said with an oath.
"That led me to look more closely, and I saw in a moment something that"
lifted me out of my moodiness. I sprang on the rock against which I
was leaning and shouted long and loudly.
"'Himmel!' Steve cried, seizing me by the ankle. 'Are you mad, man?'"
"But I only shouted again, and waved my cap frantically. Then I slipped"
"down, sobered. 'They see us,' I cried. 'They are Leuchtenstein's"
"riders. And Count Hugo is with them. You are safe, my lady.'"
"She turned white and red, and I saw her clutch at the rock to keep"
herself on her feet. 'Are you sure?' she said. The troop had halted
and were wheeling slowly and in perfect order.
"'Quite sure, my lady,' I answered, with a touch of bitterness in my"
tone. Why had not this happened yesterday or the day before? Then my
girl would have been saved. Now it came too late! Too late! No wonder
I felt bitterly about it.
"preparations for the night. He was about to make some remark, however,"
when to his well-attuned ears there came the sound of approaching
footsteps. In an instant he was standing in the parting made by the
"curtains, his face eager, animated, tense."
"""What's that?"" he whispered."
"""That's snow slidin',"" the Girl informed him without the slightest trace"
of anxiety in her voice.
"""God bless you, Girl,"" he murmured, and retreated back of the curtains."
"It was only an instant before he was back again with: ""Why, there is"
"something out there--sounded like people calling,"" he again whispered."
"""That's only the wind,"" she said, adding as she drew her robe tightly"
"about her: ""Gettin' cold, ain't it?"""
"But, notwithstanding her assurances, Johnson did not feel secure, and it"
was with many misgivings that he now directed his footsteps towards the
bed behind the curtains.
"""Good-night!"" he said uneasily."
"""Good-night!"" unconsciously returned the Girl in the same tone."
Taking off her slippers the Girl now put on a pair of moccasins and
"quietly went over to her bed, where she knelt down and made a silent"
prayer.
"""Good-night!"" presently came from a little voice in the rug."
"""Good-night!"" answered the man now settled in the centre of the"

"The accident became widely known. Newspapermen came from the city, and"
Solem had to pilot them up the mountain and show them the spot where it
"had taken place. If the body had not been removed at once, they would have"
"written about that, too."
Children and ignoramuses might be inclined to think it foolish that Solem
"should be taken from the work in the fields at harvest time, but must not"
the business of the tourist resort go before all else?
"""Solem, tourists!"" someone called to him. And Solem left his work. A flock"
"of reporters surrounded him, asked him questions, made him take them to"
"the mountains, to the river. A phrase was coined at the farm for Solem's"
absences:
"""Solem's with death."""
"But Solem was by no means with death; on the contrary, he was in the very"
"midst of life, enjoying himself, thriving. Once again he was an important"
"personage, listened to by strangers, doling out information. Nor did his"
"audience now consist of ladies only--indeed, no; this was something new, a"
"change; these were keen, alert gentlemen from the city."
"To me, Solem said:"
"""Funny the accident should have happened just when the scratch on my nail"
"has grown out, isn't it?"""
something inevitable you might as well look at it from the more
"cheerful side. After all, there was the chance that we might not have"
"made it this far, you know. Now, tell me honestly, does it make sense"
getting all worried-up by thinking of how horrible it would have been
"if we'd been caught back there when Seventy-nine blew up?"""
"""I suppose not."""
"""Well, then,"" he said in a semi-cheerful tone, ""since we did make it"
"out safely, and are still waiting after eight days, we might as well"
"expect to be collected soon."""
"Charles Andrews said, from behind him, ""At a hundred dollars an hour,"
"Norton?"""
"Norton turned around angrily. ""So it's the hundred clams per,"" he"
"snapped back. ""That's damned poor payment for having to live with the"
"likes of you in a space can this cramped."""
"Andrews eyed the pilot with distaste. ""Tell me,"" he said smoothly,"
"""did my last effort on the pedal generator go for power storage, or"
for a couple of gallons of hot water for that shave and shower you've
"enjoyed?"""
"Norton stretched and stood up. ""I figured that having a clean face"
"might help morale,"" he said pointedly."
"""You're a cheap, chiseling--"""
"""Easy, Andrews! Easy. There's a lady present. Besides, I might forget"
"my easy-going nature and take a swing at you."""
"On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on"
"their new grass petticoats (sevata'i) specially made for this occasion,"
enter the water and approach the canoes to unload them. No special
greetings pass between them and their husbands. They are interested
"in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in the sago."
People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet the
incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
"with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and"
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
"natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of"
the arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
"over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables"
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
"Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters."
CHAPTER XVI
THE RETURN VISIT OF THE DOBUANS TO SINAKETA
I
"screeching gargoyles, instead, devoted all their efforts to merely"
hurling their attenuated bodies on the two men as though they wished
to capture them alive.
"Finally, however, the nature of the battle changed. The tallest of the"
attackers opened his tiny mouth and piped a signal. The ring of
weaving tall bodies surrounding the two opened and became a U. The
"creatures in the curve of the U raised their shock-tubes and, with"
"none of their own kind behind the victims to share in its discharge,"
released whatever power it was that lurked in them.
The shock was terrific. Without the glass and metal of the ship to
"protect them, out in the open and defenceless, Brand and Dex got some"
indication of its real power.
"Writhing and twitching, feeling as though pierced by millions of red"
"hot needles, they went down. A swarm of pipe-like bodies smothered"
"them, and the fight was over."
CHAPTER III
_The Coming of Greca_
The numbing shock from the tubes left the Earthmen's bodies almost
paralyzed for a time; but their brains were unfogged enough for them
to observe only too clearly all that went on from the point of their
capture.
Lavender pulled up alongside of the _Arabella_ and deliberately made
the boat fast.
"""We got to act as though we haven't found the knife, y'see,"" he warned."
"""As though we were going just swimming."""
In her eagerness to board the _Arabella_ Sidney stumbled. Lavender had
to clutch her to keep her from tumbling into the water.
"""Oh!"" They both cried in one sound as they clambered to the deck--for"
the knife was gone!
"""Well, _that_ means they'd been on the _Arabella_. Jed Starrow dropped"
"that knife and he missed it and came back to look for it!"""
"""Lav, I believe they've hidden their treasure on the _Arabella_!"""
Sidney still reverted to the more romantic terms of buccaneering.
"""Let's look for it now!"""
"""With 'em watching maybe from the _Puritan_? I guess not. We got to go"
"ahead and swim the way we always do, Sid. Don't let's even appear to be"
"talking about anything. Come on, I'll beat you in!"""
For the space of the few minutes while the water closed about her with
delicious coolness Sidney forgot everything in an intoxication of
delight. Presently she came back to the _Arabella_ and climbed aboard
"with a sigh of utter content. ""Thank goodness _I_ haven't any"
"complexes,"" she laughed, shaking the salt drops from her bobbed head."
"""And now what?"""
Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn over his bathing suit.
"in slashed clothes, which were parti-coloured, red, yellow, and black."
Some of them carried lances and others swords.
“Why are the guards here dressed differently?” asked Cæsar.
“Because this belongs to the Dominions of the Pope.”
“And what kind of guards are these?”
“These are pontifical Swiss guards.”
"“They look comic-opera enough,” said Cæsar."
"“My dear man, don’t say that. This costume was designed by no one less"
than Michelangelo.”
"“All right. At that time they probably looked very well, but now they"
have a theatrical effect.”
"“It is because you have no veneration. If you were reverential, they"
would look wonderful to you.”
"“Very well, let us wait and see whether reverence will not spring up in"
"me. Now, you go on and explain what there is here.”"
"“This first room, the Hall of Audience, or of the Popes, does not"
"contain anything notable, as you see,” said Kennedy; “the five we are"
"coming to later, have been restored, but are still the same as at the"
time when your countryman Alexander VI was Pope. All five were decorated
"by Pinturicchio and his pupils, and all with reference to the Borgias."
"The Borgias have their history, not well known in all its details, and"
"their legend, which is more extensive and more picturesque. Really, it"
"Jack Norton immensely, although he knew that chances of survival were"
"better with Norton's boorish, interfering presence than without. He was"
"bored, he was angry, he was above all resentful of the time wasted in"
this spacewreck business....
"An orderly tapped Commodore Wilson on the shoulder. ""Message from"
"Terra,"" he said."
"Wilson groaned and reached for the telephone beside his bunk. ""Wilson"
"here,"" he said. ""Go ahead!"""
"""Admiral Stone. Wilson, a new ship is on the way. I want you to get"
"into this thing fully, so I'm briefing you now."""
"""New type of ship?"""
"""Well, not a new ship, but some new equipment. The Infrawave Section of"
the Space Department Radiation Laboratory has some experimental gear
"they want to try in actual service."""
"""Experimental gear?"""
"""Sheer experiment, Wilson. It's supposed to be an infrawave detecting"
"and ranging device. It's shown low grade response so far, and it may"
be entirely useless to you. But Radiation feels that even something
"incomplete and erratic may be better than going it blind."""
"Wilson sat up, interested. ""How does it work?"""
"""Darned if I know. It took a whole cruiser class to carry the junk"
"that makes it tick. It's piled in with twine and baling wire, and when"
the crate took off the advanced techs were still connecting cables and
"""No one can say. A day, a week, a month, a year--it is an elusive search"
"I follow, my young friends. May I call you that?"""
"We bowed, and I deferentially suggested:"
"""If we can help you in any way?----"""
"""It is the beautiful spirit of America,"" he sighed, ""to help those in"
"distress, yet there is nothing to do but watch--watch. For you have not"
"yet been here long enough to see a child in these waters--no?"""
"Tommy, perhaps because he came from the South and was on more or less"
"friendly terms with superstitions, glanced over the rail as if an infant"
might be floating around almost anywhere. Our strange guest's mysterious
"hints were, indeed, rather conducive to creeps."
"Then, without further comment, he arose, tossed his cigar overboard, ran"
"his fingers through his mass of hair, and went below."
"""What d'you suppose he meant?"" I asked, in a guarded voice."
"""Simple enough,"" Tommy whispered. ""He's got apartments to let"
"upstairs."""
"""Get out, man,"" I laughed. ""That chap has more sense than either of us!"""
"""Then he'd better come across with some of it. You remember the freckled"
"lad at Soissons who got fuzzy-headed from too much concussion? Well, he"
"saw children around everywhere, too! It's a sure sign, Jack!"" But now he"
"laughed, adding: ""Oh, I suppose our little Roumanian's all right,"
"only----"""
"write one. I also suggested that we meet in Bettina's parlor, where"
Frances's letter could be rewritten in cipher. We trusted Bettina as we
"trusted ourselves, and when we told her the good news, she clapped her"
"hands for joy, laughing, yet ready to weep, and was as happy as even she"
"could be, which was very happy indeed."
"After we had talked, laughed, and cried a reasonable time in Betty's"
"parlor, Frances handed me her letter, which was a bulky document, well"
taped and waxed.
"""It will require a week for me to translate this,"" I remarked, weighing"
the letter in my hand.
"""What do you mean by translating it?"" she asked in surprise."
"""I must write it out in cipher. Hamilton directed that all letters should"
"be sent in that form,"" I answered, amused at her alarm."
"""No, no!"" she cried, snatching the letter from me, pressing it to her"
"breast and blushing to her ears. ""You shall not see my letter!"""
"""Why?"" I asked."
"""Because,"" she answered."
"""That is no reason,"" I replied. ""Of course you have written nothing that"
"you would not want me or your father to see?"""
"""Well, yes, I have,"" she returned emphatically. ""A great deal. Would you,"
"Betty, want any one to see such a letter written by yourself?"""
"""I suppose I could write a letter which I should want but one person in"
_LEGEND AND HISTORY_
"Cæsar went out of the cabinet, leaving the German and Cortés seated on"
"the sofa, absorbed in the picture; he looked at various paintings in the"
"gallery, went back, and sat down, beside the artists."
"“This portrait,” he said presently, “is like history by the side of"
"legend. All the other paintings in the gallery are legend, ‘folk-lore,’"
as I believe one calls it. This one is history.”
"“That’s what it is. It is truth,” agreed Cortés."
"“Yes, but there are people who do not like the truth, my friend. I tell"
"you: this is a man of flesh, somewhat enigmatic, like nature herself,"
and with arteries in which blood flows; this is a man who breathes and
"digests, and not merely a pleasant abstraction; you, who understand such"
"things, will tell me that the drawing is perfect, and the colour such"
as it was in reality; but how about the person who doesn’t ask for
reality?”
"“Stendhal, the writer, was affected that way by this picture,” said"
Cortés; “he was shocked at its being hung among masterpieces.”
"“He found it bad, no doubt.”"
“Very bad?”
“Was this Stendhal English?”
"""Don't you sell tea, bread, or anything to eat?"""
"""I trade only in walls and roofs, for which I pay to the swindling"
"proprietor of this hole--Judas Petunikoff, merchant of the second"
"guild--five roubles a month,"" explained Kuvalda in a business-like"
"tone.  ""Only those come to me who are not accustomed to comfort and"
"luxuries .... but if you are accustomed to eat every day, then there is"
the eating-house opposite.  But it would be better for you if you left
off that habit.  You see you are not a gentleman.  What do you eat?
"You eat yourself!"""
"For such speeches, delivered in a strictly business-like manner, and"
"always with smiling eyes, and also for the attention he paid to his"
lodgers the Captain was very popular among the poor of the town.  It
"very often happened that a former client of his would appear, not in"
"rags, but in something more respectable and with a slightly happier"
face.
"""Good-day, your honour, and how do you do?"""
"""Alive, in good health!  Go on."""
"""Don't you know me?"""
"""I did not know you."""
"""Do you remember that I lived with you last winter for nearly a month"
".... when the fight with the police took place, and three were taken"
"away?"""
"""My brother, that is so.  The police do come even under my hospitable"
"""With gratitude,"
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"I sought Frances, and when I told her the substance of George's letter,"
she was almost wild with joy.
"""Am I willing to try?"" she exclaimed, laughing while tears were hanging"
"in her eyes. ""I am not only willing to try, but am determined to succeed."
"Ay, I'd sell England itself in the same cause. Of all the men I have ever"
"known, this king of ours is the greatest dupe. Since the return of the"
"court to Whitehall, he has been growing more importunate every day. He"
"seems to have lost what little wits he had, and does and says the"
"silliest things one can imagine."""
"""And you do not fear attempting to lead him on to sell Dunkirk? You do"
"not fear going too near the precipice?"" I asked, wishing to weigh her"
self-confidence more by the manner of her reply than by her words.
"She laughed and answered: ""There is no precipice, cousin Ned; nothing to"
"fear save kidnapping, and I am always guarded against that danger;"
"nothing to do of which I need feel ashamed, save the acting of a lie, and"
"surely one may lie to the father of lies without sin."""
"""But the lie may be recognized,"" I suggested, ""if one be too bold about"
"it."""
"""My lie will go little beyond a smile or two. The king's vanity will do"
"the rest. He will make himself believe that I mean more than I say."""
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox, the weapons of the ruler will prevail"
over the weapons of the enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox that has _ganni_[87], the ruler will"
weaken the land of his enemy.

who was without a rival.
"If an ewe gives birth to a cow, the king will die, another king will"

'How?' my lady muttered.
"'He swore at me,' Marie answered in the same tone. 'And he spoke of"

"The Countess laughed, but far from joyously. 'I suppose to-night--I"
must see him?' she said. She tried as she spoke to press herself more
"deeply into the pillows, as if she might escape that way. Her flesh"
"crept, and she shivered though she was as hot as fire."
Once or twice in the hours which followed she was almost beside
herself. Sometimes she prayed. More often she walked up and down the
"room like one in a fever. She did not know on what she was trusting,"
"and she could have struck Marie when the girl, appealed to again and"

Already they could hear the footsteps of the officers.
"""I'll take a chance. Good-bye."""
There was no time even for a hand-shake; Fraser stepped swiftly to the
"door, then strolled quietly out into the view of the two men, who an"
instant later accosted him.
"""Are you Mr. Boyd Emerson?"""
"The adventurer answered brusquely, ""Yes, but I can't talk to you now."""
"""You are under arrest, Mr. Emerson."""
Boyd waited to hear no more. The glass door swung open noiselessly
"under his hand, and he stepped out just as the bill-clerk looked up"
"from his work, staring out through the other entrance."
"""Fingerless"" Fraser's voice was louder now, as if for a signal. ""Arrest"
"me? What do you mean? Get out of my way."""
"""You'd better come peaceably."""
"Boyd heard a sharp exclamation--""Get him, Bill!"" And then the sound of"
"men struggling. He ran, followed by a roar from the strikers, in whose"
full view Fraser's encounter with the plain-clothes men was taking
place. A backward glance showed him that Fraser had drawn his pursuers
"to the street. He had broken away and dodged out into the open, where"
the other officers responded at a call and seized him as he apparently
undertook to break through the cordon. This diversion served an
unexpected purpose. Not only did it draw attention from Emerson's
"retreat, but it also gave the mob its long-awaited opportunity."
Rippley slapped him on the shoulder:
"“Then,” said he, “we ought to give Pangbutt’s house an air. There"
is a lack of the grand manner here. One man-servant is ridiculously
inadequate. At least three of us ought to assist to wait on the guests.
"Doome and Fluffy and I and--and you, Blotte--would make a ripping lot"
"of waiters, and it wouldn’t be half so slow as talking art and rot"
to people who don’t know.... Genius shall serve the mob. This night
"must never be forgotten. By Macready, yes--Pangbutt used to play at"
play-acting! But where are his properties?”
Blotte was striding the room; he laughed:
"“Ay, ay--the gala-night of life should be gay and joyous,” cried"
"he--“all the candles lit, as for a bridal.” He came to a halt, scowled"
"at the dark hollow of the great doorway, and strode thither."
The old butler was lurking suspiciously outside.
"Blotte grabbed him by his coat lapel, and drew him into the light:"
"“Hireling fellow,” said he, “bring more lights. This place is like a"
damned omnibus.”
The old butler held out an expostulant palm in dignified remonstrance:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen--the guests will be arriving in a few minutes----”"
"Rippley went up to him, and gripping his fingers in the old servant’s"
"waistcoat, pulled him into the room."
"“Don’t talk like an unfrocked bishop, Dukes--it’s most irreligious,”"
"asked the man. ""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it"
"outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And"
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the _huldres_
"disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away."
"Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the"
"wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,"
"and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."

THE CHILD OF MARY
"Far, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple."
Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so
poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her
road.
"Eilert was going out in his boat to fish haddock, and I went with him."
Actually he should have been getting some meat for us; but he had promised
"the gentry from the city some fish, and fish was one of the gifts of God."
"Besides, if he lacked meat, he could always slaughter one of the pigs."
"There was a slight wind; but then we wanted some wind, Eilert said, as"
long as there was not too much of it.
"""Not reliable tonight though,"" he said, looking up into the sky; ""the"
"bigger the wind, the stronger the current."""
"At first I was very brave, and sat on the thwart thinking of Eilert's"
"French words: _travali, prekevary, sutinary, mankémang_, and many"
"others. They've had a long way to travel, coming here by ancient routes"
"via Bergen, and now they're common property."
"And then suddenly I lost all interest in French words, and felt extremely"
"ill. It was much too windy, and we got no haddock."
"""Pity she's come up so quick,"" said Eilert; ""let's try inshore for a"
"while."""
"But we got nothing there either, and as the wind increased and the sea"
"rose, ""We'd better go home,"" said Eilert."
"The sea had been just right before, remarkably so, but now there was"
entirely too much of it. Why on earth did I feel so bad? An inner
"exhaustion, some emotional excitement, would have explained it. But I had"
experienced no emotional excitement.
"no reply. Rance made no movement to follow her, but instead drew a pack"
of cards from his pocket and began to shuffle them with practiced
carelessness. But when a minute had passed and the girl had not
"returned, he called once more, with growing impatience, to know what was"
keeping her.
"""I'm jest gettin' the cards an' kind o' steadyin' my nerves,"" she"
answered somewhat queerly through the doorway. The next moment she had
"returned, quickly closing the closet door behind her, blew out her"
"candle, and laying a pack of cards upon the table, said significantly:"
"""We'll use a fresh deck. There's a good deal depends on this, Jack."" She"
seated herself opposite the Sheriff and so close to the unconscious form
of the man she loved that from time to time her left arm brushed his
shoulder.
"Rance, without protest other than a shrug, took up his own deck of"
"cards, wrapped them in a handkerchief, and stowed them away in his"
pocket. It was the Girl who spoke first:
"""Are you ready?"""
"""Ready? Yes. I'm ready. Cut for deal."""
"With unfaltering fingers, the Girl cut. Of the man beside her, dead or"
"dying, she must not, dared not think. For the moment she had become one"
"incarnate purpose: to win, to win at any cost,--nothing else mattered."
"Rance won the deal; and taking up the pack he asked, as he shuffled:"
"""A case of show-down?"""
"""Nothing to report,"" announced Barracombe, as Aubyn relieved him as"
"officer of the watch. ""A jolly fine night. I shouldn't wonder if we"
"were favoured by a visit from a Zeppelin or two."""
"""A pretty jamb in the harbour,"" said Terence, giving a quick glance"
"at the maze of vessels. ""Fortunately, I hear, we've several seaplanes"
"at our disposal."""
Barracombe wished his relief good-night and descended the ladder to
retire to the seclusion of his cabin and sleep the sleep of
"exhaustion, for he had had a strenuous time before the cruiser left"
Devonport.
During the first hour nothing unusual occurred. The midshipman of the
"watch reported ""Rounds all correct, sir,"" to which Aubyn replied with"
"the stereotyped ""Very good."" Across the harbour came the faint hail"
of the Night Guard as the picquet boat studiously visited every
vessel within the limits of the breakwater.
The masthead light of the flagship began to blink. A signalman on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge snatched up a slate."
"""General call, sir,"" he announced."
"Deftly the man took down the message, then hurried to the chart-room"
to decipher the code.
"""Submarine E27 reports three hostile aeroplanes passing S.W. by W."
"Position eleven miles N.N.E. of North Goodwin."""
"The warning was a brief one, for hardly had the ship's company been"
"bowed deferentially. ""You are about to receive a great honor. The CEO"
"has asked for a private conference with you."""
Yuri stared over Ikeda's shoulder at the Man-in-Charge. All this right-
wing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing. He was
the one calling the shots. Who was everybody kidding?
"Now the CEO looked his way, sizing him up with a quick glance. Yuri"
"Androv assessed him in turn. It was one look, but they both knew there"
was trouble ahead.
Then Tanzan Mino patted a colonel-general on the shoulder and headed
"over. ""Yuri Andreevich Androv, I presume,"" he said in flawless Russian,"
"bowing lightly. ""A genuine pleasure to meet you at last. There's a most"
"urgent matter we have to discuss."""
Thursday 4:00 P.M.
"At the precise hour, the _tokonoma _alcove off Vance's bedroom rotated"
"ninety degrees, as though moved by an unseen hand, and what awaited"
"beyond was a traditional Japanese sand-and-stone garden. It was, of"
"course, lit artificially, but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be"
thriving on the fluorescents. Through the garden's grassy center was a
curving pathway of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular
"curves, and situated on either side of the walkway were towering rocks"
nestled in glistening sand that had been raked to represent ocean
waves. The rocks were reminiscent of the soaring mountains in Chinese
Sung landscape paintings.
"""Take this lady and her maid straight up to the suite next mine,"""
"ordered Slyne as Sallie alighted, while Captain Dove listened, all ears."
"""And ask Mr. Jobling to join me in my sitting-room. He's still here, I"
"suppose?"""
"He gave vent to a heartfelt sigh of relief as the man, already preceding"
"his charges indoors, paused to answer in the affirmative."
"""I needn't book a room for you,"" he told Captain Dove, with calculated"
"indifference. ""But Sallie must have somewhere to leave Ambrizette."
"""Hey! you. Call my chauffeur to take the car round to the garage."""
"Captain Dove followed him toward the bureau, attracting not a few"
glances of mingled surprise and amusement from the elaborate idlers in
its neighbourhood. Slyne was furious.
"""I can't have him tagging about after me in that ghastly get-up!"" he"
told himself on the way to the elevator; and cuffed the elevator-boy's
ears at the sound of a mirthful sneeze with which that unfortunate youth
"had become afflicted. ""Though how the deuce I'm to help myself I don't"
"know."""
In the corridor at which they got out he caught sight of Mr. Jobling
"approaching, and hurried Captain Dove into the sitting-room of his"
suite.
"""Give me five minutes to change my clothes,"" he requested of the old"
"man. ""And don't get straying about, or you'll lose yourself."""
Mr. Jobling met him on the threshold as he shut the door. That gentleman
"""No,"" she answered in that hard voice, by which I knew that mention of"
"Yolande's name had displeased her.  ""Remember that we are friends, and"
"that sometimes we have interests in common.  Therefore, take this piece"
"of advice from an old woman who knows."""
"""Knows what?"""
"""Knows that your friendship with the pretty Yolande is dangerous--"
"extremely dangerous."""
CHAPTER TEN.
CONFESSION.
"Next day, when the manservant asked me into the tiny boudoir in the Rue"
"de Courcelles, I found Yolande, in a pretty tea-gown of cream silk"
"adorned with lace and ribbons, seated in an armchair in an attitude of"
"weariness.  The sun-shutters were closed, as on the previous day, for"
"the heat in Paris that July was insufferable, and in the dim light her"
wan figure looked very fair and fragile.  The qualities which imparted
to her a distinct individuality were the beautiful combination of the
pastoral with the elegant--of simplicity with elevation--of spirit with
sweetness.
"She gave vent to a cry of gladness as I entered, rose, and stretching"
"out her hands in welcome, drew a seat for me close to her.  I looked at"
"her standing before me in her warm, breathing, human loveliness."
"""You are better, Yolande?  Ah! how glad I am!""  I commenced.  ""Last"
"night I believed that you were dead."""
"""And if I had died would it really have mattered so very much to you?"""
revolver rang out at precisely the same moment. There was a yell of
"fury, followed by a crash. Then almost oppressive silence."
"Bob was on his feet like a cat, fingers gripping the automatic he had"
"snatched from the owner’s nerveless hand. His jaw was hard, and there"
was a glint of more than anger in the eyes he bent upon Joyce’s
supporters hurrying up to the aid of their chief.
"“Hands up!” he cried out harshly, “Quick!”"
"He did not have to speak twice. There was something in his voice,"
"coupled with an emphatic gesture with the automatic, which made those"
"six men, big and powerful as they were, obey him with remarkable"
unanimity.
"“Take their guns, Jack,” continued Bainbridge, in that same commanding"
voice.
"Peters stepped forward to obey. The first man drew back instinctively,"
and started to pull down the hand which held a revolver. Without an
instant’s hesitation Bob fired. The bullet struck the upraised weapon on
"its blued-steel barrel, wringing a cry of surprise and pain from the"
fellow’s lips as he dropped the gun.
"There was no more trouble after that, Peters collected four revolvers"
and two Remingtons. Then he glanced questioningly at Bainbridge.
"“Throw ’em in the river,” the latter commander curtly. “’Way out in the"
"middle, where they can’t be recovered.”"
"The riverman walked a few steps toward the bank; then, pausing, he"
glanced back at the straight young figure standing behind him.
with more flowers.
'Ha!' I said foolishly. 'What is it?'
"'My lady sent me to you,' she answered."
"'Yes,' I asked eagerly. 'Does she want me?'"
"But Marie hung her head, and played with the flowers. 'I don't think"
"so,' she whispered. 'She only sent me to you.'"
Then I understood. The Waldgrave had gone to the farther end. Steve
and the men were tending the horses half a dozen paces beyond the
"screen of willow-leaves. We were alone. A rat plashed into the water,"
"and drove Marie nearer to me; and she laid her head on my shoulder,"
"and I whispered in her ear, till the lashes sank down over her eyes"
"and her lips trembled. If I had loved her from the first, what was the"
"length and height and breadth of my love now, when I had seen her in"
"darkness and peril, sunshine and storm, strong when others failed,"
"brave when others flinched, always helpful, ready, tireless! And she"
"so small! So frail, I almost feared to press her to me; so pale, the"
blood that leapt to her cheeks at my touch seemed a mere reflection of
the sunlight.
I told her how Steve had made the guards at the prison drunk with wine
bought with her dowry; how the horses he had purchased and taken out
of the camp by twos and threes had been paid for from the same source;
"and how many ducats had gone for meats and messes to keep the life,"
"that still ran sluggishly, in the Waldgrave's veins. She listened and"
lay still.
"'So you have no dowry now, little one,' I said, when I had told her"
"who thinks a diamond is the truth and paste a lie, is a stupid fool who"
doesn’t deserve to be read.’”
"“Yes, all right: you take one point of view and he takes another. I"
understand why Ruskin wouldn’t please you. What I do not understand is
why you find it absurd that if a person has a desire to penetrate into
"the beauties of a symphony or a picture, he should do so. What is there"
strange in that?”
"“You are right,” said Cæsar; “whoever wants to learn, should. I have"
done so about financial questions.”
“Is it true that your brother knows all about questions of money?”
Kennedy asked Laura.
“He says so.”
“I haven’t much belief in his financial knowledge.”
“No?”
"“No, I have not. You are a sort of dilettante, half nihilist, half"
"financier. You would like to pass for a tranquil, well-balanced man, for"
"what is called a philistine, but you cannot compass it.”"
"“I will compass it. It is true that I want to be a philistine, but a"
philistine out in the real world. All those great artists you people
"admire, Goethe, Ruskin, were really philistines, who were in the"
business of being interested in poetry and statues and pictures.”
"“Moncada, you are a sophist,” said Kennedy. “Possibly I am wrong in this"
"discussion,” retorted Cæsar, “but the feeling I have is right. Artists"
prepared paper flat on the forehead of the dead man.
"When he withdrew it, I could see that it bore marks of the lines on his"
"head. Without a word, Kennedy drew from his pocket a print of the"
photograph of the smudge on Schloss’ door.
"“It is possible,” he said, half to himself, “to identify a person by"
"means of the arrangement of the sweat glands or pores. Poroscopy, Dr."
"Edmond Locard, director of the Police Laboratory at Lyons, calls it."
"The shape, arrangement, number per square centimeter, all vary in"
"different individuals. Besides, here we have added the lines of the"
forehead.”
He was studying the two impressions intensely. When he looked up from
"his examination, his face wore a peculiar expression."
“This is not the head which was placed so close to the glass of the
"door of Schloss’ office, peering through, on the night of the robbery,"
in order to see before picking the lock whether the office was empty
and everything ready for the hasty attack on the safe.”
"“That disposes of my theory that Schloss robbed himself,” remarked"
"Winters reluctantly. “But the struggle here, the sleeve of the dress,"
the pistol—could he have been shot?”
"“No, I think not,” considered Kennedy. “It looks to me more like a case"
of apoplexy.”
"“What shall we do?” asked Winters. “Far from clearing anything up, this"
complicates it.”
“Where’s Muller?” asked Kennedy. “Does he know? Perhaps he can shed
"Lights were flashing here and there, and when Jimmie at last found"
"himself inside the chimney, he knew that the very room he had recently"
left was being occupied by the outlaws.
"The electric light was out again, and the boy groped with his hands in"
the darkness. Much to his surprise they failed to locate his chum.
“Ned!” he called softly. “Where are you hiding?”
Jimmie heard a chuckle in the darkness and felt a hand on his shoulder.
Then Ned whispered in his ear:
“I guess I’ve stumbled on one of the hidden cells of the mission!” he
said. “Anyway there’s a hole leading out of this chimney that’s big
enough to keep house in.”
"“We’ll be finding a train of cars and an East river ferryboat next,”"
Jimmie chuckled. “We always do find something when we go away from camp.
"If we don’t find anything else, we find trouble.”"
"It was thought safe, now, to turn on the electric light. The rays showed"
a room perhaps twelve feet in size with furniture and furnishings of the
description of those in the chamber below. Although the apartment seemed
to be somewhere near the center of a lofty finger of rock which lifted
"from the eastern slope of the mountain, the air was remarkably fresh and"
pure.
"“There’s an opening somewhere,” Ned suggested. “A shut-in room like this"
would asphyxiate one if there were no ventilation.”
“Then I think we’d better be finding it!” Jimmie advised. “Just listen
to those fellows chewing the rag in the room we recently left!”
"""Welcome to the wonderful world of Tanzan Mino. I don't know where the"
"hell we are, but it's definitely not Kansas, or London."""
"""My head feels like I was at ground zero when the bomb hit. My whole"
"body aches."" She groaned and plopped back down on the futon. ""What time"
"do you think it is?"""
"""Haven't a clue. How about starting with what day?"" He felt for his"
"watch and realized it was gone. ""What does it matter anyway? Nobody has"
"clocks in never-never land."""
"Satisfied she was okay, he stood up and surveyed the room. Then he saw"
"what he'd expected. There in the center of the ceiling, integrated into"
"the pattern of light-colored woods, was the glass eye of a video"
camera.
And the music. Still the faint music.
He walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside another
"set of sliding doors, also painted with the double-ax insignia. He"
"found himself looking at a third large space, this one paneled in raw"
"cypress. It was vast, and in the center was a cedar hot tub, sunk into"
"the floor. The water was fresh and steaming, and two tiny stools and"
rinsing pails were located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking.
"It was a traditional _o-furo_, one of the finest he'd ever seen."
"""You're not going to believe this."" He turned back and waved her"
forward. In the soft rice-paper glow of the lamp she looked rakishly
disheveled. Japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking.
"""Our host probably figured we'd want to freshen up for the festivities."
"Check it out."""
door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or
"explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in"
"the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say"
"that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed"
sternly.
"""First, Mr. Brown,"" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in"
"class, ""you realize that you are not only committing the political"
"crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away"
"without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores"
"intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?"""
*       *       *       *       *
He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.
Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.
"""I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,"" Sis added"
caustically.
Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.
"""Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And _you_ want to foul up"
"Venus."""
"""We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of"
"politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before--"""
"""Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world."""
"""It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee"
"Brown."" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over"
"her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, ""What"
gallants. But it may not be.  I may not give you such a right. A maiden
is not free to choose her friends; and the knights of chivalry are long
"since vanished from the earth.  I would that I might call you friend,"
that sometimes we might meet and hold converse together. I trust that I
"may learn a good report of you, that one day I may speak with pride of"
having known you in your youth.  But that must suffice us.  Let it be
"enough for both.  I may not—"""
"She hesitated, and her voice died into silence. She spoke with a"
repressed emotion which he scarcely understood.  The tumult of his own
heart was such that he could not seek to gauge the depths of her
feelings.
"""If I may not be your knight, let me at least be your friend—your"
"servant!"" he pleaded.  ""And if there is anything wherein I can serve"
"you—"""
She seemed struck by the phrase.  She lifted her bent head and gazed
earnestly at him; but the words she spoke seemed strange.
"""You are the friend of Lord Sandford; is it not so?"""
"""I have been his comrade these many weeks.  He has shown me much"
"kindness and good-fellowship. I owe him gratitude."""
"""And you must know him well, I doubt not.  Tell me, Sir Grey—and I pray"
you deceive me not—what kind of a man is this same Lord Sandford?  Is he
"leal and true, faithful, loving, and loyal?  Is he better than the crowd"
"who follow at his heels and ape his manners, use his name as a"
"watchword, and fawn upon his favour?  Tell me, what think you of him?  A"
"friend must needs speak sooth."""
But after a little it came to him that the yellow gleam did not seem
"any closer; in fact, it grew fainter; he knew then, with a moment's"
"panic, that the tide and wind were too strong for him. He cursed his"
"frail strength, with a smarting in his eyes that did not come from the"
salt water.
There was only one thing he could do. Turn his back on the friendly
light and strike out in the direction of the beach. It would be
"further, but the cross currents of the tide would not impede his"
progress so much.
"For a long time he fought ahead stubbornly, changing his strokes, even"
"swimming on his back. But his breath came with increasing difficulty, a"
sharp pain stabbed at his side. He labored on. The pain grew sharper
and caught at him like a horrible vise. Once he yielded to it and sank
"down, down into the black water. But it passed and, as he rose, he"
"struck out again, blindly, now, for he had lost all sense of direction."
"""Oh, God! Oh, God!"" he shouted in his heart. His Aunt Achsa's God,"
whose All-embracing Love he had questioned because that God had made
"him crooked, must help him now! ""I _got_ to get help!"" God _must_ hear"
him.
A great exhaustion seized him. He sank again with a quivering breath.
But now his feet touched sand. With new strength he plunged ahead.
Again he was in deep water but he swam with eager strokes. The dreadful
pain stabbed but he did not heed. Now he saw moving lights. He was near
the beach! With a heartbreaking effort he fought the strength of the
"water, finally gaining the shallow depths. He heard voices nearby in"
the darkness.
power. At that a terrible feeling of hopelessness assailed him. His only
chance was to reach the valley where he had little fear of capture; but
"wounded, as he was, that seemed out of the question, and he saw himself"
caught like a rat in a trap. In an access of rage at the situation in
which he was placed he made another effort to raise himself up on his
elbow and peer through the window at the Sierras. The noise that he
"made, slight though it was, awoke the Girl. In an instant she was at his"
bedside drawing the curtain over the window.
"""What you thinkin' of?"" she asked. ""At any moment--jest as soon as the"
trail can be cleared--there'll be someone of the boys up here to see how
"I've pulled through. They mustn't see you . . ."""
"Forcibly, but with loving tenderness, she put him back among his pillows"
and seated herself by the bed. An awkward silence followed. For now that
the man was in his right senses it was borne in upon her that he might
"remember that she had fed him, given him drink and fondled him. It was a"
situation embarrassing to both. Neither knew just what to say or how to
"begin. At length, the voice from the bed spoke:"
"""How long have I been here?"""
"""Three days."""
"""And you have nursed me all that--"""
"""You mustn't talk,"" warned the girl. ""It's dangerous in more ways than"
"one. But if you keep still no one'll suspect that you're here."""
"""But I must know what happened,"" he insisted with increasing excitement."
"""I remember nothing after I came down the ladder. The Sheriff--Rance--"
"what's become . . .?"""
When the three lads came to the finger of granite upon the top of which
"the two fires showed, they first made a careful examination of the"
thickets close by and then ascended to the top.
"“These fires were made to constitute a signal, all right!” Jack"
"declared, poking at the now dying embers."
"“Sure!” answered Frank. “You see, no cooking was done here, and there is"
no camp in sight.”
"“Besides, the position of the blazes on this high rock shows that the"
"fires were built so that the columns of smoke might be seen,” suggested"
"Harry. “It was Indian talk, all right!”"
"“Well, there’s no one here in need of help so far as I can see!” laughed"
"Jack, “and so we may as well go back to the camp.”"
"“That’s the thing to do,” Frank urged. “To tell the truth, I don’t feel"
exactly right about leaving Gilroy there alone.”
"“Aw, we’ll hear him sleeping before we get within a rod of the cave,”"
"laughed Jack. “Gilroy is a good old chap, and father thinks a lot of"
"him, but he doesn’t know much about this kind of a life. I’ll bet that"
"right now he’s dreaming about grizzly bears, and lions, and crocodiles,"
and panthers.”
"From their position in the forest, after their departure from the rock,"
they could see nothing of the signal from the north which had attracted
"Jimmie’s attention, so there seemed nothing for them to do but to return"
to camp. Therefore they set out at good speed.
He intended to make sure it didn't. The planning had been split-second
up until now; this was no moment to relax his guard.
"Yes, it was good he was here. As he studied Comrade Karanova, he"
realized that something about her was still making him uneasy. So far
"it was merely a hunch, but his hunches had been right more often than"
he liked to think.
He tried to push the feeling aside. Probably just paranoia. She
"obviously was here today for the same reason he was, to make sure the"
Soviet money was returned safely. She probably was also still worried
"about the protocol, but that problem was hers, not his. From today on,"
the KGB would have to work out their in-fighting back home the best way
they could. The ground rules were changing fast in Moscow.
"Besides, Dzerzhinsky Square was about to become part of a previous life"
"for him. If he could just clear this up, get his commission, he'd be"
set. Forever. Enough was enough. Maybe he'd end up in the Caribbean
"like Michael, drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis."
The elevator door opened. Facing them were Michael Vance and Eva
Borodin.
"""Glad you could make it."" Vance glanced coldly at Vera. ""Right on time."
"The money arrives in exactly seven minutes."""
"She nodded a silent greeting, pulling her sable coat tighter as she"
strode past. The bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her
"with nervous awe. Even in London, T-Directorate brass had clout."
They moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading to the
"counting room. On this floor everything was high-security, with"
"distinctly, though at that time, my poor friend, you were not a little"
"portly, and now you are a man shrunken."""
"""And my name?"" he asked, flattered that a beautiful woman should recall"
him so distinctly.
"""It is a strange name--Gatepath. An old English name redolent of the"
soil. Roger Gatepath. Your firm bears no prefix of initials and no
"suffix of company. You call yourselves Gatepaths. Just Gatepaths, as"
"though your status were territorial."""
"He crowed with pleasure. By an exercise in memory, Madame Gilbert had"
tied him to her chariot wheels.
"""Right!"" cried he. ""Right in every particular. You are the most"
"wonderful of women. For two minutes I spoke with you, and that was"
"nearly four years ago. I was one of a large party, an insignificant"
"lawyer lost in a dazzling company of titles. Yet you have remembered."""
Madame left the sense of flattery to soak in. She did not spoil the
impression that she had made by explaining that she would have
remembered a lackey with just the same accuracy.
"""And you, Madame?"" he asked. ""Have you been all these years doing war"
work with the Italian Red Cross? The years have passed and left no mark
"upon your face and figure. I, who comfortably filled out my clothes, am"
"shrunken, yet time and sorrow have spared you."""
"""Nevertheless, I have been pretty hard at work,"" said Madame briskly. ""I"
was present at that party ostensibly as an official of the Italian Red
Cross. In fact I was there to see that no harm befell the Royal
Personages who were in my charge. While we moved about those pleasant
in lockers for a while without speaking. Then he spoke slowly and
deliberately.
"""It strikes me that when I was an officer of the bodyguard, in the"
"service of the late Fernando the Seventh, my right royal namesake (and"
"in some sort predecessor), there was another room used for the private"
stores and pieces of the officers. If I mistake not it was entered by
"that door to the right, but the key appears to be wanting!"""
"He added the last clause, as he watched the frantic efforts of Rollo,"
"who had immediately thrown himself upon the panels, while the Señor was"
in the act of rolling out his long-drawn Castilian elegances of
utterance.
"""Hither, Cardono,"" cried Rollo, ""open me this door! Quick, Sergeant!"""
"""Have a care,"" said the Duke; ""there is powder inside!"""
"But Rollo, now keen on the scent of weapons of defence, would not admit"
"a moment's delay, and the Sergeant, inserting his curiously crooked"
"blade, opened that door as easily as he had done the French window."
Muñoz stepped forward with some small show of eagerness and glanced
within.
"""Yes,"" he said, ""the officers' arms are there, and a liberal allowance"
"of powder."""
"""They are mostly sporting rifles,"" said Rollo, looking them over, ""but"
"there is certainly plenty of powder and ball."""
"""And what kills ibex and bouquetin on the sierras,"" drawled Muñoz, ""will"
"Accordingly, within four hours of receiving his appointment, Terence"
"bade his parent farewell and proceeded by rail to Devonport, where"
"the ""Sunderland"" was lying. It was nearly dark when he alighted at"
Millbay station. Here he called a taxi and was whirled off to the
"Dockyard, whence a picquet boat conveyed him to the cruiser, which"
was lying at a buoy in the Hamoaze.
"""We're off under sealed orders at six o'clock tomorrow morning,"""
"announced one of his new shipmates, a junior lieutenant, Teddy"
"Barracombe by name. ""Of course, we are quite in the dark, but there's"
a strong idea floating around that the ship's off to the Near East.
Just my mark! According to all accounts we'll be pretty busy in the
"Dardanelles."""
"""That's all very fine for you,"" commented Oswestry, the torpedo"
"lieutenant, ""but where do I come in? We can't use torpedoes against"
"fortifications, you know, and there's precious little floating about"
"for us to go for."""
"""Don't take on, Torps,"" said Barracombe cheerfully. ""You never know"
"your luck. Wait and see."""
"""I'd rather t'were the other way about,"" corrected Torps. ""Seeing"
your torpedo leave the tube and waiting for the enemy ship to be
blown up. No Dardanelles for me. So I hope to goodness it's the North
"Sea. By Jove, I do!"""
"As soon as the ""Sunderland"" was clear of the breakwater the momentous"
orders were opened. It was not to the Near East; the cruiser had to
proceed to Dover and await further instructions.
"second he stood in awkward silence, swallowing hard in his"
embarrassment. Then he raised his head again.
"“I don’t need your job,” he said, in a poor imitation of devil-may-care"
"defiance. “I’ll get my time, and----”"
Bainbridge cut him short. “You’ll get down to the drive and _work_. Beat
it now--quick!”
"Without another protesting word, Kollock turned meekly and obeyed."
CHAPTER XII. THE TEST
"Before he had taken a dozen steps, Kollock was furious with himself, and"
by the time Bainbridge was out of sight the wrath of the riverman had
risen to a white heat.
From the first he had tried to dislike Bainbridge. Pete Schaeffer had
"been his friend, and after he had been whipped Curly made up his mind"
that there could be no getting along in a crew bossed by the victor.
Then came that brief but pointed interview with Bob which affected him
so oddly. He had never before had anybody tell him that he was to be
"trusted; most bosses had been emphatic in saying the opposite thing. Or,"
"if they kept silent, they showed in a dozen obvious ways that they"
considered him in the same class with his notorious brother.
Then there was the incident of the day before. Curly could not help
admiring the manner in which Bainbridge had handled the crowd that was
trying to hold up the drive. It was exactly the sort of thing he would
"like to have done himself, and his heart warmed toward the man with the"
"courage and ability to act in that fashion. Moreover, Jack Joyce was an"
"kept the drive from jamming. He was hot and sweaty, and generally weary"
"as he continued his way downstream, and his wrath was naturally instant"
"when, on suddenly rounding a bend, he came upon Curly Kollock, cool,"
"calm, and unruffled, sitting comfortably on a rock, enjoying a"
cigarette.
"As the latter saw Bainbridge, he flushed slightly, and half rose from"
"the bowlder. Then, with a stubborn twist of his lips, he sank back"
"again, pulling hard on the cigarette, and doing his best to look"
unconcerned.
"Bob walked straight up to him, and stopped."
"“Well,” he said bitingly, “I’m sorry you’ve lost the use of your feet"
and hands. Is it paralysis?”
"Kollock’s flush deepened, and he mumbled something inane about taking a"
"smoke. He found that he had arisen, apparently without volition, and was"
"standing before the other man, who stared at him a long half minute."
"“This is no rest cure,” said Bob at length. “You’re paid for helping the"
"drive along. I don’t want any loafers in this gang. Understand? Now, get"
down to the head of the drive--and do something!”
"Kollock’s face was flaming, and his eyes gleamed angrily. “I don’t take"
"that line of talk from anybody!” he growled, clenching his fists"
threateningly. “I’ll----”
"“You’ll do what I said, and do it quick!” Bainbridge’s voice was not"
"raised above a conversational pitch, but there was a ring in it which"
seemed to take the fight and bluster out of the big riverman with the
effectiveness of a keen knife thrust into an inflated bladder. For a
removed from the trunk of your family tree. He had only the faintest
tinge of blue blood in his veins. He was an absolute outsider. We'll
"hear no more about _him_ now."""
"""You mean that it's an absolutely sure thing for her,"" Captain Dove"
"suggested, and Mr. Jobling looked pained."
"""I can't afford to risk anything on uncertainties, sir,"" he answered"
"stiffly. ""And I'll stake my professional reputation on--"""
"""Oh, never mind about all that,"" Slyne broke in, folding his share of"
"the papers together and pocketing them. ""The syndicate's safely floated."
And now--as to our next move.
"""You'd better get away back to Genoa by the five o'clock train, Dove."
And you must take Ambrizette with you; I'll get Sal--Lady Josceline
another maid in Paris--one who won't attract quite so much attention to
us as that damned dwarf would.
"""Jobling and I will go on there by the night-mail, on our way to London"
with--Lady Josceline. You can take the _Olive Branch_ round to some safe
"English port and lay her up there in the meantime. As soon as you land,"
you can rejoin us--at Jobling's address. By that time we'll probably be
"ready to redeem our note to you."""
"""By that time,"" Captain Dove returned with concentrated bitterness,"
"""you'll have found some way to give me the slip altogether. D'ye take me"
"for a blind idiot, Slyne? D'ye think I'm going to let Sallie out of my"
"sight, with you?"""
"Slyne was visibly disconcerted. ""But--aren't you going to take your ship"
"round to England?"" he asked, in genuine surprise. ""You can't very well"
'Where is Marie?' I cried.
She did not answer. No one answered; and I knew. Steve swore again. I
think he had known from the beginning. I began to tremble. On a sudden
my lady lifted up her voice and cried shrilly--
'Marie! Marie!'
Again no answer. But this time I did not wait to listen. I ran from
"them into the darkness the way we had come, my legs quivering under"
"me, and my mouth full of broken prayers. I remembered a certain"
"solitary tree fronting the poplars, on the other side of the way,"
"which I had marked mechanically at the moment of the fall--an ash,"
whose light upper boughs had come for an instant between my eyes and
"the sky. It stood on a little mound, where the moorland began to rise"
"on that side. I came to it now, and stopped and looked. At first I"
"could see nothing, and I trod forward fearfully. Then, a couple of"
"paces on, I made out a dark figure, lying head and feet across the"
"road. I sprang to it, and kneeling, passed my hands over it. Alas! it"
was a woman's.
"I raised the light form in my arms, crying passionately on her name,"
"while the wind swayed the boughs overhead, and, besides that and my"
"voice, all the countryside was still. She did not answer. She hung"
"limp in my arms. Kneeling in the dust beside her, I felt blindly for a"
"pulse, a heart-beat. I found neither--neither; the woman was dead."
And yet it was not that which made me lay the body down so quickly and
stand up peering round me. No; something else. The blood drummed in my
"ears, my heart beat wildly. The woman was dead; but she was not Marie."
"She was an old woman, sixty years old. When I stooped again, after"
"""Won't you sit down?"" he suggested with debonair courtesy."
But she shook her head; she was evidently afraid to receive him on any
such friendly footing. She did not even care to ask him what he was
doing in evening dress at breakfast-time and on board the _Olive
Branch_. But in her troubled eyes he could read that unspoken inquiry.
"""I've been travelling all night to get back to you, Sallie,"" he told"
"her, in a low, eager tone, ""and I hadn't time to change--I was in such a"
hurry to tell you the news. I've come to take you away from the _Olive
"Branch_,--and Captain Dove. I've come to set you free."""
"She stared at him as though she had not heard aright, her lips parted,"
"her eyebrows arched, a faint, puzzled, questioning frown on her"
forehead.
"""I've come to set you free,"" he said again."
"""At what price?"" she asked suddenly, with disconcerting directness, and"
his would-be straightforward glance wavered.
"""Don't put it that way!"" he urged. ""I ask no more than the fulfilment of"
"the promise you made me. And--listen, Sallie. I've found out who you"
really are and where your home is. I'll take you there if only you--
"""I'm not asking you to marry me right away, either, remember. All you"
must do in the meantime is to sign without question some papers that
will be required. Then I'll make everything quite safe for you and take
"you to your own home."""
The quick doubt in her eyes had given place to an expression of helpless
amazement and growing dismay. But he did not wait to hear anything she
“Don’t go. Send her an excuse--and take me for a drive. It would do me
"good, and I should so love to be alone with you.”"
It was the very first time in her life that Yvonne had consciously
cajoled a man. Her face flushed hot with misgivings. It was with a
mixture of her sex’s shame and triumph that she heard him say.
"“Whatever you like, dear. It is still your holiday.”"
CHAPTER XIII--Dis Aliter Visum
But the best laid schemes of Yvonnes and men often come to nothing.
"While she was devising, on her drive along the coast, a plan for"
"spending a quiet dangerless evening at the hotel, Mrs. Winstanley was"
"sitting in solitary dignity at the concert, nursing her wrath over"
"Professor Drummond’s “Natural Law in the Spiritual world,” a book which"
she often perused when she wished to accentuate the rigorous attitude of
her mind.
Yvonne had reckoned without Mrs. Winstanley. Otherwise she would have
"offered her a seat in the carriage. As it was, Mrs. Winstanley felt"
more resentful than ever. Under the impression that the Canon was to
"accompany her to the Kursaal, she had graciously dispensed with the"
"escort of the Wilmingtons, who had gone off to see bicycle races at the"
Vélodrome. She was left in the lurch.
To dislike this is human. To wrap oneself up in one’s sore dignity is
"more human still, and there was much humanity that lurked, unsuspected"
"by herself, in Mrs. Winstanley’s bosom. It asserted itself, further,"
"""I win,"" he announced, briefly, his eyes alone betraying the inward"
"fever. He dropped the cards before her on the table. ""Three kings,--and"
"the _last hand_!"""
"Suddenly, as though some inward cord had snapped under the strain, the"
"Girl collapsed. Limply she slid downward in her chair, one groping hand"
"straying aimlessly to her forehead, then dropping of its own weight."
"""Quick, Jack,--I'm ill,--git me somethin'!"" The voice trailed off to"
nothingness as the drooping eyelids closed.
"In real consternation, the Sheriff sprang to his feet. In one sweeping"
"glance his alert eye caught the whisky bottle upon the mantel. ""All"
"right, Girl, I'll fix you in no time,"" he said cheeringly over his"
shoulder. But where the deuce did she keep her tumblers? The next minute
he was groping for them in the dark of the adjoining closet and softly
cursing himself for his own slowness.
"Instantaneously, the Girl came to life. The unturned cards upon the"
table vanished with one lightning movement; the Girl's hand disappeared
"beneath her skirts, raised for the moment knee-high; then the same,"
"swift reverse motion, and the cards were back in place, while the Girl's"
"eyes trembled shut again, to hide the light of triumph in them. A smile"
flickered on her lips as the Sheriff returned with the glass and bottle.
"""Never mind,--I'm better now,"" her lips shaped weakly."
"The Sheriff set down the bottle, and put his arm around the Girl with a"
rough tenderness.
"""Oh, you only fainted because you lost,"" he told her."
"Averting her gaze, the Girl quietly disengaged herself, rose to her feet"
"shut his mouth by and by, when I have more time to attend to such"
"matters."""
"""How much do you want?"" Slyne inquired with a frown evidently meant to"
warn his friend to be modest.
"""Can you spare twenty pounds--to go on with?"""
"Slyne hesitated, but only for a few seconds. Then he pulled out a"
pocket-book and surreptitiously passed that sum to the penniless man of
"law, who accepted it with no more than a nod of thanks."
"""I'll pay Mullins now,"" he remarked, and immediately hurried out of the"
room. Captain Dove was gasping for breath and showed every other symptom
of a forthcoming explosion.
"As soon as the door shut behind him, the old man gave open vent to his"
wrath. And a most furious quarrel followed between Slyne and him.
"Sallie, too, learned then, for the first time, of the vast inheritance"
"which would be hers, of Slyne's cunning plan to buy Captain Dove out for"
"a mere pittance, and how he himself expected to profit through marrying"
her.
But she was not overwhelmed with surprise by that belated discovery. She
had almost anticipated the final disclosure of some such latent motive
behind all Slyne's professions to her. The only difference it might make
would be to Captain Dove. Slyne and he were still snarling at each other
when Mr. Jobling walked jauntily in again. But at sight of him Captain
Dove began to subside.
"""We mustn't be late. Mr. Spettigrew will be expecting us now. I've sent"
"Mullins on ahead with my papers,"" observed Mr. Jobling breezily, and"
plainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible
check-stations.
"""Not that baby,"" returned the computer confidently. ""I'll bet you a"
small farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his
goniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back
"into position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's"
"always been there."""
"""The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to"
"them?"""
"""Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody"
"anything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?"""
"""Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?"""
"""Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are"
altogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you.
"Another thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x."
"If so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all"
"off on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every"
"check-station. See?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"True to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact"
"center of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he"
began really to enjoy the trip.
"""How do we check on chronometers?"" asked P6 when Stevens had been"
"introduced. ""By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds"
Louis XIV because of a too great friendliness for one of the king's
"sweethearts, and was living in exile in London till Louis should forgive"
his interference. The French king really liked De Grammont and trusted
"him when his Majesty's lady-loves were not concerned, so the count had"
"been sent to England in honorable exile, and was employed in certain"
cases as a spy and in others as a means of secret communication between
the French king and persons connected with the court of Charles II.
"When De Grammont saw me, he came forward, holding out both hands in his"
"effusive French manner, apparently overjoyed at finding a long-lost"
brother.
"""Come with me, my dear baron,"" he cried, bending so close to me that I"
"feared he was going to kiss me. ""Come with me! You are the very man of"
"all the world I want, I need, I must have!"""
"""You have me, my dear count,"" said I, ""but I cannot go with you. I am"
"engaged elsewhere."""
"""No, no, let me whisper!"" He brought his lips close to my ear and"
"continued almost inaudibly: ""You may please me. You may help a friend."
"You may oblige--a king."""
"The last, of course, was the _ne plus ultra_ of inducement according to"
"the count's way of thinking, and he supposed the mere suggestion would"
"vanquish me. Still I pleaded my engagement. He insisted, however,"
repeating in my ear:--
"""Oblige a king! A real king! Not a flimsy fool of bourgeois, who makes of"
"himself the laughing-stock of his people, but a real king. I cannot name"
"him now, but you must know."""
"if you wish to make sure whether it is a good auspice or a bad, you kill"
"the spider and count its legs. If they are an even number, it is a good"
"omen; if uneven, bad.”"
"“But I believe spiders always have an even number of legs,” said Cæsar."
"“Certainly,” responded the old man; “but my wife swears they do not;"
that she has seen many with seven and nine legs. It is religious
unreasonableness.”
"“Are there many people like that, so credulous?” asked Cæsar."
"“Oh, lots,” replied Lanza; “in the shops you will find amulets, horns,"
"hands made of coral or horseshoes, all to keep away bad luck. My wife"
"and the neighbour women play the lottery, by combining the numbers of"
"their birthdays, and the ages of their fathers, their mothers, and their"
"children. When some relative dies, they make a magic combination of"
"the dates of birth and death, the day and the month, and buy a lottery"
ticket. They never win; and instead of realizing that their systems
"are of no avail, they say that they omitted to count in the number of"
"letters in the name or something of that sort. It is comical, so much"
religion and so much superstition.”
"“But you confuse religion and superstition, my friend,” said Kennedy."
"“It’s all the same,” answered the old man, smiling his suavely ironical"
smile. “There is nothing except Nature.”
"“You do not believe in miracles, Giovanni Battista?” asked the"
Englishman.
"“Yes, I believe in the earth’s miracles, making trees and flowers grow,"
CHAPTER V
BAFFLED
"When at last I arrived at Cary's flat it was very late, and I was"
exceedingly tired and out of temper. A squadron of Zeppelins had been
"reported from the sea, the air-defence control at Newcastle had sent"
"out the preliminary warning ""F.M.W.,"" and the speed of my train had"
been reduced to about fifteen miles an hour. I had expected to get in
"to dinner, but it was eleven o'clock before I reached my destination."
"I had not even the satisfaction of seeing a raid, for the Zepps, made"
"cautious by recent heavy losses, had turned back before crossing the"
"line of the coast. Cary and his wife fell upon my neck, for we were"
"old friends, condoled with me, fed me, and prescribed a tall glass of"
mulled port flavoured with cloves. My stern views upon the need for
Prohibition in time of war became lamentably weakened.
"By midnight I had recovered my philosophic outlook upon life, and Cary"
began to enlighten me upon the details of the grave problem which had
brought me eagerly curious to his city.
"""I expect that Dawson will drop in some time to-night,"" he said. ""All"
"hours are the same to him. I told him that you were on the way, and he"
"wants to give you the latest news himself. He is dead set upon you,"
"Copplestone. I can't imagine why."""
"""Am I then so very unattractive?"" I inquired drily. ""It seems to me"
"that Dawson is a man of sound judgment."""
"""I confess that I do not understand why he lavishes so much attention"
Thereupon his neighbour tried to create an impression by appearing calm
"and philosophical. He said in a strained, breaking voice:"
"""Think of all the waste in life and treasure this frightful war"
involves. Think of the moral degradation. Think of the widows and
"orphans. Think of the...."" He was unequal to the effort and his voice"
trailed away and then seemed to catch in his throat. But he recovered
"and with a kind of gasp he squeezed out a few more words: ""Bill, forgive"
"me for insulting you to-day--I didn't mean it, Bill. Forget it, Bill,"
"forget it! If you get killed without forgiving me, my conscience will"
"always torture...."""
"""For Christ's sake shut up, yer bleed'n' 'ypocrite,"" interrupted the"
"gruff voice of ""Bill"" somewhere out of the darkness. ""Yer always"
bleed'n' well preachin'--it's bad enough 'avin' Fritz over us without
"you bloody well rubbin' it in. If yer don't shut yer mouth, I'll come"
"over an' shut it for yer, 'struth I will."""
"The philosopher said no more, but another voice made itself heard, that"
"of a good-natured, elderly bachelor, who said with melancholy"
resignation:
"""It's jolly hard, all the same, to be knocked out like this. You're so"
"helpless--no dug-outs, no shelters anywhere...."""
"""It's doubly hard when you're married,"" said another. ""I haven't got the"
"wind up about myself at all, but I can't help thinking about my wife...."
"They're going away now, thank the Lord. You never know when they won't"
"be coming back though--that's just the worst of it."""
The noise of the propellers was indeed dying away.
“Cardinal Spada is a very intelligent man and a very amiable one. At
"heart he is a Liberal and fond of the French. As to the Abbé Tardieu, he"
is a very influential priest at the church of San Luigi.”
After lunch they went direct to a solitary street in the old part of
"Rome. At the door of the big, sad palace where Cardinal Spada lived, a"
"porter with a cocked hat, a grey greatcoat, and a staff with a silver"
"knob, was watching the few passers-by."
"They went in by the broad entry-way, as far as a dark colonnaded court,"
paved with big flags which had grass between them.
In the middle of the court a fountain shot up a little way and fell into
a stone basin covered with moss.
Kennedy and Cæsar mounted the wide monumental stairway; on the first
floor a handsome glassed-in gallery ran around the court. The whole
house had an air of solemnity and sadness. They entered the Cardinal’s
"office, which was a large, sad, severe room."
"Monsignor Spada was a vigorous man, despite his age. He looked frank"
"and intelligent, but one guessed that there was a hidden bitterness and"
desolation in him. He wore a black cassock with red edges and buttons.
"Kennedy went close and was about to kneel to the Cardinal, but he"
prevented him.
Cæsar explained his ideas to the Cardinal with modesty. He felt that
this man was worthy of all his respect.
"Monsignor Spada listened attentively, and then said that he understood"
"nothing about financial matters, but that on principle he was in favour"
"rowing. A little later I got up and looked again--oh, yes, they were"
getting on. I took up my post by the window. It was really quite
interesting to watch the boat getting smaller and smaller; finally I
"opened the window, even looked through my field-glasses. As it was not yet"
"quite light, I could not see them very clearly, but the red hat was still"
discernible. Then the boat disappeared behind an island. I dressed and
"went down. The children were all still in bed, but the wife, Regine, was"
up. How calmly and naturally she took everything!
"""Do you know where your husband is?"" I asked her."
"""Yes--funny, aren't they?"" she replied. ""I never saw them till after"
they'd left--gone down to the fjord. Where do you suppose they're going?
"Haddock fishing?"""
"""Maybe,"" was all I said. But I thought to myself: ""They're leaving, all"
"right. They had their knapsacks on their backs."""
"""Funny couple,"" Regine resumed. ""Nothing to eat, no coffee, not a thing!"
"And the missis not wanting anything to eat last night, neither!"""
I merely shook my head and went out. Regine called to me that coffee was
"nearly ready, so if I'd like a cup--"
Of course the only thing I could do in the face of such foolishness was to
shake my head and go away. One must take the sensible view. How was it
"possible to understand such behavior? Nevertheless I, the undersigned,"
"should have gone on to Olaus yesterday, instead of going fishing. That"
would have been still more sensible. What business had I at this house?
"Very likely she found it embarrassing to be called the ""missis,"" and this"
was why she could neither eat last night nor stay here today. So she had
"beaten a retreat, with her friend and her knapsack."
"Yashka was ""touched with paint"" after two glasses of vodki, and was in"
a slightly uplifted condition.
"The people looked at him, expecting him to make a row, and all were"
silent.
"""Did you see me?  And how did it please you?"" asks Yashka."
The people control their laughter.
"""No; it did not please me,"" replies the teacher.  His tone is so"
serious that the people are silent.
"""You see I was just trying it,"" said Yashka, with bravado, fearing that"
"the teacher would rebuke him. ""The wife is satisfied....  She has not"
"got up yet to-day...."""
"The teacher, who was drawing absently with his fingers on the table,"
"said, ""Do you see, Yakov, why this did not please me? ... Let us go"
"into the matter thoroughly, and understand what you are really doing,"
and what the result may be.  Your wife is pregnant.  You struck her
last night on her sides and breast. That means that you beat not only
"her but the child too.  You may have killed him, and your wife might"
have died or else have become seriously ill.  To have the trouble of
"looking after a sick woman is not pleasant.  It is wearing, and would"
"cost you dear, because illness requires medicine, and medicine money."
"If you have not killed the child, you may have crippled him, and he"
"will be born deformed, lop-sided, or hunch-backed.  That means that he"
"will not be able to work, and it is only too important to you that he"
"should be a good workman.  Even if he be born ill, it will be bad"
"enough, because he will keep his mother from work, and will require"
medicine.  Do you see what you are doing to yourself?  Men who live by
"It was by no means a difficult task to replace the stone, as it was thin"
"and had been nicely fitted into the opening. In a short time the boys,"
"proceeding mostly on their hands and knees, came to the end of the"
tunnel and looked out over a valley tucked in between two great summits.
"The snow-line was not far away and the air was cold, notwithstanding the"
direct rays of the sun.
"There was no one in sight, no moving object anywhere, as the boys paused"
at the mouth of the passage and gazed about. Judging from the location
"of the sun, they were looking straight west."
"“Now,” Ned said after a pause, “if we follow this little valley straight"
"to the south, we’ll come out somewhere near our camp.”"
"“Yes,” Jimmie answered, “I have a pious notion that our brownstone front"
is carved into the face of a continuation of that ridge on the other
side of the little valley.”
"“Perhaps we’ll find the Boy Scout messenger at the camp,” Ned suggested."
"“If we do,” Jimmie declared, “I’ll change his face for him!”"
"“I can’t understand the fellow,” Ned admitted."
"“Gee!” cried Jimmie, “He came out into the woods and told Frank and I to"
"beat it, then went up into the camp and led you into the clutches of"
"these outlaws. If I had his head in chancery right now, I’d ‘beat it’,"
all right! He ought to get a thousand years!”
"“I hope the boys are all safe,” said Ned."
TOXICOLOGY.--Dogs and cats are especially susceptible to the action of
"carbolic acid, therefore great care must be exercised when washing,"
"especially cats, with any preparation containing carbolic acid."
Disinfecting and deodorizing cat’s quarters with any preparation
containing carbolic acid makes them sick.
ANTIDOTE.--Sulphates of soda or magnesia. Atropine sulphate
hypodermically is a very valuable antidote. Alcohol and vinegar have
"been used with good results, both internally and externally."
ACIDUM SALICYLICUM--SALICYLIC ACID
"An organic acid, existing naturally in combination in various plants,"
but largely prepared synthetically from carbolic acid.
DERIVATION.--Made by passing carbonic dioxide through sodium carbolate
at a temperature of 428° F. (220° C.). 2 NaC₆H₅O (sodium carbolate) +
CO₂ = Na₂C₇H₄O₃ (sodium salicylate) + C₆H₆O (phenol). Sodium salicylate
is treated with hydrochloric acid when salicylic acid is precipitated.
"PROPERTIES.--Light, fine, white, needle-shaped crystals, odorless,"
"having a sweetish, afterwards acrid taste; permanent in air. Soluble in"
"alcohol, ether and hot water; borax increases its solubility."
"DOSE.--Horses, 2 to 6 drs.; cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"pigs, 30 to 40 grs.; dogs, 5 to 20 grs.; should be given well diluted;"
"large doses are recommended for fevers, but smaller doses more often"
repeated in rheumatism.
The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had
to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he
threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something
nasty about the length of his hair; and _imagine_!--he not only
"resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he"
sassed the judge in open court!
"""Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female"
"attorneys. Told _her_ that where _I_ came from, a man spoke his piece"
"when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side."""
"""What happened?"" I asked breathlessly."
"""Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took"
"my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the"
"rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated."" His eyes grew dark for"
"a moment. He chuckled again. ""But I wasn't going to serve all those"
"fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,"
"they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken"
mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.
"My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking"
"for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away."""
*       *       *       *       *
"For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill."
"""Y-you mean,"" I choked, ""th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?"
"And I'm with you while you're doing it?"""
He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.
"""What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what"
"business do _you_ have this close to the hull?"""
"""No,"" he answered breathlessly.  ""But we must not lose a single"
"instant.""  And I saw that with a lancet he had made an incision in her"
"delicate wrist, and there was blood there.  ""She is in a state of"
"catalepsy, and we must do all in our power to bring her round."""
"""But do you think you can?""  I cried."
"""I hope so."""
"""Do your best, Dick,"" I implored.  ""Save her, for my sake."""
"""Rely upon me,"" he answered calmly, adding: ""Run along to Number 18 in"
the boulevard--the corner house on the right--and bring Doctor Trepard
"at once.  He lives au troisieme.  Tell him that I sent you, and that the"
"matter is one of life or death.""  He scribbled some words on a card,"
"and, giving it me, added: ""Tell him to bring this.  Meanwhile, I will"
"commence artificial respiration.  Go!"""
"""But do you think she will really recover?""  I demanded."
"""I can't tell.  We have already lost so much time.  I had no idea of the"
truth.  It has surprised me just as it has surprised you.  This moment
"is not one for words, but for actions.  Don't lose an instant."""
"Thus urged, I snatched up my hat and tore along the boulevard like a"
"madman.  Without difficulty I found Trepard's appartement, and on being"
"admitted found him a grave-faced, rather stout old Frenchman, who, on"
the instant I mentioned Dick's name and gave him the card with the words
"upon it, naming some drugs he required, went into an adjoining room, and"
"fetched a phial of tiny red pillules, which he held up to the light."
"Then he put on his hat, and descended with me to the street.  A fiacre"
"was passing, which we took, and five minutes later we were standing"
"What a coincidence: another barn on my road, just as in the days of the"
golden horn! It offers me plenty of straw and shelter for the night; but
"where is the girl who gave me the letter? How warm her breath was, coming"
"between lips a little parted! She will come again, of course; let us wait,"
"we have plenty of time, another twenty years--oh, yes, she will come...."
I must be on my guard against such traps. I have entered upon the
honorable years; I am weak and quite capable of believing that a barn is a
"gift from above: thou well-deserving old man, here is a barn for thee!"
"No, thank you, I'm only just in my seventies."
And so in my errand of the head I pass by the barn.
Toward morning I find shelter under a projecting crag. It is fitting that
"I should live under crags hereafter, and I lie down in a huddle, small and"
"invisible. Anything else you please, as long as you don't flaunt your"
selfishness and your rags!
"I am comfortable now, lying with my head on another person's knapsack full"
of used clothes; I am doing this solely because it is just the right size.
But sleep will not come; there are only thoughts and dreams and lines of
"poetry and sentimentality. The sack smells human, and I fling it away,"
laying my head on my arm. My arm smells of wood--not even wood.
But the slip of paper with the address--have I got the address? And I
scratch a match to read it through and know it by heart tomorrow. Just a
"line in pencil, nothing; but perhaps there is a softness in the letters, a"
womanliness--I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
THE HAT OF THE _HULDRES_
"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a"
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
"cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of"
"cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,"
"for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his"
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
"celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride"
"and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and"
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
"not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit"
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
"and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of"
"attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,"
"here I am back again."""
"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife."
"""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so"
"much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little"
"consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there."""
"""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his"
wife.
"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a _huldre_ hat."
"""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?"""
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered at random and since he seemed to expect"
"some reply to that fatuity. She had met a good many men in her time, but"
never one quite like this Lord Ingoldsby--who actually seemed anxious to
look and act like a cunning fool.
A waiter intervened between them. But his lordship waved that
functionary away.
"""Do let's,"" he implored with child-like insistence. ""It would be so"
"deevy to be pals with you. And I'm beastly dull here, all by myself,"
don't y'know. So--
"""Eh?"" He glared at Slyne, who had bluntly interrupted his _tête-à-tête_."
"""No, I _don't_ want any oysters--I told that waiter-chap so. And I"
_don't_ know any 'lady of the camellias.' I can't imagine what you're
"talkin' about at all, I'm sure."""
"""I saw her again last night, at the Casino,"" said Slyne, imperturbably,"
and went on to entertain Sallie with a long if not over-truthful account
"of his own over-night's doings there. So that, for all his lordship's"
"lack of manners, it was some time before that spoiled youth again"
succeeded in monopolising her attention. At every turn Slyne was ready
"to balk him, and, but for his native self-conceit coupled with a certain"
"blind obstinacy, he must very soon have understood what was perfectly"
"plain to Sallie, that he was there merely on sufferance, to serve some"
purpose of Slyne's.
"""Goin' to be here long, Lady Josephine?"" he managed to break in at last."
Slyne had turned to give a departing waiter some order.
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered again, since she could say nothing else."
We all tried in vain to stand with heels and back to the inside of the
north wall on the ground floor--it cannot be done; one falls forward
at once. From the top there is a magnificent view of the city and the
"surrounding plain, of the mountains on the east and the sea on the"
"west, of the city of Leghorn and the island of Elba."
From the windows of our hotel at Pisa we saw for the first time the
red gold of ripe oranges shining amid their dark green leaves in the
"gardens, and rejoiced to think that at last we had reached a somewhat"
"milder climate, and were now leaving rigorous winter behind us."
"The journey from Pisa to Rome is a long one, and the schedule was such"
that we did not arrive till late at night. From the car windows we had
"some impressive views of the Mediterranean by moonlight, and of the"
"solemn campagna, and, thus prepared, we crossed the Tiber at midnight,"
and passed through the breach in the walls which has been made for the
"railway, feeling, perhaps even more deeply than is usual, the thrill"
with which all travellers except those who are utterly devoid of
imagination first enter the Eternal City.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
SOME LITTLE ADVENTURES BY THE WAY.
"_December 21, 1902._"
[Sidenote: Conditions Unfavorable to Letter-writing Abroad.]
"The police launch sheered off, and the sound of her exhaust grew"
rapidly fainter and fainter. But not until it had wholly ceased did Big
George give over his post at the wheel. Even then he went down the
"ladder reluctantly, and without a word of thanks, of explanation, or of"
apology. With him this had been but a part of the day's work. He saw
neither sentiment nor humor in the episode. The clang of the
"deep-throated ship's bell spoke the hour, and, taking Cherry's arm,"
Boyd helped her to the deck.
"""Now let's eat something,"" said she."
"""Yes,"" he agreed, relief and triumph in his tone, ""and drink something,"
"too."""
"""We'll drink to the health of 'Fingerless' Fraser."""
"""To the health of 'Fingerless' Fraser,"" he echoed. ""We will drink that"
"standing."""
"A week later, after an uneventful voyage across a sea of glass, _The"
Bedford Castle_ made up through a swirling tide-rip and into the
"fog-bound harbor of Unalaska. The soaring ""goonies"" that had followed"
them from Flattery had dropped astern at first sight of the volcanic
"headlands, and now countless thousands of sea-parrots fled from the"
"ship's path, squattering away in comic terror, dragging their fat"
bodies across the sea as a boy skips a flat rock. It had been Captain
"Peasley's hope, here at the gateway of the Misty Sea, to learn"
"something about the lay of the big ice-floes to the northward, but he"
"was disappointed, for the season was yet too young for the"
"revenue-cutters, and the local hunters knew nothing. Forced to rely on"
"luck and his own skill, he steamed out again the next day, this time"
“Of course it is--a delightful one--to see dear Yvonne and yourself.
Where are you staying?”
"“At the Océan,” said the Canon, “and you must all come and dine with us"
this evening.”
“And will you come to the _bal_ here afterward?” asked Sophia. “Evan has
run across some college friends--or won’t you think it proper?”
"“I am going to wear the whole suit of motley while I am here,” replied"
the Canon gaily.
"He kept his word, not being a man of half measures. No check should be"
"placed on Yvonne’s enjoyment. She had been moping, as far as Yvonne could"
"mope, during the latter dullness of Fulminster; now she expanded like a"
flower to the gaiety around her. The Canon found an aesthetic pleasure
in watching her happiness. Her expressions of thanks too were charmingly
"conveyed. Since that unfortunate attempt on his part, over a twelvemonth"
"back, to instruct her in the responsibilities of her position, she had"
never exhibited toward him such spontaneous feeling. He let her smile
"upon whom she would, without a twinge of jealousy."
Yvonne enjoyed herself hugely. She danced and jested with the young men;
"she chattered in French to her table d’hôte neighbours, delighted to"
speak her mother’s tongue again; she staked two-franc pieces on the
"public table, and one afternoon came out of the gaming-room into the"
"great hall where the Canon was sitting with Mrs. Winstanley, and poured"
a great mass of silver on to the table--as much as her two small hands
joined could carry.
"“I thought gambling was against your principles, Everard,” said Mrs."
"I manage to reach the trading center at midday, when everyone is up and"
"about, and the post office open. They give me a large sheet of wrapping"
paper and string and sealing wax; I wrap the parcel and seal it and write
on the outside. There!
"Oh--I forgot the slip of paper with the address--to put it inside, I mean."
"Stupid! But otherwise I have done what I should. As I continue on my way,"
I feel strangely void and deserted; no doubt because the knapsack was
"quite heavy after all, and now I am well rid of it. ""The last pleasure!"" I"
"think suddenly. And as I walk on I think irrelevantly: ""The last country,"
"the last island, the last pleasure...."""
XXXI
What now?
"I didn't know at first. The winter stood before me, my summer behind"
"me--no task, no yearning, no ambition. As it made no difference where I"
"stayed, I remembered a town I knew, and thought I might as well go"
"there--why not? A man cannot forever sit by the sea, and it is not"
necessary to misunderstand him if he decides to leave it. So he leaves
his solitude--others have done so before him--and a mild curiosity drives
him to see the ships and the horses and the tiny frostbitten gardens of a
"certain town. When he arrives there, he begins to wonder in his idleness"
"if he does not know someone in this town, in this terrifyingly large town."
"The moonlight is bright now, and it amuses him to give himself a certain"
"address to visit evening after evening, and to take up his post there as"
"though something depended on it. He is not expected anywhere else, so he"
"And then, in great mental agony, I said to myself: ""I _will_ be happy, I"
"_will_ enjoy my leave."" But a number of invisible cobwebs hung between"
"myself and the world around me. I tried to brush them away, but they"
were so impalpable that the movement of my hand did not disturb them at
all.
I gave up the attempt. I would wait until I got home. Then I would talk
and forget myself--only by forgetting myself would I enjoy the present.
Only those who forget themselves are happy. The obsession of self is
the most oppressive of all burdens.
I descended from a 'bus and took a train. A girl sitting opposite me
"stared at my blue chevrons and whispered to her fellow passenger: ""He's"
"just come from the front."" So I too was regarded as a strange kind of"
animal. I got out at my home-station. I showed my leave-warrant to the
ticket collector. He was a benevolent looking old man. He smiled and
wished me good luck. Things began to seem a little less foreign. And
then the thought of being home in a few minutes absorbed me entirely.
"I hurried down the street. I knocked at the door, and it opened. The"
long yearned-for meeting took place at last.
"I threw my pack, equipment and steel helmet contemptuously into a"
"corner. I took an infantile delight in clean, furnished rooms, in the"
"white table-cloth, the shining silver, the cut flowers, and the"
oil-paintings on the wall. And we talked until late into the night.
It was good to wake up the next morning and to know that the first day
of my leave was still before me. I felt encouraged to face my new
surroundings boldly. I would understand them and identify myself with
"them. If the sensation that I was dreaming came upon me again, I would"
"delighted to meet such redoubtable warriors, and hoped that now they"
"would come with me and help me, as my business was to fight Germans,"
"airships and all. This was strictly true, for, but for German"
"influence, there would have been no need to wage war on the Raiders"
who had only been induced to become our enemies by lying German
propaganda.
Idu said they would be only too glad to go with the Sahib and to help
him fight the enemies of the British Raj. He also told me that he had
already saved my life once that evening.
"""How was that?"" I asked, my spirits rising as I gazed through the"
darkness at my first three recruits.
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned Idu, ""when the airship, which you say is"
"no airship, stopped, in a little while we saw the figure of a man,"
"carrying a lantern moving towards us, and Halil here,"" laying his"
"hand on the shoulder of one of his pals, ""lifted his rifle and was"
"about to shoot. But I said, 'Nay. See, it is but one man. Let us wait"
and see who he is.' And then the lantern went out and there was no
"longer a target."""
"""You did well, Idu,"" I said solemnly. ""You have most certainly saved"
"my life, and as you seem to be as intelligent as you are brave, I"
shall appoint you to my personal staff. I am the officer who has
"been sent out to take command of the forces along the Sarhad, and in"
Seistan. But at the present moment my chief concern is to find the
"right road to Saindak. Can you show it to me?"""
"Idu laughed. ""I could lead you there blindfold, Sahib."""
"I felt the difficulties of the road were now over, and, piloted by"
"""Happen to know if he had any relations, sir?"""
"""H'm. He was a widower, I believe."""
"""Children?"""
"""Really,"" said Mr. Kilshaw, with a faint smile, ""I don't know."""
And he escaped from pertinacious Mr. Dawson with some alacrity. When he
"was outside, he stopped suddenly. ""Shall I tell 'em to apply to"
"Medland?"" he asked himself, with a malicious chuckle. ""No, I'll wait a"
"bit yet,"" and he walked on, wondering whether by any chance Mr. Benham"
had been done to death to save the Premier. This fanciful idea he soon
"dismissed with a laugh; it never entered his head, prejudiced as he was,"
"to think that Medland himself had any hand in the matter. After all, he"
"was a man of common sense, and he quickly arrived at a conclusion which"
"he expressed by exclaiming,"
"""The poor fool's been showing his money. Who's got my five hundred now,"
"I wonder?"""
"His wonderings would have been satisfied, had Aladdin's carpet or other"
magical contrivance transported him to where the steamship _Pride of the
"South_ was ploughing her way through the waves, bound from Kirton to San"
"Francisco, with liberty to touch at several South American ports. A"
"thick-set, short man, shipped at the last moment as cook's mate, in"
"substitution for a truant, was lying on his back, smoking a cigarette,"
"looking up at the bright stars, and ever and again gently pressing his"
hand on a little lump inside his shirt. He seemed at peace with all the
"world, though he was ready to be at war, if need be, and his knife,"
"burnished and clean, lay handy to his fingers. He turned on his side and"
"enough of the protocol translated by tomorrow, the press package ready."
Then we drop it on the papers and blow town.
"From the hallway outside a bell chimed faintly as the elevator opened,"
a private lift that came directly up from the lobby. When he heard the
"heavy footsteps of the couriers, accompanied by MNB guards, he stepped"
over and quickly glanced out. The two blue-suits were each carrying a
large satchel handcuffed to the left wrist. Obviously the third had
"stayed downstairs, guarding the van."
"""This way."" The heavy-jowled director of the MNB bond trading desk"
stepped out and motioned them in. The play was on.
Kenji Nogami's issue of Mino Industries debentures had been registered
with the Issuing House Association the previous day. This morning they
"would be acquired by Vance, using a wire transfer between the Moscow"
Narodny Bank on Saint Swithins Lane and Westminster Union Bank's bond
"desk. After that there would be a second transaction, whereby Sumitomo"
"Bank, Limited would accept the debentures as security for a loan of one"
"hundred million dollars, to be wire-transferred back to Westminster"
Union and from there to Moscow Narodny Bank. Everything had been
prearranged. The whole transaction would require only minutes.
Unless there was a glitch.
Vance had fully expected that Tanzan Mino would send a welcoming
"committee to Nogami's premises, which was why he'd arranged for the"
money to be delivered here at Moscow Narodny's side-street branch. He
"figured the Soviets, at least, would play it straight. KGB wanted its"
file closed.
"Then too, Eva still had the protocol. Their back-up insurance policy."
"""You're free now to do as you like,"" he answered, and left her. He felt"
as if he were treading on air on his way back to the mid-ship saloon.
"Captain Dove, in the same _négligé_ costume, was busy at breakfast when"
"Slyne walked in upon him again, but looked up from his plate for long"
enough to mumble a malicious question.
"""Yes, I've fixed it all up with her,"" Slyne answered with assumed"
"nonchalance. ""You can always trust me to know how to handle a woman,"
"Dove."""
"Captain Dove shot a derisive glance in his direction. ""Is she willing to"
"marry you after all, then?"" he demanded, feigning a surprise by no means"
complimentary.
"""Not just at once, of course,"" returned his companion, and left the old"
man to infer whatever he pleased.
In response to a shouted order of Captain Dove's a slatternly
cook-steward brought Slyne a steaming platter of beans with a bit of
"bacon-rind on top, and an enamelled mug containing a brew which might,"
"by courtesy, have been called coffee. There was a tray of broken ship's"
"biscuits, a tin containing some peculiarly rank substitute for butter,"
"upon the table, with the other equally uninviting concomitants of a"
meagre meal.
"""_Tchk-tchk!_"" commented Slyne, and sat down to satisfy his hunger as"
"best he might; while Captain Dove, having overheard that criticism, eyed"
"him inimically, and proceeded to puff a peculiarly rank cigar in his"
face.
"""You might as well be getting dressed now,"" said Slyne indifferently."
"kidnapping----"""
Gatepath looked around anxiously. The men were alone in a recess of the
"club smoking-room. ""Yes,"" he whispered eagerly. ""Yes, go on."""
"""I shall not do anything of the sort. You are a nice sort of family"
"solicitor, Gatepath. Apart from the personal danger of playing tricks,"
"can't you see that your interest lies with the bouncing heir, not with"
"the snuffy old family? Don't be an ass. Bring him home, give the House"
"of Lords the sensation of their placid lives, and let the good old"
British public enjoy a week of laughter. How they will bellow with joy.
"And the newspapers! I can see, Gatepath, that your agreeable young heir"
"is going to be the Success of the Season."""
"""You are not very helpful,"" groaned Gatepath. ""There must be a"
solution; there must be some way of shielding the Family from this
"frightful humiliation."""
"The interview with the Chief was a complete failure, and Gatepath parted"
from his old friend both hurt and angry. He had not expected ribald
"laughter in so grave a social crisis. The Chief must be a Radical, a"
"Socialist, even a Bolshevik, one empty of all decent political"
principles.
It was on his way home that Gatepath bethought him of Madame Gilbert.
"She, that beautiful, loyal-hearted woman, would not laugh. He remembered"
the glitter of unshed tears in the violet eyes when she had bade him
farewell. It was his tactless hand upon the open wound of Caporetto
"which had aroused those tears. He remembered also that Madame was free,"
"and that she had been trained to do the ruthless, unscrupulous work of"
"the Secret Service. She did not look either ruthless or unscrupulous,"
and it was in a strictly professional sense that Gatepath connected her
"hard and painful; as biscuit was the only available food, no"
nourishment was taken. The bowels acted on the second night. At
the end of a week the patient was sent by bullock wagon (three
"days and nights) to Modder River, and then down to Capetown,"
"where he walked into the hospital on the thirteenth day,"
apparently well.
"Two days later the temperature rose to 104°, and enteric fever"
"was diagnosed, no local signs pointing to the injury existing."
The patient made a good recovery.
"(173) Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_ (Mauser), at junction of"
outer 2/5 with inner 3/5 of line from right anterior superior
"iliac spine to umbilicus; _exit_, at upper part of right great"
"sacro-sciatic foramen, in line of posterior superior iliac"
spine. Advancing on foot when struck; he then fell and crept
"fifty yards to behind a rock, where he remained seven and a"
half hours. For two days subsequently he vomited freely; the
"bowels acted nine hours after the injury, and then became"
"constipated. No further symptoms were noted, and at the end of"
three weeks the abdomen was absolutely normal. The man is now
again on active service.
(174*) Wounded at Modder River while retiring on foot. _Entry_
"(Mauser), at highest point of right iliac crest; _exit_, 2-1/2"
inches to right of and 1/2 inch above level of umbilicus. The
"injury was not followed by sickness, and the bowels remained"
confined. During the first two days 'pain struck across the
abdomen' when micturition was performed.
When the patient came under observation on the third day the
"condition was as follows:--Complains of little pain,"
discovered in him by the patient searcher. She insisted upon sitting
next to him and in holding his hand when it was not employed in
conveying food to his mouth. She was startled at first by the
"discussion upon the prisons most suitable for me, but quickly became"
reconciled to the idea of a temporary separation.
"""Colonel Dawson,"" she asked. ""When daddy is in prison, may I come and"
"see him sometimes. Mother and me?"" Dawson gripped his hair--we were"
"the maddest crew!--and replied. ""Of course you shall, Miss Jane, as"
"often as you like."""
"""Thank you, Colonel Dawson; you are a nice man. I love you. Now show"
"me the handcuffs in your pocket."""
For the second time that day poor Dawson blushed. He must have
regretted many times that he had mentioned to me those unfortunate
darbies. Now amid much laughter he was compelled to draw forth a
pretty shining pair of steel wristlets and permit Jane to put them on.
They were much too large for her; she could slip them on and off
"without unlocking; but as toys they were a delight. ""I shouldn't mind"
"being a prisoner,"" she declared, ""if dear Colonel Dawson took me up."""
"We were sitting upon the fire-guard after luncheon, dallying over our"
"coffee, when Jane demanded to be shown a real arrest. ""Show me how you"
"take up a great big man like Daddy."""
"Then came a surprise, which for a moment had so much in it of bitter"
realism that it drove the blood from my wife's cheeks. I could not
follow Dawson's movements; his hands flickered like those of a
"conjurer, there came a sharp click, and the handcuffs were upon my"
"wrists! I stared at them speechless, wondering how they got there,"
"and, looking up, met the coldly triumphant eyes of the detective. I"
"stay for his health's sake in the fresh sea-air; and when he yielded,"
"they prided themselves, after the manner of humans, on their own powers"
of persuasion. One morning Sir Oliver asked him point-blank:
“When are you going to Australia?”
"“I don't know,” said John. “There 's no immediate hurry.”"
"“I hope, dear,” said Julia, “you 'll give up the idea altogether.”"
"“Have n't I told you that I've made up my mind?” said John, in his gruff"
tone of finality.
“When are you going to break the news to Stella?” asked Sir Oliver.
"“Now,” said John, who had begun to loathe the mention of the doomful"
subject; and he stalked away--the three were strolling in the garden
"after breakfast--and went to Stella's room, and of course made no"
mention of it whatsoever.
"Then Herold came down for the week-end, and when he heard of Risca's"
pusillanimity he threw back his head and laughed for joy; for he knew
"that John would never go to Australia without telling Stellamaris, and"
also that if he could not tell Stellamaris in the first madness of his
"agony, he would never be able to tell her at all."
"And so, in fact, the fantastically absurd prevailed. Before the"
"Unwritten Law, mainly promulgated and enforced by Risca himself, which"
"guarded the sea-chamber against pain and sorrow, the driving Furies"
slunk with limp wing and nerveless claw. And one day Risca was surprised
"at finding himself undriven. Indeed, he was somewhat disconcerted. He"
fell into a bad temper. The Furies are highly aristocratic divinities
"The water’s dropping every minute, and we’ve got a mean stretch to cover"
before we strike the Penobscot. I’ll go back and hustle the rear
along----”
"He stopped abruptly, and whirled around as a voice, shrill and trembling"
"with passion, was raised behind him."
"“You’ll pay for that, you meddlin’ pup! I’ll teach you to go blowin’ up"
"folks’ property, an’ mighty near committin’ murder! I’ll show you you"
can’t play tricks on John Joyce an’ get away with it. That game might
"work with some, but it won’t----”"
Things happened so swiftly after that that even the men standing around
"were quite unable to understand exactly what was doing, and which of the"
two was really the one who started the trouble.
The instant Bob turned he saw that Joyce was either beside himself with
"rage, or giving a most astonishingly good imitation of that condition."
"His face was purple, with veins standing out on his forehead like cords."
His eyes glared with that combination of rage and hate which a badly
frightened man almost invariably feels for the cause of his mental
"disturbance. The automatic was leveled in his hand, and one finger"
trembled on the trigger.
"For a single instant Bainbridge stood rigid, every muscle suddenly"
tensing. Perhaps he read a hint of Joyce’s purpose in the fellow’s eye;
perhaps it was simply intuition which made him guess what was coming. At
"all events, suddenly, and without warning, he launched his lithe body"
through the air exactly as in the manner of the old forbidden flying
tackle.
"His shoulder struck Joyce’s knees, and the wicked, snapping shot of the"
"some sand-bags, trembling all over and feeling as though I was going to"
"choke. I waited for a long time, but nothing happened, so I got up and"
looked round. Lucky escape for us! There's a terrific hole by the Red
Cross and another one behind the bath-house. The third's in the next
field. Only two men hit. O'Neil's got it in the elbow--he's all right
for Blighty. Poor old Hartog's badly hurt--a frightful gash in the thigh
with the piece still in it. I hope he won't have to lose his leg.
"Christ, I'm glad it's all over--I wouldn't like to go through that"
"again."""
"There was silence for a while, but soon the silence was broken by the"
distant muttering of anti-aircraft fire.
"""Jesus Christ Almighty--'e's comin' again--O God, why can't 'e leave us"
"alone."""
We stood outside the marquee and anxiously watched the horizon. We heard
"a faint humming noise. It grew louder and louder until it became a deep,"
droning buzz that rose and fell in regular pulsation. Then
boom--boom--boom--three times the sullen roar of distant explosions
"sounded. Then there came the familiar rushing, whistling noise of a"
descending bomb. We flung ourselves down in the wet grass. I felt every
muscle in my body contract as though I were trying to make myself as
small as a pin point in expectation of the terrible moment. There was a
dull thud close by and I felt the earth vibrate. The bomb had fallen a
"few yards away, but had merely buried itself in the earth without"
exploding.
"There was no anti-aircraft fire, but the droning noise continued loudly,"
"rising and falling. Private Trotter, who was lying beside me, was"
drawing his breath in sharply between his lips. Our fear of impending
disaster was prolonged intolerably. The droning propeller seemed to be
"fain hope that some day I may see him again."""
"""You had speech with him?  You saw his manner and his port?  Tell"
"me—show me—how did he carry himself?"""
"Grey rose to his feet, laughing.  He humoured the whim of the old actor."
"He was not lacking in the histrionic gift, and threw himself into his"
"part with good will.  He uttered quick commands, as though to his"
"officers; he threw out his arms, as though directing one man here,"
"another there.  He recalled numbers of words spoken by the General, and"
these he reproduced faithfully and with an excellent imitation of
"Marlborough’s polished, courteous, yet commanding air.  Then he let his"
"face soften, and addressed the old man as he himself had been addressed,"
"with words of thanks and with promises of friendship.  Finally, throwing"
"off the mask, he broke into a laugh, and was astonished at the eager"
change which had come upon the Old Lion.
"""Boy!"" he cried, with a new access of energy, ""I trow I see for both of"
"us a way to fame and fortune."""
Grey’s eyes lighted as he eagerly asked his meaning.
"""That is soon told.  Have you heard how, after the victory of Blenheim,"
none could be found to hymn the praises of the great General till the
"poet Addison was introduced to notice, and penned his immortal lines?"
"Now, since the victory of Ramillies, I have burned with desire to show"
the world by somewhat more than verse alone the power and genius of
"England’s mighty soldier.  See here!"""
"The old man rose and crossed to his table, where he fetched from a"
"drawer a scroll covered with writing, which he put in the hands of his"
"companion.  Grey saw that it was a dialogue cast in dramatic form, and"
"And the people answered her, and told her who it was. And when she"
"heard, she fell down upon the road as one dead: for it was her father"
"and mother who had died yesterday, and it was their funeral train that"
"she saw. They were all dead now, husband and sons and father and mother;"
in all the world she was quite alone.
"So she went mad, for her trouble was more than she could bear. She threw"
"off all her clothes, and let down her long hair and wrapped it about her"
"naked body, and walked about raving."
"At last she came to where the Buddha was teaching, seated under a"
"fig-tree. She came up to the Buddha, and told him of her losses, and how"
she had no one left; and she demanded of the Buddha that he should
restore to her those that she had lost. And the Buddha had great
"compassion upon her, and tried to console her."
"'All die,' he said; 'it comes to everyone, king and peasant, animal and"
man. Only through many deaths can we obtain the Great Peace. All this
"sorrow,' he said, 'is of the earth. All this is passion which we must"
"get rid of, and forget before we reach heaven. Be comforted, my"
"daughter, and turn to the holy life. All suffer as you do. It is part of"
"our very existence here, sorrow and trouble without any end.'"
"But she would not be comforted, but demanded her dead of the Buddha."
"Then, because he saw it was no use talking to her, that her ears were"
"deaf with grief, and her eyes blinded with tears, he said to her that he"
would restore to her those who were dead.
"'You must go,' he said, 'my daughter, and get some mustard-seed, a pinch"
"of mustard-seed, and I can bring back their lives. Only you must get"
this seed from the garden of him near whom death has never come. Get
Johnson was strangely silent. He was wondering how his coming there
to-night had really come about. But he could find no solution to the
problem unless it was in response to that perverse instinct which
prompts us all at times to do the very thing which in our hearts we know
"to be wrong. The Girl, meanwhile, after a final creasing of the"
"neatly-folded cover, started for the cupboard, stopping on the way to"
pick up various articles which the wind had strewn about the room.
Flinging them quickly into the cupboard she now went over to the window
"and once more attempted to peer out into the night. But as before, it"
was of no avail. With a shrug she straightened the curtains at the
windows and started for the door. Her action seemed to quicken his
"decision, for, presently, with a gesture of resignation, he threw down"
his hat and coat on the table and said as if speaking to himself:
"""Well, it is Fate--my Fate that has always made the thing I shouldn't do"
"so easy."" And then, turning to the Girl, he added: ""Come, Girl, as you"
"say, if I can't go, I can't. But I know as I stand here that I'll never"
"give you up."""
The Girl looked puzzled.
"""Why, what do you mean?"""
"""I mean,"" began Johnson, pacing the floor slowly. Now he stopped by a"
"chair and pointed as though to the falling snow. ""Suppose we say that's"
an omen--that the old trail is blotted out and there is a fresh road.
"Would you take it with me a stranger, who says: From this day I mean to"
be all you'd have me. Would you take it with me far away from here and
"forever?"""
It did not take the Girl long to frame an answer. Taking Johnson's hand
she said with great feeling:
"business puzzles me, though you and your friends here seem to find it"
"devilish amusing. When I told the Chief Constable, the manager of the"
"shipyard, and the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Work that you were"
"the guilty party, they all roared. For some reason the Admiral and the"
shipyard manager kept winking at one another and gurgling till I
"thought they would have choked. What _is_ the joke?"""
"""If you are good, Dawson, I will tell you some day. This is November,"
and the _Rampagious_--the ship described on your paper--left for
"Portsmouth in August. In July--"" I broke off hurriedly, lest I should"
"tell my visitor too much. ""It has taken our friend who put the paper"
in the sardine tin three months to find out details of her. I could
"have done better than that, Dawson."""
"""That is just what the Admiral said, though he wouldn't explain why."""
"""The truth is, Dawson, that the Admiral and I both come from Devon,"
"the land of pirates, smugglers, and buccaneers. We are law breakers by"
instinct and family tradition. When we get an officer of the law on
"toast, we like to make the most of him. It is a playful little way of"
"ours which I am sure you will understand and pardon."""
"""You know, of course, that I am justified in arresting you. I have a"
"warrant and handcuffs in my pocket."""
"""Admirable man!"" I cried, with enthusiasm. ""You are, Dawson, the"
perfect detective. As a criminal I should be mightily afraid of you.
"But, as in my buttonhole I always wear the white flower which"
"proclaims to the world my blameless life, I am thoroughly enjoying"
this visit and our cosy chat beside the fire. Shall I telephone to my
office and say that I shall be unavoidably detained from duty for an
indefinite time? 'Detained' would be the strict truth and the _mot
"for you!"""
"Whereupon, though the connection of idea is not obvious, Rollo"
remembered the moment when he had faced the black muzzles of Cabrera's
"muskets in the chill of the morning, and the bitter regret which had"
"then arisen to his mind. Out there in the dark of the palace-garden,"
death fronted him as really though not perhaps so immediately. He
"resolved quickly that he should not have the same regret again, if the"
worst came to the worst. There was no one in the alcove where Concha had
"found him. The Queen-Regent had disappeared to her suite of rooms, and"
thither after a time Señor Muñoz had followed her. The rest were at that
moment being placed in their various posts by the Sergeant according to
Rollo's directions.
So he stooped quickly and kissed Concha upon the mouth.
It was strange. The girl's inevitable instinct on such matters seemed to
have deserted her. In a somewhat wide experience Concha could always
"tell to a second when an attempt of this kind was due. Most women can,"
"and if they are kissed it is because they want to be. (In which, sayeth"
"the Wise Man, is great wisdom!) A fire-alarm rings in their brain with"
"absolute certainty, giving them time to evite the conflagration by a"
healthy douche of cold water. But Rollo the Firebrand again proved
himself the Masterly Incalculable. Or else--but who could suspect
Concha?
"It is, again sayeth the Wise Man, the same with kicking a dog. The brute"
sees the kick coming before a muscle is in motion. He watches the eye of
his opponent and is forearmed. He vanisheth into space. But when Rollo
"interviewed an animal in this fashion, he kicked first and thought"
"afterwards. Hence no sign of his intention appeared in his eye, and the"
dog's yelp arrived almost as a surprise to himself.
"“Well,” Ned suggested, “we’d better wait here a little while, until"
"things get quieted down, and then make a break for the passage.”"
"“All right,” Jimmie said with an air of resignation, “I’ll crawl back"
here in the corner and try to imagine that I’m in charge of a pie wagon
on Third avenue. Perhaps I can dream a pie or two!”
The boy leaned back in an angle of the chamber and prepared to continue
the discussion regarding the different kinds of pies sold at the old
"Williams street corner. As he did so, the support of his back gave way,"
"his heels flew up in the air, and he tumbled all of a heap into a"
passage which seemed to begin at that corner of the room.
Hearing the fall and the exclamation of impatience which came from the
"boy’s lips, Ned turned on the electric and saw Jimmie lying on his back"
in a tunnel probably a yard in size each way. There were plenty of
indications that the tunnel had been cut through solid rock.
"As far as Ned could see; that is, as far as the eye of the electric"
carried; there were no breaks in it. Directly a chill breeze blew in
"from the opening, and the boy knew that the passage touched the surface"
of the mountain not far away.
"“Je-rusalem!” shouted Jimmie, “hold up the light and let me see if I’m"
all here. That’s the second tumble I’ve got in this consarned old hole
today.”
"“If every tumble you get in life brings such results as this,” Ned"
"declared, “you ought to go around the world looking for tumbles!”"
"“They hurt, just the same!” Jimmie declared, rubbing the back of his"
head. “I got an awful bump on my coco!”
"them."""
Here a knock at the door interrupted the conversation. The servant
"entered, bringing a note gorgeously crested and coroneted in gold."
"Villiers, to whom it was addressed, opened and read it."
"""What shall we do about this?"" he asked, when his man had retired. ""It"
is an invitation from the Duchess de la Santoisie. She asks us to go
"and dine with her next week,--a party of twenty--reception afterward. I"
"think we'd better accept,--what do you say?"""
"Alwyn roused himself from his reverie. ""Anything to please you, my dear"
"boy!"" he answered cheerfully--""But I haven't the faintest idea who the"
"Duchess de la Santoisie is!"""
"""No? ... Well, she's an Englishwoman who has married a French Duke. He"
"is a delightful old fellow, the pink of courtesy, and the model of"
"perfect egotism. A true Parisian, and of course an atheist,--a very"
"polished atheist, too, with a most charming reliance on his own"
infallibility. His wife writes novels which have a SLIGHT leaning
"toward Zolaism,--she is an extremely witty woman sarcastic, and"
"cold-blooded enough to be a female Robespierre, yet, on the whole,"
amusing as a study of what curious nondescript forms the feminine
"nature can adopt unto itself, if it chooses. She has an immense respect"
"for GENIUS,--mind, I say genius advisedly, because she really is one of"
those rare few who cannot endure mediocrity. Everything at her house is
"the best of its kind, and the people she entertains are the best of"
theirs. Her welcome of you will be at any rate a sincerely admiring
"one,--and as I think, in spite of your desire for quiet, you will have"
"to show yourself somewhere, it may as well be there."""
"Alwyn looked dubious, and not at all resigned to the prospect of"
"that as a compliment.  But at my age--well, it is really cruel of you."""
"""Intelligence is more interesting to a diplomat than a pretty face,"" I"
"responded quickly.  ""And there is certainly no more intelligent woman in"
"all Paris than the Baronne de Chalencon."""
"She bowed stiffly, and her wrinkled face, which bore visible traces of"
"poudre orchidee and touches of the hare's-foot, puckered up into a"
simpering smile.
"""Well, and what else?"" she asked.  ""These speeches you have apparently"
"prepared for some pretty woman you expected to meet here to-night, but,"
"since she has not kept the appointment, you are practising them upon"
"me."""
"""No,"" I said, ""I really protest against that, Baronne.  A woman is never"
"too old for a man to pay her compliments."""
"We had strolled into a cool ante-room, and were sitting together upon"
"one of the many seats placed beneath clumps of palms and flowers, the"
only light being from a hundred tiny electric lamps hung overhead in the
trees.  The perfect arrangement of those ante-rooms of the Salle des
"Fetes on the nights of the official receptions is always noteworthy, and"
"after the heat, music, and babel of tongues in the grand salon it was"
"cool, quiet, and refreshing there."
"By holding her regular salon, where everybody who was anybody made it a"
"point to be seen, the Baronne had acquired in Paris a unique position."
Her fine house in the Avenue des Champs Elysees was the centre of a
"smart and fashionable set, and she herself made a point of being versed"
in all the latest gossip and scandal of the French capital.  She
"scandalised nobody, nor did she seek to throw mud at her enemies.  She"
willing to give their highest degrees to encourage it.
"83,654. (Mr. Macdonald). The witness did not think it was necessary to"
"have a non-Indian element in the service in order to stiffen it up, but"
he accepted the principle that there should be a certain small
proportion of non-Indians.
"83,655. The title of professor at a college or University should carry"
"with it dignity and honour, and ought not to be so freely used as at"
present. All he asked was that it should not be abolished at the expense
of such Indians as were doing as good work as their European colleagues.
"83,656. If the Calcutta university continued to develop its teaching"
"side, there would be no objection to recruiting University Professors"
from aided colleges. This would have certain advantages.
"83,657. (Mr. Fisher). The witness desired to secure for India Europeans"
who had European reputations in their different branches of study. If it
"was necessary to go outside India or England to procure good men, he"
would prefer to go to Germany. This was the practice in America where
they were annexing all the great intellects of Europe.
"83,658. The witness would like to see India entering the world movement"
in the advance and march of knowledge. It was of the highest importance
that there should be an intellectual atmosphere in India. It would be
of advantage if there were many Indians in the Educational Service. For
"they came more in contact with the people, and influenced their"
"intellectual activity. Besides, on retirement they would live in India"
and their life experience would be at their countrymen's service.
"83,659. There was very little in the complaint made in certain quarters"
that the work of the Professors in the colleges in India was hampered by
"""'Anything that I should ask,' I replied."
"""'Ah, I see, I see! Should ask? I take it there are certain sacrifices"
"you would not ask,' returned the king. 'We here in France would say that"
"your position was Quixotic. However, your King Charles is a weak fool,"
"easily imposed upon. Is the lady quick and resourceful in expedients,"
"calm and thoughtful in emergencies, and silent on great occasions?'"
"""To all of which I answered, 'Yes.'"
"""'Surely the lady is not La Belle Jennings?' asked the king."
"""'Yes,' I replied."
"""'In that case you are the very man I want, and your lady-love can help"
"me buy Dunkirk. It is easy to lead a fool to do the wrong thing, and I'm"
"sure La Belle Jennings will find a way to gain her end and ours. If,"
"through her, you induce King Charles to sell Dunkirk to me on my own"
"terms, I'll make you its governor and a rich man. I'll put you in a"
"position to marry this paragon, Mam'selle Jennings, if, as I take it,"
lack of fortune is all that stands between you. I do not mind telling you
now that De Grammont had given me full information concerning the king's
view of La Belle Jennings and your relations to her before I wrote my
"first letter, inviting you to visit me.'"
"""I am loath to undertake so mean an office as that of inducing King"
"Charles to sell an English city, but I cannot save Dunkirk, and I may"
profit by helping what I cannot prevent. So I beg you broach the subject
"to Frances, cautioning her for me to take no risk, and if she is willing"
"to use and to hoodwink the man who would not hesitate to take her life,"
"let me know, and I shall write to you again with further instructions."
asked.
"""Nay,"" said Sergeant Cardono; ""but when I am required to guide a party"
"secretly to San Ildefonso, where the court of the Queen-Regent is"
"sojourning, it does not require great penetration to see the general"
"nature of the service upon which I am engaged!"""
Rollo recovered himself.
"""You have not yet told me what you have discovered,"" he said,"
expectantly.
"""No,"" replied the Sergeant with great composure--""that can wait."""
For little Concha was approaching; and though he had limitless
expectations of the good influence of that young lady upon the military
"career of his officer, he did not judge it prudent to communicate"
"intelligence of moment in her presence. Wherein for once he was wrong,"
"since that pretty head of the Andalucian beauty, for all its clustering"
"curls, was full of the wisest and most far-seeing counsel--indeed, more"
to be trusted in a pinch than the _juntas_ of half-a-dozen provinces.
"But the Sergeant considered that when a girl was pretty and aware of it,"
she had fulfilled her destiny--save as it might be in the making of
military geniuses. Therefore he remained silent as the grave so long as
"Concha stayed. Observing this, the girl asked a simple question and then"
"moved off a little scornfully, only remarking to herself: ""As if I could"
"not make him tell me whenever I get him by himself!"""
"She referred (it is needless to state) not to Sergeant Cardono, but to"
"his commanding officer, Señor Don Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the"
self-sufficient shire of Fife.
"He gave way to much emotion. Vivie, though still dazed with the"
"reverberating horror of Edith Cavell's execution, tried to regain"
her mind balance and thank him for the kindness he had shown them.
But it was now necessary to see her mother who might also be
undergoing a shock. As she walked up to their bedroom she reflected
that the departure of von Giesselin would have to be followed by
their own exile to some other lodging. They would share in his
disgrace.
The next morning in fact the Belgian manager of the hotel with many
regrets gave them a month's warning. The hotel would be required for
some undefined need of the German Government and he had been told no
one could be lodged there who was not furnished with a permit from
the Kommandantur.
For three weeks Vivie sought in vain for rooms. Every suitable place
was either full or else for reasons not given they were refused. She
"was reduced to eating humble pie, to writing once more to Gräfin von"
Stachelberg and imparting the dilemma in which they were placed. Did
this kind lady know where a lodging could be obtained? She herself
"could put up with any discomfort, but her mother was ill. If she"
"could help them, Vivie would humbly beg her pardon for her angry"
letter of three weeks ago and resume her hospital work. Minna von
Stachelberg made haste to reply that there were some things better
not discussed in writing: if Vivie could come and see her at six one
"evening, when she had a slight remission from work--"
"Vivie went. Out of hearing, Gräfin von Stachelberg--who, however, to"
"facilitate intercourse, begged Vivie to call her ""Minna,""--""We may"
"all be dead, my dear, before long of blood-poisoning, bombs from"
"on the one side, and accuracy on the other. The true Fairy Tale should"
be unhampered by any compromise of probability even--the scientific
representation should be sufficiently marvellous along its own lines to
need no supernatural aid. Both appeal to the imagination in different
ways.
"As an exception to this kind of mixture, I should quote “The Honey Bee,"
"and Other Stories,” translated from the Danish of Evald by C. G. Moore"
Smith. There is a certain robustness in these stories dealing with the
"inexorable laws of Nature, though some of them will appear hard to the"
child; but they will be of interest to all teachers.
Perhaps the worst element in choice of stories is that which insists
upon the moral detaching itself and explaining the story. In “Alice in
"Wonderland” the Duchess says, “‘And the moral of _that_ is: Take care"
of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.’ ‘How fond
"she is of finding morals in things,’ thought Alice to herself.” (This"
gives the point of view of the child.)
"The following is a case in point, found in a rare old print in the"
British Museum:
“Jane S. came home with her clothes soiled and hands badly torn. ‘Where
"have you been?’ asked her mother. ‘I fell down the bank near the mill,’"
"said Jane, ‘and I should have been drowned if Mr. M. had not seen me"
and pulled me out.’ 'Why did you go so near the edge of the brink?‘
"'There was a pretty flower there that I wanted, and I only meant to"
"take one step, but I slipped and fell down.’ Moral: Young people often"
"take but one step in sinful indulgence (Poor Jane!), but they fall"
into soul-destroying sins. There is a sinful pleasure which they wish
to enjoy. They can do it by a single act of sin (the heinous act of
"picking a flower!). They do it; but that act leads to another, and they"
CHAPTER XVI
THE CAMBRIAN
"THE PALEOZOIC ERA. The second volume of the geological record,"
"called the Paleozoic (Greek, PALAIOS, ancient; ZOE, life), has"
come down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first
"volume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the"
globe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the
"earlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed"
"have suffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and"
"have been less widely buried from view, than the strata of the"
pre-Cambrian groups. By means of their fossils we can correlate
the formations of widely separated regions from the beginning of
"the Paleozoic on, and can therefore trace some outline of the"
history of the continents.
"Paleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured"
"by the thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions"
of years. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms
were very great. It is according to the successive stages in the
advance of life that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five
"systems,--the CAMBRIAN, the ORDOVICIAN, the SILURIAN, the"
"DEVONIAN, and the CARBONIFEROUS. On the same basis the first three"
"systems are grouped together as the older Paleozoic, because they"
alike are characterized by the dominance of the invertebrates;
"while the last two systems are united in the later Paleozoic, and"
"83,664. (Mr. Chaubal). He did not know whether the salaries he had"
"mentioned as having been paid in Japan, New Zealand and Yale were on an"
incremental scale or not.
"83,665. There was a difference of kind between the way in which"
students were taught in schools and the way in which they were taught in
colleges. He did not agree with the witnesses who had said that during
the first year or two years at college the instruction given was similar
to that given in a school. It was very difficult to disprove or to prove
such statements. There would be no advantage in keeping boys to a school
course up the intermediate standard and making the colleges deal with
only those students who had passed the intermediate examination.
"83,666. (Sir Theodore Morison). There should be one scale of pay for all"
"persons in the higher educational department. The rate of salary, Rs."
"200 rising to Rs. 1,500 per month, was suitable, subject to the proviso"
"that the man of great distinction, instead of beginning at the lowest"
"rate of pay, should start some where in the middle of the list, say, at"
Rs. 400 or Rs. 500. He would make no reference in regard to Europeans or
Indians in that respect. In effect this no doubt amounted to making
Indians eligible for higher educational posts both by direct recruitment
and by promotion.
"83,667. He would not favour the handing over of all the Government"
institutions in Bengal to private agencies; there must be one or two
Government colleges in order to keep up the standard. He should be
sorry to see the Government dissociating itself from one of its primary
"duties, which was education."
"83,668. Privately managed Colleges paid less in salary than the"
Government Colleges. They paid about the same as was given in the
in his repertory.
"""Oh, come, old chap, I bet he didn't,"" observed Captain Heseltine."
"""We've seen him, you know."""
Duncombe laughed good-humouredly.
"""At any rate he made Kilshaw look a little green, and some of the people"
behind called out 'Shame!' and got themselves sat upon. Then they had
Medland up again and twisted him a bit about his acquaintance with
"Gaspard; but the coroner didn't seem to think there was anything in it,"
"and they found murder against Gaspard, and rang down the curtain. And"
when we got outside there was a bit of a rumpus. They hooted Kilshaw and
"cheered Medland, and yelled like mad when a dashed pretty girl drove up"
"in a pony-cart and carried him off. Altogether it wasn't half bad."""
"""Glad you enjoyed yourself,"" observed Captain Heseltine. ""If it amuses"
strangers to see our leading celebrities mixed up in a murder and other
"distressing affairs, it's the least we can do to see that they get it."""
The Captain's facetiousness fell on unappreciative ears. Most of Mr.
Duncombe's audience were too alive to the serious side of the matter to
enjoy it. To them it was another and a very striking scene in the fight
"which had long gone on between Medland and Kilshaw, and had taken a"
fresh and fiercer impetus from the well-remembered day when Medland had
spoken his words about Kilshaw and his race-horses. Nobody doubted that
"Kilshaw had kept this man Benyon, or Benham, as a secret weapon, and"
that the murder had only made the disclosure come earlier. Kilshaw's
"reputation suffered somewhat in the minds of the scrupulous, but his"
"partisans would hear of no condemnation. They said, as he had said, that"
in dealing with a man like Medland it would have been folly not to use
"the weapons fate, or the foe himself by his own misdeeds, offered. As"
"Queen-Regent,"" whispered the portress, Rebeca, pointing upwards; ""but"
"promise me to commit no murder or do any hurt to the little maid."""
"""Be quiet, woman,"" muttered Rollo, more roughly than was his wont; ""we"
"are come to save both of them from worse than death. Sergeant Cardono,"
"bring the ladder!"""
"The Sergeant disappeared, and it was not many seconds before he was back"
again adjusting its hooks to the side of an iron balcony in front of one
of the lighted rooms. Almost before he had finished Rollo would have
"mounted, impetuously as was his custom, but the Sergeant held him back"
by the arm.
"""I crave your forgiveness,"" he whispered, ""but if you will pardon me"
"saying so, I have much more experience in such matters than you. Permit"
me in this single case to precede you! We know not what or whom we may
"meet with above!"""
"Nevertheless, though the Sergeant mounted first, Rollo followed so"
closely that his hands upon the rounds of the ladder were more than once
in danger of being trodden upon by the Sergeant's half-boots.
Presently they stood together on the iron balcony and peered within. A
tall dark man leaned against an elaborately carved mantelpiece
indolently stroking his glossy black whiskers. A lady arrayed in a
"dressing-gown of pink silk reaching to her feet was seated on a chair,"
"and submitting restlessly enough to the hands of her maid, who was"
"arranging her hair for the night, in the intervals of a violent but"
somewhat one-sided quarrel which was proceeding between the pair.
Every few moments the lady would start from her seat and with her eyes
flashing fire she would advance towards the indolent dandy by the
fail to appreciate the courtesy and consideration which he consistently
"showed her now. His patience with Captain Dove, a trying companion at"
"the best of times and doubly troublesome idle, more than once made her"
wonder whether he could be the same Jasper Slyne she had known on the
_Olive Branch_. Prosperity seemed to have improved him almost beyond
recognition.
He had a cabin at her disposal on the Calais-Dover steamer but she
"stayed on deck throughout the brief passage, glad to breathe the salt"
"sea-air again, while he entertained her with descriptions of London and"
she watched the twinkling lights that were guiding her home.
"And then came London itself, at last, somewhat grey, and cold, and"
disconsolate-looking on a wet winter morning.
"But after breakfast in a cosy suite at the Savoy, a blink of sunshine"
along the Embankment helped to better that first hasty impression. And
then Slyne took Captain Dove and her in a taxicab along the thronged and
bustling Strand to Mr. Jobling's office in Chancery Lane.
They got out in front of a dingy building not very far from Cursitor
"Street. It was raining again, and Sallie, looking up and down the"
"narrow, turbid thoroughfare, felt glad that she did not need to live"
there.
"Indoors, the atmosphere was scarcely less depressing. A dismal passage"
"led toward a dark stairway, up which they had to climb flight after"
"flight to reach at last a dusty, ill-smelling, gas-lighted room,"
"inhabited only by a shabby, shock-headed hobbledehoy of uncertain age"
"and unprepossessing appearance, perched on a preposterously high stool"
"at a still higher desk, behind a cage-like partition."
"determining to get on, but uneasy at the expense, for monetary conditions"
"were ever more embarrassed. At home, she practised steadily and worked"
hard at composition. She finished several songs and studies during the
"spring and summer, and left still more unfinished.  Monsieur Harmost was"
"tolerant of these efforts, seeming to know that harsh criticism or"
"disapproval would cut her impulse down, as frost cuts the life of"
"flowers.  Besides, there was always something fresh and individual in her"
things.  He asked her one day:
"""What does your husband think of these?"""
Gyp was silent a moment.
"""I don't show them to him."""
She never had; she instinctively kept back the knowledge that she
"composed, dreading his ruthlessness when anything grated on his nerves,"
"and knowing that a breath of mockery would wither her belief in herself,"
"frail enough plant already.  The only person, besides her master, to whom"
she confided her efforts was--strangely enough--Rosek.  But he had
"surprised her one day copying out some music, and said at once: ""I knew."
"I was certain you composed.  Ah, do play it to me!  I am sure you have"
"talent.""  The warmth with which he praised that little ""caprice"" was"
"surely genuine; and she felt so grateful that she even played him others,"
"and then a song for him to sing.  From that day, he no longer seemed to"
"her odious; she even began to have for him a certain friendliness, to be"
"a little sorry, watching him, pale, trim, and sphinx-like, in her"
"drawing-room or garden, getting no nearer to the fulfilment of his"
"desire.  He had never again made love to her, but she knew that at the"
least sign he would.  His face and his invincible patience made him
pathetic to her.  Women such as Gyp cannot actively dislike those who
admire them greatly.  She consulted him about Fiorsen's debts.  There
"in his gorgeous chariot, driving furiously along the road which led to"
St. Albans.
"His boon companions, thus left to their own devices, went over to the"
"spot where the strange thing had befallen at the race, and where the"
country folk had gathered with shakings of the head and questionings
"beneath their breath; and there, plain for all men to see, was the"
"yawning hole with the open trap hanging down, and the marks of the heavy"
"fall of the good horse, whose escape with whole bones was little short"
of a miracle.
"An old countryman was holding forth to a knot of eager questioners, now"
swelled by Lord Sandford’s friends.
"""I mind well when there was a house here; ’twas pulled down when I were"
a young chap.  And the well must ha’ bin hereabouts.  That old trap has
"been in the ground ever since I can mind; but there be no water now, and"
"the sand has pretty nigh silted it up.  I’ve a-looked in many a time,"
and the hole gets less and less deep.  When I saw them setting up the
"brushwood and things here, I made sure they had covered the trap well."
"I walked about it, but never saw sign of it.  If I’d a thought of"
"danger, I’d ha’ told one of the fine folks.  I suppose they never seed"
it.  The grass and stuff do grow long and rank this time o’ year.  And
"so the gentleman’s horse trod on it, and it gave way with him.  Mercy"
"me, but ’tis a wonder he didn’t break his neck then and there!"""
"Lord Sandford’s comrades looked each other in the eyes, and drew a"
little away.  All knew that something strange had passed upon him of
"late, and that there was some rupture betwixt him and the man who had"
but lately accused him of seeking to compass his death.
"""Did he know?""  ""Was it plot or plan of his?"" whispered one and another;"
"the German occupation lasted, or during that time receive a penny in"
compensation for the sequestration of the property.
The notes for the hundred thousand francs therefore were carefully
concealed in Mrs. Warren's bedroom at the Hotel Impérial and Vivie
for a few months afterwards felt slightly easier in her mind as to
"the immediate future; for, as a further resource, there were also"
the jewels and plate at the bank.
"They dared hope for nothing from Villa Beau-séjour. Von Giesselin,"
"after more entreaty than Vivie cared to make, had allowed them with"
a special pass and his orderly as escort to go in a military motor
to the Villa in the month of April in order that they might bring
away the rest of their clothes and personal effects of an easily
transportable nature. But the visit was a heart-breaking
disappointment. Their reception was surly; the place was little else
than a barrack of disorderly soldiers and insolent officers. Any
search for clothes or books was a mockery. Nothing was to be found
in the chests of drawers that belonged to them; only stale food and
unnameable horrors or military equipment articles. The garden was
trampled out of recognition. There had been a beautiful vine in the
"greenhouse. It was still there, but the first foliage of spring hung"
"withered and russet coloured. The soldiers, grinning when Vivie"
"noticed this, pointed to the base of the far spreading branches. It"
"had been sawn through, and much of the glass of the greenhouse"
deliberately smashed.
"On their way back, Mrs. Warren, who was constantly in tears,"
descried waiting by the side of the road the widow of their
"farmer-neighbour, Madame Oudekens. She asked the orderly that they"
might stop and greet her. She approached. Mrs. Warren got out of the
car so that she might more privately talk to her in Flemish. Since
"""If your Lordship means to say that I wish to withdraw dishonorably from"
"my engagement with your sister, I crave the privilege of telling you that"
"you lie!"""
"I never was more calm in my life, and my words brought a cold smile to"
Hamilton's lips.
"""My friend De Grammont will have the honor of waiting on you to-morrow"
"morning,"" he answered, bowing politely."
"""I shall be delighted to see his Grace,"" I answered. ""Good night, my"
"lord!"""
Here was a solution of my problem in so far as it concerned my engagement
"with Mary Hamilton, for if I killed her brother, she would not marry"
"me, and if he killed me, I could not marry her. The fact that a gleam"
of joy came to me because of my unexpected release caused me to feel
"that I was a coward not to have broken the engagement in an honorable,"
straightforward manner rather than to have seized this opportunity to
force a duel upon her brother. It is true I had not sought the duel
deliberately and had not thought it possible one second before uttering
the word that made it necessary. Still it was my act that brought it
"about, and I felt that I had taken an unmanly course."
After leaving Count Anthony I walked across the room to where Mary
was standing at the outer edge of a circle of ladies and gentlemen who
"surrounded De Grammont, listening to a narrative in broken English, of"
"his adventures, fancied or real, I know not which, but interesting,"
and all of a questionable character.
"When I spoke to Mary, she turned and gave me her hand. I had not"
expected the least display of emotion on her part; therefore I was not
THE CREW OF THE _KAMMA FUNDER_.
"The stars of European science, who had been shining in a wonderful"
"constellation over Quebec, were just about to leave Canada in that"
"well-known comfortable liner, the _Nipigon_, when a most annoying"
"thing happened.  The cattle-ship _Abbitibbe_, never famous at any"
"time for minding her helm, got her steam steering gear jammed as she"
"was passing the _Nipigon_, and took a wide sheer to port when she"
should have altered her course to starboard.  The peaceful
"preparations of the passenger boat were broken up, and her crew"
"received the wild charge of the _Abbitibbe_ with curses, which,"
"though effectual in heating the atmosphere, were no use as a fender."
"The _Nipigon_ was cut down to the water's edge, and the scientific"
lights of Europe were much put out.  They hurried ashore in the most
"irregular and unscientific manner, and, having sent others for their"
"baggage, began to make preparations for going to New York, as no"
other good passenger boat was leaving the St. Lawrence for a week.
"But Nature, possibly out of revenge for the unseemly curiosity"
"evinced by all men of science, was beforehand with them."
"Misfortunes, as was once observed by an intelligent, if pessimistic,"
"anthropoid ape, never come singly.  It was the twelfth of November,"
"and a sudden blizzard, bringing all the snow it could carry, broke up"
communication with the south.  If the men of science were to keep
"their appointments with their universities, it was necessary to sail"
from Canada at once.  They shipped themselves under protest upon the
"_Nemagosenda_, of 2,900 tons register, which was little better than a"
"tramp, and was commanded by Captain Joseph Prowse."
"He was never short of money, for he had a purse which was never empty."
"He never was short of food, for he had a table-cloth on which, as soon"
"as he spread it, he found all he wanted to eat and drink. And, besides,"
he had a magic wishing cap. When he put it on he could wish himself
"wherever he wanted, and there he would be that very moment."
"There was only one thing that he lacked: he had no wife, and he was"
gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to
make haste.
"As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it occurred to him to wish"
himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world. No
sooner had he thought of it than he was there. And it was a land which
"he had never yet seen, and a city in which he had never yet been. And"
"the king had a daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld her"
"like, and he wanted to have her on the spot. But she would have nothing"
"to do with him, and was very haughty."
"Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside himself that he could"
no longer be where she was not. So he took his magic cap and wished
"himself into the castle. He wanted to say good-by, so he said. And she"
"laid her hand in his. ""I wish we were far beyond the end of the world!"""
"said the youth, and there they were. But the king's daughter wept, and"
begged to be allowed to go home again. He could have all the gold and
"silver in the castle in return. ""I have money enough for myself,"" said"
"the youth, and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about. He"
"could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food, and drink the"
"finest wines, said she. ""I have enough to eat and drink myself,"" said"
"the youth. ""See, you can sit down at the table,"" said he, and at once he"
spread his table-cloth. And there stood a table covered with the best
one might wish; and the king himself ate no better.
other work which might help their country in its need.
And Bertie Adams?
When he realized that his beloved and revered Miss Warren was shut
"off from escape in Belgium, could not be heard of, could not be got"
"at and rescued, he went nearly off his nut.... He reviewed during a"
succession of sleepless nights what course he might best pursue. His
age was about thirty-two. He might of course enlist in the army. But
"though very patriotic, his allegiance lay first at the feet of Vivie"
"Warren. If he entered the army, he might be sent anywhere but to the"
Belgian frontier; and even if he got near Belgium he could not dart
off to rescue Vivie without becoming a deserter. So he came speedily
"to the conclusion that the most promising career he could adopt,"
"having regard to his position in life and lack of resources, was to"
"volunteer for foreign service under the Y.M.C.A., and express the"
strongest possible wish to be employed as near Belgium as was
"practicable. So that by the end of September, 1914, Bertie was"
"serving out cocoa and biscuits, writing paper and cigarettes, hot"
coffee and sausages and cups of bovril to exhausted or resting
"soldiers in the huts of the Y.M.C.A., near Ypres. Alternating with"
"these services, he was, like other Y.M.C.A. men in the same district"
"and at the same time, acting as stretcher bearer to bring in the"
"wounded, as amateur chaplain with the dying, as amateur surgeon with"
"the wounded, as secretary to some distraught officer in high command"
whose clerks had all been killed; and in any other capacity if
called upon. But always with the stedfast hope and purpose that he
might somehow reach and rescue Vivie Warren.
"“She does n't want anything at all,” said the matron, and the girl's"
eyelids fluttered. “She's being spoiled too much as it is already.”
"John bent his heavy brows on the woman. She spoke not shrewishly, not"
"unkindly, merely with lack of love and understanding. He repressed the"
bitter retort that rose to his lips. But at the same time a picture rose
"before him of another sick-room, a dainty sea-chamber open to sun"
"and sky, where pillows of down were not forbidden, where flowers and"
"exquisite colours and shapes gladdened the eye, where Love, great and"
"warm and fulfilling, hovered over the bed. No gulls with round, yellow"
eyes came to the windows of this whitewashed prison with messages
"from the world of air and sea; no Exquisite Auntship, no Great High"
"Favourite, no Lord High Constable, executed their high appointed"
functions; no clock with chimes like a bell swung in a sea-cave told
the hours to this orphan child of misery. He realized in an odd way
"that Stellamaris, too, was an orphan. And he remembered, from the awful"
"evidence, that this child was just over fifteen--Stella's age."
Again rose the picture of the cherished one in her daintily ribboned
"dressing-jacket, as filmy and unsubstantial as if made of sea-foam,"
"with her pure, happy face, her mysterious, brown pools of eyes, her"
hair lovingly brushed to caressing softness; and he looked down on Unity
"Blake. Man though he was, the bit of clean sail-cloth that did duty as a"
nightgown moved his compassion.
He did his best to talk with her awhile; but it was a one-sided
"conversation, as the child could reply only in monosyllables. The matron"
"fidgeted impatiently, and he said good-bye. Her wistful glance followed"
him to the door. Outside he turned.
“There is just one thing I want to say to her.”
Monsieur Edouard Harmost inhabited the ground floor of a house in the
Marylebone Road.  He received his pupils in a large back room overlooking
"a little sooty garden.  A Walloon by extraction, and of great vitality,"
"he grew old with difficulty, having a soft corner in his heart for women,"
"and a passion for novelty, even for new music, that was unappeasable."
Any fresh discovery would bring a tear rolling down his mahogany cheeks
"into his clipped grey beard, the while he played, singing wheezily to"
"elucidate the wondrous novelty; or moved his head up and down, as if"
pumping.
"When Gyp was shown into this well-remembered room he was seated, his"
"yellow fingers buried in his stiff grey hair, grieving over a pupil who"
"had just gone out.  He did not immediately rise, but stared hard at Gyp."
"""Ah,"" he said, at last, ""my little old friend!  She has come back! Now"
"that is good!""  And, patting her hand he looked into her face, which had"
"a warmth and brilliance rare to her in these days.  Then, making for the"
"mantelpiece, he took therefrom a bunch of Parma violets, evidently"
"brought by his last pupil, and thrust them under her nose.  ""Take them,"
take them--they were meant for me.  Now--how much have you forgotten?
"Come!""  And, seizing her by the elbow, he almost forced her to the piano."
"""Take off your furs.  Sit down!"""
"And while Gyp was taking off her coat, he fixed on her his prominent"
"brown eyes that rolled easily in their slightly blood-shot whites, under"
squared eyelids and cliffs of brow.  She had on what Fiorsen called her
"""humming-bird"" blouse--dark blue, shot with peacock and old rose, and"
looked very warm and soft under her fur cap.  Monsieur Harmost's stare
"seemed to drink her in; yet that stare was not unpleasant, having in it"
only the rather sad yearning of old men who love beauty and know that
their time for seeing it is getting short.
"the probability of an adventure with tolerant amusement, such was his"
inherent love of it and so developed was his capacity for
"""playing-true,"" that he sometimes made me think almost anything might"
"turn up. I was quite unaware that my mother had written him, or that he,"
"in return, had promised to keep her fully advised of my improvement--a"
state which was already beginning.
"""I carn't see how you help talking of it, sir--all that gas, and liquid"
"fire, and bursting shells,"" Gates stared at him in perplexity."
"""It's an effort, but I refuse to turn phonograph like some of the old"
"timers--not that I love 'em any less for it, Lord knows!"" Then he began"
"to laugh, and turned to me, adding: ""One of the first things I did after"
getting home was to drop in on a very dear gentleman who's been a friend
"of our family since the Ark. He came at me with open arms, crying:"
"'Well, Thomas, sit right down and tell me about your experiences!' I"
side-tracked that--for I hate the word. We didn't go over for
"_experiences_! But he wouldn't be denied. 'Try to think,' he commanded."
"'Why, Thomas, old as I am, I remember when Stonewall Jackson struck that"
"brilliant blow----' and you can shoot me for a spy, Jack, if he didn't"
keep me there five hours while he fought the entire Civil War! No
"sir-ee! After tonight, never again!"""
"But Tommy's talk, to which the crew listened in rapt attention, consumed"
"nearer six than two, or even five hours. These men were hungry for"
authentic first-hand information--being too old to have sought it for
themselves.
It must not be inferred that the _Whim's_ crew consisted of the ancient
and decrepit. More than once my father had said that if ever he should
get in a tight place there was no band of six he would rather have at
"his back than this one headed by Gates; nor did he except Pete, the"

"The Girl smiled at the emphasis on the last word, for she knew that it"
"referred to her. Furthermore, she had divined pretty well what had been"
"his thoughts concerning his old life; but, being essentially a woman of"
"action and not words, she said nothing."
A moment or so later he asked her to read to him. The Girl looked as she
might have looked if he had asked her to go to the moon.
"Notwithstanding, she got up and, presently, returned with a lot of old"
"school-books, which she solemnly handed over for his inspection."
The invalid smiled at the look of earnestness on the Girl's face.
"""Not these?"" he gently inquired. ""Where is the Dante you were telling me"
"about?"""
Once more the Girl went over to the book-shelf; when she came back she
"handed him a volume, which he glanced over carefully before showing her"
the place where he wished her to begin to read to him.
At first the Girl was embarrassed and stumbled badly. But on seeing that
he seemed not to notice it she gained courage and acquitted herself
"creditably, at least, so she flattered herself, for she could detect, as"
"she looked up from time to time, no expression other than pleasure on"
"his face. It may be surmised, though, that Johnson had not merely chosen"
"a page at random; on the contrary, when the book was in his hand he had"
"quickly found the lines which the Girl had, so to say, paraphrased, and"
"he was intensely curious to see how they would appeal to her. But now,"
"apparently, she saw nothing in the least amusing in them, nor in other"
"passages fully as sentimental. In fact, no comment of any kind was"
"forthcoming from her--though Johnson was looking for it and, to tell the"
"truth, was somewhat disappointed--when she read that Dante had probably"
never spoken more than twice to Beatrice and his passion had no other
merely repeated what was whispered to her; hence a chat with her was
"always interesting to one who, like myself, was paid to keep his ears"
open and report from time to time the direction of the political wind.
"Tournier, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his wife were her"
most intimate friends; hence she was frequently aware of facts which
"were of considerable importance to us.  Indeed, once or twice her"
friendliness for myself had caused her to drop hints which had been of
the greatest use to Lord Barmouth in the conduct of his difficult
diplomacy at that time when the boulevard journals were screaming
"against England and the filthy prints were caricaturing Her Majesty,"
with intent to insult.  Even the _Figaro_--the moderate organ of the
French Foreign Office--had lost its self-control in the storm of abuse
"following the Fashoda incident, and had libelled and maligned ""les"
"English.""  I therefore seized the opportunity for a chat with the"
"wizen-faced old lady, who seemed in a particularly good-humour, and"
deftly turned the conversation into the political channel.
"""Now, tell me, Baronne,"" I said, after we had been chatting some little"
"time, and I had learnt more than one important fact regarding the"
"intentions of Tournier, ""what is your opinion regarding the occupation"
"of Ceuta?"""
"She glanced at me quickly, as though surprised that I should be aware of"
what she had believed to be an entire secret.
"""Of Ceuta?"" she echoed.  ""And what do you at your Embassy know regarding"
"it?"""
"""We've heard a good deal,"" I laughed."
"""No doubt you've heard a good deal that is untrue,"" the clever old lady"
another without a word spoken. There was no sign of surprise or fear
"in his face, just a queer little smile. Suddenly he moved, made a"
"snatch at the front of his overalls, and put something into his mouth."
"I guessed what it was, but did not try to stop him; it was the best"
"thing that he could do."""
Dawson stopped and pulled savagely at his cigar. He jabbed the end
"with his knife, though the cigar was drawing perfectly well, and gave"
forth a deep growl which might have been a curse or a sob.
"""Have you ever watched an electric bulb fade away when the current is"
"failing?"" he asked. ""The film pales down from glowing white to dull"
"red, which gets fainter and fainter, little by little, till nothing"
but the memory of it lingers on your retina. His eyes went out exactly
"like that bulb. They faded and faded out of his face, which still kept"
"up that queer, twisted smile. I've seen them ever since; wherever I"
"turn. I shall be glad of that bout of influenza, and shall begin it"
with a stiff dose of veronal.... When the light had nearly gone out of
"his eyes and he was rocking on his feet, I spoke for the first time. I"
"spoke loud too. 'Good-bye,' I called out; 'I'm Dawson.' He heard me,"
for his eyes answered with a last flash; then they faded right out and
he fell flat on the steel deck. He had died on his feet; his will kept
"him upright to the end; that was a Man. He lived a Man's life, doing"
"what he thought his duty, and he died a Man's death.... I blew my"
whistle twice; up clattered a Sergeant with the Marine Guard and
stopped where that figure on the deck barred their way. 'Get a
"stretcher,' I said, 'and send for the doctor. But it won't be any use."
"The man's dead.' The Sergeant asked sharply for my report, and sent"
"off a couple of men for a stretcher. 'Excuse me, Sergeant,' I said, in"
"my best detective officer voice, 'I will report direct to your Major"
and the Commander. I am Chief Inspector Dawson.' He showed no surprise
"nor doubt of my word--if you want to understand discipline, gentlemen,"
ship was taken by the Welsh pirate Howel Davis. At first Roberts was
"disinclined for the pirate life, but soon changed his mind."
On the death of Davis there were several candidates for the post of
"commander, all brisk and lively men, distinguished by the title of"
"""Lords,"" such as Sympson, Ashplant, Anstis, and others. One of these"
"""Lords,"" Dennis, concluded an eloquent harangue over a bowl of punch with"
a strong appeal for Roberts to be the new chief. This proposal was
"acclaimed with but one dissenting voice, that of ""Lord"" Sympson, who had"
"hopes of being elected himself, and who sullenly left the meeting swearing"
"""he did not care who they chose captain so it was not a papist."" So"
Roberts was elected after being a pirate only six weeks; thus was true
merit quickly appreciated and rewarded amongst them.
[Illustration: CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW ROBERTS.
To face p. 262.]
"Roberts's speech to his fellow-pirates was short but to the point, saying"
"""that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water, and must be a pyrate,"
"it was better being a commander than a common man,"" not perhaps a graceful"
"nor grateful way of expressing his thanks, but one which was no doubt"
understood by his audience.
"Roberts began his career in a bright manner, for to revenge the perfectly"
"justifiable death of their late captain he seized and razed the fort,"
"bombarded the town, and setting on fire two Portuguese ships so as to act"
"as torches, sailed away the same night. Sailing to Brazil they found in"
the Bay of Bahia a fleet of forty-two Portuguese ships ready laden and on
"the point of leaving for Lisbon, and Roberts, with the most astounding"
"boldness, sailed right in amongst them until he found the deepest laden,"
"which he attacked and boarded, although his was a much smaller ship. He"
The change in the aspect of affairs would have made a greater difference
to most companies of adventurers than it did to that of which Master
Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the shire of Fife was the leader. In the
morning they had all risen with the expectation of being shot with the
sun-rising. At ten of the clock they were speeding southward on good
"horses, holding acknowledged rank and position in the army of the only"
Catholic and religious sovereign.
But they were a philosophic quartette. Rollo drew in the morning air and
blew it back again through his nostrils without thinking much of how
nearly he had come to kissing the brown earth of Luis Fernandez's garden
with a dozen bullets through his heart. Mortimer meditated somewhat
"sulkily upon his lost onions, rustling pleasantly back there in the cool"
_patio_ of the nunnery. Etienne sorrowed for his latest love idyll
"ruthlessly cut short, and as to El Sarria, he thought of nothing save"
that Dolóres had come back to him and that he had yet to reckon with the
Fernandez family. The next time he would attend to the whole matter
"himself, and there would be no mistakes."
It was not without sadness that Rollo looked his last on the white
walls of the convent of the Holy Innocents. He was glad indeed to have
"placed Dolóres in safety--glad that she and her child were together, and"
that the good sisters were responsible for them. Between them the four
"had made up a purse to be sent by Concha to the Mother Superior, to be"
"applied for the behoof of her guests till the better days should come,"
and Ramon Garcia be able to claim his wife and first-born son.
But Concha had refused point-blank.
"""The babe came through the wicket. The mother arrived by night, a"
"fugitive asking pity, like the Virgin fleeing down to Egypt in the"
"pictures,"" said Concha. ""The convent needs no alms, nor does the Lady"
"Europe, we had seen crowns which far surpassed this one in costliness"
"and beauty, but none of which, nor all of which combined, had ever"
excited a thousandth part of the interest attaching to this old crown
in Monza.
[Sidenote: Why the Crown is so Sacred.]
The explanation is this: within that ring of jointed plates of gold
"runs a thin band of iron, which priestly tradition says was made of one"
of the spikes that fastened the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ to the
"cross. It was this band of iron that we tiptoed to see, hardly noticing"
the bejewelled rim of gold around it. It was on account of this band of
iron that the priest and his attendant swung their censer and performed
their ceremony as we entered. It was this band of iron that gave to the
crown its sacred place above the altar. It was for the safe keeping of
"this band of iron that the steel case, with its numerous locks, was"
"made. It was from this band of iron that the diadem received its name,"
the Iron Crown of Lombardy.
[Sidenote: How it was Used by Charlemagne and Napoleon.]
"And what were the historical uses of it, referred to above, which made"
it so much more interesting to us than the many other so-called nails
"of the true cross elsewhere? Well, this among others: on the last"
"Christmas day of the eighth century, while Charlemagne was kneeling"
"with uncovered head before the high altar of St. Peter's in Rome,"
"the Pope approached him from behind, and, placing the Iron Crown of"
"Lombardy on his head, hailed him as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire."
"A thousand years later on the 26th of May, 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte,"
"""watched by an apparently invincible army which adored him and a world"
"which feared him,"" standing in the vast marble cathedral at Milan,"
within his reach.
"Since her return, Rosek had begun to come again, very careful not to"
"repeat his mistake, but not deceiving her at all.  Though his"
"self-control was as great as Fiorsen's was small, she felt he had not"
"given up his pursuit of her, and would take very good care that Daphne"
Wing was afforded every chance of being with her husband. But pride never
"let her allude to the girl.  Besides, what good to speak of her?  They"
"would both lie--Rosek, because he obviously saw the mistaken line of his"
"first attack; Fiorsen, because his temperament did not permit him to"
suffer by speaking the truth.
"Having set herself to endure, she found she must live in the moment,"
"never think of the future, never think much of anything. Fortunately,"
nothing so conduces to vacuity as a baby.  She gave herself up to it with
"desperation.  It was a good baby, silent, somewhat understanding.  In"
"watching its face, and feeling it warm against her, Gyp succeeded daily"
"in getting away into the hypnotic state of mothers, and cows that chew"
"the cud.  But the baby slept a great deal, and much of its time was"
"claimed by Betty.  Those hours, and they were many, Gyp found difficult."
"She had lost interest in dress and household elegance, keeping just"
"enough to satisfy her fastidiousness; money, too, was scarce, under the"
"drain of Fiorsen's irregular requirements.  If she read, she began almost"
"at once to brood.  She was cut off from the music-room, had not crossed"
its threshold since her discovery.  Aunt Rosamund's efforts to take her
"into society were fruitless--all the effervescence was out of that, and,"
"though her father came, he never stayed long for fear of meeting Fiorsen."
"In this condition of affairs, she turned more and more to her own music,"
"and one morning, after she had come across some compositions of her"
"girlhood, she made a resolution. That afternoon she dressed herself with"
"pleasure, for the first time for months, and sallied forth into the"
February frost.
"little relieved, but drowsiness came on again. I fought against it with"
"all my strength, but with an agony no words can describe I realized that"
it was too strong for me. I pulled myself together with another
despairing effort. I noticed that my clothing felt cold and clammy--I
"had been sweating all over...."""
"The theatre orderly burst into the waiting-room and shouted: ""Are you"
"all deaf? I've been yelling out 'Next man' the last five minutes, but"
you won't take no bloody notice. Send us two or three. The Colonel's in
"the theatre--he'll kick up a hell of a row if you don't get a move on."""
"We were scared and sent three men across. When they had gone, we asked"
to hear the end of the story.
"""Well, I was absolutely desperate. I kept on looking at my watch, but"
"the minutes crawled along. I believe I must have started crying once,"
"but I don't know for certain, I was so sleepy that I don't remember half"
"of what I did and what I dreamt--I know I did dream, it's funny how you"
can start dreaming even when you're standing up or moving about. I
couldn't keep my eyes open and I kept on dropping off and pulling myself
"together. Suddenly, there was a terrific crash and a shell burst, it"
"must have been forty or fifty yards off. I thought, bitterly, that"
"there'd be no Blighty for me--no such luck. Then, high up in the air, I"
"saw a big shell-fragment sailing along in a wide curve, spinning and"
"turning. I looked at it--it was coming my way--Jesus Christ, perhaps I'd"
have some luck after all--and in any case a few more seconds would have
"passed by. It descended like a flash, I started back in spite of myself"
and held one hand out in front of my face. I felt a kind of numb pain in
"my right foot--nothing very bad. I looked down and, oh joy, I saw a big,"
"jagged bit of shell imbedded in my foot. I tried to move it, but the"
"pain was too great. Joy seemed to catch me by the throat, I began to"
"dance, but such a pang shot through my leg that I had to stop. I dropped"

"In 1566 was acted at Christ's College, Cambridge, 'A Ryght Pithy,"
"Pleasaunt, and merie Comedie, intytuled _Gammer Gurton's Needle_.' The"
"authorship is uncertain, recent investigation having exalted a certain"
Stevenson into rivalry with the Bishop Still to whom former scholars
were content to assign it. Possibly as the result of a perusal of
"Plautus, possibly under the influence of the last play--for in subject"
matter it is even more perfectly English than _Ralph Roister
"Doister_--this comedy is also built on a well-arranged plan, the plot"
developing regularly through five acts with subsidiary scenes. Let us
glance through it.
"Gammer Gurton and her goodman Hodge lose their one and only needle, an"
"article not easily renewed, nor easily done without, seeing that Hodge's"
"garments stand in need of instant repair. Gib, the cat, is strongly"
"suspected of having swallowed it. Into this confusion steps Diccon, a"
"bedlam beggar, whose quick eye promptly detects opportunities for"
"mischief. After scaring Hodge with offers of magic art, he goes to Dame"
"Chat, an honest but somewhat jealous neighbour, unaware of what has"
"happened, with a tale that Gammer Gurton accuses her of stealing her"
best cock. To Gammer Gurton he announces that he has seen Dame Chat pick
up the needle and make off with it. Between the two dames ensues a
"meeting, the nature of which may be guessed, the whole trouble lying in"
the fact that neither thinks it necessary to name the article under
dispute. No wonder that discussion under the disadvantage of so great a
"misunderstanding ends in violence. Doctor Rat, the curate, is now called"
in; but again Diccon is equal to the occasion. Having warned Dame Chat
"that Hodge, to balance the matter of the cock, is about to creep in"
"through a breach in the wall and kill her chickens, he persuades Doctor"
Rat that if he will creep through this same opening he will see the
needle lying on Dame Chat's table. The consequences for the curate are
It was an early rumour of this intention which had so stirred the
"resentment of Don Baltasar Varela, and caused him to look about for some"
instrument of vengeance to prevent the accomplishment of the designs of
"""that _burro_ of the English Stock Exchange,"" as his enemies freely"
named Mendizábal.
"But Cristina of Naples was a typical woman of the Latin races, and,"
however strongly she might be determined to establish her daughter on
"the throne of Spain, she was also a good Catholic, and any oppression of"
Holy Church was abhorrent to her nature.
"Upon this probability, which amounted to certainty in his mind, the"
Abbot of Montblanch resolved to proceed.
"Moreover, it was an open secret that a few months after the death of her"
"husband Fernando, Cristina had married Muñoz, one of the handsomest"
"officers of her bodyguard. For this and other Bourbon delinquencies,"
"conceived in the good old Neapolitan manner, the Spaniards generally had"
the greatest respect--not even being scandalized when the Queen created
"her new partner Duke of Rianzares, or when, in her _rôle_ of honorary"
"colonel of dragoons, she appeared in a uniform of blue and white,"
"because these were the colours of the ""Immaculate Conception."""
But enough has been said to indicate the nature of the adventure which
"our hero had before him, when after a toilsome march the party halted in"
the grey of the dawn in a tiny dell among the wild mountains of
Guadarrama.
"The air was still bleak and cold, though luckily there was no wind."
"Concha, the child of the south, shivered a little as Rollo aided her to"
"dismount, and this must be the young man's excuse for taking his blue"
"military cloak from its coil across his saddle-bow, and wrapping it"
corrected edition of the New Testament. He did not fail to request the
chiefs of conservative divinity at Louvain beforehand to state their
objections to his work. Briard of Ath declared he had found nothing
"offensive in it, after he had first been told all sorts of bad things"
"about it. 'Then the new edition will please you much better,' Erasmus"
"had said. His friend Dorp and James Latomus, also one of the chief"
"divines, had expressed themselves in the same sense, and the Carmelite"
Nicholas of Egmond had said that he had never read Erasmus's work. Only
"a young Englishman, Edward Lee, who was studying Greek at Louvain, had"
summarized a number of criticisms into ten conclusions. Erasmus had got
rid of the matter by writing to Lee that he had not been able to get
hold of his conclusions and therefore could not make use of them. But
"his youthful critic had not put up with being slighted so, and worked"
out his objections in a more circumstantial treatise.
"[Illustration: XVII. VIEW OF BASLE, 1548]"
Thus Erasmus set out for Basle once more in May 1518. He had been
obliged to ask all his English friends (of whom Ammonius had been taken
from him by death in 1517) for support to defray the expenses of the
"journey; he kept holding out to them the prospect that, after his work"
"was finished, he would return to England. In a letter to Martin Lypsius,"
"as he was going up the Rhine, he answered Lee's criticism, which had"
irritated him extremely. In revising his edition he not only took it but
"little into account, but ventured, moreover, this time to print his own"
translation of the New Testament of 1506 without any alterations. At the
same time he obtained for the new edition a letter of approval from the
"Pope, a redoubtable weapon against his cavillers."
At Basle Erasmus worked again like a horse in a treadmill. But he was
really in his element. Even before the second edition of the New
"Testament, the _Enchiridion_ and the _Institutio Principis Christiani_"
"men here, not even your chief assistant or Trehayne, should know that"
you are joining the _Malplaquet_ as a Marine. Two independent strings
"are in this case better than a double-jointed string."""
"""I never tell anything to any one, least of all to Pudden-Headed"
"Wilson. He is loyal, but a stupid ass with a flapping tongue. Trehayne"
"is close as wax, but, on general principles, I keep my movements"
"strictly to myself. He will be in the ship, but he won't know that I"
"am there too. The Commander must know and the Major of Marines, for I"
"shall want a uniform and the free run of the ship, so as to be posted"
"where I like. The Marine Sergeants of the Guard may guess, but, as Mr."
"Cary says, they won't talk. You two gentlemen are safe,"" added Dawson"
"pleasantly, ""for I've got you tight in my hand and could lock either"
"of you up in a minute if I chose."""
"A peculiar knock came upon the door, a word passed between Dawson and"
"the police sentry outside, and a young man in the uniform of a naval"
"petty officer entered the room. He was clean-shaven, looked about"
"twenty-five years old, was dark and slim of the Latin type which is"
"not uncommon in Cornwall, and impressed me at once with his air of"
"intelligence and refinement. His voice, too, was rather striking. It"
was that of the wardroom rather than of the mess deck. I liked the
look of Petty Officer Trehayne. Dawson presented him to us and then
"took him aside for instructions. When he had finished, both men"
"rejoined us, and the conversation became light and general. Trehayne,"
though clearly suffering from nervous strain after his recent
"professional failures, talked with the ease and detachment of a highly"
cultivated man. It appeared that he had been educated at Blundell's
"School, had lost his parents at about sixteen, had done a course in"
"some electrical engineering shops at Plymouth, and when twenty years"
old had secured a good berth on the engineering staff of the _Vernon_.
"He could speak both French and German, which he had learned partly at"
"narrow one in Harpe Alley, leading from Shoe Lane.  It was not an old"
"house, for it came within the area of the great fire of fifty years"
"back, and had been rebuilt, like the whole of the surrounding buildings,"
with greater speed than discretion.  Grey had once come across Sir
"Christopher Wren in his other life, and had talked with him of the"
short-sighted policy observed in the rebuilding of the city.  The great
"architect declared that had his plans been carried out, London would"
have been the finest city in the world: but the haste and false economy
"of the citizens and city companies had thwarted his plans, and the old"
"lines of narrow and crooked streets were kept as before, to the cost of"
succeeding generations.
"This house had been hastily run up, like those surrounding it, and the"
tempest from without rattled and shook the walls and windows as though
"to drive them in.  But the room itself, though no more than an attic,"
"bore an air of comfort very pleasant to the eyes of the homeless Grey,"
whose own quarters only contained the barest necessities of life; for
"there were some rough shelves full of books in one corner, and a rug"
before the fire gave a look of comfort to the place.  Two armchairs of
"rude pattern, but furnished with down cushions, seemed to invite repose;"
"and everything was scrupulously clean, even to the boards of the floor."
"""’A poor thing, but mine own,’"" spoke the Old Lion, with his grim smile,"
"as he motioned to Grey to take one chair, and he himself pulled up the"
"other. ""I have dwelt here two years and more now, and I have not been"
"unhappy; albeit I never thought to end my days in a garret, as belike I"
"shall do now."""
"""Fortune has been hard upon you,"" spoke Grey earnestly.  ""You have the"
gifts and the powers; it is cruel that your limbs should have become
"crippled."""
"had written long ago and read it through, sweet and tender memories"
"crowded upon me, and in my eyes stood blinding tears.  I may be forgiven"
"for this, I think, when it is remembered how fondly I had once loved"
"Yolande, before that fatal day when jealousy had consumed me, and I had"
turned my back upon her as a woman false and worthless.
"Letter after letter I read, each bringing back to me sad memories of"
"those days, when in the calm sunset hour we had wandered by the"
"riverside hand in hand like children, each supremely content in each"
"other's love, fondly believing that our mad passion would last always."
"In all the world she had been, to me, incomparable.  The centre of"
"admiration at those brilliant balls at the Royal Palace at Brussels, the"
most admired of all the trim and comely girls who rode at morning in the
"Bois, the merriest of those who picnicked in the forest round about the"
"ancient chateau, the sweetest, the most tender, and the most pure of all"
"the women I knew--Yolande in those days had been mine.  There, in my"
"hand, I held the letter which I had written from Scotland when on leave"
"for the shooting, asking if she loved me sufficiently to become my wife."
"To that letter I well remembered her reply--indeed, I knew it verbatim;"
"a tender letter, full of honest love and straightforward admission--a"
"letter such as only a pure and good woman could have penned.  Yes, she"
"wrote that she loved me dearly, and would be my wife."
And yet it was all of the past.  All had ended.
"I sighed bitterly--how bitterly, mere words cannot describe.  You,"
"reader, be you man or woman, can you fully realise how deeply I felt at"
"that moment, how utterly desolate the world then seemed to me?"
"Those letters I slowly replaced in the cavity and closed it.  Then, as I"
"turned away, my eyes fell upon the photographs standing upon a small"
whatnot close by the escritoire.  They were of persons whom I did not
"circumstances mere nonsense--which it very likely was--and said so,"
"which betrayed inexperience, and Alicia Derosne asked what time it took"
place.
"""Eleven sharp,"" said the Governor, and returned to the account of the"
murder.
Time after time in the last few days Alicia had told herself that she
"could bear it no longer. At one moment she believed nothing, the next,"
nothing was too terrible for her to believe; now she would fly to
"Australia, or home, or anywhere out of New Lindsey; now a"
straightforward challenge to Medland alone would serve her turn.
Sometimes she felt as if she could put the whole thing on one side; five
minutes later found her pinning her whole life on the issue of it. Under
"her guarded face and calm demeanour, the storm of divided and"
"conflicting instincts and passions raged, and long solitary rambles"
became a necessary outlet for what she dared show to none. She shrank
"from seeing Medland, and yet longed to speak with him; she felt that to"
"mention the topic to him was impossible, and yet, if they met,"
"inevitable; that she would not have strength to face him, and yet could"
not let him go without clearing up the mystery. She told herself at one
"moment that she hardly knew him, at the next that between them nothing"
could be too secret for utterance.
What she hoped and feared befell her that morning. She went out for a
"walk in the Park, and before long she met the Premier, with his daughter"
and Norburn. The two last were laughing and talking--their quarrel was
"quite forgotten now--and Medland himself, she thought, looked as though"
his load of care were a little less heavy. The two men explained that
"they were on their way--a roundabout way, they confessed--to the"
"Council, and had seized the chance of some fresh air, while Daisy was"
"full of stories about yesterday's triumph, that left room only for a"
facing these two villages. But the specimens found in Sanaroa are
"much better in colour, and I think more easily procured. The fishing"
"in this latter locality, however, is done by the Sinaketans only."
"Whether the fishing is done in their own Lagoon, near an uninhabited"
"island called Nanoula, or in Sanaroa, it is always a big, ceremonial"
"affair, in which the whole community takes part in a body. The"
"magic, or at least part of it, is done for the whole community by"
"the magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma), who also fixes the"
"dates, and conducts the ceremonial part of the proceedings. As the"
spondylus shell furnishes one of the essential episodes of a Kula
"expedition, a detailed account both of fishing and of manufacturing"
"must be here given. The native name, kaloma (in the Southern Massim"
districts the word sapi-sapi is used) describes both the shell and
"the manufactured discs. The shell is the large spondylus shell,"
"containing a crystalline layer of a red colour, varying from dirty"
"brick-red to a soft, raspberry pink, the latter being by far the most"
"prized. It lives in the cavities of coral outcrop, scattered among"
shallow mud-bottomed lagoons.
"This shell is, according to tradition, associated with the village"
"of Sinaketa. According to a Sinaketan legend, once upon a time, three"
"guya'u (chief) women, belonging to the Tabalu sub-clan of the Malasi"
"clan, wandered along, each choosing her place to settle in. The eldest"
selected the village of Omarakana; the second went to Gumilababa;
"the youngest settled in Sinaketa. She had kaloma discs in her basket,"
"and they were threaded on a long, thin stick, called viduna, such"
as is used in the final stage of manufacture. She remained first
"in a place called Kaybwa'u, but a dog howled, and she moved further"
"on. She heard again a dog howling, and she took a kaboma (wooden plate)"
and went on to the fringing reef to collect shells. She found there
"the momoka (white spondylus), and she exclaimed: ""Oh, this is the"

Another Panamanian product which the tourists buy eagerly but which is
rapidly becoming rare is the pearl. In the Gulf of Panama are a group of
islands which have been known as Las Islas des Perlas--the Pearl
"Islands. This archipelago is about thirty miles long, with sixteen big"
"islands and a quantity of small ones, and lies about sixty miles south"
of Panama City. Balboa saw them from the shore and intended to visit
them but never did. Pizarro stopped there on his way to Peru and
plundered them to his heart’s content. Otherwise their history has been
uneventful. Saboga on the island of the same name is a beautiful little
"tropical village of about 300 huts, on a high bluff bordering a bay"
that affords excellent anchorage. Whales are plentiful in these waters
"and Pacific whalers are often seen in port. San Miguel, the largest town"
"of the archipelago, is on Rey Island and has about 1000 inhabitants. The"
"tower of its old church is thickly inlaid with glistening, pearly shell."
[Illustration: DESPOILING OLD GUAYMI GRAVES]
"The pearl fisheries have been overworked for years, perhaps centuries,"
and begin to show signs of being exhausted. Nevertheless the tourist who
takes the trip to the islands from the City of Panama will find himself
beset by children as he lands offering seed pearls in quantities.
Occasionally real bargains may be had from “beach combers” not only at
"Rey Island, but even at Taboga, where I knew an American visitor to pick"
up for eleven dollars three pearls valued at ten or twelve times as much
when shown in the United States. There are stories of lucky finds among
divers that vie with the tales of nuggets among gold prospectors. Once a
native boy diving for sport in one of the channels near Naos Island
brought up an oyster in which was a black pearl that was sold in Panama
"for $3000. The report does not say how much of this the boy got, but as"
the project was never abandoned during four hundred years. At last it
"was secured by stratagem, in the year eight hundred and something."
"The commander of the Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the"
"bones, separated them, and packed them in vessels filled with lard. The"
religion of Mahomet causes its devotees to abhor anything in the nature
"of pork, and so when the Christian was stopped at the gate of the city,"
"they only glanced once into the precious baskets, then turned up their"
"noses at the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones were buried in"
"the vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years"
"to receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were"
secured. And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if
"those holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like a"
"dream, and its foundation be buried forever in the unremembering sea."""
[Sidenote: The Gift of Leo XIII. to London.]
More recently I had read of what has been well called the burlesque
"enacted at Arundel Castle no longer ago than in July, 1902, in which"
"the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Vaughan, and many lesser ornaments and"
"dignitaries of the Romish Church, took part."
"""Pope Leo XIII., in order to show his 'good-will to England,'"
sent from Rome the remains of St. Edmund to garnish the new Roman
"Catholic cathedral at Westminster. It was an appropriate gift, for"
such buildings are usually garnished with 'dead men's bones and all
"uncleanness.' But as the cathedral is not yet finished, as a further"
"token of good-will, the relics were committed to the care of no less"
a personage than the Earl Marshal of England. They arrived at Arundel
"on the evening of July 25th, and were placed for the night in Fitzalen"
"Chapel. The next morning the whole castle was astir betimes, for the"
"great event of the day, the transference of the bones to the castle"
"chapel, was to take place. This was accomplished in a solemn and"
where I found Frances and Bettina luxuriating in tearful sympathy.
"I walked home with Bettina, and she invited me to go to her parlor to"
"have a cup of tea. To see Bettina boil the tea (steep it or draw it, she"
said was the proper phrase) was as pretty a sight as one could wish to
"behold, and when she poured it out in thin china cups, handing one to"
"me and taking one herself, her pride in following the fashion of modish"
ladies was as touching as it was simple and beautiful. It was almost more
"than my feeble resolutions could withstand, so when I was about to leave"
"I had a great battle with myself and was defeated, for I seized her"
"hands, and although I said nothing, she knew what was in my mind, so she"
"hung her head, murmuring:--"
"""If you are willing to make me more unhappy than I am."""
"""Not for the world, Bettina,"" I answered, rallying against myself."
"""Goodnight."""
"""Good night. Now I know you are my friend,"" she answered softly, holding"
"my hands for a moment, then dropping them suddenly and turning from me."
"I have refrained from speaking of Mary Hamilton of late, partly because"
"I did not see her frequently at this time, and partly because the shame I"
felt at the time of which I am now writing comes surging over me whenever
I touch upon the subject. Not that I did anything of which I need be
"ashamed, but because I remember so vividly my motives and desires that"
"the old sensations return, even at this distant day, as a perfume, a"
"strain of music, the soft balminess of spring, or the sharp bite of"
"winter's frost may recall a moment of the past, and set the heart"
throbbing or still it as of yore.
"After leaving Bettina, I went back to Whitehall and dressed for a ball"
"President.  At the right of the head of the Republic, who was"
"distinguishable by his crimson sash, sat the Countess Tornelli, with the"
wife of the United States Ambassador on his left.  The President's
"wife--who wore a superb gown of corn-coloured miroir velvet, richly"
"embroidered and inlaid with Venetian lace, a veritable triumph of the"
"Rue de la Paix--had on her right the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Lerenzelli,"
"the doyen of the Diplomatic Corps, while on her left was my Chief, Lord"
Barmouth.
"The seat next me was allotted to his daughter Sibyl, who looked charming"
"in rose chiffon.  During dinner she chatted merrily, describing a"
charity bazaar which she had attended that afternoon accompanied by her
"mother.  On the other side of her sat Count Berchtold, the secretary of"
"the Austrian Embassy, who was, I shrewdly suspected, one of her most"
"devoted admirers.  She was charming--a typical, smart English girl; and"
I think that I was proved to be an exception among men by reason of the
"fact that I did not flirt with her.  Indeed, we were excellent friends,"
and my long acquaintance with her gave me a prescriptive right to a kind
of brotherly solicitude for her welfare.  Times without number I had
"chaffed her about her little affairs of the heart, and as many times she"
had turned my criticisms against myself by her witty repartee.  She
could be exceedingly sarcastic when occasion required; but there had
"always been a perfect understanding between us, and no remark was ever"
distorted into an insult.
Dinner was followed by a brilliant reception.  The great Salon des
"Fetes, which only a year before was hung with funeral wreaths, owing to"
"the death of the previous President, resounded with that peculiar hum"
made up of all the intonations of conversation and discreet laughter
rolled together against the sustained buzzing of the orchestra a short
distance away.  The scene was one of glittering magnificence.  Everyone
knew everyone else.  Through the crowd of uniforms--which always give an
THE MEETING PLACE OF THE CAYUCAS]
"Once a week Miguel’s father went down to market at Matachin, and"
"sometimes the boy went along. The long, narrow cayuca was loaded with"
"oranges, bananas and yams, all covered with big banana leaves, and with"
Miguel in the bow and his father in the stern the voyage commenced.
"Going down stream was easy enough, and the canoists plied their paddles"
"idly, trusting chiefly to the current to carry them along. But coming"
"back would be the real work, then they would have to bend to their poles"
and push savagely to force the boat along. At places they would have to
"get overboard and fairly carry the boat through the swift, shallow"
rapids. But Miguel welcomed the work for it showed him the wonders of
"Matachin, where great iron machines rushed along like horses, drawing"
long trains of cars; where more people worked with shovels tending queer
machines than there were in ten towns like Cruces; where folk gave pesos
"for bananas and gave cloth, powder and shot, things to eat in cans, and"
rum in big bottles for the pesos again. It was an exciting place this
Matachin and made Miguel understand what the gringoes meant when they
"talked about New York, Chicago and other cities like it."
[Illustration: BANANA MARKET AT MATACHIN]
When he grew older Miguel worked awhile for the men who were digging
"away all this dirt, and earned enough to buy himself a machete and a gun"
and a few ornaments for a girl named Maria who lived in another hut near
the river. But what was the use of working in that mad way--picking up
"your shovel when a whistle blew and toiling away until it blew again,"
with a boss always scolding at you and ready with a kick if you tried to
"take a little siesta. The pesos once a week were good, that was true. If"
you worked long enough you might get enough to buy one of those boxes
"that made music, but _quien sabe?_ It might get broken anyway, and the"
"routes, but without much success, owing to the inhospitable nature of"
the country through which they had to pass and also to the opposition
"they met with from the Hazara tribes round Herat, who, belonging"
"as they do to the Shiah section of the Mahommedan religion, are at"
"daggers drawn with the Afghans, who belong to the Sunni section."
"Therefore the Germans had to try yet another road, and succeeded"
farther South where they had failed in the North. By taking the
longer route through Kerman and Narmashir in the South and South-East
"of Persia, they found easy ingress into Afghanistan."
"To effect this, however, they had to make friends with the nomad"
and war-like tribes of the Sarhad. These tribes were traditionally
"friendly to the British, but the Germans had bribed them heavily"
and had moreover assured them that Germany had turned Islam and
that the Kaiser William himself was a convert to their religion. As
"the Sarhad tribes were always out for a good thing for themselves,"
"and as they believed the lie about the German conversion, they had"
allowed themselves to be tricked into helping the Germans. This
they were doing not only by permitting them to pass through their
"territory, but also by harassing the lines of communication between"
the inadequately small British frontier posts.
"The story of Germany having turned Mahommedan, farcical as it was,"
was nevertheless a potential source of grave danger for us in India.
"It must be remembered that Germany's ally, Turkey, was Mahommedan,"
"and that in helping us against Germany, the Mahommedans of India were"
"already being called upon, indirectly, to fight against their own"
"co-religionists. When, in addition, India was assured that powerful"
"Germany was winning, so her agents avowed, in every theatre of war,"
it was inevitable that in time her loyalty to us must suffer.
"""I promise you, Colonel, the maid will be worth her billet,"" said the"
"Sergeant, ""or else she is no true Andaluse. To such an one in old days I"
"have often trusted----"""
Thus far Cardono had proceeded when suddenly he broke off his
"reminiscence, and with a paternal gesture patted Concha's arm as she was"
bending over to transfer a second helping of the _puchero_ to his dish.
"The party was now in excellent marching order, well-provisioned,"
"well-fed, rested, and provided with the best and most recent"
information. Even John Mortimer's slow English blood developed some
"latent Puritanic fire, and he said, ""Hang me if I do not fight for the"
"little girl who was willing to pay for the _whole_ of the goat-milk!"""
"To fight for a Queen, who at the early age of five was prepared to give"
"a wholesale order like that, appeared to John Mortimer a worthy and"
laudable deed of arms. He was free indeed to assist in taking her
"captive, if by so doing he could further the shipping of the Priorato he"
himself had paid for. But to make over to a set of thieves and murderers
a girl who had about her the makings of a good customer and a woman of
"business habits, stirred every chivalric feeling within him."
The night was so dark that it was resolved that the party should leave
their horses behind them in the stables of the deserted farm. They could
then proceed on foot more softly and with more safety to themselves. To
"this La Giralda, knowing that they must return that way, readily"
assented. For the thought of the dead woman she had left in the
"first-floor room haunted her, and even in the darkness of the night she"
could see the stark outlines of the sheet she had spread over the body.
"So it came to pass that once more horseshoe iron clattered, and there"
was a flashing of lights and a noise of voices about the lonely and
"curious name of the _Protestant Cæsar_, the pirates burnt out of spite,"
"not because of her name, but because she belonged to Boston, where there"
had lately been a hanging of pirates.
"Blackbeard now sailed north along the American coast, arriving off"
"Charleston, South Carolina. Here he lay off the bar for several days,"
"seizing every vessel that attempted to enter or leave the port, ""striking"
"great Terror to the whole Province of Carolina,"" the more so since the"
"colony was scarcely recovered from a recent visit by another pirate, Vane."
"Being in want of medicines, Teach sent his lieutenant, Richards, on shore"
with a letter to the Governor demanding that he should instantly send off
"a medicine chest, or else Teach would murder all his prisoners, and"
threatening to send their heads to Government House; many of these
prisoners being the chief persons of the colony.
"Teach, who was unprincipled, even for a pirate, now commanded three"
"vessels, and he wanted to get rid of his crews and keep all the booty for"
"himself and a few chosen friends. To do this, he contrived to wreck his"
own vessel and one of his sloops. Then with his friends and all the booty
"he sailed off, leaving the rest marooned on a small sandy island. Teach"
"next sailed to North Carolina, and with the greatest coolness surrendered"
"with twenty of his men to the Governor, Charles Eden, and received the"
Royal pardon. The ex-pirate spent the next few weeks in cultivating an
"intimate friendship with the Governor, who, no doubt, shared Teach's booty"
with him.
A romantic episode took place at this time at Bath Town. The pirate fell
"in love, not by any means for the first time, with a young lady of 16"
"years of age. To show his delight at this charming union, the Governor"
"himself married the happy pair, this being the captain's fourteenth wife;"
though certain Bath Town gossips were heard to say that there were no
was regarded by the Germans.
It was in 1837 that Ferrier married the young lady with whom he had so
long corresponded. The marriage was in all respects a happy one. Mrs.
"Ferrier's gifts and graces, inherited from her father, will not soon be"
"forgotten, either in St. Andrews where she lived so long, or in"
"Edinburgh, the later home of her widowhood. One whose spirits were less"
gay might have found a husband whose interests were so completely in
his work--and that a work in which she could not share--difficult to
"deal with; but she possessed understanding to appreciate that work, as"
"well as humour, and could accommodate herself to the circumstances in"
"which she found herself; while he, on his part, entered into the gaiety"
on occasion with the best. A friend and student of the St. Andrews'
"days writes of Ferrier: 'He married his cousin Margaret, Professor's"
"Wilson's daughter, and I don't doubt that a shorthand report of their"
courtship would have been better worth reading than nine hundred and
"ninety-nine out of every thousand courtships, for she had wit as well"
"as beauty, and he was capable of appreciating both. No more charming"
"woman have I ever seen or heard making game of mankind in general, and"
in particular of pedants and hypocrites. She would even laugh at her
"husband on occasion, but it was dangerous for any volunteer to try to"
help her in that sport. A finer-looking couple I have never seen.[5]
"[5] Another sister married William Edmondstoune Aytoun, the"
poet. It was regarding Professor Aytoun's proposal for Miss
Wilson's hand that the following story is told. When the
"engagement was being formed, Aytoun somewhat demurred to"
"interviewing the father of the lady, and she herself"
undertook the mission. Presently she returned with a card
"pinned upon her breast bearing the satisfactory inscription,"
"'With the author's compliments'! Aytoun, as is well known,"
"was extremely plain, and it was of his bust in the"
"blossoms. She had enemies, of course. Most of the other queens were her"
"enemies, and tried to do her harm. But it was useless telling tales of"
"her to the king, for the king never believed; and she walked so wisely"
"and so well, that she never fell into any snare. But still the plots"
never ceased.
"There was one day when she was sitting alone in the garden pavilion,"
"with the trees making moving shadows all about her, that the king came"
"to her. They talked for a time, and the king began to speak to her of"
"her life before she came to the palace, a thing he had never done"
"before. But he seemed to know all about it, nevertheless, and he spoke"
"to her of her brother, and said that he, the king, had heard how no man"
"was so strong as this blacksmith, the brother of the queen. The queen"
"said it was true, and she talked on and on and praised her brother, and"
"babbled of the days of her childhood, when he carried her on his great"
"shoulder, and threw her into the air, catching her again. She was"
"delighted to talk of all these things, and in her pleasure she forgot"
"her discretion, and said that her brother was wise as well as strong,"
and that all the people loved him. Never was there such a man as he. The
"king did not seem very pleased with it all, but he said only that the"
"blacksmith was a great man, and that the queen must write to him to come"
"down to the city, that the king might see him of whom there was such"
great report.
"Then the king got up and went away, and the queen began to doubt; and"
the more she thought the more she feared she had not been acting wisely
"in talking as she did, for it is not wise to praise anyone to a king."
"She went away to her own room to consider, and to try if she could hear"
"of any reason why the king should act as he had done, and desire her"
brother to come to him to the city; and she found out that it was all a
"plot of her enemies. Herself they had failed to injure, so they were now"
"plotting against her through her brother. They had gone to the king, and"
"admirer of Erasmus, had requested him to direct his attention to the"
"fact that in his interpretation of St. Paul, especially in that of the"
"epistle to the Romans, Erasmus had failed to conceive the idea of"
"_justitia_ correctly, had paid too little attention to original sin: he"
might profit by reading Augustine.
"The nameless Austin Friar was Luther, then still unknown outside the"
"circle of the Wittenberg University, in which he was a professor, and"
the criticism regarded the cardinal point of his hardly acquired
conviction: justification by faith.
Erasmus paid little attention to this letter. He received so many of
"that sort, containing still more praise and no criticism. If he answered"
"it, the reply did not reach Spalatinus, and later Erasmus completely"
forgot the whole letter.
"Nine months afterwards, in September 1517, when Erasmus had been at"
"Louvain for a short time, he received an honourable invitation, written"
"by the first prelate of the Empire, the young Archbishop of Mayence,"
Albert of Brandenburg. The archbishop would be pleased to see him on an
occasion: he greatly admired his work (he knew it so little as to speak
"of Erasmus's emendation of the Old Testament, instead of the New) and"
hoped that he would one day write some lives of saints in elegant style.
"The young Hohenzoller, advocate of the new light of classical studies,"
"whose attention had probably been drawn to Erasmus by Hutten and Capito,"
"who sojourned at his court, had recently become engaged in one of the"
boldest political and financial transactions of his time. His elevation
"to the see of Mayence, at the age of twenty-four, had necessitated a"
"papal dispensation, as he also wished to keep the archbishopric of"
Magdeburg and the see of Halberstadt. This accumulation of
ecclesiastical offices had to be made subservient to the Brandenburg
"farm, a few slices of sausage, and a big cup of frothing chocolate"
topped with whipped cream. The scene that spread before her was
"idyllic, from a bucolic point of view. The beech woods of Tervueren"
shut out any horizon of town activity; black and white cows were
"being driven out to pasture, a flock of geese with necks raised"
"vertically waggled sedately along their own chosen path, a little"
disturbed and querulous over the arrival of a stranger; turkey hens
"and their half-grown poults and a swelling, strutting turkey cock, a"
peacock that had already lost nearly all his tail and therefore
"declined combat with the turkey and was, moreover, an isolated"
bachelor; guinea-fowls scratching and running about alternately; and
plump cocks and hens of mixed breed covered most of the ground in
"the adjacent farm yard and the turf of an apple orchard, where the"
fruit was already reddening under the August sun. Pigeons circled
against the sky with the distinct musical notes struck out by their
"wings, or cooed and cooed round the dove cots. The dairy women of"
the farm laughed and sang and called out to one another in Flemish
and Wallon rough chaff about their men-folk who were called to the
Colours. There was nothing suggestive here of any coming tragedy.
This was the morning of the 13th of August. For three more days
"Vivie lived deliriously, isolated from the world. She took new books"
"to the shade of the forest, and a rug on which she could repose, and"
"read there with avidity, read also all the newspapers her mother had"
"brought over from England, tried to master the events which had so"
rapidly and irresistibly plunged Europe into War. Were the Germans
"to blame, she asked herself? Of course they were, technically, in"
invading Belgium and in forcing this war on France. But were they
not being surrounded by a hostile Alliance? Was not this hostility
on the part of Servia towards Austria stimulated by Russia in order
to forestal the Central Powers by a Russian occupation of
Constantinople? Why should the Russian Empire be allowed to stretch
"on this subject, for the two following experiences gathered from the"
streets which bear indirectly on the subject of story-telling:
"Mrs. Glover was visiting a sick woman in a very poor neighbourhood,"
"and found, sitting on the doorstep of the house, two children, holding"
"something tightly grasped in their little hands, and gazing with much"
expectancy towards the top of the street. She longed to know what they
"were doing, but not being one of those unimaginative and tactless"
"folk who rush headlong into the mysteries of children's doings, she"
passed them at first in silence. It was only when she found them still
in the same silent and expectant posture half-an-hour later that
she said tentatively: “I wonder whether you would tell me what you
"are doing here?” After some hesitation, one of them said, in a shy"
"voice: “We're waitin' for the barrer.” It then transpired that, once a"
"week, a vegetable-and flower-cart was driven through this particular"
"street, on its way to a more prosperous neighbourhood, and on a few"
"red-letter days, a flower, or a sprig, or even a root sometimes fell"
out of the back of the cart; and those two little children were waiting
"there in hope, with their hands full of soil, ready to plant anything"
"which might by golden chance fall that way, in their secret garden of"
oyster-shells.
This seems to me as charming a fairy-tale as any that our books can
supply.
Another time Mrs. Glover was collecting the pennies for the Holiday
Fund Savings Bank from the children who came weekly to her house. She
noticed on three consecutive Mondays that one little lad deliberately
helped himself to a new envelope from her table. Not wishing to
"frighten or startle him, she allowed this to continue for some weeks,"
"and then one day, having dismissed the other children, she asked him"
quite quietly why he was taking the envelopes. At first he was very
We know little of the early career of this remarkable buccaneer. He was
"loved by his crew, and had great influence over them. It is recorded that"
"one Sunday morning, finding some of his men gambling, he threw the dice"
"overboard, saying ""he would have no gambling aboard his ship."""
We know that on one occasion he was caught in his vessel by H.M.S.
"_Success_ and brought to Port Royal, Jamaica, and that on December 1st,"
"1679, he was in prison awaiting trial for piracy. Apparently he got off,"
for this brilliant young buccaneer is soon afterwards heard of as
"commanding a small vessel of sixteen tons, armed with but one gun and a"
"crew of thirty-five men. He was one of a party of 330 buccaneers who,"
"under the leadership of Coxon and Sharp, landed on the coast of Darien and"
marched through the jungle to attack and plunder the town of Santa Maria.
"The remainder of the journey across the isthmus was done in canoes, in"
which the pirates travelled down the Santa Maria River until they found
themselves in the Pacific. On this expedition each captain had his company
"and had his own colours, Sawkins's flag being a red one with yellow"
"stripes. Arrived at the sea, they captured two small Spanish vessels, and,"
"the rest of the company being in the canoes, they boldly sailed towards"
"Panama City. Meeting with the Spanish fleet of eight ships, the buccaneers"
"attacked it, and, after a most furious battle, came off victorious. This"
"was one of the most gallant episodes in the whole history of the ""brethren"
"of the coast,"" and was afterwards known as the Battle of Perico. Sawkins"
"fought in the most brave and desperate manner, and took a large share in"
"the successful enterprise. After this action some quarrelling took place,"
"which ended by Captain Coxon going off with some seventy men, to return"
across the isthmus on foot. The company that remained in the Pacific
"elected Sawkins to be their leader, as Captain Sharp, a much older man,"
was away in his ship.
"The buccaneers, ever since they defeated the Spanish fleet, had blockaded"
"the harbour, and a correspondence took place between the Governor of"
this extraordinary conflict Ralph is horribly belaboured by the
malicious Matthew under pretence of blows aimed at Dame Custance. Act
"V, however, brings Goodluck himself and explanations. That worthy man"
"finds his lady true, friendship is established all round, and Ralph and"
Merrygreek join the happy couple in a closing feast.
This bald outline perhaps makes sufficiently clear the great advance in
"plot structure. Within the play, however, are many other good things."
"The character of Ralph Roister Doister, 'a vain-glorious, cowardly"
"blockhead', as the list of dramatis personae has it, is thoroughly well"
"done: his heavy love-sighs, his confident elation, his distrust, his"
"gullibility, his ups and downs and contradictions, are all in the best"
"comic vein. Only second in fullness of portraiture, and truer to Nature,"
"is Dame Custance, who--if we exclude Melibaea as not native to English"
shores--may be said to bring into English secular drama honourable
"womanhood. Her amused indifference at first, her sharp reproof of her"
"maids who have allowed themselves to act as Ralph's messengers, her"
"gathering vexation at Ralph's tiresome wooing, her genuine alarm when"
she sees that his boastful words are accepted by the sea-captain as
truth--these are sentiments and emotions copied from a healthy and
"worthy model. Matthew Merrygreek, an unmistakable 'Vice' ever at Ralph's"
"elbow, is of all Vices the shrewdest striker of laughter out of a block"
of stupidity: it is from his ingenious brain that almost every absurd
"scene is evolved for the ridiculing of Ralph. Thoroughly human, and"
"quite assertive, are the lower characters, the maid-servants and"
"men-servants, Madge Mumblecrust, Tibet Talkapace, Truepenny, Dobinet"
Doughty and the rest. Need it be added that the battle in Act IV is pure
fooling? or that jolly songs enliven the scenes with their rousing
choruses (e.g. 'I mun be married a Sunday')? _Ralph Roister Doister_ is
an English comedy with English notions of the best way of amusing
English folk of the sixteenth century. With all its improvements it has
"no suggestion of the alien about it, as has the classically-flavoured"
"witty and sparkling dramas, and disputed as to whether the ""Old"
"Bachelor"" or the ""Way of the World"" were his happiest effort; whilst"
"some declared that the ""Double Dealer"" was the best of all.  They talked"
"excitedly of the revival at Drury Lane of Farquhar’s ""Love and a"
"Bottle,"" which had scored such a success some fourteen or fifteen years"
previously.  And there were some who lauded and some who depreciated
"Colley Cibber and his ""Careless Husband"" and ""Love’s Last Shift,"" which"
were favourites throughout the town.
"It was a new world to Grey; but he listened with a certain fascination,"
"for the drama had always attracted him, and he watched the gestures of"
the actors and listened to their mouthing periods with something between
wonder and amusement.  He could understand that these men had been
"failures. Only Lionel Field appeared to have any true histrionic gift,"
and the cause of his downfall was plain to be read after the speech of
"the ""Old Lion.""  From time to time, as the light flickered upon the"
"striking face in the ingle, Grey caught a fine-lipped smile upon it, and"
once or twice he thought the old actor’s eyes met his in a gleam of
humour.  But of that he could not be sure—it might be but the trick of
"the firelight; and presently wearied nature asserted itself, and the"
"young man passed from drowsiness to actual sleep, and knew nothing more"
till a sharp grip upon his arm roused him to a sense of his
surroundings.
"It was the tapster who thus shook him; and when he opened his eyes, Grey"
"saw—or thought, at least—that the room was empty.  What the time was he"
"had no idea; but it must be late, and he rose hastily to his feet with a"
muttered apology at having overstayed the closing time.
At that moment there emerged out of the shadows of the ingle-nook a bent
"figure, dignified even in its infirmity, and the voice which Grey had"
heard before spoke in quietly authoritative accents.
"Gerard, who did the infamous deed, actually told his judges 'that he"
"would soon be a saint in heaven, and would have the first place there"
"next to God,' whilst his family received a patent of nobility, and"
entered into the possession of the estate of the Prince in the Franche
Comté--rewards promised for the commission of the crime by Cardinal
"Granvelle."" (Dr. Alexander Robertson's _Roman Catholic Church in"
"Italy_, p. 94.)"
These are some of the things that help to explain not only the tone
"of the pasquinades, not only the indictments of the world's leading"
"historians, which are to be presently cited, but also the present"
attitude of something like twenty millions of the thirty-odd millions
"of Italy's inhabitants, who have forsaken the church altogether."
What idea the people have of the Jesuits in particular is well shown
"by the legend connected with the Piazza del Gesu, the great open space"
"in front of the Jesuit church, which is considered the windiest place"
in Rome. The story is that the devil and the wind were one day taking a
"walk together. ""When they came to this square, the devil, who seemed to"
"be very devout, said to the wind, 'Just wait a minute, mio caro, while"
"I go into this church.' So the wind promised, and the devil went into"
"the Gesu, and has never come out again--and the wind is blowing about"
"in the Piazza del Gesu to this day."""
[Sidenote: Pasquino's View of the Pope.]
One of the interesting objects in Rome is a mutilated statue called
"Pasquino, which stands at the corner of the Orsini Palace, one of"
the most central and public places in the city. The reason for the
interest attaching to this almost shapeless piece of marble is that
for centuries it was used for placarding those satires upon the popes
"which, by their exceeding cleverness and biting truth, have made the"
the soldiers by their careworn faces; or that many a man stood morning
and evening to gaze at the carved and lofty front of his house--by St.
Sebald's or behind the new Cathedral--and wondered how long the fire
would spare it. The magistrates who had staked all--their own and the
"city's--on this cast, went about with stern, grave faces and feared"
"almost to meet the public eye. With a doubled population, with a huge"
"army to feed, with order to keep, with houses and wives and daughters"
"of their own to protect, with sack and storm looming luridly in the"
"future, who had cares like theirs?"
"One man only, and him I saw as we went home from the Burg. It was near"
"the foot of the Burg hill, where the strasse meets three other ways."
"At that time Count Tilly's crooked, dwarfish figure and pale horse's"
"face, and the great hat and boots which seemed to swallow him up, were"
fresh in my mind; and sometimes I had wondered whether this other
"great commander were like him. Well, I was to know; for through the"
"crowd at the junction of these four roads, while we stood waiting to"
"pass, there came a man on a white horse, followed by half a score of"
others on horseback; and in a moment I knew from the shouting and the
way women thrust papers into his hands that we saw the King of Sweden.
He wore a plain buff coat and a grey flapped hat with a feather; a
"tall man and rather bulky, his face massive and fleshy, with a close"
moustache trimmed to a point and a small tuft on his chin. His aspect
"was grave; he looked about him with a calm eye, and the shouting did"
"not seem to move him. They told me that it was Ba[=n]er, the Swedish"
"General, who rode with him, and our Bernard of Weimar who followed."
"But my eye fell more quickly on Count Leuchtenstein, who rode after,"
"with the great Chancellor Oxenstierna; in him, in his steady gaze and"
"serene brow and wholesome strength, I traced the nearest likeness to"
the king.
"crew turned pirates, and sailed to the Red Sea. Here he met with a great"
"Indian ship, which he had the hardiness to attack, and soon took her, and"
"each of his men received as his share £3,000, and with this booty they"
sailed to Madagascar. He was already held in high esteem by the pirates
"who resided in that favourite stronghold. At one time he joined Misson,"
"the originator of ""piracy-without-tears"" at his garden city of Libertatia."
A quarrel arose between Misson's French followers and Tew's English
"pirates. A duel was arranged between the two leaders, but by the tact of"
"another pirate--an unfrocked Italian priest--all was settled amicably, Tew"
being appointed Admiral and the diplomatic ex-priest suitably chosen as
Secretary of State to the little republic. Such a reputation for kindness
"had Tew that ships seldom resisted him, but on knowing who their assailant"
was they gave themselves up freely. Some of Tew's men started a daughter
"colony on their own account, and the Admiral sailed after them to try and"
"persuade them to return to the fold at Libertatia. The men refused, and"
"while Tew was arguing and trying to persuade them to change their minds,"
his ship was lost in a sudden storm. Tew was soon rescued by the ship
"_Bijoux_ with Misson on board, who, with a few men, had escaped being"
"massacred by the natives. Misson, giving Tew an equal share of his gold"
"and diamonds, sailed away, while Tew managed to return to Rhode Island in"
"New England, where he settled down for a while. To show the honesty of"
"this man, being now affluent, he kept a promise to the friends in Bermuda"
"who originally set him up with a ship, by sending them fourteen times the"
original cost of the sloop as their just share of the profits.
"At last, Tew found the call of the sea and the lure of the ""grand account"""
"too great to resist, and he consented to take command of a pirate ship"
"which was to go on a cruise in the Red Sea. Arrived there, Tew attacked a"
"big ship belonging to the Great Mogul, and during the battle was mortally"
wounded.
"His historian tells us ""a shot carried away the rim of Tew's belly, who"
"would have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether, had not the"
Master Girl reminded him of them toward evening. He took the bit that
"hung in the corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse at once"
"ran up, breathing fire and flame; but he seized the moment when he came"
"running up to him with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his"
"mouth. Then he stood still, as gentle as a young lamb, and he had no"
"trouble bringing him to the stable. Then he went to his room again, and"
began to whistle and sing. In the evening the giant came home with his
"goats. ""Did you fetch the horse?"" he asked. ""Yes, master,"" said the"
"king's son. ""It would make a fine saddle-horse, but I just took it"
"straight to the stable."" ""I'll have to see that,"" said the giant, and"
"went into the stable. But there stood the horse, just as the king's son"
"had said. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you"
"could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Yesterday the master"
"chattered about the Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her"
"again. I wish master would show me the creature, for I surely would like"
"to see her,"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very simple and"
"stupid. ""You will get to see her in plenty of time,"" said the giant."
"On the third morning the giant went off again with his goats. ""To-day"
"you must go to the devil, and fetch me his tribute,"" said he to the"
"king's son. ""When you have done that, you may rest for the remainder of"
"the time, for you have come to a kind master, and you might as well know"
"it,"" and with that he went off. ""You may be a kind master,"" said the"
"king's son; ""yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of"
"it, but I think I'll look after your Master Girl a bit. You claim that"
"she belongs to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me what to"
"do,"" and with that he went in to her. And when the Master Girl asked him"
"what the giant had given him to do that day, he told her he must go to"
"the devil and fetch a tribute. ""But how will you go about it?"" asked the"
"Master Girl. ""You will have to tell me that,"" said the king's son, ""for"
"I have never been to the devil's place, and even though I knew the way"
miracle that the British Empire survived that life and death struggle
against a man of superhuman genius who was determined to effect its
overthrow. I have called special attention to the extent and
pertinacity of Napoleon's schemes for the foundation of a French
"Colonial Empire in India, Egypt, South Africa, and Australia; and"
"there can be no doubt that the events of the years 1803-13 determined,"
"not only the destinies of Europe and Napoleon, but the general trend"
of the world's colonization.
As it has been necessary to condense the story of Napoleon's life in
"some parts, I have chosen to treat with special brevity the years"
"1809-11, which may be called the _constans aetas_ of his career, in"
order to have more space for the decisive events that followed; but
even in these less eventful years I have striven to show how his
Continental System was setting at work mighty economic forces that
"made for his overthrow, so that after the _débâcle_ of 1812 it came to"
be a struggle of Napoleon and France _contra mundum_.
"While not neglecting the personal details of the great man's life, I"
have dwelt mainly on his public career. Apart from his brilliant
"conversations, his private life has few features of abiding interest,"
perhaps because he early tired of the shallowness of Josephine and the
Corsican angularity of his brothers and sisters. But the cause also
"lay in his own disposition. He once said to M. Gallois: ""Je n'aime pas"
"beaucoup les femmes, ni le jeu--enfin rien: _je suis tout à fait un"
"être politique_."" In dealing with him as a warrior and statesman, and"
"in sparing my readers details as to his bolting his food, sleeping at"
"concerts, and indulging in amours where for him there was no glamour"
"of romance, I am laying stress on what interested him most--in a word,"
I am taking him at his best.
"I could not have accomplished this task, even in the present"
"on a pretext, had called for drink, and vanished in the early morning,"
leaving a dead man behind him. Who was this man? Where did he come from?
Had he been missing since last night? On these inquiries the
"Superintendent launched several intelligent men, and then was forced for"
the time to turn his attention to the business of the day.
"To search a large town for a missing man takes time, and the searchers"
"did not happen to fall in with Company B of Procession 3, which at one"
"o'clock had mustered in Digby Square, prepared to march to the Public"
"Park. Had they done so, it might or might not have seemed to them worth"
"noticing that Company B of Procession 3, which was composed of"
"carpenters and joiners, had missed some one, namely the officer whom"
"they called their ""Marshal,"" and who was to have ordered their ranks and"
marched at their head; and the name of their Marshal was none other than
François Gaspard. The Superintendent himself was keeping watch over
"Company B, but, in a professionally Olympian scorn of processions, he"
"was far from asking or caring to know who the Marshal was, and indeed,"
"if he had known, he would scarcely have drawn such a lightning-quick"
inference as that the missing Marshal and the missing murderer were one
and the same. So Mr. Gaspard's absence was passed over with a few curses
"on his laziness, or, from the more charitable, a surmise that there had"
"been a misunderstanding, and Company B, having appointed a new Marshal,"
went on its way.
One demonstration of the public will is much like another in the shape
"it takes and the incidents it produces. This Sunday's was, however, as"
"friends and foes agreed, remarkable not only for the numbers who took"
"part, but still more for the spirit which animated it, and when the"
Premier and his colleagues made their appearance on the great platform
"there was no room to doubt that somehow, by his gifts or his faults, his"
"policy or his demagogic arts, his love of humanity or his adroit wooing"
"of popularity, Medland held a position in the eyes of the common people"
"suppressed, perhaps because of his great humility, was informed in a"
"vision that the emperor alluded to was Diocletian, and at the same"
time the torments and persecutions suffered by the Christian virgin
"Filomena, as well as her wonderful constancy, were also revealed to"
"him. There were some difficulties in the way of the Emperor Diocletian,"
which _incline_ the writer of the _historical_ account to incline
to the opinion that the young artist in his wisdom _may_ have made
"a mistake, and that the emperor may have been not Diocletian, but"
"Maximian. The facts, however, now admitted of no doubt; the relics"
were carried by the priest Francesco da Lucia to Naples; they were
enclosed in a case of wood resembling in form the human body; this
"figure was habited in a petticoat of white satin, and over it a crimson"
tunic after the Greek fashion; the face was painted to represent
"nature, a garland of flowers was placed on the head, and in the hands"
"a lily and a javelin with the point reversed, to express her purity"
and her martyrdom; then she was laid in a half-sitting posture in a
"sarcophagus, of which the sides were glass, and, after lying for some"
time in state in the chapel of the Torres family in the Church of Sant'
"Angiolo, she was carried in grand procession to Mugnano, a little town"
"about twenty miles from Naples, amid the acclamations of the people,"
working many and surprising miracles by the way.... Such is the legend
"of S. Filomena, and such the authority on which she has become within"
"the last twenty years one of the most popular saints in Italy.""--_Mrs."
"Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art_, p. 671."
"But, after all, the most extraordinary case of saint-manufacture is"
"not that of Philomena, but that of _Buddha_! I have not room for the"
"story here, but if any one wishes to know how the papacy made Buddha a"
"Christian saint, he will find the whole story, with the proofs, in _A"
"History of the Warfare of Science and Theology_, by Andrew D. White,"
"LL. D., late President and Professor of History at Cornell University,"
and until recently United States Ambassador to Germany.
"""I shall be ready enough for that; you can reckon on me."""
"How the day passed Grey never knew, and it was still broad daylight when"
"he and his comrades started for the gardens of Vauxhall, where it was"
the fashion to spend the evening hours when nothing more attractive
"offered, and where such music and such illuminations as the times had to"
"offer were to be enjoyed, and where ladies and their attendant beaux"
"fluttered about like so many gay butterflies, and found opportunity as"
the dusk fell for walks and talks of a more private nature in the bosky
alleys and shady paths than they could hope to gain in crowded routs and
"card-parties.  Supper could be obtained too, and pleasant little parties"
made up; and the fashionable world found it agreeable on these hot
summer nights to take their pleasure out in the open air.
"Grey detached himself from his friends upon the first opportunity, and"
"wandered alone through the gardens, avoiding encounters with persons he"
"knew, though often accosted with laugh and jest and challenge by masked"
"ladies, or young bloods eager to make friends with one whose face and"
"figure began to be known, owing to his successes in horsemanship with"
"Don Carlos, and his friendship with Lord Sandford.  But Grey made small"
"response to overtures, quickly shook himself free, and pursued his"
"solitary ramble, till at length a sound of gay voices, laughter, and"
"almost uproarious mirth, in which the tones of Lord Sandford could"
"plainly be heard, drew him to a wide open space where an illuminated"
"fountain seemed to have drawn a great concourse of people; and there,"
"amid a tossing crowd of gaudy gallants, and ladies with towering heads,"
"mincing, giggling, uttering little shrieks, little jests, or playing off"
"an infinitude of coquetries and artifices to attract admiration, he"
beheld the stately white-robed figure around which his thoughts and
fancies had been playing all through the long hours of the day.
"couple of days in bright little Brussels, arrived at Cologne. Most"
"travelers know to their cost how noisy, narrow, and unattractive are"
"the streets of this ancient Colonia Agrippina of the Romans,--how"
"persistent and wearying is the rattle of the vehicles over the rough,"
cobbly stones--how irritating to the nerves is the incessant shrieking
"whistle and clank of the Rhine steamboats as they glide in, or glide"
"out, from the cheerless and dirty pier. But at night, when these"
"unpleasant sounds have partially subsided, and the lights twinkle in"
"the shop-windows, and the majestic mass of the Cathedral casts its"
"broad shadow on the moonlit Dom-Platz, and a few soldiers, with"
"clanking swords and glittering spurs, come marching out from some dark"
"stone archway, and the green gleam of the river sparkles along in"
"luminous ripples,--then it is that a something weird and mystical"
"creeps over the town, and the glamour of ancient historical memories"
"begins to cling about its irregular buildings,--one thinks of the"
"legendary Three Kings, and believes in them, too,--of St. Ursula and"
her company of virgins; of Marie de Medicis dying alone in that
"tumbled-down house in the Stern-gasse,--of Rubens, who, it is said,"
"here first saw the light of this world,--of an angry Satan flinging his"
Teufelstein from the Seven Mountains in an impotent attempt to destroy
"the Dom; and gradually, the indestructible romantic spell of the Rhine"
"steals into the spirit of common things that were unlovely by day, and"
makes the old city beautiful under the sacred glory of the stars.
"Alwyn dined at his hotel, and then, finding it still too early to"
"retire to rest, strolled slowly across the Platz, looking up at the"
"sublime God's Temple above him, the stately Cathedral, with its"
"wondrously delicate carvings and flying buttresses, on which the"
moonlight glittered like little points of pale flame. He knew it of
"old; many and many a time had he taken train from Bonn, for the sole"
"pleasure of spending an hour in gazing on that splendid ""sermon in"
"stone,""--one of the grandest testimonies in the world of man's"
I didn't think you were going to...
feel that way.
I thought sometime you might want to come over and meet my sons.
Can we do that right now?
"Now as in ""now""?"
Yeah.
"Oh, good."
You're here.
You have to clean all this up.
Come on.
Come on.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Put away all this stuff.
All this stuff needs to be put away somewhere.
No.
Wait.
You're right.
This is better.
More kid-like.
Just play.
Do whatever you normally do.
Just be kids.
That's great.
Is that gonna fit in there?
"No, I don't think so."
Maybe you can put it in there.
I guess not.
"It looked like it would fit, but I guess not."
Wait.
Wait.
So I will transfer you my energy.
I will transfer my karma.
Here is my karma on you.
Jason!
You have a great aura.
Yes.
Jason!
Encouragement!
Yes!
This is a great way to stretch.
Yep.
You see?
You could do this with your partner at home.
Sure.
Let's ride this energy out!
Keep your chin up.
Yep.
"Yes, this fire has just started."
And we will not put it out.
What is he doing?
I don't really know that pose.
"Okay, now we go into the happy baby pose."
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Please regard me.
I'm sorry?
"Please, allow me."
To do what?
Regard me.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
"You are doing fantastic, my dear."
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Aren't we going back?
"We still have some time, right?"
For what?
I want to be with you a bit longer.
When he comes...
He'll take a while to get back.
Let's just go somewhere.
Where?
Anywhere.
Let's just look for a place.
"Ah, here."
They don't even have a front desk.
Isn't it the one outside?
Is it?
Let's try the second floor.
They're all empty.
No one's here.
This is crazy.
"- No, please don't."
- I think I'm going crazy.
Be patient.
Let's meet in Seoul.
He'll go nuts if he finds out.
But I want to have you.
So bad.
- Really?
"- Yes, really."
For real.
"Then, strip."
Everything?
Don't kill her.
Of course not.
"But you, on the other hand..."
No!
Don't!
"Please, please."
No!
"Please, please."
David!
Please!
No!
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
My God.
Try the other zones.
Who's in the basement?
Let's see what's down there.
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"Oh, my God!"
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
Just stay in bed.
Leave me alone!
It's great the way you sell yourself.
Why me?
You're the one who yelled.
You can't eat up everything in the fridge.
Why not?
I bought the food.
Why do I have to sell myself anyway?
"Because you want to live here, you bum."
You're nuts.
Why don't you stay here?
Would it bother you if Marco lived here a while?
"No, why?"
He asked me.
I'd like him to stay.
"Yeah, sure."
Why not?
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?
What?
Why?
I don't want to have to sell myself.
Don't worry.
I've done it for you.
Thanks.
"But no, thanks."
Stay here!
After all the trouble I went to!
I don't want trouble!
I just want to live here!
You're nuts!
It was a brilliant fight.
And then I fell?
I suppose I swooned away like a woman.
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
It was very hard.
- I remember the gun was shaking so.
- You see?
You're stronger than you knew.
And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Drink your milk.
Where are the others?
They've gone.
- Gone?
- Mm-hm.
But how will we get back to Paris?
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's peaceful.
It's discreet.
Chopin.
Do you love me?
"God help me, I do."
You are superb.
Don't.
What is wrong?
I'm frightened.
Of me?
Certain acts are unseemly.
They are unsuitable.
Chopin.
- No.
It's our dog.
Uh-huh.
When will Mom be back?
Hmm?
Um...
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where should we wait?
Hand me the list.
I'll see how much we've collected.
- The money too?
"- Yeah, I'll count it."
Okay.
- Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.
You'd swear a doctor had written it.
It's barely legible.
Looking forward to school?
- Well...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.
A lot more going on there.
We've already collected a tidy sum.
"If somebody else gives as much as him, we'll have done pretty well."
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how much more we get.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I have to go to the toilet.
( indistinct chatter )
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?
No.
Are you sure?
It's very good.
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Stay away from me!
Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not going to change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
Yes.
Why?
They just found another victim.
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
I...
I'm losing my mind.
It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."
Me?
"I just take, take, take."
So I have to take this.
Just...
Don't start crying.
Okay?
And don't kill yourself.
- Hey.
- Have you met her yet?
- Who?
- Audrey.
Your date.
Do you usually meet them first?
"Grace, if you want me to call this off..."
No.
I'm just curious.
"Sometimes I meet them, sometimes I don't."
Just seems so strange.
I will finish it.
"But it isn't, see?"
I'm finishing it.
Hello Jerd.
This is Je speaking.
Yes.
Are you free now?
I've got a job for you.
It's for Adidas.
"You can, right?"
So you're free?
Okay.
Where are you now?
"Okay, I will send you the file."
Bye.
Yoon.
Save the file for me now.
"No, I won't."
Yoon.
No.
This isn't the time to be afraid of losing a job.
Have you lost it man?
I'm not afraid.
"You are not afraid, huh?"
What do you call this?
I said I'll send the rest tomorrow morning.
You have another half.
You won't make it in time.
You taught me that freelance work is all about being responsible.
"If you can't make it, don't take the job, remember?"
But I will finish in time.
Is this in time?
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
- A week?
- Sorry?
A week?
"Yes, that's right."
It strangely matches.
What does?
Cute.
What breed is your dog?
"You see, her appetite for dogs..."
"I mean, her attachment to dogs is strong."
She hates it when others get near her food.
He's a half-breed.
We're raising him for the summer.
I'll be going now.
Do you mime as well?
I'm sure the murderer is one of them.
- Wait!
Wait please!
- You foolish kid!
Please stop!
You can't kill me now.
Why not?
That detective.
He's suspicious of you all.
Suspicious?
He's noticed that you all are foxes.
What?
How do you know that?
By what evidence?
"Yeah, he's lying."
I'm not lying.
Please listen to me.
Pretend?
What?
"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia?
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
No!
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than hour ago.
Did you hear anything?
no.
Huh.
You have a slow leak.
"Guido, he fix."
You make-a such a nice new road.
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.
Even though you not a Ferrari.
"You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare"
- absolutely free!
"- Look, I get all my tires for free."
"I like your style, eh?"
You drive the hard bargain.
OK.
Luigi make you a new deal.
"You buy one tire, I give you three for free!"
"Oh, would you look at that?"
"Ramone, Ramone!"
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.
"No, no, no, no."
Deal me out.
Pass.
"No, thank you."
"- No, no, no, no."
No.
- This is it.
My last offer.
"You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!"
Done.
"You interested, you call me."
You know where I am.
Ah!
Stop!
Let me...
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.
[Both moaning]
"Oh, my gosh."
That was so good.
You are fucking insane.
"I don't know, professor."
This scratch looks pretty old.
The Ark's magnetic.
"Yeah, let's check it out later, come on."
There's no engine!
That'll keep 'em out for a while.
And us in.
"Shh, quiet!"
Sound the alarm.
"Come on, MacGyver, they know we've escaped."
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
"That's a shame, Frankie."
Lot of unanswered questions.
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
"You and me, right now."
"- Well, I..."
No.
- What?
"Daddy, you can beat him."
Come on.
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.
"You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me."
- That's right.
"- All right, you got a fight."
"Greg, get my gloves."
"- I'm sorry, bro."
"- Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back."
- He was so fast.
- You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
- We have nothing.
- I don't know what to say.
- I gave it my best.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.
"- Hey, you have the time?"
"- Aw, not you again."
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.
I can't get my bearings.
You need a stiff drink.
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.
BALLROOM
These things still go on!
Anyway...
Where'd that guy go with my suitcase?
- You got conned.
So they stole that too.
Now I have nothing left.
Oh well.
At least you can't lose anything that way.
"Well, well."
Biberkopf!
You've been gone a long time.
A beer and two patties.
Coming up.
- Wait.
- What?
Let me.
So you help out here?
No male admirers around?
"- No, none."
"- In that case, another beer."
Cheers.
Who's that with Cilly?
"A beer driver, maybe."
Can't believe she'd go for that type.
His name's Biberkopf.
I know him from before.
Just out of prison.
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
I see.
No nausea?
No vertigo?
Here.
Now?
No.
Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky.
But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time.
You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes.
Well.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
"You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here."
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."
Get off the street!
- Run!
- Hide!
Here come the goon goons!
Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.
Yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
Slug.
Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
You could have got someone to post it for you.
"Oh, Come on."
You could've got your mum to post it.
I don't bloody know.
You wanted an alibi.
- Maybe you sent it.
You're blaming me..
- Bullshit!
"Oh, it's you."
You sent it!
Don't listen to him.
"Chris, just fucking admit it!"
Enough.
I want a confession.
We'll keep playing until we get one.
"Truth or Dare, Chris?"
Dare.
You fuck.
Dare it is.
One moment.
"Luke, Luke!"
"- Luke, what the fuck?"
- Help us.
"- I can't, I can't."
- Please.
"We used to call this... the ""acid test."""
Easy to improvise.
"Very, um... useful for motivating prisoners."
"This next part... isn't terribly pretty, I'm afraid."
Open up.
Open up.
"Now, this is much easier... if you relax."
You've got to show them...
You have to stick it right up them...
you have to flabbergast them.
- What do I do?
- Put in first gear.
- Where's the handle?
- There.
Put it into second.
"On the left, by your leg."
Press the clutch at the same time.
Your left leg!
- Your left leg!
- Which is that?
The clutch!
- Which?
- Your left leg!
The left pedal!
- Fucking pedal!
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
"Hit me, to check I'm not dreaming!"
Must be that southern wine!
I'd better give it up.
- I can't believe it!
- Good God!
It can't be possible!
- Who's the crazy guy?
- The steel-drum champion!
"Go to it, Jean-Marie!"
Super-dooper!
He plays on Radio Luxembourg.
"- Put it into third, Goubi."
- If I can.
Can we spend some time together?
You're so beautiful.
- You're not serious.
"- No, you're really beautiful."
I envy you.
"- Please, stop."
You're much prettier.
- Not at all.
- How old are you?
- How about you?
Thirty-one.
I'm older.
You are?
Then I should call you Big Sis?
How did you meet Joongrae?
It was just a coincidence.
He wanted to have a drink so we did.
What do you want to have?
"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.
It's cute.
"No, it's a piece of crap."
Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike.
Who told you that?
The restaurant owner told me.
That man always talks crap.
See?
We haven't got a proper officer so we get pushed about like potboys.
He's not a proper officer.
Never seems to tire.
Hard to catch him off guard.
"He let you off light, Sharpe, back in the village."
So why so hard?
"He's just not right, Cooper."
He's not happy being an officer.
And mark my words he'll bring us bad luck
We'll do it tomorrow.
In the mountains.
Vale.
The fire's started.
Prepare to fight
Down
Get down!
Or I'll kill him
Rifles!
To me!
"Oh, my God."
"Young Perkins, sir."
Not a sound.
No!
No!
"Perkins, I want you to protect this pennant with your life."
"Yes, sir."
"Never say die, Perkins."
"Never again, sir."
They'll be back for them two.
Up!
Keep moving!
How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
- Jane!
- Mum...
We're here now.
Shh.
"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
"- Let's get him out, okay?"
"- Please, please, get me out of here!"
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build....
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?
Yeah.
"You gotta watch, because when it rains, the water comes up really quick."
"Joey, listen to me."
You go find a phone.
You call 911.
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
"All right, Joey?"
Go!
Go!
"- Well, where's he going?"
"- Well, this grate is locked."
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.
Just don't!
"Ben, listen to me."
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise you that.
"But you gotta do me a favor, okay?"
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
I'm tired.
I've got to do something.
Come on!
Let's go and take care of this.
"Tom, I can't find Franz."
"Please give him my best regards, and give him this."
This is the video footage.
I've decided not to do the project.
He'll be upset then.
"I'm sorry, but I think it's for the best."
I'm upset too.
Didn't you like the mask?
The mask was great.
I'm not so certain.
It's not your fault.
Who's fault is it then?
Certainly it's not yours.
Take care Tom.
I've been waiting for you.
I had the late shift.
Now I've got no time.
What are you doing?
Shopping free of charge
Help!
Do you live here now?
You came here to ask me that?
Something has happened.
What?
A supermarket was held up.
A woman was shot.
Is he shoplifting now?
What are you up to there?
- Also why would we die?
- Can I interrupt for a second?
I just want to say that I love both of you guys.
Trent more than I did before.
OK.
"Well, just so you know, I hate both of you."
Do you want any oil before we start?
No.
"Please, I... that wasn't in the script."
Sounds like we're ready to go.
Let's get started.
Ah.
"Three, two, one."
Hit it!
None of my moves are sexual.
I apologize.
- Wow!
"- Yeah, wow."
That was an amazing story.
"Hey, Danny."
You have to tell us if you got the ring back when you get back from the bathroom.
"Hey, yeah."
OK.
Just give me a few seconds.
- Flashbacks are exhausting.
"- Hell, yeah."
So look.
The stripper scouts turned out that they loved us.
And so did the audience.
So...
Anyway.
"OK, well."
That blockhead
Where is he?
He is exhausted!
It's good to drink wine.
The blockhead is here
What are you doing?
What do you want?
Want to collect our bones?
Shut up!
A horse stance!
Master said I can go when the incense finishes
Now it's all burnt down!
Burnt down?
Not yet!
Look carefully
"Be patient, kid."
Want to go?
Horse stance!
Want to sleep?
Horse stance
Keep on horse stance!
I've been in stance for the whole night
"I'm so out of shape, food doesn't matter now"
I'm so tired!
"Mr. Ghost, I'm not the one that killed you!"
I've nothing to do with you
"Please, no!"
Master!
Master!
Master!
Forget it!
If I inform Master now
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
YOu!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
HOW did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight and go skinny-dipping.
Yeah!
You know?
"Like,I just want to be naked in the dark ocean with you."
Naked.
You know?
Johnny?
"No,no,no,no,no."
"Everything's fine,it's just..."
What?
I like you.
"I just need you to,like,taper it back a little."
Just a little.
Like this.
You don't need to do that.
It's all good.
We're cool.
"You're kinda,like,bam, instant on me,bam?"
Yeah.
"and I need to,like,ease into it."
Have a little flirty time.
I don't want flirty time.
Flirty time's awesome.
"Flirty time is not awesome,okay?"
This is awesome.
This.
"This is awesome,okay?"
Come on.
"Don't be afraid of it,Bella."
You have absolutel no patience.
You're going to drive yourself crazy for nothing.
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
Are you parents divorced?
My mom is dead
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.
What happened there...?
Just some kids.
At school.
Where do you go to school anyway?
"I never see you.... ...Owen, listen."
...What...?
You have to hit back.
You have to hit back hard.
I can't ...There are three
Then you hit back even harder.
Hit them harder than you dare And then they'll stop.
...What if they hit me back?
You have a knife.
Yeah...
But what if that didn't stop them?
I'll help you.
But..
You're a girl...
I'm a lot stronger than you think I am
...I have to get in there...!
...Move Move...
- Mr. Zoric...?
"- Yes, Owen?"
I was wondering.
About the after school strength training?
Can people still sign up?
...You like to get strong?
Okay.
Four o'clock.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
Park Chun-bae
No.
That's not it.
It's you.
No.
This is all your doing.
We were playing!
I don't care.
Dad lets us play.
I don't care what your dad does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- So start already.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.
- Jean-Claude?
- What?
I don't have a hard-on!
So what?
Me neither.
In whose honor should we get it up?
I always wake up with one.
You're probably too filthy...
There's so much dirt id take a bulldozer to dig it out.
Come on.
It feels great...
I can't.
I'll start bleeding again.
"Well, how about your feet?"
We could clean them up a bit.
Purify the air...
You'll be all right...
Stop worrying.
Is all in your head and you're getting obsessed...
"Feels good, huh?"
Feel any lighter?
You're real pretty!
You're almost desirable...
Hands off!
What hands?
"Yours, faggot!"
Don't be ashamed...
I'm not ashamed.
I just don't want to.
I don't want to...
How do you know?
If you've never tried it?
With prehistoric animals.
And Nazis...
I think.
Still drawing?
Sure.
"I was published in ""Parapluie""."
I saw.
Like it?
A lot.
You know I like what you do.
They cropped it an added yellow print.
It doesn't matter.
It's good.
I have to go.
It's late.
Kremlin-Bicêtre is far.
"""Whenever painters try to cast off representation, they do so destroying painting and their survival as painters""."
Any good?
It's amazing.
Do you agree?
To some extent.
We follow our own path.
But it costs you sometimes a lot.
You can't know.
I understand.
I think I do.
I saw Christine.
And?
She didn't go her own way.
She wants a relationship.
Hence the older man.
You want a relationship?
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
You've gotta be the youngest attorney in the firm to sit on a case this big.
I don't know.
"Listen, here, hey."
"I was gonna give this to you at dinner, but it feels appropriate here."
Danny.
"Oh, my God."
I saw it and I thought of you.
It's beautiful.
"Here, here, here."
- Can we afford this?
I had some stocks pay out dividends.
You know.
Can't a guy do something nice for this girl?
"Yes, he can."
I love you.
"Wait, you didn't get this off that dead girl, did you?"
Wow.
Wow.
- Just checking.
I'm just... pushed too far to his throat.
Did you know...
- I don't know.
Tell me how.
Say it.
"Yeah, I would've."
- How?
"I don't know, okay?"
"No, it was an accident."
I didn't want him dead.
"You must've choked it back into his windpipe, right?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was an accident."
Here.
Take this.
You look half frozen.
Thank you.
It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.
I was supposed to fix the gate.
It's...
It's fine.
It's no big deal.
You could have been hurt.
And...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.
"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.
I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?
You want a ripe mango?
Come on!
I'm in the mall!
Yes sis.
"Okay, bye!"
How's Joy?
.
Why are you looking for her?
What do you want to hear?
.
That she's okay?
.
And she's not looking for you?
You two have incredibly think faces.
Don't you ever mess with my sister again.
I saw Migs yesterday.
He even asked how you're doing.
What did you say?
.
Of course I nagged him!
Oh my!
He was even with that Bela!
After what he did to you?
.
I can't believe his guts!
"Sis, what I did was right, wasn't it?"
"Sis, is it really like that when you're pregnant?"
You're not just craving for the food.
You're also craving for the place where you want to eat!
My gosh.
"And you know, this place is too far!"
Even taxis can't get here anymore.
I don't care who it is.
I'll cream him!
I wish you the best of luck.
Let's go!
We'll join forces and clobber him!
Roger!
Bout...
Dimension...
Dangaioh...!
Think you can get away with this?
You bunch of space trash!
Flame Arrow!
No...!
What...
What's going on?
!
Why doesn't he fall?
The Flame Arrow doesn't affect him.
What do you mean?
He seemed to absorb it.
Dangaioh's attack doesn't faze him...?
Burning Blow...!
Good!
Burning Blow is out of control...
Stop it!
It's too dangerous.
What is that thing?
Condition indicators dropping...
The three of them are unconscious.
Prepare the shock pulses!
Put all your efforts into the pilots' life support systems.
"So, this is the power of our enemy...?"
- That's what I mean.
- We're not a thing.
- We're not married.
"- Oh, no."
You're not married?
- No.
"- No, we're just friends."
- Aren't you pregnant?
"- No, I'm not..."
I'm not pregnant.
"What happens, Martha, if you have a child out of wedlock?"
You'd better do something.
You'd better pop a question today.
"Would you just pull over, Meemaw, and let Martha..."
"- Martha, would you drive?"
"- No, no, no."
We're on vacation.
Your mom's out of town.
She left me in charge for once.
"No, she left me in charge, by the way, Meemaw."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"Um, just making a stop."
"Well, you have an appointment."
"I do, but you know what?"
[Tires squealing]
Chip:
Meemaw.
[Elevator dings]
Christine:
Hello.
[Cell phone rings]
- Hello.
Wash your hands first.
Where did that hair come from?
- Where?
- There?
That black thing.
Oh!
There's another one.
"Oh, wait."
It's the full moon!
I must be turning into the beast!
"Yeah, that moustache could do with a trim, too."
- I can see some...
- Ssh!
- Rhydian?
"- 'Listen, mate.'"
I've got a bit of a vomiting situation with my substitute parents.
They're throwing up everywhere.
Oh!
"Yeah, and I'm on bucket duty so I'm not going to be able to make it out."
"OK, well..."
"Oh, there she blows."
"Right, I've got to go."
No Rhydian?
What is it with everyone today?
Must be the full moon.
"You know, we don't have to do this."
- What?
- Stay here.
I don't care how your parents try and justify this.
It's still a cage.
It's still unnatural.
We agreed.
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
I'm in a fox's den!
So what!
"Whether I'm killed by a fox, or get rich off of their pictures, you'll never kill me, so don't call me again!"
Honey.
"I'm hanging up, you bastard."
I'm risking my life for this.
Live or die.
Turn into a fox!
"Honey, please change!"
- What?
- Turn into a fox!
- You don't change when you do this?
- No.
You're still the best!
Welcome!
Tickets are sold here!
"Hey, they didn't buy any tickets."
"Dad, what's with all these people?"
It's a sign that everything will be alright.
The cop.
Welcome.
May I help you?
I came to see a circus performance.
You came to the right place.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
"No, I don't know her."
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Who is she anyway?
A dead woman.
She was found axed near Nam Mountain here.
"You're busy selling your gear, so you don't need mine."
"You've got it all wrong, mate."
"- Shh, it's fine, fine."
"Let's call the boss, see what he thinks, shall we?"
"For-for fuck's sake, Jonesy."
"Just, this shit doesn't grow on trees."
You know what it's like.
I'm on hold on your tip-off...
"Just go away, just go!"
I was just explaining about the private party.
This isn't...
Not a problem...
Get a cab
Be careful.
Why don't you join us?
I wouldn't wanna intrude.
"Maybe, uh, maybe another time."
- Guide me.
- Swivel round and rock back.
"Yeah, that's it."
Okay.
"Come inside, I insist."
"Quick, come on."
"You can do it, come on."
Just go for it!
Gem!
Fuck!
Let's see how you like it.
No!
"Gem, listen to me."
Focus.
There's a saw.
J.E.
Pepper!
Pepper!
Here we are!
Come on!
"Come on, digger!"
"Come on, there you go!"
"There you go, digger!"
Go get it!
Go get it!
Fetch!
"Fetch, digger!"
"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
I miss the track team.
And I miss the basketball team.
We have no time for other sports.
Lacrosse is hard enough.
Forget it.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu all of a sudden?
Are you at all interested in lacrosse?
"Showing up late, and all."
Bringing your weird friends.
You're a bit strange yourself.
"""My name Minmin."""
Can you play lacrosse?
You use this?
It's for throwing the ball.
This is no good.
You must control the ball.
Shoot at the goal.
"Oh, OK."
It's quite difficult.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey!
help!
I need help!
Hey!
"please, help me!"
What am I to do?
Task Force 7 needs more students adept in martial arts.
select a few students.
Request payment by wire.
And the other request?
We've dispatched 3 students.
Payment is complete.
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
"No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me."
But if he can't control his power -- it's all right.
How is it all right?
"By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his emotions."
Just like I knew would happen.
"He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready to give us a hug."
[ Grunts ]
Close enough.
Guys!
Wait!
You have somewhere else to be!
What?
There's no time!
Run to the big donut!
Run!
"Uh, okay!"
I would've liked a hug.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ] No way!
"No way, no way, no way, no way!"
Ooh!
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Uh...
You're just opening?
I thought I was late!
Late?
We always open at 7:30 on Sundays.
"Ahh, duh!"
"Well, you're just in time."
Here you go!
My treat!
A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.
"- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite."
"It has to be really good vanilla, though."
"You should, um, check out the place down the street, in the mini-mall on Olamar."
Best shakes in town.
"- Sorry, it looks like a pigsty."
- Do you spend wisely.
So it is now.
What an ugly bag.
"- There are more than 200,000."
"- There are actually 500,000."
Jaså.
We clean up after yourself.
- I've messed up!
- It is you who have fucked you!
I salute the way from Vijay.
He got 10 years!
Shit.
Moment
"No, let it sit."
- Your fucking snitch.
"- Yes, I'm a fucking snitch."
Come on.
Hold this.
Wait here.
- They have several informants.
"- Bye, Dad."
You can even see in the new documents.
I send them over a secure line.
"Well, and if I need to check other cases ..."
Can I call you back?
What are you doing here?
Do you know why we tolerate your kind?
Because I just fit your work.
But you have gone too far.
Now there shall be no rules anymore.
I have not done anything.
Mom.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's fine.
`
The baby's okay.
She's okay.
She ?
It's a girl.
Sweet.
Cool.
"Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have.
I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
Or sleeping anywhere.
"Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going..."
it'll be fun.
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.
"- Oh, my God, the yard guy?"
"- Yeah, I know."
"What was I supposed to do, wait for you?"
You weren't coming back.
I wanted you to tell me the truth.
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.
"Well, hot damn, welcome to the club."
- I love that guy.
- You're not the only one.
"- You had me three months ago, and you left."
- I want to make that up to you.
Oh my dick!
"Now, you are charged with murdering."
You can employ your own lawyer to defend for you.
Do you have any lawyer?
Yes!
Chan Mon-gut!
Shit!
"Mister, are you ready?"
I've found Master.
Good!
Let's go.
"After the shaving, no hair will be left."
"You can't regret, Mister,"
do you want a second thought?
Come on.
Stop!
"Fleas are living in my armpit, why do you stop me?"
May I have a little bit freedom?
"Mister, do you want to go on?"
"Yes, please."
Foon is being charged with hom4cide in Hong Kong.
What?
Yes.
Hey!
What?
Are you going to save him?
How?
"If you don't, he will die."
People will die sooner or later!
You are smart and wise!
I can't help...
He committed crime in HK which is governed by British law.
- No.
Mr Thomas.
Can you tell me what you remember last?
Well.
I came out of my apartment.
and I walked...
My head was spinning and I fell down.
After that.
I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it.
Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What?
You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes.
But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen.
Mr Thomas.
you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes.
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
Have some coffee.
It'll wake you up.
can we have the check?
What are you doing?
I got to go.
We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
do you?
That's very annoying.
but it'd look funny on my table.
Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
Come.
Panju.
Who is it?
Manoj?
Yes.
"Yes, that's me."
And you are?
We are coming from Kanyakumari police station.
We want some details.
Is there a problem?
Shall we talk inside?
"Okay, come in."
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's position...
"If you change it, he will get hurt later."
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
-You're not trained.
-Since when?
I meant you're not trained to work as part of this team.
There will be other missions.
When you're ready.
"But for now, stay put."
-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.
Ugh.
When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks.
My mentor.
My king.
I thought he trusted me.
Trust?
They don't even trust us with the basics.
They've got a secret H.Q. in space.
What else aren't they telling us?
I have a better question.
Why didn't we leave with Speedy?
What is Project Cadmus?
Don't know.
But I can find out.
COMPUTER:
Access denied.
-Heh.
Wanna bet?
Whoa.
How are you doing that?
Same system as the Batcave.
COMPUTER:
No!
Not again.
Get...
Go back!
Frank.
Frank.
"Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream."
You were having another kid.
"Maureen's the last one, right?"
Tell me she's the last one!
She's the last one.
"Oh, thank God."
It was horrible.
This baby had teeth!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
"Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now."
"So, heat it is."
"Frank, we'll get through this."
We always do.
I'm here for you.
The kids love you.
Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
"And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm gonna go downstairs.
"Oh, Sue, don't do that."
I haven't showered in days.
"I meant the kitchen, Frank."
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
Only if I get hit by a bus.
A medical friend?
-Why it interests so much to you?
-Or a medical friend?
And if outside thus?
"So that by your part, we have finished."
You were wanted who it.
"In agreement, but I can run?"
no?
-Until the shutdown of the street car.
-In agreement.
"It starts, damn it."
-It does not start?
"-No, it does not start."
First you invite to me and soon it does not start.
You had to fail to me indeed now?
Eh!
taken care of!
-I do not touch myself.
"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.
For here.
-Let go of the hair. let it go!
- You will never change.
"We go, only I have requested you a little kiss."
-You kiss with the hands.
"-But, only with one."
What do you want?
-To where you go?
They see here.
We speak.
It vetoes the devil.
You have what you deserve.
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
- Even money Stoker don't go the distance!
- Twenty says he does!
"I'll take that, and as much more as you got!"
Break it up!
Come on!
Nelson's working on his belly!
Stoker don't like it there!
Who does?
- What you trying to do?
Cop a Sunday?
- What's the matter?
Can't you take it?
"It looks like a home run, and it is a..."
"No, it's going to fall inside."
- You're doing swell!
"- How're you doing, Stoke, huh?"
"Okay, fella!"
"Okay, let's see that!"
That will be all right!
"Take it easy, Stoke!"
Take it easy!
There we are!
Give them a show!
"One more heat, and we'll call it a day!"
"Sure thing, Danny!"
Sure thing!
You're doing fine!
You're doing fine!
- I told you I'm gonna take this guy!
- He never laid a glove on us!
Ten seconds!
"Don't forget, if you try to slug with him, he'll kill you!"
Kelly?
- Kelly Donovan.
- Jen!
I heard you were back in town.
Used to babysit me.
- And then I used to party with her.
- This woman is crazy.
- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.
"- Well, sit, drink."
"- Uh, I shouldn't."
"I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?"
"- Take a night off, it's good for the soul."
- Great for the soul.
"Oh, wow."
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
- You gonna stop me?
"- Let it be, Frederick."
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.
"What you got, boy?"
Try that again.
Back off.
Back off.
- We don't fight each other.
- I want out of this house.
- Why can't we go into town?
The war is like a time bomb for everyone who stuck their neck out.
How did you recognize me?
You said my name right away.
Your voice.
It hasn't changed.
"Like in the past, when you'd brief us before we'd go."
I'll visit again soon.
Maybe with good news.
"Whatever you'll do, good luck."
"The children would say ""Mazzel and broche""."
Ok.
Thanks.
More chicken and we're also out of orange juice.
"Ab, come on."
-Orange juice.
I like to have a full fridge.
In case something happens.
What happens?
-Anything.
War.
-You and your war.
There.
-Thank you.
Juice.
And juice.
I called you at the office earlier.
-I wasn't there.
And you weren't there yesterday or the day before yesterday.
That's true.
I was away for work.
-But they didn't know where you were.
Jealous?
Why aren't you trying anything on?
Did you take your meds?
"What do you mean, did I take my meds?"
Of course.
"For God's sake, Mom."
Ha-ha-ha.
"It's just, you don't spend money like this when you're on them."
"- What are you saying, hm?"
- Nothing.
It's nothing.
Just having a good time with your friends.
Isn't that all right?
"Just because I'm sick from time to time, I can't have a good time?"
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We're having a good time.
See?
That jacket is gorgeous.
You see that jacket?
"It's beautiful, right?"
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, with the shoes."
"Oh, my God, it's perfect."
"Come on, baby."
Just try something on.
Try these on.
Wanna try these on?
They're really cute.
We'll get three of these.
We'll get one for you and one for Grace.
Let's get three of them.
"- Thanks, Robin."
You're awesome.
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
"-Quick, what is it?"
-A little memento.
"We fly from such a great distance, with a noble mission."
and you steal in a supermarket.
That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers.
-Thank you.
-All right.
Hello.
What does this mean?
We can't figure out the process in which this works.
-Can you give us some advice?
-What is in the can?
Great.
But we can't see in there.
"Do you have matches, doctor?"
No!
"Jeez, it's petrol!"
Where did you get it?
This must go immediately!
-What if someone saw you?
-It was lying in front of the house.
Unattended.
"The man who owns this, saved a long time for it."
-Worked.
Went without food.
-Really?
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
I've been saving all my life!
You're so tall.
Get lost!
So sorry.
Goodbye.
"David, sit and eat with us."
I've to work.
Thanks.
Thank God having David here.
I'll never know how to deal with those members.
Like it?
We can change it till you like it.
Can you stop spending money to me this way?
"When you did something wrong, sent me gift."
Now you buy me a car.
So what?
I'm not that greedy.
You know how bad that makes me feel?
What?
Aren't I nice to you?
You just walked out on me.
Why did we've to split up?
You really want to know?
Tell me.
"You're ill-tempered, stubborn, give me no sense of security..."
"Ok, cut it out."
"You're not my cup of tea, ok?"
Then imagine me to be coffee.
"Milk tea, tea and coffee mix, anything."
"Michael, let's just be friends."
"It's all my fault, ok?"
"Lisa, is everything ok?"
This is your tea.
Not now.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I keep it running perfect.
"It's Tony's sister, she did it."
She's as weird as he is.
"Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly and continuously without interference from your sister."
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- It's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"Hey, wait for me."
"Come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
Okay.
Less gay it is.
Great!
"I'm gonna give Wes a call, see what he thinks of the glasses idea."
"Oh, Jack."
He has no idea what he just...
Anticlimax.
What's wrong?
My boyfriend back home thinks that college is gonna make me some sort of... sex robot.
Tell me about it.
Mine thinks it's gonna turn me into a brainwashed sex doll.
You know what?
We should teach them a lesson.
Yeah?
If they're gonna treat us like that... maybe we should just act like it.
Yeah!
"Okay, close your eyes."
You tricked me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- That.
- Ouch!
Not too hard!
Stop!
You stop!
"Oh, you're so sexy!"
I feel so much better!
Me too.
Pillow fights fix everything.
"You know, I heard that but I always thought it was a sham."
A pillow sham?
"Ooh, good one."
I've never done that before... with a girl...
(voice cracking):
including... my poor wife.
(creaky door opens)
"Oh, hi."
I need to switch rooms.
This guy is bumming me out.
I don't know if you have any singles open or...
Silence!
"Now that we have you, we don't need this frail, old man."
"Well, that was a stupid move."
You're all under arrest.
(dramatically):
For murder!
(surf rolling)
"Aw, this soaks deck."
"Hey there, Chief."
You mind if I pick up here tomorrow?
Say between 1:00 and 4:00?
"See, I'm a cable installer..."
"Good, because our cable is out."
We missed the last Mad Men.
You will fix our cable.
"Oh, this will be easy."
Good luck.
We've tried everything.
"Oh, so pirates couldn't fix their cable?"
That's right.
"Exactly, so let me do what I do."
Caw!
Caw!
PIRATE:
It is working!
Go!
Thank you.
Get out!
Do you still love me?
I gave you my reasons.
Do you still love me?
"Say ""I do not love you."""
Say it!
Say it!
I do not love you.
You're a liar!
"You did the right thing, coming to see me."
I do not have anyone else.
You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?
Yes.
"You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love."
Only one course remains open to you.
What do I have to do?
There's someone you should meet.
Who?
His name is Guibourg.
Who is he?
He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.
Where shall I find him?
Monsieur Guibourg?
Yes?
I need your help.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the Marquise de Montespan.
And how may I help you?
I need to reclaim a man's love.
Are you helping him with his homework?
"Oh, ."
No.
He does it all himself.
"He's getting a ""d."" maybe you should help him."
"Oh, no."
We do.
We do.
We totally do.
"It's just that we can't help him, 'cause we don't really understand it ourselves."
"Okay, okay."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to set aside some extra time...
An evening next week...
To teach parents a math class.
Oh!
That would be so...
Wait.
What?
A class for parents?
Is there a problem?
No.
That just sounds like a lot of work...
For you.
"Welcome, parents."
I'm sure we're all thrilled
"To be here on a night when ""the mentalist"" is on,"
But tonight we're gonna learn...
excuse me.
Ms. Rinsky?
How wonderful.
An interruption.
Here.
Look at this one.
"Oh, that's great."
Great.
With the smoke around Jivver's face.
Yeah.
So how's Hallie?
Looks like...
"you guys are an item now, huh?"
No.
"No, not an item."
Definitely not.
"She's a very nice girl, but um, she doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"
"Well, you're a big boy."
I'm sure you can handle... her.
"Hey, um, I wanted to ask you did you tell her to pursue me?"
Uh...
- Hello there Miss homebody.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
For what?
Did you forget my big screen debut deal?
We're going to my L.A. Red carpet premiere.
Hello.
"What do you think, Johnson?"
I think she's dead.
No excuses.
Seven was supposed to tell you.
Yeah.
"Well, he didn't."
"Oh, my god, I did actually."
It's just that you had your head buried in those photos and you didn't notice.
"Well, can I wear this?"
Mukesh.
Come here.
I don't care what people will think of me...
But you will never be able to face anyone again!
Put the knife in me!
What?
You don't have to kill me!
Insert it in a little bit!
Sarika!
I'll break open the door!
He will kill both of us!
Good!
We will die together like star-crossed lovers!
I am warning you for the last time Sarika!
That felt good.
First class first!
It was never Johnny who betrayed me...
It has always been you.
"And today, you want to get away again."
Not this time!
This is Mukesh.
is Johnny there?
"Who, Karpov?"
Yes.
He took off.
To Mauritius.
The lucky fucker ran into a bag of cash!
Johnny!
"Brother, we have reached."
Where are you?
We have been waiting outside the train station.
Are you coming?
-Aliens.
What?
-All this for nothing.
They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
"The way he talks, you'd think he had something there."
Excuse me.
Hey.
Look at the dude.
- Come on.
Let's give him the works.
"- All right, kiddo."
"- Hey, watch out!"
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
"All right, come on!"
Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
"How'd you get it, Crab?"
I hoisted it over the transom in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
"Boy, we'll be in the money now."
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
"Hi, Soapy!"
"- Soapy, look what we got."
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
Where did the husband spring from?
He had left her?
Left her where?
A husband is no baggage to be carried around!
He's left on a pilgrimage.
That's wonderful!
A thorn out of my path!
But he will return.
How's that?
He has a return ticket.
God!
I'll have the railways cancel his ticket!
I want Laxmi!
I've no interest in life without Laxmi anymore!
Has Kishan paid you his rent?
Not in the last 6 months!
Haribhai?
I'm in a hurry...
See you later.
Look after my connection;
I'll go after the collection!
Who's throwing the litter around?
That's no litter...
Siraj!
What are you doing here?
And what's this?
Have you left Grand Hotel?
Yes.
This set-up is my own.
Have you bought it then?
What's that?
A Hindu name?
- We need to smash things all over your body.
- Yes!
- No.
- Yes.
- We need to build up your tolerance to beatings.
- Hence the smashing.
"- We used a trash can, but Dennis wanted to use a chair."
- I think he's ready.
- That's way too excessive at this point.
- That guy's ready.
- He's not ready for a chair.
"- I'm tellin' you, he's ready."
Hey!
Guys!
I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him all worked up.
- He's the toughest guy we know.
"- Yes, he is, but he..."
"Hey, Mac!"
"Get a chair, smash it on my back."
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right attitude.
I'll tell you what.
"Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts."
- Let's take things to the next level.
- Yeah.
- But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
- Let's get drunk!
- Whoa!
Shadab!
Wait!
Don't beat!
- Faiz!
"- No, brother!"
Not today!
"Are you okay, brother?"
Brother.
"How's this blood, my brother?"
Brother.
Hold it!
"Please, hold it!"
"""This is love, not some revolt""."
"""It's a matter of hearts, not something else""."
"""Some say this love is a trouble""."
"""Some say this love is a stigma""."
"""Love is desire""."
"""Love is a blessing""."
"""Love is wealth""."
"""Love is worship""."
"""The world is an enemy of love""."
Faiz!
Faiz!
"""Will die if separated""."
You have my promise!
"""People of love shall brighten""."
What did you think?
I am not a pawn in the chess game.
"That, someone's life should decide victory or loss."
"Sheen, don't stop me to day."
"You are bloodied angry, today."
"You are no more that Faiz, who I had loved."
"Hey, let me get two more."
And one for my buddy.
"Oh, man, you remember this?"
How could I forget it?
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Yeah.
"Hey, you wanna get your sidekick under control?"
"Robbie, chill out, man."
It's $200 if I gotta recover that table.
You gonna pay for it?
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"Robbie, this isn't American Bandstand."
Get off the table.
"Come on, man, you're disrupting this whole establishment."
"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.
"Police officer, put the gun down."
Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."
Robbie!
Back off.
You never pull a gun out unless you're planning to shoot somebody.
You got it?
"Yeah, I got it."
Is this... um...
Who-who-who...
Who... where...
"Uh, gee, if i..."
How 'bout it?
What's up?
"Do-do you know many, um... [crying]"
Wait!
"Please, don't go."
[Crying]
It's up to you.
I'll talk.
I'll tell ya.
What did he look like?
[Monitors beeping]
I think it's time for us to go.
"Listen, would you wait for me outside?"
Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.
I found the guys that did this to you...
And I've taken care of it.
It was strange.
It was like we were back in 'nam.
It didn't matter if it was right or wrong.
I just did it.
"And don't worry about Maria and the kids, 'cause I figured out a way to get some money for them."
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
"Listen, do you want me to turn this television on here... just blink your eyes if you do."
"I'll get the nurse to come in and look after you, okay?"
Just hold on.
Please.
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
"Thank you, Doctor."
And now you'd best have a look at this rump.
- You've humiliated me.
- Good.
You'll be too embarrassed to speak of it.
No-one must know what's happened.
"- Gentlemen, do I have your word?"
- Yes.
"And you, monsieur?"
"After all the time we spent together, how could you?"
In cold blood?
It was easy.
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him.
- He needs peace.
- I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
- No.
No.
"On the contrary, you wounded him."
"In his shooting arm, too."
He never even had time to fire.
Faiz is in danger.
They will kill him.
Why are you'll looking at my face?
Go and call for the priest!
Go!
"Where are you, priest?"
How long will you take?
This marriage should happen today.
Talk to the priest later.
"Tell me where my brother is, first."
Did you mortgage him to me?
Listen you prince!
"If something happens to my brother, I shall destroy your world."
Threaten someone else!
Kayyub!
Come on!
Come on!
"Come on, inside!"
Brother we have put the girl in the vehicle.
"Your ""Would be"" bride shall be with us."
"Give me my brother and take away your ""Would be"" bride."
- Come on!
- Away!
Away!
"If something happens to my brother, everyone shall be killed."
"Brother, the girl!"
Sit in the car!
You'll attack us?
Get up!
Get up!
Don't beat!
Shadab!
I don't want a dime extra.
And you're not gonna touch him again.
You hear me?
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again and I hope you don't...
I don't give a crap if he gives you a reason.
"You're not gonna touch him again, just say it."
"Billy, let's go."
You need to calm...
You need to tell your little brother...
"Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!"
"You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me?"
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...
Billy!
Billy!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
Hey!
Get out!
You are barking down the wrong tree!
Billy!
Go!
"Jesus Christ, Billy!"
"What are you thinking, man?"
Get in the truck!
"Barking up the wrong tree, Billy!"
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck.
Keep your little brother away from me.
Start the truck.
Start the truck.
I'm trying!
[Tuning]
[Hits bad note]
Shall I play something else for you?
Give me.
[Tuning]
[Plays Penruddocke's song]
[Woman from outside]:
Bravo!
Encore!
Encore!
[Woman]:
Forgive me.
I simply couldn't help responding to such marvellous playing.
Was it you?
It was neither of us.
"Well, whoever it is is extremely gifted."
"Yes, they are."
Now if you'll excuse us.
- You don't think that was rather rude?
"- No, I do not."
[Speaking German]
It's no good looking at me.
Who was that then?
I don't know.
Never seen her in my life before.
Would he like me to leave me fiddle?
"Oh, that would be very kind, Adam."
"You can be assured, it will be well looked after."
It's all right.
You can hang onto it for a bit.
[Speaking German]
"Well, now."
"It's a morning thing, right?"
When you wake up?
You work too much.
Sure.
Excuse me.
"Oui, mon ange."
"Yes, sweetheart, I know."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Daddy will call you back, but now I'm... wait, hang on."
Would you excuse me a second?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
"Honey, I can't talk to you now."
"Rachel, check out that guy for me... now."
Of course you're coming for vacation.
Sure you are.
"No, honey, I can't come get you."
"We'll do just like last time, I..."
We'll see.
"Okay, I'll call you back."
Love you.
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.
I've got a screwball in my office.
"He may be a screwball, but he wasn't lying."
He's head of a department at St. Louis.
Ross didn't tell you anything else?
"No, nothing."
"They say the swan sings only once, just before dying."
"Yes, I know."
"He senses he's going to die, so he sings."
It's not because of the pain.
- That's good.
That's not what I said though.
- What do you mean?
- When you were... born.
When I was born?
You mean changing diapers and things?
- I did that.
- I know you did.
"Remember, once I went out into the road... and you waited, and you gave me a spanking... for going out in the road?"
- Do you remember?
"- Oh, I remember that one too."
That was a tough -
- And you -
- That was a tough corner.
And you used to take me fishing?
Right?
"Oh, I did."
Every week.
Every week we went fishing and horseback riding.
Remember?
- Do you -
"- Well, I liked doing those things."
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- We did enjoy ourselves.
I'm still livin'.
Yes.
And I'm glad you are.
"- I'm not bad, eh?"
- I think you're great.
You still look pretty handsome to me.
[Chuckles]
- I'm not bad.
"- What, you got bumped?"
- No.
"Mm, they, uh, found a girl with better hobbies."
Would you quit?
No.
I decided not to be on that list.
Because...
"Well, just because."
Don't feel like you have to cancel your blind date.
I'm not going on that date.
"- Oh, what, she blew you off?"
- No.
Right.
"She saw your picture, huh?"
I just didn't feel like going out tonight.
With her.
Great.
Yeah.
See wanna have dinner tonight?
Yeah I'd like that.
"All right, this is perfect."
Johnson?
The corned beef here is addictive.
"Look, I won't tell your dad I saw you here if you don't tell you saw me."
You can tell him whatever you want.
Can you hear that?
- I can't hear anything.
- exactly.
- I told you it wouId be different.
- City life.
"- Seen it, done it, bought the T-shirt."
[Brakes Screech]
[Cloudy] Here.
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.
He made me too.
He lives on four.
He went up to six.
He's cute.
Real cute.
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
- [Cloudy] Come on.
- Look.
My partner and I made this case.
You know?
Originally.
We don't want any feds screwing' it up.
Case?
So far you haven't showed me a damn thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
"- Aw, get out— - [Cloudy] Knock it off."
"- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."
- We don't need this.
"Now, cut it out, will ya?"
For Christ's sakes!
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no, no."
That's all right.
Do we have an appointment?
"Actually, I wanted to make one."
It's about next semester.
"Uh, oh..."
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?
My head is swimming.
It's hot.
Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
With all that make-up?
"You don't wear any, do you?"
"I'd still look like me, only in color."
You're too smart for that.
"You're a confident, no-nonsense woman."
- I sound like an airline.
"- I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong."
"It's just that you don't need any of that, Rose."
Thanks.
How's your head?
- I think food will help you.
"- Pizza, maybe?"
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There's that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
"I'm his wife, I have to be here!"
-We'll take care of Migs.
-His blood pressure?
"Just stay here, we'll take care of this."
We still can't be sure of the extent of the damage but he's still lucky he didn't get a fracture in the skull.
"-Doc, when is he waking up?"
-There's a lot of possible outcomes.
But I promise...
"Whatever happens to him, I'll still take care of him."
Is there anyone looking for me?
.
No one.
But I already found the man I love in the whole world.
How's Migs?
He hasn't waken up yet.
I'm sure he will wake up.
Aren't you going to visit again?
.
"You know, I'm not supposed to be there."
My son!
My son!
Brother!
Come here.
Come.
How are you feeling?
"Come, one more."
There's Joy.
Who are you?
.
I'm your wife.
I'm Joy.
I don't know her.
"Oh, God!"
Tasik!
- What is it?
"- Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong!"
- Roll out of here!
- Naturally.
"I have no other choice, but you're wrong."
"Why did you fall, Tasik?"
Now let's be serious.
Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house!
- We'll survive.
- Naturally.
"But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us!"
"- Step aside, please."
- What?
"- Step aside, please!"
- You're welcome.
Who needs you?
"Well, that's it..."
"Oh, damn it!"
"Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman."
I think your daughter...
Don't come near me!
I'm standing.
"She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter."
- Look...
- Don't touch me!
Ciao-miaow!
Let me through!
Hello?
"No, I didn't chase anyone."
Just turned my son-in-law out.
"I was little, but I was so angry."
That doesn't sound like you.
I've got to cram for my lit exam.
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.
"Don't you have, like, everything to sign up for?"
First day.
You got a lot to do.
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.
- Okay?
"The cafeteria, the office..."
- I'll...
I'll show him around.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- He's a pain in the ass.
- I'm standing right here.
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.
"So, it must be weird starting at a new school in the middle of the year."
Used to it.
We move around a lot.
Living in one place your whole life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
"So, yesterday, in the hall..."
Yeah.
Right.
I was wondering when you'd bring that up.
- You knew who I was?
- ‭Yeah.
And you chose to screw with me because...?
"It was more fun than ""Hey, I'm Eli."" ""Hey, I'm Emma."""
- It can't be!
- Stinkmeaner?

"- Close, nigga!"
"It's the clone of Stinkmeaner, nigga, and I've been waiting here to tell you, you's a bitch-ass, faggot-ass, punk-ass, pussy-ass, bitch-ass nigga!"
You know what?
I'm sick of this shit.
You came back to life again?
"Fine, I'll kill your punk ass one more time!"
"Well, let's go, nigga!"
"Come see what this blind, old man got for your ass!"
Ohh!
Unh!
"Oh, yeah!"
"You wasn't expecting all that was you, nigga?"
!
It's a black nigga samurai!
Ha!
Agh!
Agh!
Yeah!
What's wrong with y'all?
!
Somebody help me!
The police!
Thank God for the police!
"The good news for you is, he's not pressing any charges."
He's not pressing charges?
!
He attacked me!
I want to press charges!
"There were at least 53 recordings of the incident, Mr. Freeman."
Done.
What?
Let me do that.
Allright
You're helping out here?
No gentlemen around?
"No, there aren't any."
"Well then, another beer."
Cheers!
Who is Cilly sitting with?
Maybe some truckdriver.
She's into that type.
That's Biberkopf.
I've known him for a while.
Just released from prison. 4 years.
Why?
"Ida, his wife."
He killed her during a binge.
Not too bad.
"Done eating and drinking, she wanders off."
What's he doing here?
Do I owe you something?
You'd better not bother me.
You were in Tegel!
"- Yes, but that's over."
- You're a tough guy.
I'll start my own business:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders"
You're not gonna earn anything with that.
The main thing is that one lives his life decently.
Isn't that right or am i correct?
- What's your name?
What are you looking for?
- Death?
- That's funny.
That's all the Death Zone offers your people.
I'm looking for a man.
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!
You know it.
I saw how he buried you alive.
For him you are dead now.
It will not give you more trouble.
I stole something.
Something very special.
What?
My daughter.
Is the child yours?
- Little?
- Yeah.
But I thought she was one of them.
Can you take me with her?
"Dangerous, she is protected."
"Please, Atka."
My life is nothing without it.
"Quannik thought, that the time of red blood soon ends."
Soon comes the time of black blood.
He lives for 143 years.
Many of his visions came true.
He said there will be no cure for black blood.
Ash is nearby.
I can feel his presence.
Its smell is lifeless.
Your path does not make sense.
There's no one there.
We can watch hockey.
Doesn't matter
--I am leaving you all --Where to?
Where to?
To take Sorokin's place?
Just my own
Where once was a feast There now stands a coffin...
What?
"--An aimless coffin --Sorry, which coffin?"
No.
"Hold it, Bobylev!"
Anyutin Lane!
I can't pay them all back.
But I will return one small debt.
Stop.
Make a left
--There's a ditch there.
Take pity on the vehicle.
"--I said, go left!"
"Faster, faster."
Why are you crawling?
--Now what?
--A puddle.
Need to check its depth.
Give me the steering wheel!
Step on it.
We'll cross it by accelerating
"I tell you like an ex-tank driver, step on it hard."
There we are.
I didn't get a chance to buy insurance on it.
"Oh, Bobylev."
You got it?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Slowly.
Everything like I told you.
"Get out, and open my door, now."
Out.
"Andy, he's inside."
We ain't letting you out of here till you give us something.
"Hey, Paul."
What you got?
"Vagrancy and, uh, resisting arrest."
That's not a good way to start the day.
Come on.
Do I get my phone call?
What's going on?
Vernon.
"That domestic you rolled last week, the one with the broken collarbone?"
- What about him?
- Ia is all over it.
They want a statement from you on tape.
After we process this guy.
Bates can take care of it.
"I want this cleared up now, in my office."
Let's go.
Are you deaf?
Come on.
You watch yourselves with this one.
Process him then get back here.
"Okay, feeding in the loops."
Move.
Open it.

Just like a shining apple.

"Can you alter these, make them a bit longer?"
Certainly.
Would this be long enough?
"Welcome to our store, Please watch your step,"
I'm really sorry.
"Oh, sorry."
Are you alright?
Yes.
How about tonight?
Uh...
Dinner.
It's a Greek restaurant.
You'll love it there.
But...
Can you wait for me at that cafe on the corner when you finish work?
I have to go home now.
"Of course, don't worry."
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'm only a bit drunk.
Are you alright?
You were so drunk.
Did I...?
Why don't you take a shower to freshen up?
Where is it?
"Come over here, princess?"
- Yeah?
- What do you call this then?
- Interesting!
- Wow.
Who's that from?
- Hannah Fields in the year below.
Sniff it to see if she rubbed her fanny on it.
Neil!
"Na, just a bit of perfume."
So what are you going to do about it?
Nothing.
Apart from making sure Carli doesn't find out.
I think she'll be too busy sucking on her boyfriend's knob.
- Shut up.
- What?
"All I'm saying is, he'll have his cock right deep in her gob and then in her vag."
"Out the vag, back in the gob."
Thanks!
"Oh, yeah, that reminds me."
Give that to your mum for us.
Are you serious?
"- Oh, you are."
- Don't tell her who it's from.
"No, course not."
"Anything else, Neil?"
- Would you like me to ask her out?
- Would you?
Let me think.
Would I?
No.
"No, I fucking wouldn't."
Good morning.
What do we think?
Uncool!
It's not uncool!
Who said uncool?
Me!
Why is it uncool?
It's a Peugeot!
What's that got to do with it?
It's ugly!
That's nothing to do with coolness!
Anyone think it is cool?
"Right, I do."
I'm gonna explain why.
It's a hot hatchback - hot hatchbacks are cool.
"They're small, they're easy to run."
"I had one the other week, came down here, drove it in second gear all the way, made me feel 18!"
"All of which is good, and they're good cars."
I just...
"Everybody else thinks it's uncool, you think it's cool."
Casting vote here.
"I reckon, apply your own test."
The Kristen Scott Thomas test.
Picture her outside her apartment in that.
She'll get in.
No.
She'll get in the diesel one of the bloke behind.
I think it's uncool.
"Oh, my God!"
What's up with you?
Chinese burn.
Why don't you give him a dead leg?
I will.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.

- All units respond.

My God!
"Yep, it's definitely a rug!"
"Way to go, Hardy, you asshole!"
"Tommy, congratulations."
We're all very proud of you.
You blew up a litter bug's car and found a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- Then you're in the wrong job.
Let's just say that it was the killer and it was a cop.
It'd be very easy for him to figure out our patrol patterns.
He'd just be waiting for us to come along.
He dumps the rug to make us look like morons.
- Hardy...
- Yes.
- You should know something...
- Are you really a man?
- No.
- Good.
But I was married to one.
- A cop?
- Worse.
A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter.
She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
"Sis, if you only told me we're going here, I should've worn rubber shoes and pants!"
To think I gave too much effort.
Sis?
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
Do you know that Migs proposed to me in front of that tree?
"He told me, however strong that tree is, that's how strong his love for me is."
That's why I want to see that tree.
"As long as that tree is right there,"
I won't lose hope.
"Everything will be alright, Sis."
How many copies to you want me to buy?
.
-What?
How many letters?
.
-What's that?
Five!
Five!
Five!
He's pestering me!
"Yes, okay!"
"I'll call you later, wait!"
Hey!
You're such a pest!
Give me that!
Hey!
Give that to me!
I'm going with them.
I love you.
But I want to experience life in Canada.
You know that long distance relationships are hard.
Self-mutilation is an expression of a child crying out for help.
Wait a minute!
"I've read all the books, too."
I haven't seen a child crying out for help!
This is such crap!
He's a wonderful kid.
He's perfect!
- Too perfect.
- There is no such thing.
There is in children with psychotic tendencies.
"So now we have Ted Bundy, Jr."
Is that it?
"Look, Rachel."
I know you're hating this.
I'm hating this.
But your son has a problem.
"Why are you doing this, Shawn?"
- I'm trying to help.
- You don't want me to be happy.
That's ridiculous!
Stop denying the situation.
Enough.
That's all.
"Let's go, Rachel."
- Rachel--
- No!
Don't say it.
We have to do something.
They're too close to it.
Did you see any marks on his arm?
No!
I can't believe Shawn is doing this.
This is very soft...
like velvet.
Naturally.
It's pure silk.
"It cost us 4,000 Rupees."
"Sleeping in this is so much fun, as if..."
"As much fun as it is in your husband's arms, right?"
Don't take of fence.
I said that only because...
"I enjoyed the bliss of Cashmere silk, on a mat with my husband."
Hand me the pillow-cover.
Who's this handsome hiding in your pillow?
Is he your brother?
He seems to be young.
Must be your elder brother then?
Why do you always giggle?
Go away.
He was my husband.
Was?
Is he no more?
Gosh!
Don't say that!
Have you had a drivorsh?
"It's ""divorce"", aunty."
Not drivorsh.
He's pretty good looking.
Looks can be misleading.
Give me that.
May I say something?
A young couple can separate... but parents must never be done apart.
Never mind that.

"- Oh, the verdict?"
- We nailed it.
"Great lyrics, Andrea."
Thanks.
Just think.
This is our chance to get our big break.
I think a crazy plan is coming our way.
"If we can just get the song to Livi, she'll help launch my career."
I'll be rich and famous.
"And what happened to ""us""?"
"We're a band, remember?"
"Yeah, what good is fame if you don't have your friends?"
That's just it.
We'll all be famous.
As if.
What do you want?
Me'?
"Oh, nothing."
It's just so much fun listening to you guys think you could be pop stars.
We've got a better chance than you.
"Oh, please."
OK.
Nice.
That feels good.
Are you gonna fuck me now?
Yup.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Can I stay up late watching movies?
-Yep.
You're not gonna make me go to bed?
Do whatever the fuck you want.
What's wrong?
"It's... you know my friend you met here tonight, Bender?"
Yeah.
"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but she was here before you got here and she kissed me."
She kissed you?
"Yeah, she was tying my tie and she pulled me in and kissed me."
Did you kiss her back?
No. [LAUGHING] Of course not.
"But it was- you know, it was peculiar."
"Well, girls do funny things sometimes."
Yeah.
"There was this once, a long time ago, actually when we first met, she and I made out."
Nothing really came of it... [SIGH]
She and I - we don't make sense as a couple.
Do we make sense as a couple?
-Yes.
-Yeah?
Water!
"Please, let me get water."
I'm so not done with you yet.
"What, what?"
Yes. thank you.
I'm sorry about what i said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's chuck?
It's over... once and for all.
But i'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
You know everyone else is here.
Yeah...
Everyone's here.
Oh it's beaufiful
It looks so good on you.
Oh!
i've dreamed about this for so long.
Do you want to fire it up?
I can't. blair and I have a meeting at rouge tomate.
Huh. that's cryptic.
Both.
So how are you today?
Miserable.
But at least college
Will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.
No chuck No nate.
No anybody really.
Except gossip girl.
Forget I said that.
It's okay.
I read them too.

- Shooting.
Wait!
Wait.
She's pregnant.
- What?
- Looks like about 11 weeks.
Fetal heart rate is 140.
Baby appears healthy and intact.
I need Ricky.
"It's my arm, man."
It hurts like a...
Do something already!
BP's steady at 120.
But he's been like this the whole time.
"Ricky, you need to calm down."
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds.
"Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis."
He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps.
You were lucky.
Yeah?
You should see the other guys.
No fracture or deformity.
"So, what?"
Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead?
"- An eye for an eye, man."
- Yeah.
Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
- WOMAN:
Get rid of her!
-Damn right.
Except you'll have to go through me first.
"Me, too."

And all of us.

But I'm not gonna let you do it.
I can't let anyone else die because of me.
No one else is gonna die because of you.

And if she doesn't?
Then...
Then...
"Then if she doesn't, we figure it out."

You know I'm just one person.
I'm not worth it.
"No, you are worth it."
You are worth it to me.
I love you.
JEANINE: ...plays a critical role in maintaining the social order.
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack.
This city may be safely enclosed behind a vast wall.
There should be a number on it.
Ask Mace to look it up.
"Pretty, isn't it?"
(Sighing)
"Stop worrying, Howard."
There's hundreds of them.
And don't forget who's paying for all this.
"That's right, yes."
I'm suggesting exclusive rights to it all.
"I'm sorry, can you speak up?"
"No, I'm not going to sell them individually."
One moment.
"- We do want the world, don't we?"
- Of course we do.
And don't forget America.
"Yes, the world."
And America as well.
"Yes, good."
What?
"Oh, yes, splendid."
That would be grand.
Goodbye.
"Well, that should take pressure off Carter."
- Did they say yes?
- And at a very good price.
"Oh, Pops, you are clever."
Howard will be so pleased.
Let's have a drink.
LACAU:
It is outrageous.
They are behaving as if they own this country.
How dare they give exclusive rights to The Times?
Last night was terrible.
You look good.
That's impossible at my age.
Even more now... that I'm dying.
Don't say that.
I'm dying!
"Come on Jacoba, you have to be strong!"
I don't want to!
I'm dying...
It's all because of your son.
It's a girl.
Don't you remember?
Why do you blame her?
He's a selfish person.
"When he was small, he was so quiet."
Probably he was thinking what he was going to do later.
He was really cute.
And very obedient.
You know already what happened when he grew up.
He turned out to be so ugly!
Now that we're married I can tell you...
He took away my house.
You said the house was for me.
But he came back and took it away.
So I told him I was leaving to die in other place.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I know what I'm saying!
Who's that?
She's a nun.
She takes care of you.
You're younger.
Leave Franz alone!
"You're in love with him, aren't you?"
"You don't wanna work for me, huh?"
- No!
- Say that again!
Let me go!
"You two, come here!"
"You're my friend, you saved my life."
"Here, take my crown."
"Franz, my dear Franz."
"Hmm, what's up?"
I just don't get this.
"Franz, don't you think we should move somewhere else?"
- Why?
"- I got money, I'll borrow you some."
Why?
I like it here.
You sent that guy away and tonight we're stuck.
We have a replacement.
First-class.
Who?
- He's a decent man.
- You'll see how I'll change his mind.
"I wanna move, to some suburb."
Come in!
"Cilly, a man is waiting outside for you."
Just seeing a tax return paper makes me go crazy.
I just don't know.
"Reinhold lets you know that they need someone tonight, you know the deal."
They want Franz to come over.
Reinhold sent this paper.
He wants you to come over.
Why don't you drive it?
"Well, it doesn't run."
"I mean, at least not that I could figure out."
Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
- Be more of a girl right now.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Why don't you come take a look at this?
"Elena, remember the old Camaro your dad used to have?"
Of course.
- I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
- Wow.
"Well, I don't like sports cars."
They're too hard to make out in.
"No, it wasn't that bad."
"- I'm sorry, man."
"- No, no."
Don't worry about it.
"You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good."
She's good with you.
"You know, I wasn't sure, but she's happy and I'm glad."
"All right, let's take a look at this."
Ouch.
Damn it.
- Need some help?
- Damn it.
Stupid shoe.
Ugh.
Pick up your other foot.
Ahem.
There you go.
Thanks.
I think.
"Oh, yeah."
No.
My boyfriend.
He hurt you?
"Uh, you want me to call the cops?"
No.
No.
That'll only make things worse.
"I just want to go to his place, pick up my stuff."
If I just had an hour.

I would appreciate it if you would take us off your list.

"Hey, uh, you mind watching the place for a few minutes while I go hit the head?"
You don't have a toilet?
"Oh, it's busted."
Goddamn landlord doesn't want to pay to fix it.
We've been using the bar down the street.
"Anyone stops in, just tell them I'll be back in five or thereabouts."
"At my age, it may take a little longer."

Hey.
"Hey, why'd you park me in?"
"Hey, what the fuck, man?"
Why'd you park me in?
Look out.
We've got to find the emergency switches.
"You two go that way, and you two go that way."
"Tony, we must eliminate Tia."
You will cause that portable utility panel to run her down.
"Hey, Tia, come here."
Come on.
"That ain't it, right?"
- You found it!
- I knew it was it!
"But, it's spelt wrong."
You guys get dazzler and muscles.
OK.
Come on.
The rest of the money's just arrived.
All right.
I'd better call Gannon.
The cooling system's on.
Switch it off.
We lost it!
What's going on down there?
It's coming back.
"650, 600..."
Gotcha!
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Tony, why are you doing these things?"
Why are you using your powers against me?
What's happened?
Tony pretend to remember Tia.
Lure her to the center of the room and make that crane drop on her.
Tia!
I'm starting to remember.
Yeah.
Kind of.
I gotta go.
You're looking for something.
I'm not enough!
Am I enough for you?
Are you running for president?
"Yes I am, Ms. Walker."
"Dad, he had another kid."
With Holly.
- Does Mom know about this?
- No!
"And Kevin, she never will."
- You told your sister about us?
- That we're friends.
- It's fine.
Don't worry.
- We got to be careful.
Prodigal daughter returns.
Thought it'd be a nice surprise.
"Oh, my God."
Hey.
Do you know what this editorial is about?
That one reason Whitmore's candidacy is a stretch is because his daughter's too fat to be first daughter.

He's your son just like Shiv.
Blood ties don't make up relations Raghunath.
You've to abide by it too.
And Shiv has done that.
He has.
He's so cultured.
He's always first to lend a helping hand.
He never does anything wrong behind my back.
And even today... he never forgets to give respect to his elders.
He always leaves a mark behind.
That's true.
Yes.
Shiv.
Where were you?
Listen.
You're going to Delhi tomorrow.
To your uncle.
Pack your bags.
Yes father.
Come nephew.
Sit.
So are you prepared?
What's happened?
Some seniors were ragging the new students.
So...
"Oh, thank goodness."
I had the strangest dream.
I dreamt I was addicted to energy pills.
Hmm.
I seem to have been accidentally tied to the bed.
We had to protect you from yourself.
Your dream was real.
Was it?
"Hey, give me my pills out of my jacket."
You're not having any pills.
You're an addict!
"Donna, I'm not an addict."
"Now, if you wouldn't mind reaching into my anus and fetching me my private reserve."
"Ain't happening, Brown."
We're having an intervention.
Yeah?
You and what army of family and nosy neighbors?

Oh.
"What's up, Arianna?"

Would you reach into my anus for me?

It was probably just a wrong impression.
"- You just go there, I'll join you later."
- Allright.
Goodbye!
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
We'll pick up another two guys there.
Then we'll do our job.
"No, I can't do that."

Why are you upset?
"They just wanted to celebrate, nothing wrong with that."
- What is it?
I just hope Franz isn't gonna screw this up.
"Relax, he just needs a kick in the ass."

I don't have any stock tips.
"He stopped going to the office and these guys keep showing up at the door like cops, but he won't answer."
"Look, I haven't told anybody about it."
I can keep a secret.
Hey!
"Where you at, girl?"
It's time for you to get your buzz on.

You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Say hi to everyone.
Allright.
Love you.
"Love you, too."
Bye.
So how long you been with him?
OK.
- OK.
Thanks.
- I hope I get to meet him soon.
- What?
Your boyfriend.
"If you want to keep things private, you got to avoid Noreen."
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for the intel.
I was surprised to hear you were in a relationship.
I just would've assumed you'd say something.
- You're...
You're fishing.
- You're evading.
It's only fair.
You know all the details in my personal life.
"Besides, what's the big secret?"
Is he bald?
A hunchback?
A member of the Green Party?
He doesn't exist.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I lied because I...
"Well, I had to because everybody in this office thinks that you and I are..."
- They do?
- They do.
- But we're not.
- I'm aware of that.
"Every time I tried to tell Noreen, she thought I was lying..."
So you made up another lie.
You'd make a very effective politician.
Come!
Mada mada da ne.
That'll be all.
Good afternoon!
Captain...
"Playing a match without approval, twenty rounds around the court."
But I-
Forty rounds.
Yes.
The rest of you start your high-intensity training.
The first years pick the balls.
Yes.
You're the team captain.
Please give me your guidance.
I will join next semester.
"First, hand up a registration form."
"Ah, okay."
Oyaji.
"Oh, Ryoma."
"Gave me a scare there, what're you doing here?"
Is your mother doing fine?
It's outrageous.
What were you thinking leaving our hometown?
It's called Seishun Gakuen.
Nothing spectacular.
"Why, don't like it?"
"Don't tell me that to get me into that school, you brought me here all the way from the States?"
"Well, you can say that."
How about it?
Let's have a game.
Here then.
I'll crush you.
- I'm concerned about this one child...
- Shut up!
"Respectfully, all right?"
"Respectfully, shut up."
Because we've got organs.
"I whish we could get organs delivered, instead of having to pick them up, you know?"
I hate flying.
"I always feel much closer to death on a plane than in the OR, don't you?"
I do now.
I met Izzie the other day.
She's very pretty.
So you--you think she's the one?
I-I don't know.
"Well, I mean, we're at that age, right?"
"Marriage, babies..."
That the plan?
I don't know!
I'm sorry.
"I-I don't make plans, okay?"
"If there's a future there, great."
"If not, whatever."
I'll get over it.
I always do.
Okay?
Okay.
I think it's nice.
Your date.
I think you and the pig murderer make a really good couple.
Okay.
What are you gonna do on your date?
What are you ganna talk about?
- Why do you care?
Who asked you to lie?
They asked where my uncle was.
I said that he'd left.
They asked how he was and you said he'd left.
We don't want anything from your uncle.
They asked me.
I said that he had left.
They asked how she was.
It wasn't about your uncle.
Have they taught you anything at school?
Yes.
You don't give an answer until you're asked a question.
"Yes, I've been taught that."
I don't want any more bread.
You understand?
"If you have good news, come here."
"If not, don't bother coming back!"
All right.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Put the bread down there and go.
"Hello, engineer."
My mother wants to know if you want the milk cold or hot.
Warm it up.
Good day.
"There's nothing more to say, Mrs Godarzi."
As I told you before.
"No, it's the same."
What?
"No, we don't know what to do."
What does that mean?
"That's impossible, Mrs Godarzi."
Now I plan to mary and settle down.
Good idea.
Have you seen any girl?
"- No, I haven't yet."
But I will.
I see.
You hide from me?
"Tell me, who is she?"
"Hey, there's nobody."
"Don't wory about me, big daddy."
Find a good girl for yourself and settle down.
I did like a girl.
Butthings didn'twork out.
"Come on, you are good at it."
But I am no good.
I get a bit nervous.
- So what?
I'll speak for you.
"- First, speak for yourself."
"Sheetal, these flowers are rosy in colour like you."
But you are looking more red in your anger now.
"Yes, I'm Vijay here."
I was waiting for your call.
Really?
"So, you were sure I'd call you, were you?"
Of course. I have seen a lot of cases like this.
Tell me...
How are you?
May I ask you why you sent me these flowers?
Just to get a call from you.
And just why did you expect a call from me?
Just because I want to meet you.
Let's go.
"No, no."
We can't do that.
"What, you got a better idea?"
"Come on, dad, our window's closing, and we need to dine and dash now."
"Excuse me, sir."
Sir!
Wow.
I can't believe you did that.
"Yeah, neither can I."
That is so not you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
"So, where are you and Martin going?"
Dad.
What?
"Come on, I don't wanna talk about that."
"We're just gonna fight, ok?"
"Forget it, then."
It's ok.
"Well, I should get back."
"Oh, Martin said that you had 'till 5:00, right?"
"Sarah, I really just... just wanna tag along with you, see how you spend your time."
I'm not gonna interfere.
"I'll just sit there, won't say a word."
What is it you think I do?
Steal cars?
Vandalize private property?
Beg?
"Sarah, I have no idea what you do... and that's why I'm asking."
This is a life drawing class.
"Yeah, sorry to disappoint."
Good for the pain within.
Very good super aspirin.
My body feels light.
Soon you'll feel much better.
I think the Paki fancies the pusher frau.
Hossein is no Paki.
He's Persian.
"Well, then the Persian fancies the pusher frau."
"- Hi, Steso."
"- Maria, get dressed."
- It smells of... opium!
- Against pain.
Too expensive for you.
- Fucking Paki!
- Persian.
"Fucking Persian, then."
Asger?
How's my credit?
- Very bad...
- Right.
I'll just hang around then.
"We're all waiting for something bigger and better to hit us, right?"
I'm not waiting for anything.
"Will you let Asger tattoo your hardened, Middle Eastern body?"
Having tattoos is a sin.
Your body is a temple.
It's sacred.
"You don't tag your own temple, do you?"
"- And you, Steso."
You got any?
- Plenty.
Look!
You are biting off more than you can chew.
"If you talk about Tangak once more,"
I will slap in your face in the way you have not seen it before.
That's it.
Bashirou!
What a nice shirt.
It looks great on you.
"If I wear gunny, you know what's gunny?"
If I wear gunny it will looks good on me.
Now I bought something for you that it looks so great on you.
It goes with you so much.
Thank you.
Bashirou!
You've forgot it again.
- Where are you going with such clothes?
- Tangak_
You won't go to Tangak_ I will.
I said you can't go to Tangak_
"How great you are going there,lf not you had made me disappointed."
"Go to stay with your father, wretched slatteml"
Get in.
Hey!
Hey!
Mister!
Hey Mister!
Stop your car!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop it!
Hey!
Stop!
Hey!
Next up there...
Carlos.
They will be the local authorities.
Good morning gentlemen.
We came from the Balkans.
This is the king of Belgium.
We are a diplomatic mission.
Excuse me?
He is Albanian.
She does not speak Italian?
We are in Albania.
How 'in Albania'?
"Oh, I do not believe it."
Are you sure?
- Yup.
Let's go down and ask for a phone.
"Carlos, what happened?"
- They'll be the currents.
How 'the currents'?
- There are so many currents at sea.
Well then we go down.
We went to Montenegro.
There we bought a boat there.
We were to get to the sea.
"No, excuse me, in Italy."
The captain of the Albanian port was not impressed.
He smoked a lot
While Ludovic tried to explain the situation.
But nothing to do.
"For him, we were just the sociable."
- Can I have a glass of water?
Please...
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- Hello.
- Hey.
Don't hang up.
"Look, I'm so sorry about before."
I think...
"God, I must've had too much to drink or something, but if I promise not to try to kiss you or anything, will you come over here and talk to me?"
I really need to talk to you.
Anna?
Anna?
- Hi.
- Hey.
I promise I won't touch you.
Hey.
I don't care about tomorrow or anything else.
I just care that you're here.
Fuck!
"Oh, fuck!"
Why'd you leave without saying goodbye?
I have to go to this work thing.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Have you seen my keys?
"You can't wait to get back to her, can you?"
Can you just please help me find my keys?
What did I do?
"You didn't do anything, Kim."
You're amazing.
You were amazing.
Last night was perfect.
Here.
Thank you.
I see the red smoke.
Come on in.
Out.
COLEMAN:
Give them a hand.
"- Morning, Max, Collier."
"- Morning, sir."
- Hell of a mess!
- Looks like we'll float away.
What's this outfit coming in?
COLEMAN:
"That's Captain Nim, your counterpart with a patrol that just got zapped."
- Joe.
"- Yes, sir."
Alert the dispensary.
Tell them casualties are coming in.
L'll go find Colonel Kirby.
It was a close one.
LIEUTENANT:
Get those casualties over to the dispensary.
Let's go.
Snap it up!
The rest of you get some dry clothes and chow.
Report for debriefing.
Move it out!
Fill me in.
"As you know, we were hit yesterday."
Three casualties.
This is sure Charlie's weather!
But they didn't follow us.
- You sure?
- Affirmative.
"Please, my friend, what is the matter?"
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.
"If you want water, I will get you water."
"No problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
"You have to get me out of here, quick."
They're gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
Quick.
They keep asking about you.
What you know.
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
"I know where the Ark is, Marion."
The Ark's here?
"I'm coming with you, Jones."
Get me out of here!
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!
"If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us."
"Jones, you've got to get me out of here!"
"Come on, Jones, are you crazy?"
!
"Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot."
I'll be back to get you.
"Jones, what's the matter?"
That's it.
Who knows?
Yan-ling was killed by the Wu-tang.
Which one of you killed her?
- We didn't kill your sister.
- Liar!
Your sister was killed by someone else.
"Trust me, we're friends!"
I ain't your friend!
I'm your enemy!
Yes!
Use full strength!
Stop talking!
Fight!
Go!
"Ming-kai, use 8-divine Sword."
"Wu-tang, why didn't you use full force?"
How did you know?
Go on!
Why did you intentionally miss him?
How did you know I missed him?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Yes!
You better not play any tricks!
We won't.
"It's just a contest, so there's no need to kill each other."
Nonsense!
What do you mean?
Mean?
Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine sword are both impressive.
I can't distinguish which is better.
That's why I invited you both here.
I want to know which is better.
He sees you and loves you.
Where is our mother?
Don't you know yourself when you have to urinate?
We can't help you with that.
Hello?
Untie me.
Now clean the bed.
Take the sheets off.
"Come on, get them off."
Elias?
Where is our mother?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
All right.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play the game again.
I will talk again to Lukas.
Lukas will live again.
"I'll make breakfast for the both of you, ready your clothes."
"We do everything again, as before."
But you have to believe me that I am your mother.
And you honestly want to do that?
I promise.
Elias ...
It's not your fault that Lukas died.
The accident was not your fault.
Do you really believe her?
She's lying.
Let her prove that she is our mother.
What do I do now?
What is Lukas now doing?
But I can't see him!
"Rose, I came by your office today for lunch, but you weren't there."
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.
"Rose, he's a friend of mine, but you have to watch out for him."
"Believe me, I'm not his type."
He has trouble controlling himself.
- Oh.
- What?
What?
What?
- Did you pull something?
- I think so.
Right here.
A little lower.
Lower.
Closer to the spine.
There.
"Oh, yeah."
Lean back into it.
I thought you might like to meet me in Europe after your classes end.
We never had a honeymoon.
That's right.
I would love that.
- Would you?
- Mmm.
- Am I pressing too hard?
"- No, but I'm all sweaty."
And I have to floss.
"When you've got to floss, you've got to floss."
"Claire, I don't know how to ask for it."
"We're so polite, I feel like we're roommates in a charm school."
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
It's amazing.
- You serious?
Oh you can get that.
"Oh no, it's OK."
But you can get that.
Sorry.
Oh it's Hallie.
Just 2 seconds.
Hey!
Um yeah I'm still here.
Um sure that's fine.
"Wait, you didn't really just do what I think you just did, did you?"
Because I kind of had plans to just spend the night with you.
Um she's outside.
How did she get my address?
"I don't know, not from me."
Hello...
Door's open.
Hi.
Dale said she was coming by to shoot the band so I thought I'd surprise you.
Hey.
- Hey.
We actually finished a couple of hours ago but um...
Really?
Why don't you sit back down.
You're not...
Yeah you know I'm sorry I'm lame but I have to work in the morning so...
You should see the show she's casting it is so funny.
"Look you could stay, have another beer."
Oh I'm sure we'll do it some other time.
I'll see you guys later.
Just one second.
Varun is one of the best visually challenged chefs...
Stop... stop
I feel shy to hear my own success story.
Will you please keep the book and leave?
You are taunting me too much.
Bye.
Thank you.
Don't mention.
Rhino!
Bake it.
Who is it?
Is the restaurant closed?
Yes.
Sorry.
The closing time is 10:30 PM.
An elderly man on the platform told that he was hungry.
He asked me if he can have something to eat.
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...
Please wait.
Let me check.
Somehow I managed this with the leftovers.
Take it.
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing to sympathize.
This is my restaurant.
This is my job.
Okay.
Thanks.
You can visit the elderly man if you would like to.
He is nearby.
What a fine seat that fellow George has.
"Madame George Sand, dear."
The authoress.
(coughing)
(horse neighs)
- Are you ready now to face me?
"- God, MaIIefiIIe!"
Not now!
"Yes, now."
No kisses?
Where's my greeting?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, MaIIefiIIe."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
Drink!
Drink!
- Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
- OK.
- Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
"- Kill me, young Adam."
- Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
- Drink me dry.
- Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
- Who wants some of my plant?
- I don't believe you people were invited.
- We've come to take Adam back.
"How dare you barge in here, you ill-mannered trash?"
You mongrels.
Bet you didn't even wipe your feet.
"No, but we'll wipe them on the way out."
"If I wasn't holding this, I would totally high-five you."
"Oh, yeah, you come in here with your ridiculous blunt morality and you understand nothing of his world, nothing of his needs."
I tell you what.
No idea.
The murderer would be dead inside .
The police officer has not received the shot the killer allegedly shot because of pain .
We repeat
The murderer...
So...
It was a real...
Dad!
I'm fine.
Where is Light?
Party somewhere.
We can not count on him.
How it is possible...
I would have preferred to live .
without knowing such a thing
I killed
2 persons...
Me?
Sorry.
Papa.
You want to die?
I am the former owner of the Death Note .
I am the God of Ryuk death.
Do not be so surprised.
"From now on, you had to understand that it is not a simple notebook?"
How does it feel to kill?
Shit!
Papa.
Sayu.
Farewell.
You do not want this notebook ?
My presence does not mean that you will soon die.
Off to meet girls.
I've got a 30-foot range.
"- (girl) Is that you, Shawn?"
- Get out.
Fine.
No girls for me.
"I'll just study and get good grades and get smart and become a famous scientist, and then I'll build a wife."
I'm bored.
- (♪ jazz)
- What's that?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you home?
"- Cory, we're studying."
- So am I.
"Don't go, Rebecca."
Sorry.
I really don't feel like being here anymore.
You haven't seen the whole house.
Let me take you up to the roof.
"Actually, Eric, I think it's nice we didn't go any further than we did."
- Thank you.
- No prob.
Why don't we just study together like we planned?
- I need to study alone.
- So I'll see you Friday?
No.
"OK, then!"
"So, what's new?"
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I have you.
"I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bring you back to life, and I'm gonna kill you again."
What a catastrophe...
Didn't you find her?
Yes.
Amelia.
The husband tried to throw us down the stairs!
She was completely fat!
They say us singers end up fat.
I'm sure you won't.
Laura says hi.
How is she?
-Fine.
She's still my guardian angel.
Always worried about me.
She asked me how were you doing.
And what was your answer?
That you look so great!
And what do you think?
I think you have a normal look.
"A moment ago, I was thinking how would you look without beard."
Taxi!
Luisa!
Make him come to the concert!
"Hey Max, if you don't come, let's not wait another 10 years huh?"
"Do you like singing, right?"
Yes.
It's what a like the most.
And do you like that song you sang before?
I know that poem is yours.
It'd be better to say it was.
I wrote it more than 20 years ago.
How were you like back then?
Without beard.
"Uh, okay, sure."
Why not?
"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Hi.
There's no need to interact with me.
I'm just here to observe.
What's he observing?
We're scientists.
We observe everything.
"Here, go buy yourself a scone."
All right.
- And what is your name?
- Angela.
"Oh, derived from the word ""angel."" Appropriate."
You're cute.
I'd like to buy a scone.
"Oh, I'm sorry, we're out."
We have muffins.
"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, just getting comfortable."
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
I...
They were out of scones.
"Sheldon, I'm talking to someone."
You're being rude.
I'll bet you're an actress.
"If not, you should be."
You have a very expressive face.
"Oh, my God."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does yourdad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my fatherwas a commanderlike you."
He died in combat in southeastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up yourass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone yourown size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
Don't bathe in the evening!
You could have a chest-congestion!
We Brahmins always bathe before we cook.
Great woman!
She observes cleanliness even at this age!
"You bathe everyday, don't you?"
What do you mean?
"I mean, it's good to bathe everyday!"
Wow!
She is even religious...
What a chaste woman!
Jai!
What are you up to?
The water wouldn't flow the drain!
So I came down!
Jai!
What's that?
You're wearing a matrimonial necklace!
It belonged to my mother.
When she died... my father asked me to preserve it carefully.
And what's that...
on your forehead?
"Eyebrows, eh?"
It's a dot!
This doesn't belong to Mom.
Aunty gave it to me and said...
"""You have a necklace."
"Complete the picture with a dot""!"
You must wear it on your forehead.
Jai!
I'm here too!
"Talk to me, when you're through with her!"
That looks like an industrial park.
"Well, it was, but now it's slated for demolition."
I'll call Booth.
(glass breaks)
BOOTH:
Looks like this is where he set up shop.
Look at all this stuff.
Booth?
Yeah?
Look at this.
There's parish records.
News clippings about Aldo.
Discharge documents...
This X-ray is not Aldo's.
It's of somebody else.
How do you know?
There's a stellate-shaped wound directly above the right squamosal suture.
Gunshot?
Yes.
The extent of the damage indicates a high powered rifle.
Perfectly placed.
Not too many people can make that shot.
BRENNAN:
The writing is Cyrillic.
Serbian.
That is correct.
Where are you going?
Over here.
Going behind door number two.
Look at this.
This is not good.
(clears throat)
JESSIE:
"Oh, God!"
You kids do watch too many movies.
Come on in!
I don't have my suit on.
"So, Mick, do you like girls better than frogs yet?"
I don't like frogs.
Nice evasive move.
- What?
- Nothing!
"Mikey, you're staring at me."
"No, I'm not."
"Hey, it's okay to look."
"It may not be polite to stare, but looking's nothing be embarrassed at."
Just promise me one thing.
"When the girls you look at, they start to look back, make sure you're real nice to them; okay?"
"If I had a girlfriend, I'd do anything for her."
I bet you would.
MAN:
"Oh, my God!"
What the heck are you watching?
Just a horror film.
"Sorry, Buddy."
I don't feel good about you watching that kind of stuff.
"Besides, it's bedtime."
So what kind of fun stuff did you do today?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
How do you know you love a girl?
I don't know.
You just know.
It makes you feel good all over.
So you and Finn don't have to keep living in sin.
Whatever.
"- You hear that, Finn?"
- What?
You're off the hook.
"Oh, he's just daydreaming about two paintings a day instead of one."
"Well, I don't know."
Just give a guy a second here.
I need to think.
"(WHIRRING, CLICKING)"
"Ah, I never get tired of that sound."
"(BULB POPS, WHIRRS)"
Finn.
"All right, come on, guys."
It's not like I want to do this.
"Okay, then let's not do it!"
"Uh, do I need to remind you about the roasted dead guy in our basement?"
"We got to do what's in the photo, right, bro?"
How the hell did this happen?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a fucking dare.
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.
"Say something, Finn."
We should destroy that machine.
What?
We can't do that.
I know.
It's too late.
It doesn't matter why we do this.
"- Look, Cohen, I think we need to really talk."
- Hey!
There you are.
"Look, some guy just puked all over an amplifier, and... -"
- Why was that tattooed girl just telling you about vomit?
"- She's, uh..."
She's my boss.
I actually work here now.
- What?
- Yeah.
It was the only way I could get those tickets.
- But why?
"- Well, I needed the tickets to show you that I could be selfless, and I needed to be selfless to get you to stop"
"- Cohen, that was really sweet. - Pathetic and sweet?"
"- No, just sweet."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, God."
Oh.
"Come on, I'm sor..."
"Summer, just wait a second."
- You are unbelievable.
"- Not in a good way, right?"
- I thought you just wanted to be friends.
- I do.
"- Oh, well, then what was that, that kiss?"
- I don't know.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So this whole night wasn't just a plan to get me back?
"- No, absolutely not."
Yeah.
That would be best.
I want to...
"It's my job, Chief."
We're going to get these sons of bitches.
I'll be waiting on you.
(LAUGHING)
RADIO DJ: 73 degrees in downtown Albuquerque.
We expect fair skies tomorrow stretching all the way across the southwest.
"So for you night owls out there, sit back, relax, and enjoy."
DALE:
"Hey, what are you two doing here?"
When did you guys get back?
EARL:
"Oh, Wednesday night."
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.
"Well, Earl had to get back to work, and I'm starting a new job next week."
What are you going to be doing?
Keeping books down at the rice mill.
I went down and talked to old man Hosey.
He hired me on the spot.
You guys take it easy.
Take it easy.
Dale...
"Well, that's good."
"Well, congratulations."
"Thank you, Dale."
We better be going.
DALE:
Okay-doke.
"Do you want some of this, baby?"
I just had to.
"Now, I know all about everything."
"You know if you're found, you'll be in a terrible jam."
- I don't care.
"- Oh, sweet...."
- What are you doing away from the school?
- I'm out.
Thompson fired me.
- He what?
- That's nothing.
That's part of it.
You should know all he's done.
- Tell me.
- We had a terrible row over the food.
That's why he fired me.
The boys can't eat it.
It's worse now than ever.
They won't stand for anything more.
All they need is a spark and they're capable of anything.
"Defendant, you're charged with the murder of Johnny Stone."
He knew Johnny was sick and he put him in the cooler.
"And you knew it too, didn't you?"
"You dirty, squealing rat."
Yeah.
"And you, Thompson, you killed Skinny."
"No, no."
"No, I didn't, boys."
I didn't.
I didn't know he was so sick.
I never would have done it.
- I ain't gonna let you throw yourself--
- Mind your business.
"Why do not you ask me there, man?"
I'll see you soon.
OK?
"Hi, honey."
Let's go to my camp.
It is located in White Creek near barracks where they took your family.
Follow me.
Sit down.
"Jeez, I'm sick."
"Toni, come here quickly."
Here.
Use this.
OK?
Shoot him if exaggerated.
Bu!
"Man, this is illegal."
"Yes it is legal, it took me the cell, not in the shack."
We can not be more legalistic.
No new evidence.
Really?
Why do not you arrest me if you have new evidence?
I like it here.
Is relaxed.
It seems to me that you are trying this trick before.
"If you think that this type of to break me,"
You've already seen it does not work.
-Yes.
What if I told you that your drug Lu Bates connected with the murder of Hastings?
"If Lu did it, arrested to me."
Do not worry.
We'll take you to the station.
Do not worry.
Let me go!
You swine!
I'll give it to you right in the face!
Bastard!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
He wouldn't obey either!
So I grabbed him just like this and pushed him out of the car!
Murderer!
Help!
Help!
We wander through the whole wide world
We wander because we enjoy it so
We wander over hill and dale
We wander through the whole wide world
Let's go!
What's the matter?
Where's Mieze?
I heard her yelling.
She's not yelling anymore.
Let's go!
NO SHORT SWIM TRUNKS ALLOWED
Mieze's run away.
What can I do?
She left her clothes and everything behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Yeah.
What's she doing with a louse like me?
It was just the one time.
One time or ten ― it's the same thing.
I know who she ran off with.
- Who?
- A guy she knew before.
- A drink?
"With her drinking, how am I going to control myself?"
I'll get you one right away!
Wonderful!
She'll sure get drunk!
is this my heart beat or yours?
Or are our hearts beating as one?
Someone's knocking at the door!
Never mind him!
Answer the door!
How can I leave you alone?
Go and answer the door first!
"OK, stay where you are and reserve a place for me."
Collecting garbage removal fee!
This is the fee for 3 months.
Don't you ever bother me again.
But you haven't paid for 6 months.
Can't you just take this first?
Nobody's going to disturb us now.
You take a shower first!
Good idea.
Get all clean first!
I'm taking my shower.
"Bridget, I'll be real quick."
I mean I'll be quick at taking my shower!
Sure!
"Gosh, how can I say such silly things?"
Bridget!
"Robin darling, I have to go."
See you soon.
"Love, B!"
Robin darling!
But also continuously.
Martin?
-I'd like to say something.
-Yes.
"If it goes on like this, it will come to an end."
-Yes.
-I mean yesterday.
Yes.
Why did you let that idiot be with you?
We could have had a nice evening.
-Yes.
-Who are you constantly calling?
-Are you even listening to me?
-No.
I mean yes.
You get this from the pills.
Trying it on yourself!
What do you have your guinea-pigs for?
Some things in human homes are breakable.
And some are unbreakable.
What do people use it for?
"I don't know, people are strange."
And hang up when I'm speaking with you!
"No, I can't stand it."
When will this misery end?
!
Some things can open normally.
And some can't open at all.
But they can.
We must close the opening so that something else won't fly away.
-Some things play.
-And some things don't play.
Where's your dad...?
...He wasn't... my dad...
What this stuff?
I like puzzles.
I'm wanna go home now...
I wanna go.
Are you gonna let me...?
What are you gonna do to me...?
...I told you we couldn't be friends...
Hi...
Are you Larry...?
can I talk to you for a minute...?
Sure.
Sorry to bother you.
..How's... she doing...?
It's been... quite a night
They had to give her almost six pints of blood...
We're still waiting to see if her body rejects it.
I won't keep you too long.
I just want...
I need to ask you about the description you gave.
Of the little girl.
"You said she had long blonde hair was around twelve years old, and wasn't wearing shoes..."
- Right?
- Right!
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Maybe...
Looks like a guy in our building
Did he have a daughter?
Like the girl you described?
I don't know.
"Now he can not, he wants not, he knows not."
Thanks.
I'll do it.
Here comes the soup for my first broken Venom.
"Mickey's a mover and a shaker, but this mean Matalan, he's angling for..."
"If this is still a man, he wouldn't take it, lying down!"
It's manhood at question now.
Man's ugly business.
"Honor, power..."
Gonna start moaning?
Was my mom moaning?
Me?
I faked the screams!
"A spoonful, my love?"
"Love is a miracle, you want to see a miracle?"
I'm just following your laws.
You really are the puppet they made out of you.
Fucked by a grenade.
"You can't fuck over, or even just fuck!"
Anyone!
Anyone!
Go away!
Can't you understand?
I'll come!
"I'll come, I swear!"
Shall I decorate with his brains too?
I'm not ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
It's not my fault.
It's mine.
Idiot.
So you're in?
"Today, on the Golden State Freeway two boxes of deadly baby food were lost."
This baby food is contaminated with botulism.
"The boxes are marked ""Dalecki's. """
Why do I do that?
I mean just...
I'm too nice a guy.
I don't believe this.
Hey.
Hey.
"Yeah, you."
What do you think you're doing?
You were doing 68.
"You know, I could give you a citation for that."
That's 13 miles over the speed limit.
Thirteen miles.
Do you know that?
"Yeah, all right."
Just keep it under 55.
And consider yourself warned and advised.
Boy.
Why am I such a nice guy?
Now you stay by the window and watch.
Every move is a picture.
"Now, go on by the window."
Is she still out there?
"What ""Uh-oh""?"
Is she with another guy?
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
Maybe he heard about Melinda.
"If he's here, it means we're in trouble."
But what did we do?
Who are you?
You jest.
You jape.
I am one of Britain's top comic talents.
"- Say something funny, then."
- Yeah.
"If you're so funny, why don't you say something funny?"
"Go on, say something funny."
"All right, then, I will, I will."
Erm...
Plop.
"- Oh, dear."
- Damn.
Mistimed it.
I'll have to get the manager.
Mr Forsyth!
"Listen, bitch, I was once continuity link man on TVS."
I don't see why I should have to pay for my food.
"Listen, dickhead-no money, no food."
Ah.
Ooh.
You're the sort of girl I could fall in love with.
"However, no time, because Richie?"
- Yes?
- Run!
- I meant through the door.
"- Oh, sorry."
I thought they'd never give up.
Mr Forsyth had some stamina.
Safe and sound now and time to get on with my wonderful dinner party.
That's what you think.
But I have been thinking.
Hang on.
Let me close the restaurant.
He is here.
Take it.
Thank you very much.
I'll leave.
Shall I drop you somewhere?
Thanks.
I've a knowledge of every nook and corner of this locality.
Bye.
"Your article by Sadhana is very good, isn't it?"
It requires a big heart to appreciate you
- Mom.
Get me chappathis.
Despite owning a restaurant
You are still eating mom's food.
I know where this conversation will end.
Don't be boring.
Okay?
Welcome.
"Did the elderly man ask for food, today as well?"
No.
"But, how did you know that it was me?"
"Your deodorant brand is Nivea, right?"
You are awesome.
"I forgot to pay the bill, yesterday."
How much was it?
- It's Okay.
If I get the money
The credit for the good deeds will go to you.
No need.
Sorry.
He's right as ninepence.
- Have you seen the size of that TV?
"- Full HD, of course."
No!
I need to put some paper down first.
"You can sit where you like, young man."
- You like that?
- Thank you.
"Of course, it's not as good as fresh from the vein."
Hang on.
We were told there wouldn't be any killing.
We wouldn't have brought him here otherwise.
I don't appreciate your tone.
"Given the company you've been keeping, it's understandable that you think that we're all cold-blooded killers."
What's that supposed to mean?
We have a much more civilised arrangement.
"Now, this is like a proper vampire house."
- Ooh!
"- No, no, no, the bulb's gone."
We stock up on the old eco-friendlies.
Comes with...
Watch your head!
"Here we are, through here."
- Ah!
"Ow, ow, ow!"
- All right?
"Oh, I don't know, I don't know."
- Aaah!
- Ha-ha-ha!
There he is!
Heh-heh!
Whoo!
"Okay,this way!"
"Move,move,move!"
"Okay,behind the barricade."
"Get down,get down."
All right.
"Okay,steady,steady,steady,steady."
"All right,come to daddy."
"All right,there you go.All right."
Got it.
Tanner!
"All right,get in there now!"
"We're coming,we're coming!"
"Tanner.Tanner,come on,buddy."
Couple of things:
You just killed a good man...
And my legs hurt.
We translated your song.We dug up every mine you planted.
Not every one.
"""Twin Tree""?"
That one went off 20 years ago.
- How many people went with it?
- Not a soul hurt.
- You're lying.
- Okay.
"I planted that mine on mount Sutro,right on the trail everyone took to the top."
No.That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
- You're here.
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
Severe lower body trauma.
Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey, how's it going?"
I hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.
Yeah.
I'm working the Pine Street Bombings.
"I'm her partner,"
Dr. Diego Soto.
Hey.
Sandman.
Golden age.
Nice.
Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh, why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one, please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"Hey, did you see psycho there?"
"Oh, yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.
I have every issue of Sandman.
Mint condition.
"You know, if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.
"Oh, I am."
It's Peter.
Right?
Yeah.
"And, Jeanine, can I just say that it is truly an honor to finally meet you in person?"
FOUR:
"Congratulations, Mother."
You got your war.
I know you wish there was another way.
But there isn't.
I'm the lesser of two evils.
Is that it?
You'd better be.
JEANNE'.
"Tell me, why did you surrender to Erudite?"
What do you want?
I would like a position in your regime.
"Ideally, I would like a position with some advancement opportunities."
(LAUGHS)
"I may be Dauntless, but I'm not just a meathead."
"No offense, Max."
(SCOFFS)
Prove your worth to us.
Then we can discuss your ambitions.
Great.
When do I start?
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.
How do I flush her out?
"PETER""."
Simple.
The girl's a walking bleeding heart.
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.
"- I mean, you got your ass kicked."
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked.
"Mac, it had to look real."
Were you gonna tell me eventually?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- I was going to tell you eventually.
- Yeah?
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.
"Oh, wait a second."
"Oh, come on, Mac."
"Don't be like that, man."
You would have done the same thing.
"Come on, don't act like a baby."
Please don't stab me.
"Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy."
- Your last chance to chicken out.
"- That ain't gonna happen, Bobby."
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
"- All right, Frankie."
Seeing that we're a couple of old men here...
I think we should lay down some ground rules.
Now.
Number one.
Holy shit!
"Since I was currently homeless,"
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
"J.D., you have to get out."
"Now, what's he going to do?"
What's he going to do?
And...
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer Billy Logan, right?"
"Oh, my God."
What are you doing here?
"Oh, my God."
"Come in, come in, come in, come in!"
"Oh, I can't believe this."
Here.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the website, so, I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew, after hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here, I have a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."" Not much of a note."
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
No.
There's something weird about this.
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
There was little p.çleri. Now the dead.
I killed them.
A few friend like that.
"Around out there, the drugs sold."
All the dirt was making them.
I was doing the right thing.
I was going great.
Cleaned the streets.
Was wrong.
No one did not work.
Drugs flowed somehow.
The bad one always remained poor.
"Everything is about money, son."
Now I'm happy to be on this side.
The money side.
So do you.
- Okay?
"I'm doing it for you, you know?"
- I understand.
I understand.
- I am very grateful for everything you did for me.
- I love you.
You are my son.
Hallederken this job if you need me call me.
I call.
But you will not need to.
"However, take care."
To fix this problem.
"- If you are going across borders and customs control of the If I had transportation, it would be OAN'de."
- Oan?
- Public Transport.
"- Tool, the other should have been hired."
"It's enough to make you scream, you know!"
People are supposed to sit here all night waiting for tickets!
Is it war or what?
"No coming, no going."
And no one to complain to.
No one to tell about it.
Such huge trains are running and they can't take just one person on.
What kind of business is that?
Parasites!
"- Hey, man, what's that you got?"
- A ticket.
- For the next train?
"- Right, it's coming."
- She said no tickets.
- This is WL.
It's expensive.
How expensive?
"Well, it's not that expensive, but it's good because..."
Oh shit!
"Make way, women!"
Can you hear me?
"Aunt Katya, take a broom and come to the buffet."
"Folks, who ties animals to the ticket office?"
"Someone tied a dog, now it's a steer."
It's no way.
"Untie him, please."
Hello.
Good day.
- Hi.
- It's occupied.
Oh God...
- I'll be right back.
At least I got the one.
Right?
Yeah.
"Get out, get out, get out."
We got a lot of work to do.
"Good, good."
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.
What are we doing?
"Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know."
- Yeah?
"- So nobody can kick your ass, right?"
- Practically invincible.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what's your point though?"
Well...
"So here's what's gonna happen, pal."
Dennis and I are gonna train you... to be an underground street fighter.
What?
That is brilliant.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- Okay, what's the first step?"
- First step is getting that shirt off.
"- Yeah, let's get that shirt off."
- Why would I do that?
- That shirt's just gonna weigh you down.
"Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains... so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off."
I think I'm gonna wear it.
That's ridiculous.
"You can't train and wear a shirt, dude."
Now it's becoming this whole big thing.
It feels a little gay.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
Shit!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
That's not the information I have.
I swayed them once.
I could do it again.
[phone chimes]
I doubt it.
You're no longer that guy.
[whirs] [scooter horn beeps]
"- Hey, man."
You're out of line.
"- That's all right, I know the boss."
"""Proletariat""?"
"Oh, I get it, ""Coffee for the people."""
Eight bucks.
"Rich people, I guess."
"- Who do we have to thank for that, Chip?"
- Karl Marx?
"You, man."
They jacked up the rent on all the stores down here because of that hotel you made us think we wanted.
"Look, man, I lost my store too."
"Look, what do you want, Chip?"
- Just a coffee.
- No.
Your money's no good here.
"- Thanks, man."
I appreciate it.
"- No, man."
I don't want your business.
"All right, man."
I'll...
I'll think about it.
You want change?
"I just wanna say a big thank you to those of you who came out to the funeral last Wednesday of my dog, Pinot."
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, did you..."
- Big time.
- Nice!
High five!
Wait.
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family, I'm pretty sure you banged my mom."
Mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You...
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney."
Let me ask you something.
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."
"Who's your ""guitar-player-biker who couldn't find mild salsa... that said 'Screw it' and went medium"" bad boy?"
Oh.
"Marshall, your hand!"
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad... but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no."
That's the cuff.
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers."
And the rotten-fish smell is getting stronger.
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
The two of us basically have a date.
And then he calls and invites me to a party at his place.
JANINE:
He so likes you.
I'm so happy for you.
Let's look up places for your destination wedding.
How do you feel about Napa Valley?
I have really always wanted to go there.
"Oh, he's cute."
Yeah.
Smoldering but sensitive.
"Oh. ""All I have is my guitar, these chords, and the truth."""
BOTH:
Bon Jovi.
- That's hot.
- Yeah.
I like him.
"I mean, he probably hasn't called yet because we just had coffee last night."
- Really?
MARY:
"Yeah, you know."
"I mean, we actually video iChatted while holding coffee."
"But that's the same thing, right?"
"- Right, right."
- Just call your voicemail.
"Yeah, but he had a gig last night and he probably didn't get home till late."
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.
- Just call.
JOSHUA:
"Oh, honey, no, on speaker."
I don't think so.
"- No, thank you."
I really don't eat meat.
I'll just go ahead with the penne.
- Spicy?
"- Yes, please."
Thanks.
"So, how are..."
Will and the boy?
"Let's forego the small talk today, Shelly."
- It'll make me feel cheap.
- Let the big talk begin.
Have you seen this?
That's my...
"That's my file on you, Senator."
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?
Have you read it yet?
How did you get it?
Have you read it?
- What do you have to say for yourself?
"- With all due respect... um, Senator..."
- it doesn't matter what I have to say for myself.
"- Oh, it doesn't?"
"It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, all you can claim about me..."
"claim, is that I had sex..."
- Deviant sex.
- Who says it was deviant?
I do.
"And what I say, the people will believe."
And you know why?
Because I'll have a very big microphone in front of me.
"Wow, you must really hate me, Shelly."
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.
"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
"Believe me, Freddie, we're agreed on that."
"Shut up and listen, Harry!"
Your debt is useless to me.
I can't sell it on.
No one will touch you.
So I'm calling it in.
- What?
- You have three days.
You do realize that's a completely insane request?
"What's going on, Freddie?"
OK.
Take this as a down payment.
You must know some powerful people in your line of business.
You should ask for a favor.
"He's arrived then, eh?"
The new DSI?
Yeah.
I worked with him a long time ago.
Interesting guy.
Long night?
"No, no."
I turned in early.
I was whacked.
What's Orwell got?
Body dragged out of the Thames.
Young woman.
No ID yet.
"You didn't really have an early night at all, did you?"
"You don't have an off button, do you, Suri?"
I just believe in the redemptive power of sleep.
Clears out the molecular garbage in our brains.
Molecular garbage?
Yes.
I tracked you down.
I bumped into you in front of your apartment in Paris.
"Pretended it was just, uh, by chance."
We had a really good time in St. Tropez.
You stole my life.
"Look, if it's any consolation, it really wasn't much of a life."
You didn't seem very happy.
Oh.
Blame yourself.
"I mean, I tried to cut you in, but you wouldn't give me your pass code, so I mean, I had to use the drug."
How did I get away from you?
I guess I'm getting old.
Sloppy.
I forgot how physical you could be.
You ran off to tell Jacob.
(speaking German)
Please.
"Oh yeah, I'd be afraid too."
Why are you helping him?
Call it instinct.
You couldn't take that away from me.
"Uh, do you wanna see the girl or not?"
This way.
Stay.
What happened?
"It's under control, thank you."
"Julia, I'm Marta."
I'm a friend of your father's.
Where is he?
He's waiting for you.
Where?
What?
"Award-winning footage, Kyle."
Think you might be thinning a bit at the back though.
Steve?
Steve!
Idiot!
"Oh, yeah, about the film..."
I've decided to go another way.
"OK, yeah..."
Two points to the kindergarten.
"You've slowed me down, that's all."
"I've got the bait, and I'll be back for your wolves."
He is right about the bait.
"Yeah, I mean wolves can't resist it."
Although...
"Since I've got it, it's probably no use to him."
Very stealthy.
Thank you very much.
I think I'm ready for my close-up now.
This is for all the wolves out there.
Howl it with me now.
I remember the scent.
Then it went dark.
- Then I saw that man...
- He smelled bad.
- And then Shannon.
"- Yeah, but then Tom."
Which means we must have been trapped.
- Then released.
- By Tom.
We probably owe Shannon and Tom our lives and we can't even thank them.
What are you going to tell your parents?
About everyone screwing everyone.
What you read in the tabloids.
It's even worse.
- l could tell you stories.
- Tell me.
There's one bigwig when he throws a party the neighbors secure their kids behind locks this big.
Kids six or seven years of age.
"Girls, but boys too."
What do you think of that little boys?
- Hello sir.
"Hi, Herman."
- Adrienne...
Madam told me to clean up.
Won't you join us?
Funny bunny.
"Tell me more, Gerard."
Later in the car.
- Coming?
- Good morning.
- What the hell are you doing?
- For later!
You with a famous writer!
Who cares...
Bye!
"Now tell me, do these TV people go at it all the time?"
They slow down in their 80's.
Can't we flnd a quiet place in the dunes?
I'm a nature lover.
"Ah, I like touring."
"And are those showgirls an easy lay, too?"
"- You revel in such things, don't you?"
- l love sex.
Your date's here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good seeing you again.
"- You, too."
You didn't tell me you have a kid.
Huh?
Did you tell her you were my kid?
I am.
"What, did you have her when you were five?"
No!
"She's just, you know, a minor residing in my home."
"Hey, I know you."
"No, you don't."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
"I don't know where from, but uh... why are you shaking your head?"
You know I
- I don't think we've met before.
"No, I'm pretty sure we're well-acquainted."
"You know, I think I would remember you."
You're pretty memorable.
Are you the babysitter?
Me?
"No, no I totally tried to fuck Ling before I found out she was seventeen."
"That doesn't sound right, taken out of context."
"Yeah, that doesn't sound right in any context."
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
"Nice meeting you Ling, Bender."
"Hey, how the fuck you know my name?"
Let's go!
The night is young!
"Murat, what happened?"
Don't tell her anything.
She doesn't know...
What the hell happened?
"Don't panic, he is OK."
I fucking fell down.
Tell me the truth.
Was it that little bastard?
"No, I just fell."
God.
Don't embarrass him.
Go back to bed.
OK.
I really am OK.
"Just leave, I got to pee."
"Don't worry, he's all right."
He is not my boyfriend.
He is my shadow.
Where I walk... he walks with me.
He knows what I eat... where I sleep... whom I am with.
Why is he following you?
Because here in Istanbul I have a different life.
"Yo wimp, do you think I didn't spot you the other day, mamma's boy."
That's not fair.
How are you bro?
Are you OK?
Just want you to know that I took care of your money.
It's all settled.
Do you need anything further?
"Off course, he would come back... every time I enjoyed freedom."
Why would he do that?
You should have gone to the police.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21.
"Now you're slipping, Cam."
"Cam, you owe another six bucks."
"No, no."
I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
"Oh, really?"
That's great.
"Well, we're not doing it that way."
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.
"- I got it, all right?"
"- No, no."
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
"So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night, after 19 cups of coffee."
- Check it out.
- You are kidding.
- What is this?
- You're kidding!
This is good.
"Miles, this is good."
"Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here."
This is called destiny.
"You know, there is the..."
[heroic rock music plays]
- [echoing] i am your ghost of christmas present.
- hi!

- you'll see when you get up there... which is gonna be pretty soon.
- oh.
"yeah, yeah. i heard."
"well, yeah, i ain't living so good, but what are you gonna do?"
- i'll show you.
- okay.
- let's get this party started.
[christmas carol playing]
- we've already done this one.
- things aren't always what they appear.
- what a double-crosser!
pam and randy?
!
he's supposed to be back in town to see me.
- let's just see how this plays out.
- ugh.
- you want me to give you a tour?
- i want a tour of the inside.
- oh.
he don't need a damn tour.
Can this bike hold all of us?
- No problem.
- Where are we heading to?
"Xiamu, don't disturb!"
"Xiaotian, faster!"
"Allright, got it!"
What if Xiamu injured?
What will we do ?
I don't want that happened either!
"In such situation,"
I could not stop the bike!
"Xiamu, let's go home."
Why you only care about Xiamu?
I got hurt and it is bleeding!
It hurts!
What's the matter?
Not even one question is done?
"If you are being lazy again, I'll paint your face."
Like a Spiderman!
Did Yawang send you?
- Hello!
- It's on the desk.
Where is the thing I sent you for?
On the desk.
"Your potraits were in the last few pages, how come they are gone?"
I took them.
You did?
Just tell me if you wanted them.
Let the master give you some guidance!
No painter holds pencil same way as writing!
"Like this,"
fingers and wrist should relax.
Heck no!
"Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions."
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Boss, she's a woman in a million."
- You think so?
- Yeah.
She don't talk.
Oh!
"All right, get on with the dogs."
"No, thank you."
I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say!
"Nice, modest little prices they have here."
They practically give things away.
"Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?"
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do.
Come on.
"- Come on, Buck."
"- Come on, Buck."
"Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye."
There's an officer of the Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
"We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Okay, what's going on Marta?"
Know what I think?
I think you set me up.
I think this amnesia is bullshit.
"No, no."
"Oh, fuck me."
What?
"You're gonna tell me, you don't know who this is?"
Who is it?
"It's Jared, damn you."
"Paolo and Yale are dead, Marta."
Why?
I don't know.
"Alright, I don't remember anything, I swear."
Is Jared a victim too or is he in on this?
"Yeah, um, I'm getting out of here."
What're you gonna do?
It's Kyra.
I told you to turn off your cell phone.
What have you gotten us into?
Why are you calling here?
Because I told her to.
You know she was packing to leave when we got here.
"Oh, I haven't spoken to you since Berlin, partner."
"What do you want, Jared?"
"Oh, come on."
You're a smart guy.
"You've spoken to Marta, you found my place."
You must have figured it out by now.
Numbers to the Swiss bank account.
There ya go.
This can't be agency sanctioned.
You accuse me of stealing them!
?
I didn't say that!
"Do you mean me, then!"
?
"I didn't say that, either!"
"I'll fix you, if you call me a thief!"
"I won't let you off, either!"
What are you doing?
Beat you for calling us thieves!
Don't run!
Stop!
You again!
?
"Fate brings us together, from however far I bet your 109,200 miles are right here!"
Right beside your Nanking's 18 mounds!
Oh no-here comes Mr. Ugly!

Two heads think better than one
Let's talk this thing over!

"If a man's unlucky, he'll see ghosts in the sun?"
Pick a little more!
Can I ask your name!
What task?
"Come to Wu Yen Road,"
You'll see a black car 9413.
On Friday thirteenth?
Just get into the car and I'll tell you what to do.
"Remember: better come early than late, late than never."
Right way!
"Not now, tonight!"
Tonight?
Then what shall I do now?
I even sent my secretary away!
Find something to do to kill time.
I haven't taken my milk yet.
Nuisance really!
Taxi...!
Shut up!
What the hell are you yelling about?
Damn you!
Shit!
"You think this is a night market, shut up!"
"Get lost, or I'll call the police."
Damn you!
"- Hi, Hitler!"
"- Hurry up, go!"
Go to the front!
Don't turn around!
There's match inside the drawer.
"Listen, a Jew has taken a ""Beast"" to H.K. from Europe."
To be handed to an American.
Your task is to help him find the American.
What does he look like?
The Jew will tell you.
- Not this one.
Never got their zoning approved by the city.
Still an old warehouse.

Something's not right here.
"- Go, Dave and I will cover Mejia."
- Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Is anybody hurt?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
The steering locked up.
The thing veered off the road.
- Can you get it started?
"- No, it's shut down."
It's not going anywhere.
I'm calling Martello.
"Uh, we're on radio silence"
"He's right, we don't want to give away our position."
I think you really need to talk to him.
Just to play it safe.
Jenkins.
Let me handle Martello.
You come with me.
"The rest of you, stay here, and wait for a recovery vehicle."
Been trying to get those two together for a year.
"I did it, and now I'm like a dog off his leash."
"Okay, Dad."
"And let me tell you, I didn't waste any time."
I'm on the Tinder.
"Oh, okay, well, it sounds like you're good."
I'm banging my balls off!
"Medium rare, medium rare."
I want that burger medium rare.
Are you at the OTB?
"Yes, I am."
And you'll never believe what horse is running today...
Daddy's revenge.
How perfect is that?

Hit him!
Hit him like you're wearing big boy pants!

"Go, you son of a bitch, go!"
Yes!
Winner!
Revenge!
"Oh, ah, shit."
Dad?
"Oh, shit."
"Hey, Frank, it's me, Smolinski."
"Yeah, I don't know how comas work, but if you can hear me, screw you and wake up, you big shit."
"Mom, mommy, I've found Daddy!"
"Dad, we've been looking for you."
Look at the stones I've gathered!
"Igor, what is this?"
You've spent two hours in the cold wind with your bronchitis!
But I finished my sketch.
Now I know what my new painting will look like.
You're like a child.
Let's go home.
Farewell!
I hope you'll overcome your fears.
Are you talking to yourself again?
Anya?
Anya?
Anechka?
Show me your sketch.
It's nothing special.
It's beautiful.
"Hello, partner!"
How was Paris?
- Any problems?
-The entrance is closed.
"It must be opened, then."
It's not possible.
We're waiting for a government delegation
But we're running late!
I'll see to that now.
What are you doing?
You!
I told you we're running late.
We have a charter flight!
You can lose your driver's license for that!
"That's you, Frank."
I'm a wild horse.
That's what makes us such a great team.
- It's so unfair.
- What?
"- It's boring, but I give it my all."
- The idea is for her to get off.
- Why don't you lick the alphabet?
- Why?
So she thinks I'm clever?
Haven't you ever licked the alphabet?
"First you lick an A, then a B, C..."
The variation really turns them on.
Everybody does it.
- You never have?
- Never.
- Nicolaj Kopernikus taught me.
- Does he even know the alphabet?
"He told me he'd gotten complaints, so he'd adopted that technique."
- Thanks.
- Cheers.
- Are we going to the office?
"- Yes, but..."
"One, two..."
I can't drive.
Will you give me a lift?
We have to stop by the home and pick up the Gimp.
- You have to meet the mouth painter.
- Right.
But you're using your hand.

It's a bit late for niceties!
I have a woman and a friend.
I'm home and dry.
"You said that, didn't you?"
"- No, it was you."
- Same thing.
Park her for me.
We've gotta pull out the stops.

"For peanuts, petty cash or speed!"
"Remember, Antoine?"
We'll keep the hearse.
Why not leave it here?
For what?
I can understand why people would want to pay to see her.
"Well, Julia, surely not."
(Julia):
"What are we doing but watching her, William?"
About time you paid for help.
How much you offering?
- Five cents.
- Ten.
"A nickel, final offer!"
What do you know?
- I seen him.
- Did you now?
- He went to see that beast in the cage.
- What of it?
I took him there.
Near the river.

What?

It was right here two days ago!
"Yes, I'm sure it was."

The tent was right here!
Honest!

Here.
"You stay out of trouble, alright?"
"So, the victim was definitely attacked here at Travis's campsite."
Which the lying sod failed to tell us he moved.

Nothing but trouble when they show up in their caravans.

It took some time.
Will she be OK?
I don't know.
Her heart's gonna be weak for a while.
"Maybe forever,"
I don't know.
You know Dr. Jerry Gordon is the guy for you.
You do know that?
Thanks for your help.
- I couldn't get in.
- It happens.
And Dallas.
Exciting.
Big trauma centre...
Congrats.
That's great.
"You don't mean that, do you Jerry?"
Sure I do.
I'm thrilled you're gonna be thousands of miles away.
Doc?
- I didn't touch the guy.
"- No, that bruising around his neck just appeared like magic."
"What was it, a choke hold before you put him in the car, or after?"
"I wouldn't make accusations like that, Doc."
I'll do whatever I want.
He almost died.
Which would have been a real tragedy.
We still need to talk to Mr. Pike.
"He's going to be a little busy, what with the CT scans and the trip to ICU."
"Well, we'll just wait."
There it is.
Casa Natasha.
I just walk around.

Of course.
Which one is that?
Ohh.
My granddaughter and her boyfriend who won't marry her... are going to become art.
That's a limited access floor.
You need a swipe card.
Oh.
I'll just get off on two then.
You want the offices?
"- Actually, are you Nancy Herrington?"
- Yes.
Okay. 'Cause I wanted to show you my art.
I brought this tape I thought we could watch.
Okay.
Why don't you send it to this address.
"Oh, but that's here."
Can't I just hand it to you?
It'll get lost.
It's better if you send it.
How cute.
Jackknife.
That technique isn't too bad.
All the different smashes in tennis sure benefit you guys.
Too bad your ball isn't high enough.
Sorry but I've checked your data.
The data won't lie.
If not for the data you would have played better.
- What are you doing?
- Woot?
Ugh.
What was that?
What was that?
Doing that by yourself.
Makes one so nostalgic.
"This Seigaku regular uniform,"
- Not too shabby.

Let's go.
When did he come in...

- Good morning.
- Good morning.
The opposing team is Seishun Middle School finally we get to play.
I still haven't accepted you.
"Ah, I see."
"Hey, look at that."
What's this?
A chibi here.
How come even a chibi can become a regular.
They were sent to the shooter.
We traced the I.P. address.
Comes straight from this office.
(sighs)
O-Only I couldn't have sent these.
See the date and the time?
I wasn't here;
I was with a client at a hotel on Kalakaua.
I can prove it.
"Okay, Abby, who else has got access to your computer?"
Just my assistant Andrew.
He's taking off.
Hey.
Hey!
(siren wailing nearby)
(truck horn blaring)
(tires screech)
You should've let me die.
"Andrew, why would you do this?"
"I'm in love with you, Abby."
I've always loved you.
I just wanted you to stop.
Unrequited love.
Second oldest motive there is.

"Hello, Sam."
"Geez, Joe."
When'd you get back?
"You know me, I come and go as I please."
"Family is safe and sound, fast asleep."
"Well, can I assume you didn't break into my home just to say hello?"
"If you get up now, you will finish it in time."
You can work here.
I brought your computer.
There's WiFi too.
This is why I told you not to call me a douchebag.
But this is about finishing work and being responsible.
Just a little bit more.
Only 2 photos.
"If you finish this job, you can rest as many days as you want."
"And when you're done, we'll go to NYC together."
Ok?
So what did you say to him?
I told him I want to sleep.
Damn.
Was Peng angry?
He wasn't.
Just told me to fuck off and change careers.
Don't worry.
I will find you some jobs.
Will you do one thing for me?
Don't do anything stupid like this again.
I'm asking you as your best friend.
Alright.
Je.
You have to have a baby.
What?
I came back from the dead just to see your kid's face.
So you are free today?
Yeah.
I came to take care of you.
I have so much to do.
Number 116.
- What am I missing?
"- Perspective, for one."
That's a loss and a win.
How is that the downfall of my gym?
You worried?
No.
[Chuckles] Come on.
"Alvey, you got to be a little concerned."
Not a bit.
And this isn't an interview.
"Well, I appreciate the apology, but it's not necessary."
"You know what, you haven't seen my gym, right?"
Let me give you the 10-cent tour.
"This way, the next time you butcher me, you know what the fuck you're talking about."
- Mind if I take some photos?
"- Whatever you need, Mario."
[Music playing]
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Lisa's looking for you.
She's in her office.
All right.
I'll be right there.
What's up?
Shut the door.
I saw you training with Alvey today.
"Oh, man, I fucking sucked."
I was so nervous.
He was impressed.
He made it a point to tell me that.
- No shit.
- No shit.
"- No, Tommy."
- I promised Rosemary.
- What the fuck did you tell her?
Nothing.
She asked me to look out for you.
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Look out for me.
"And when you see me, don't stop."
"That way, you're not breaking any promises to anybody."
"Tell me, Paul..."
What?
Why do you want me under your train?
It's just...
I've had... two people die under my train this month.
"Jesus, you're a serial killer!"
No.
They weren't my fault.
They got this rule.
"If you have three in a month, they pay you off."
Ten years' wages.
Lump sum.
Mm...
What were you planning to do with this pay-off?
- Buy more books?
- Get out of London.
"Go and live in Scotland, on an island."
- Get away from everything.
- Really?
Life in the fast lane get too much for you?
Youth is wasted on the young.
"You know, somebody famous said that."
- What were you planning to do on this island?
"Legs, up to here!"
I'll think about it.
"Good, don't take so long!"
I've got to drink something.
Why are you coming here?
I walk around the whole day  and think about how I could live.
I come back here and wait...
"Mainly, I've been waiting on you, my dear."
You've really downsized quite a bit.
My father started all that.
I've told someone about you.
Could you imagine living here with us?
He'd like to take a look at the hotel.
Why?
He could do a lot more for you.
Why are you coming here?
You leave everything open.
"Very nice, without any obligations."
We have the ability to speak.
What is it that you do all day?
What do I do?
But you're still staying?
I'm still staying.
It's so silent here.
No singing.
Where is Emilia?
She's taking a walk.
What?
It's one in the morning.
I have no idea.
Perhaps she's singing outside now.
What do you do before you come here?
- Only because you lick the alphabet.
- He what?
He licks the alphabet to fight the monotony.
"A, B, C..."
"Bon appetit, Frank."
- What is going on?
- It's these two studs' latest thing.
- You lick the alphabet?
It's...
- It's a bit gross.
- How unromantic.
You do that?
- Casper taught Frank to do it.
- I could've thought of it myself.
"- Look, buster!"
Don't discuss our sex life with him!
I didn't.
Then how does he know what you do?
- I don't know...
- I won't have it!
- Let me finish...
- No!
"You fuck retards and lick the alphabet, you jerk!"
"- Please don't move your leg, Casper."
- I thought you were handicapped.
- I'm sorry about the retard.
- That was a lousy thing to do.
- Golf tomorrow?
- You bet.
It's nice and peaceful.
All you hear is an...
- What do you call that bird?
The half you don't need.
What's the matter?
You look like you haven't slept in a month.
I'm alright!
"I just found it easy when it was every night, at least you know what's coming."
"Well, never having known the joys of married love myself."
The bombing!
Ah!
I thought perhaps it was the long treks with the husband in the provinces.
Not really...it's difficult you know.
The trains.
Oh!
What is...?
What's that?
"It's France, uncle Frank!"
It's Hitler!
Bloody what!
?
Meeting now with Mr.Swain.
We were about to issue this shooting script.
They want all of you.
"Oh, no!"
Oh!
Don't worry.
With all that studded buried.
It will be some Rear Admiral than lather with the wind speed.
Wrong for the day in question.
Ah...when did I mention.
It's at Whitehall.
The Ministry of War.
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."
"For he today that sheds his blood with me, shall be my brother."
I'm so thirsty.
Life is so wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
"I'd like to introduce my friend, Count Casanova."
Let the count sit down.
"Count, these are three prize-winning beauties of Pankow."
Let me talk to my friend a minute.
"My dear Reinhold, I'm always so happy to see you."
You need another man?
You'd need a radiator to thaw that one out!
"- Shall I tickle you, darling?"
- Give us a smile!
- Pay no attention to them.
- You're quite the ladies' man.
"Scram for a while, girls."
These dames mean nothing to me.
"But at home I have a real pearl, a treasure, a jewel."
Why don't you bring her along?
"No, better to leave her home."
No need to drag women everywhere.
Of course!
What do you think?
Those crooks steal and cheat.
- Crooks?
And Franz frightens me too.
Franz?
He's done time too.
Tegel.
Four years.
Prison.
That's right ― Franz.
"I tell you, she's wonderful."
"Dude, rule number one; we will stop calling her ""girl."""
Really?
Why is that?
"We used to say it before, what happened?"
Things have changed.
Watch your mouth if you don't want to mess up our mood.
What are you saying?
"Dude, we barely convinced him."
Take it easy.
"Okay, fine."
I won't say anything.
We're blessed.
What's up with your hair?
Tie it up.
Hey 3012 Mert.
"Sir, I give up."
"I've forgotten the way of the school, but... you haven't forgotten my school number."
Do you really know all of our numbers?
"Shut up, you ill-mannered wretch."
Sure I do.
"This is 6024 Sinan, 5947 Kaan, 6813 Gamze, 5018 Uluc."
Fix your tie.
Well done!
"Let's hope for the best, sir."
You were a businessman; what happened?
What happened with your job?
"I took a medical report, sir."
I'm on holiday.
"We'd better go to our class, sir."
"As you know, the bell has rung."
Really?
Are you serious?
Your friend has a powerful enemy.
It's open season on her and I wanted to be the one to do it.
"VICKI, IT'S ME!"
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS!
IT'S WINTER!
SHE'S SOME KIND OF DEMON.
WATCH OUT!
You're too late to save your friend.
I'm over here!
Nope!
Here!
- What are you?
- What I am.
- You know.
- Demon.
"There are all kinds of us, with all kinds of hungers."
What are you doing slumming it down here?
Nothing is without purpose.
"You want me, right?"
Why'd you kill the kids?
"I hook them on the bottle, then move them up to the spike."
That's when I feed all their sweet juices.
I had to sacrifice a few to get your attention.
"If your kind get too much of the bug in them, my little ones go crazy and they feed, too."
"That's kind of a win-win, right?"
That tickled.
Darkness is waiting.
Let it wait.
"It'll take a lot more than that to beat me, bitch!"
Henry?
Sorry I'm late.
Sweet ride.
"A little too friendly for me, apparently."
"Uh, never mind."
Her name is Audrey.
All right.
Audrey.
Got it.
- You good?
- I need a favor.
My father isn't sick.
He's been faking his illness.
Why would he do that?
That's what I want to find out.
Why not just ask him?
He left the country.
With Emma.
"Look, there must be someone else that knows about this."
"His... his bodyguard, Donnie, I've left him messages."
"So far, nothing."
I'll see what I can do.
All right.
Hang in there.
How often do you see an escort?
Once a month or so.
I just started doing this.
"Uh, I got a raise at work."
The dating pool is depressing.
It's full of boys in skinny jeans and baseball caps.
"It's hard to find, like, men."
Women are like wild horses.
"You stroke 'em, put 'em at ease."
Whisper in their ear.
"In my experience, the more high society they are, the more they like to be manhandled."
Sounds like a great idea to me.
"Spencer, let's go."
I've done my part.
"As much as she hates to admit it,"
"The magazine really needs you, regina."
- oh.
"- Oh come on, spencer, please."
I am not gonna keep apologizing
- To someone who wants to keep an attitude with me.
- Okay.
- Let's go sit down.
- Thank you.
"Oh, i'm sorry."
There's nothing to sit on.
- Georgia: yes.
- Please consider it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Oh god, what a mess."
"Now what are you gonna do, gina?"
"I'm gonna think about it, mama."
That's what i'm gonna do.
She's not thinking about getting me back.
She's just trying to impress spencer.
She doesn't want me working with her.
"Oh, what do you care about whether she cares or not?"
She's offering your job back
And you haven't worked in six months.
We're in trouble here.
Where are you going?
I gotta go take a walk.
I gotta go clear my head.
Take a look over there.
They're having all this light come right through that.
Do you have to go now?
"Can you come back, or no?"
"- No, no, I'm going to go."
"- Okay, well, did you know why"
I came to see you today?
"Well, I'm making a film about Lou."
"- Well, I knew that."
- You knew that.
- I knew that.
- But...
I'm Lou's son.
God.
I saw you when you were six years old.
I saw you at the wake.
I saw you with your mother.
You remember that day?
What a crazy world.
You are Lou.
Have a nice concert.
- Where's Nathaniel?
- Why'd you get so upset?
"Gosh, you love a man..."
"and I knew Lou had a son, and I was told never to tell that Lou had a son."
I don't know.
"Lou was... didn't talk about his family much, except about his daughter."
He didn't talk about that.
Men don't talk about those things.
"That was his, that was his very personal thing."
We all have those personal things.
Thanks.
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
Mr. Gold?
Hi.
Peter said you were here.
Shouldn't you be in synagogue?
Uh... no.
How are you feeling?
- Better.
- Good.
Then I won't feel bad about saying this.
Your son is going to lose.
"Without Alicia, he will lose the governorship."
"Uh, I-I don't know..."
"She was on our side, Jackie."
"Alicia was offering to help Peter, then you got involved."
How did I get involved?
This friggin' house!
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Your past, your future, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
Lengthen the crew's mission.
I promised them...
"No, probably not."
Don't worry.
Good-bye.
Isn't that ditch finished yet?
I've hit a rock.
Good luck.
"I can see, in fact. I can hear."
We've reached a dead-end too.
"You're lucky, you have a pickaxe."
We don't have one.
We can't do anything.
I can provide you with a pickaxe.
Our problem can't be solved by a pickaxe.
"If it could, things would be easier."
One blow of a pickaxe would do.
"Instead of a pickaxe, you can offer me some tea."
"Please, help yourself."
"If you give me your Juliet's address, I'll ask her to provide us with milk."
"In the village, knock on any door and they'll give you milk."
I didn't find any.
"Even at the sea, there's no water for me!"
Can't I ask her for some?
No problem.
She's at Kakrahman's.
Go to the village...
You'll find her there.
Kakrahman's house...
"Ask anyone, they'll know where it is."
Get in.
I'm not disturbing you?
"Yes, sir, Sir Charles."
I'd...
"Well, show her you're happy about it."
"Do something, man."
"Just another work of art, madam."
It's not in your catalog.
"We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir?"
"Poole, old friend, I'm going to be married very soon."
"Sir, you don't know how happy that makes me."
"I knew it would, Poole."
Thank you.
"Sir, there's a patient in the consulting room, a Miss Ivy Peterson."
She's without an appointment.
"If you've no time, I can..."
"No, no, that's all right."
I'll see her.
"So it's you, sir."
So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.
Well...
I'm the one you and your friend took home that night.
- Remember?
"- Well, what what brings you here, Miss Peterson?"
- I think...
- Are you ill?
There.
That's what.
Look at that.
"Pretty, ain't it?"
Did you ever see a thing like that before?
I'll get you some lotion.
Lotion?
"It won't be lotion that will do the trick, sir."
I can't see anything.
It must be catching.
Don't tell me you're going blind and all!
Sometimes if you bring your top down and waggle the bottom.
"Who do you think I am, Gypsy Rose Lee?"
Oh!
"Hey, it works."
"It's gone, Granville!"
"Oh, it's gone."
What a relief!
"Oh, that's wonderful."
"Now, what can we give this young man to show our appreciation?"
-
- Give?
-
- You don't have to give me anything.
-
- You'd do the same for me.
-
"- Too proud to accept charity, Granville."
"Well, put it this way."
What bargains can we put him onto to show our appreciation?
"Th--There we are, sir."
-
- Compliments of the management.
-
- You've been very good.
There's someone up there that sees everything we do.
"I know, I know."
It's that Mrs Harris -
- I saw her peering out of her bedroom window.
'Ey up.
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-What-What...
What are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's gotta be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No!
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night stand material, Ted."
"Oh, oh, here's your mom."
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother's not one-night stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
"It wasn't night, and we weren't standing."
Hey-oh.
- That didn't happen.
- You're right.
It didn't.
- You just winked.
"- No, I didn't."
- You just did it again!
"- Look, bottom line."
I need you to proxy-bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow."
That'd be good on a hat.
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
- You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
Ah!
That's it!
That's it!
A loudspeaker in the shop!
Just like they have in supermarkets.
-
- Where are you going?
-
- With regular announcements to customers.
A speaker pointing that way so it'll reach the people in the street.
Where's he going?
Come back.
Don't leave me here.
"Look, don't..."
Will you...
Don't!
Aghh!
Don't leave me!
"Granville, get me that yellow screwdriver."
Don't worry about it.
It's only been two or three days.
You'll be walking fine in a couple of years.
Don't know what took you so long to get me out.
I've got a business to run.
I can't afford to spend time opening errand boys!
(GRANVILLE GROANS)
There you are.
Think where your trendiness has got you.
I brought you up to be a normal lad and suddenly you go bent.
I know you're trying to talk me out of it.
I'm not going to be talked...
Ow!
"Oh, that jail had a particular smell."
- Like lilacs dipped in urine.
- Nice.
- Yeah!
"- Oh, no."
This is the best day of my life.
Who knew you were the black sheep of the family?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
- I'm proud.
- Shut up.
"- Give me a high-five, Mom."
- No!
God.
"- So, what's up?"
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.
Holly's going to the board to try to overturn your decision
- not to counter on the vineyard.
- That woman is a nut job.
I'm backing her play.
You're what?
"I think the opportunity's right, the investment is right and I think it's what Dad wanted."
I'm voting with Holly.
- What happens now?
- We go downstairs.
Then what?
"I'm going to my office, check my e-mail."
Do whatever you want.
- About you and me.
- I just covered that.
"Office, e-mail..."
"I mean, if you don't think that this is going to work, then I understand."
Is-is Harriet.
"Look, I'm sorry."
- I lost my head out there.
- Look.
There.
"- No, no."
- I was just... but you can't go...
"I mean, we need you."
Harriet would never stand for it.
"Please, won't you reconsider?"
"You know, it's not about what happened outside tonight."
It really isn't.
But Golly...
"I just... no, I think it's time."
I really do.
"Harriet can take care of herself now, so she should."
But Harriet's just...
She's just a little girl.
"You know, it's the right thing."
"It's the right thing for all of us... for me, for you and for Harriet."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, I am."
"""'The time has come,"" the Walrus said,"""
"""To talk of many things..."
"""Of shoes and ships and sealing wax..."""
"""Of cabbages and kings..."
"""And why the sea is boiling hot..."
"And whether pigs have wings."""
Where you going to go?
"Well, I don't really know."
I'm thinking I may travel.
Are you going to go be some other kid's nanny now?
All checked?
We've interviewed eight.
We're on to the other two.
We've searched from Cape Wrath to Carlisle.
He hasn't got a roof over his head.
You're on Storm Island.
- Storm Island?
- Now you know how it got its name.
You were swept into the bay.
Everything always is.
"Please, don't get up."
- I've frightened your little girl.
- He's a boy.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I must cut his hair.
Was anyone else on board with you?
"David, we really must put the poor man to bed."
"No, I was alone."
Didn't you bother to get a weather report before you left?
No.
- Did you notify the coastguard?
"- David, what does it matter?"
"Because if he did, there may be men out there risking their lives looking for him."
- And we can let them know that he's safe.
- No.
I...
I...
I did not notify the coastguard.
I'll just turn the bed down.
- I've never seen anybody so exhausted.
"- But, Mummy..."
"Girls, I'll meet you outside."
Get her.
Okay.
"Just the littlest bit snug, aren't they?"
There we go.
"Cute, though, huh?"
How much?
- 700.
- 700?
"Yes, well, I'll tell you what."
You pay for quality 'cause there's so much crap out there these days.
"Man, I am excited to bust my dogs out in these tonight."
We're going to a French restaurant...
Le Bistro.
"It's five stars, so..."
I don't know if you've been to it.
"That sounds great, but this has been declined."
Declined?
You're kidding me!
Oh!
Makes me so mad.
"Like, the credit card companies..."
the way they waste your time.
Probably protecting me.
I spent a lot of money today.
Try that one.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Did it not go through?
What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps?
- I love that bed.
- Don't buy this act.
* You can't throw out your uncle from Spokane *
"* Mmm, that's what you think"
* How I've longed to meet somebody like you soon *
* If I never meet you that'll be too soon *
No!
* Palsy Walsy
* How're they treating' you?
* Fancy my meeting you here
* Palsy Walsy..
Let me throw 'em out.
Did you ever play football?
* Met your darling mother your sister too *
* They're young as ever and so are you *
* Palsy Walsy
* How're they treating' you?
* Fancy my meeting you here * [crowd applauding]
You hear that?
We're a hit.
"And to see, I owe it all to you."
[applause continues]
[clapping and whistling]
[knocking on door]
Who is it?
[knocking continues]
"Hello, partner."
'Thanks.
I'll wait out here.'
Would you mind passing me out a chair?
Hello.
Will you tell the manager that one of those fresh college boys is annoying me?
I'm the manager.
Get away from that door!
Doctor?
Mrs. Brown.
Is he...
You saw for yourself.
Your husband needs help.
I advise you to place him in a rest home as soon as possible.
Hello?
"Harold,"
I'm afraid I can't talk to you now.
It seems that John is much worse than I thought.
"Sure, I heard."
He's mad as a hatter.
"Well, aren't you the busy little man?"
"Oh, hello, darling."
"Isn't lunch time, is it?"
It's 1:15.
And you said 1:00.
"But if we hurry, maybe there'll be something left."
Good heavens.
I had no idea it was so late.
How's the new line going?
"Oh, fine, fine."
Where would you like to go to lunch?
How about the Royalty Room?
I'm afraid I have to be back by 2:00.
I have an appointment with the manager at Tilfords.
"I, uh..."
I want to persuade him to take on our contour chairs.
"Darling, is anything wrong?"
Nothing to worry about.
It just takes time.
But I am going to put on some new salesmen.
I was.
"(SHE SCOFFS) Exactly - ""was""."
How long?
(SIGHS) 18 years.
And how many times did you do the dirty on her?
Never.
"Well, it's my life, and actually, I really like it."
"Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?"
The meth?
"See, I think you've got one... maybe two months before your teeth start falling out."
"Come on, Jenny."
Eh?
"See, the thing is, I don't think you're doing this by choice."
Not really.
That's just a cuddly thought so you can sleep at night.
Nah.
"Need the coinage, rent to pay."
What do you want?
All right.
"Well, I can tell I'm not gonna change your mind, so why don't you just call your mum, let her hear your voice?"
It's not my voice she wants to hear.
She's no different from the freaks that get off on these films.
It's not who I actually am that matters.
It's who they wish I was.
Jen!
- I...
- Tell her I'm fine.
"All right, that's it, the show's over!"
"Come on, show's over."
"Oi, oi, oi."
Jenny Jones...
- Get off me!
You heard him.
"Thank you, sir."
"Hey, Em!"
You wanna take a ride?
Come on.
Can I go?
"Yeah, of course."
Go with your father.
She's an amazing girl.
This way!
Move this way!
Welcome aboard.
"Thank you, sir."
You sure you're all right?
I'm all right now.
"Good job, special agent."
"Thank you, general."
"If you ever want a private tour of the White House, just let me know."
I can hook it up like that.
"I mean, maybe in a few weeks.."
when we've got the place back together.
That's good to know.
You wanna give him the news?
Calls have been coming in from all over the globe for the last hour.
"The presidents of Iran, Russia, Israel and France have all agreed to your terms."
It looks like your peace plan is a go.
"You keep this up, I just might have to vote for you."
You wanna see something really special?
Yeah.
Carol.
"Henry, the president wants to do the thing."
Hold on tight.
I do not really like the sun.
Hah!
Dear friend...
I do not wish you to be burned.
(coughs)
(knocking)
Excuse me.
"I'm sorry, my friend."
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
Get Inspector Robin to protect me tomorrow.
Yes Sir!
"Darling, go buy me an ice-cream!"
I want you to apologize to this lady.
"None of your business, I like it when he hits me!"
I still want you to apologize to this bitch.
I know you'd be checking the view here.
I've got a great scheme for us.
Hang on. I want his apology.
"Just say 'sorry', out of pity for him."
I never have to say sorry!
That's true!
"Come on, let's go...!"
No way.
He has to apologize!
He's lnspector Robin!
Inspector Robin.
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
Don't bother with me.
Apologize to the bitch.
Sure thing.
"Sorry, bitch!"
I beg your pardon?
Let's go!
Who the hell's lnspector Robin?
Great...
Shame on you...
What do you want from me?
"This scheme will benefit the human race, lt will benefit the entire world."
But how will it benefit me?
"You can be the greatest unknown hero,"
But how will it benefit me?
No.
I'm here.
Guess Daddy doesn't love you after all.
We got the president.
Bring him on down.
"Back to your office, sir."
"I have John Cale on the line, sir."
Cale?
You put her on the goddamn phone right now.
"Hi, John."
They have the president.
"John, I want you to listen to me."
Help is not coming.
I said they have the president.
They called a strike on the White House.
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.
They cannot do that.
"They still have hostages, they still have Emily."
"I'm so, so sorry."
I was wrong about you..
"but there's nothing you can do, John."
"If you stay, you're gonna die."
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me..
and I am not gonna disappear on her.
So you tell me how much time I have.
You only have eight minutes left to get them out.
"Goodbye, Carol."
Clear out!
We're moving back now!
Everybody's gotta move back!
[music continues]

"Produce plays, direct, write songs, even sing them."
"Well, think of my an inspiration."
"Regan, where's Mr. Ganz?"
"He and Mr. Grady are in Atlantic City, Judge arranging for the opening."
"Don't worry, my pet."
If Chowsky won't rehearse you today
I shall have him discharged.
[whistling]
Can't you see I'm busy?
The Judge wants to talk to you.
Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"Sir, they're gonna be fine."
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
- Yes.
- You must be working part-time.
- Yeah.
Would you like some stew before you go?
I'm buying.
Hey...
How much could you make?
Hey!
How much do you make right now?
"- 6,030 won."
"- 6,030 won."
Please eat.
"But, you said... he was going around bragging about stabbing a man?"
"Oh, I think that was a lie."
But I think it's someone Han Gyul knows.
"It's Han Gyul, the kid that I fought last time?"
Not fought.
The one who beat you up.
"Hey, I didn't get beat up."
I fought...
I fought...
- Let's just say that then.
- Let's just say that.
But the suspect that Detective Im saw wasn't a young kid.
"He said that there were two men, in their late 30s."
Yes... yes.
So... you're saying that there's a young kid involved too?
"Then, Chan Gyu."
It could be... that Park Seon Woo committed this crime in two parts.
One stabbed him first.
Then the guys cleaned up after.
"And anyway, since it's true that he held that knife..."
- Never heard of her.
- You will.
She's in trouble.
Impossible.
It must be a mistake.
(Sighs)
A bomb...
"Yes, a bomb would do it."
"A bomb would blow him and his records and the barge to kingdom come, yet it wouldn't hurt anyone else."
Yes.
But where do we get a bomb from?
"Well, if you only want a little one you'd have to go to Ireland."
Honestly!
"Bomb, indeed."
Get the whole mad idea out of your head.
Ireland...
That's it!
(Irish accent) Ireland!
You remember that old villain at the Dublin show.
He was still at it.
Get me a sprig of that stuff they wear in the buttonhole.
What is it?
- Shillelagh.
"- No, shamrock, you twit."
"And book me on the first plane to Dublin in the morning, right?"
(Sniffles and sneezes)
Henry?
Henry?
Please don't ask any more questions about that storm.
An orphan of the storm has just arrived.
- What?
- Your girl.
but I was part of something.
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school?
My father was always pissed off.
he was pissed that my kid brother Michael wasinawheelchair.
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me what's this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.
He knew what went on there.
I didn't care.
The way I saw it everybodytakesabeatingsometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What?
You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me.
Look.
Come with me.
Is that him there?
No.
How about him?
No.
That's the guy Get him.
Mikhail.
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you thinking coming in here?
The key wasn't in the mailbox 'cause Darlene didn't show up tonight... so I don't get a break for another 20 minutes.
Here.
You might as well take it now.
You shouldn't have come!
You should've looked for the key later.
What's the matter?
You all right?
- Excuse me.
- Alex.
You probably gave half of those bent- nose guys up there a heart attack.
I'm surprised we weren't trampled on the way to the phone.
You better get outta here.
I'll see you soon as I get off.
Don't even think about going to sleep.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Just tell me.
Is everything going to be okay?
Get outta here!
You need to go back inside.
Lvan wants to talk to you.
We were family!
You betrayed us.
Enough.
Enough!
This is your lucky day.
Get in!
That was dynamite.
Any of those guys Alex Bohemia?
Good.
- Promise me you'll be careful.
‭
"- Mom, I..."
I can't promise you anything.
I... have no idea what to expect.
I just know that I have to talk to him.
I have to hear what he's going to say.
- Does that make sense?
- ‭Of course.
(BIRDS TWEETING OUTSIDE)
(PHONE VIBRATING)
Hey!
"Emma, are you okay?"
Yeah.
I didn't mean to scare you.
"No, uh, it's just early."
"Um, what's up?"
My dad's back.
I don't know.
You're the only one who knew him before he left.
And I haven't slept all night and I'm totally freaking out.
Wow.
He just shows up...
literally when you get back to town?
How long has he been here?
I don't know.
I didn't interrogate him.
Doesn't it seem a little suspicious?
"You know, like, the timing of it all?"
"What do you mean ""the timing of it""?"
"Um, I mean, like, where was he when all of our friends, everyone we knew, was getting slaughtered?"
When you were actually in danger?
(Footsteps)
(Engine starts)
"Beautiful night, Constable."
Beautiful night.
"Excuse me, sir, you got..."
Oh!
Oh!
You.
Mr Creeping Alopecia.
No you don't!
There's something fishy here.
"There'll be something even fishier soon, sir."
We're going to stay here and discuss this very quietly.
"""Mystery explosion wrecks peer's car""!"
"Well, Henry?"
What's going on?
Come on.
Out with it.
I'm cheesed off.
"If it isn't police or reporters, it's you."
Just a couple of minor accidents and a girl I'll never see again.
(Knock on door)
"Miss Melissa Right to see you urgently, sir."
"So, we're off again."
"Show her in, Maria."
Show her right in.
"Bathing again, or is this a dry day?"
"Good morning, my dear."
How very nice to see you again.
My husband was afraid we'd seen the last of you.
I have a feeling you won't be needing your frogman's flippers today.
- You shouldn't have come here.
Ayushman you're doing the wrong thing.
What are you doing?
I am doing my duty... and now I'm going to sc***wyou.
- Ayushman you...
- Hold on.
What?
What?
You...
You think Dimple's apart of my plan.
Is that what you think?
You are right.
She is part of my plan.
She sleeps with me every night.
So she can at least do this much Boss.
That reminds me...
Look... let's forget what you think.
Think about what your brother's dilemma... when he finds out.
Kurukshetra.
The Boss' land of destiny.
He's honored and respected here.
I'll get areal kick out of this.
When I'll defame your brother using you.
I'll humiliate you but he'll feel ashamed.
That's why they say...
People defame death.
Life... makes you suffer.
This is the second time I hit anyone.
And both the times it was you only you.
I was scared since the moment I learnt...
Shiv's going outwith you.
Now he's paying forit.
Behind bars.
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D. Now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
- What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
- Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
- Are you?
- I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
- This dog was sniffing around it.
- So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D. the fingerprints yet?"
- There's a backlog.
- Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D. her.
That's for you.
"You, at least you don't kill."
My woman.
My cross.
My skin.
Anything else you want?
"Shoo, or do you want a bow on top too?"
"No, I'll go to her!"
"Don't sweat, she's here!"
It's done!
"Hold me against you, against him, against me."
"Stop me from running out, from drowning."
Plug me.
Whatever floats your boat...
Life is good.
Can you smell it?
Take a breath!
"They watered the street, to make us grow on the paving."
"Yes, I do love you."
We've got everything!
"Our weaknesses,"
"Ideas,"
History!
"But what's keeping us on our asses, waiting for the Cossacks to strike?"
The burden of Money?
The phantoms of Culture?
The Final Solution?
"If we don't turn to face the Cossacks, it might hurt a little, get me?"
In '44 we won the Battle of the Rails.
The Final Solution?
Stale bourgeoisie farts.
"We need to take the middle ground, the power of living people, the workers."
Please follow me.
I swear with my sincerity.
"Sir, do you know the accused Ho Foon?"
No.
But he is like my concubine Yu-fa.
What?
You have had a son with your concubine?
"Yes, we have a son named Nim-sai."
But he is dead.
Why?
I don't know.
Why don't you know that?
We've lost each other for over 20 years.
Why did you say he's dead?
I saw his dead body.
How could you confirm that was your son?
From his ass.
Ass?
"Right,"
I saw a triangular birthmark on the body's ass.
That makes me believe that was my son's dead body.
"Sir, there are so many unexpected things happened on earth."
"For many things, you may not believe it."
"Foon, do you want me to teach you?"
Take off your pants!
Now!
Yes!
How about the one I saw?
"You just saw his ass, but not the face."
The birthmark may be drawn by someone.
It may be drawn by someone.
So you are my son?
How do you contact her?
How did you know I'm here?
"I cannot reveal anything, for the sake of protection."
"If I kept the names of women I spent the night with, my phone would need more memory."
What?
"I won't be meeting her in the future, so why would I keep her phone number?"
Such a player.
"You really are the one, really unlucky."
Could it be that...
"You like that woman, don't you?"
Your tastes are very unique!
Kim Yeong...
My name is Kim Yeong Ju.
She's related to a case I'm working on involving Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.
"You, really don't know?"
I don't know.
Okay.
Fine?
Work hard.
Where is this woman hiding?
Excuse me!
Where are you going?
I see you're limping.
"The clinic doesn't have X-Ray, so I'm going to the hospital."
"Wait for me a moment, I'll quckly bring my car."
Get in the car.
I don't want to.
I'll clean up the mess I made.
Hurry!
Get in the car.
"I will take her, just go."
"Her leg is like that, because of me."
But now you've grown selfish and unkind.
"What's happened to your heart, jim?"
"It belongs to you, josie, just like you're going to belong to me."
Stop being afraid.
We've climbed above right and wrong.
"They're trying to pull us down, but they can't."
We're going higher and higher and higher!
Offering 150 for any part of 2 million!
"500,000 at 150!"
I'll take it.
Any more bids?
"If it breaks 160, it'll hit 200!"
We're not gonna let it break 160!
Jim!
She's just broke 150.
150?
157!
Why aren't you in the gold room?
"Oh, i'm getting jumpy, boss."
"I tell you, wall street's gone plumb crazy."
This thing's out of control!
Because i got 'em cornered!
I got all the gold there is outside the treasury.
"But i'm still buying, luke."
We can't hold anymore!
We're done for!
Let's get out of here while we're still alive!
I can't stay with you!
It's going to hit 200!
Stick with me!
You can't lose!
1621/2!
Yes.
Did you lie on his bed?
But I'm lying on your bed too.
"First you fool around with Fat Pig,"
"Then this over-aged virgin,"
And now you come for me.
You're worst than a bore.
You mean a whore?
Don't correct me.
I hate people who correct me.
- Yoyo!
- Shut up.
I don't want to see you again.
Get lost right away!
"Hello, handsome!"
- Don't touch me!
- Why not?
"Because I used to get 0 in my exams,"
So I'm allergic to anything that shape.
So long!
- Dumpling!
- Stop that!
You said you didn't like well-rounded people.
"You're different, you're unique."
How unique?
Because you're rounded in all the wrong places.
I have something to discuss with his Excellency.
"Your Excellency, this is the 'Beast'!"
Sir!
What's the matter?
Someone called Hiroshima wants to see you.
Hiroshima?
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take them out to the ocean.
You can't set them free in the ocean.
They'll die.
They're freshwater fish.
Okay.
"I hear you, sweetheart."
You are so smart.
We'll come up with plan B. We'll come up with a really good idea.
It won't be sort of kind of good.
It'll be a perfect idea.
You'll love it.
"All right, so we're gonna look at lipstick, we're gonna look at jewelry."
"- Shoes, bags."
- We're gonna...
"Oh, shoes."
- You guys wanna look at shoes?
"- Let's look at shoes, please."
"- Yes, heels."
"- Oh, my God, wait a second."
Wait.
- Do you wanna go in here?
"- Can't let them overheat, right?"
"Oh, my gosh."
Are the goldfish coming with us?

Grace.
What...?
Am I as sexy and attractive to you as ever?
Huh?
Is this it for you?
Am I perfect?
"Well, ahem..."
I guess it wouldn't kill me if you lost a little weight.
Aha!
"Ok, and how much weight would it not kill ya for me to lose?"
I don't know.
50 pounds?
50?
All right!
Less!
Whatever.
You made me say it.
I can't believe you said 50!
"Doug, come on!"
You know I love you no matter-- ah...
This is-- this is unbelievable.
"You know, here I am walking around thinking everything's great."
"Meanwhile, you're smuggling in my clothes and hating the way I look!"
"No, I don't hate the way you look, ok?"
"But, yes, I admit it."
You could lose a little weight.
"But, Doug, come on."
I'm sure there are things about me you wish were different that you hold back on.
You?
"No, you're-- you're perfect."
"Yeah, right."
"Hey, look, when you start getting the old lady whiskers,"
"I'll let you know, but for now you're fine."
"Doug, come on."
Did you measure the closet?
- Yes.
Did you measure the door?
- Damn!
"Listen, if it's storage you're after, you can put it in the hall closet downstairs."
Let me go and get the door for you.
"All right,here, keep it sideways."
"Uh, Dubcek, hold it."
- What?
"I got it, I got it, no problem, no problem"
Hello?
Yeah just a second.
"Harry, for you."
Hello.
Wrong number.
She took it down herself.
"Ah, it's all right."
"You had the guts to get up there, you know?"
It takes time.
I have to be funny by tomorrow night!
You're not gonna make it.
I don't know what to do!
"Well, don't over-think it, you know, just, talk about things you know."
That's what I do.
Yeah.
You make fun of your poor mother's flabby arms.
"Hey, those flabby-arm jokes made her the most popular senior in Fort Meyers, Florida."
"You.. you mean, she doesn't hate you for it?"
Hate me?
No.
She loves me for it.
It's a joke.
"- Bye, Mads."
- Why didn't he put on his trunks?
- What's he up to?
- What a nasty habit.
- You had his pecker in your face.
Swinging from side to side.
It almost hypnotised me.
- I always put on my trunks first.
- You owe it to your fellow man.
"Trunks, T-shirt, tie, socks..."
- I'm buying.
- Very well.
- It's good to see you happy again.
- I love being back at work.
It's done you a world of good.
Nursing Bodil was a full-time job.
- It runs you down.
- They take good care of her.
Gather all the retards in one place so we don't have to look at them.
"It's better to put them in a home, so we don't have to look at them."
- It's gross to watch cretins eat.
- Why do you say that?
Frank and I discussed it the other day.
What have we got here?
- Delicious.
- Congratulations on your new home.
- Is the bathroom finished?
- More or less.
Want to see it?
"Yes, please."
Casper keeps raving about it.
"- Very nice, Frank."
I'm happy with you.
It's important for me to make his heart remember what his mind forgot.
But what matters the most to me is if he's safe.
Don't!
"Go ahead, Migs."
Take care.
It's already morning.
"Sorry, I got lost."
I even prepared food for you.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't understand what happened.
What?
You went to Bela?
.
Go ahead and explain your lies.
I'll make believe that nothing happened between the two of you.
I'd still listen!
Are we going to fight again?
.
"What, do you want me to be pleased?"
.
Don't I have the right to ask where you've been?
That Bela is really unbelievable.
"Because if I am the mistress, I would think of the wife waiting for you."
There.
Answer it!
And I want you to answer it in front of me.
Here!
Are you happy now?
.
Didn't you tell me that Bela is kind?
Maybe she's using her kindness to steal you from me.
- No.
No.
It ain't nothing.
- I just...
"- So that's your fine friend, is it?"
"The dirty, filthy brute!"
"If ever a man dared lay a hand to me like that, I'd..."
Well...
Aren't you going to introduce me to our charming visitor?
It's Marcia.
"This is my friend, Mr. Hyde."
"You've heard me speak about him, haven't you?"
"Oh, yes, Marcia."
I've heard a great deal about you.
I've never been interested.
Until now.
I've got to be toddling along now.
"- Toodle-loo, lvy."
"- Oh, no, no."
"Don't go now, Marcia."
"After all, this could be very interesting, the three of us in friendly discussion."
I can't keep my friend waiting.
"- I'll be dropping by, lvy."
"- Yes, yes, yes."
"Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia."
Your ideas differ from mine.
It would be a charming experience to change them.
Ivy found it that way.
"Didn't we, dear?"
Nice material.
Goodbye.
Very nice material.
"Well, she's usually right."
She's been right about everyone else.
I lived a whole life with a woman I didn't even really like.
We traveled all over the world together.
And Ellen and I never even left the grounds.
"Well, actually I took you to the IMAX that one time."
"Yeah, but I wanted to take her to the Mayan ruins in Guatemala."
She really wanted to see those.
His picture's hanging here.
He got the license for this place.
Claire?
[Sighs] Gosh.
[Crying] Nobody told me anything.
- You just heard the news?
- When did he die?
- When did he die?
- He died a week ago.
- A week ago?
- A week ago.
My God.
[Crying]
"Claire, you were told."
You just don't remember.
- Pardon?
- You were told about it.
You just don't remember us telling you.
I wouldn't remember?
I must have been -
And we had a memorial for him here as well.
- When?
"- Uh, last week."
- Was I there?
That's so mean.
"Look, if you don't take this chocolate and leave me out here, then I can't work with you."
Please give me the chocolate so I can pull you up.
Fine.
"Okay, Gene."
You hold onto me.
Got it.
"Tina, you hold onto me."
Great.
And then I'll hold onto something in the bathroom.
And pretend it's a person holding onto me.
Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy.
Okay.
We're ready.
Ah... no.
"Bang-up job, everybody."
We got the chocolate in the caboose.
Like we planned.
The only problem is is that we are not in the caboose!
At least we have toilet paper.
You guys want any?
Thank you.
Ugh!
"Well, we're stranded."
"Our chocolate's on the train, and there's nothing around here for miles."
"My boy-dar isn't picking up anything, either."
"Oh, wait..."
"no, that's a deer."
We've got to get back to that chocolate before somebody else does.
"Guys, we're gonna be okay."
The train's coming right back here.
"Wait, what?"
- Hey!
You don't show the finger to the Boss.
Aren't you ashamed?
You thrashed Bajrang's men in Rajanwadi.
When someone's fit for a beating he's bound to get it.
But where's Bajrang?
He's been missing since you thrashed him.
No matter where the rat hides... you're going to blame me for it.
Boss.
You're acting too smart because Bajrang is still missing.
What will you do if you find him?
I will lock you up...
lock you up for assaulting him.
There's your man.
All the pain you took delivered him.
Now you beat him up along with me.
Now you'll be arrested too.
But... proof?
C!
C!
TV!
CCTV!
CC...
Inspector.
It's all about perspective.
Two strands of hair in a glass of milk seems gross... but on a bald head it seems too less.
From my perspective... the Boss did justice to the farmers.
Because...
The Boss is always right.
- Say it louder.
- Hail Goddess!
- Boss...
"Hey, come on."
"A little, you know--jesus."
"I mean, people with cancer, they have issues, franc."
Jesus christ.
"You know what I'm gonna do,"
"I'm gonna take a little bit of this, and I'm going to make a donation in mike's mom's name."
"Whoa, whoa, hold up.Before you give all our money away,"
- what kind of cancer are we giving to?
- Yeah.
"I don't know, ass, face, skin, brains, all of it."
- Cock?
- Cock and balls.Everything.
"All right, I'm in."
Sweet.
What about dogs with cancer?
"Hey, dogs are welcome."
"- All right, I'm in."
- Sweet.
Breasts?
Breast cancer.How about that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, what?"
"I mean, we're going to a titty bar."
"It's like an investment, you know."
"I got it, cat cancer."
"Titty bar made me think of pussy and, you know."
"All set downstairs, boys."
"Hey, derek, we're creating a special slush fund for cancer research.You want in?"
"Cock, tits, ass, animal, all taken."
What about the liver?
- I'll drink to that.
- Duh.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You don't mind do you?
-Recording your doing.
-Turn it off...now.
"If she doesn't want, she doesn't want."
Why?
nasty things this morning?
you know where they have the drugs?
How should I know?
Ask Jack.
Drugs?
"Don't be impatient, be cool."
"Brian was right, your roof is perfect."
This fucking city is really something.
What have you done to yourself now.
She can't hide it.
A chicken is a chicken.
Come on Jimmy.
You're both so beautiful and you look alike.
Be nice.
I'm not a chicken.
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry Jimmy!
I didn't know your scalp was so sensitive.
"Now don't get anything dirty, and tape the tags on the inside"
It's not necessary to cut them.
Where's the cocaine?
Dwayne?
"Would you fix us a few lines, darling?"
"Here, I've got some blow too, baby."
I'd like to ask you a few questions over your childhood.
"Come here, legs."
She's mad at you now.
Has been for about a week.
- So is she...
- Pulling...
To the right?
Red 23!
"Excuse me, Miss."
Hi.
- You dropped this.
- Keep it.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
That's what I'm hoping.
Red 21!
Holy bananas.
You're really mad at me.
"- I feel sorry for you, actually."
- Why is that?
Because of all the things right in front of your face that you refuse to see.
Like what?
Like me.
"Oh, well."
I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to.
You know what?
"You're wasting time, 'cause Pete's in danger."
"Yeah, well, so are you, right?"
In danger if you're who you say you are?
"Okay, fine."
Here's what you and I both know but we never talk about it.
All right?
That I don't trust you.
That I need you to tell me the truth.
And to not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
- It's real.
- What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
"One at a time, if you please."
"Yes, you sir."
A whiskey?
"Why, of course."
Be my pleasure.
This here's our finest single malt.
Join you?
I'd be honored.
"To your health, sir."
[EZRA laughing ] I have an idea.
"About what, a bank we can rob?"
About food.
"I think we should offer something to eat, like the hotel does."
Try it.
"Muchas gracias, señorita, but I am drinking my dinner."
Have you lost your mind?
The sign outside says drinks for a penny.
What next?
Pay people to come in here?
"My God, at this rate you'll be broke in no time."
"Well, isn't that the object of your little exercise, Mother?"
Might as well help it along.
MAUDE:
"Oh, and that you have."
I have just come from the bank...
... wherel discovered that you paid your own money...
... tobuythisglorifiedshack.
"Well, who else's money was I supposed to use?"
Somebody else's.
Anybody else's.
-Right.
"-Ezra, rule number one:"
We have an eyewitness that saw him dump a body.
- Even you said it was a cop.
- I said it could be.
Now we have a witness that said it wasn't.
"- Dad, let's go in."
"- Sit down, I'll be right with you."
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I'll be right in.
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?
You should be glad we caught him.
Where is he?
"They're going to throw the book at him, Nick."
Your son or not.
The criminal court of Pennsylvania is now in session.
The sentencing for the State versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.
The Honourable Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.
"- Mr. Gunther, where is your client?"
"- We don't know, Your Honour."
Jimmy...
"Son, listen to me."
Listen to Daddy.
We'll talk to them.
We'll work something out.
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?
They never found her.
"Jimmy, you don't have to do this."
"Cops don't go to prison, Dad."
I don't go!
Are you gonna give him a push?
- Let her go!
My face!
My face!
Fuck my face!
- I will kill!
- Do not!
Do not shoot him!
No!
Rook!
Jesus Christ!
- What have you done to him?
!
- Cut off my face!
Some customers called for a riot.
"Director, heard some gunshots."
"Parking area, heard a car coming fast."
- And receive a license plate?
- No.
"No, not received."
"The victim, logged in this morning."
Cash paid.
"""Please do not disturb"" card hanging on."
"The point is, John: boy, girl, made a small entry."
The little girl nursery.
Knows how to do this?
I think this is yours.
- Do you have any relatives learned about the connection?
- There was just Mike.
- Children's Services will have to search.
- No one does that by tomorrow morning.
- So Do not stay overnight with you?
- Will try tonight.
I got it under control!
I took a goddamn red-eye to be here this morning.
I'm exhausted.
I hate this fucking city.
You can't talk to me that way.
I'm not a fucking kid anymore.
What the fuck happened to you?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"You're a dead man, you know that?"
It's not the first time I've heard that today.
Stupid fucking cop.
Do you know who my father is?
Where's the little girl?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"For your sake, I hope that's a lie."
"Look at you, you stupid fucking nigger cop."
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the little girl?
[cell phone rings] [grunts]
Fuck.
[cell phone rings]
"Rook, did you--did you hang up the phone on me?"
"Is that what you did, Rook?"
I'm afraid Rook can't come to the phone right now.
Who is this?
Does it matter?
Put Rook on the phone.
It's too late for that.
If that's true
I'm talking to a dead man.
So they keep telling me.
Where's the girl?
"Oh, my..."
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?
"Okay, alright."
"Alright, saved by mum."
The best way to actually just stop her from calling is...
"I don't know, answer it."
"Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms I just don't wanna open right now, so..."
She's worried.
You're her son.
"You've been travelling, and I just think if you speak to her, then..."
"Yeah, well, I still live at home with her back in Syracuse."
- That's cool.
That's fine.
- Yeah.
I was taking care of my dad.
"Oh, shit."
Is he...?
- ...okay?
"- No, he died."
"- Oh, my God."
I'm sorry.
- Last year.
"No, it's okay."
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.
"Oh, that must have been really..."
uh... tough.
"Yeah, he was my best friend."
Sometimes he'd just look at me and wouldn't even know who I was.
"Well, my mum, like, I don't even..."
I don't know how to talk to her.
"You know, I don't have that connection."
Stop.
Stop!
Why did you save me?
You're like my father.
But such obsession.
You forced me to sit in the car.
Otherwise I would've shown you more.
Here's an advice.
Listen carefully and follow it.
Live larger than life.
Laugh more than you can cry.
Forgo your anger.
And finish your enemies with a smile.
Get it?
There's a rage in my heart too.
They killed 10 of my men.
I'll kill 20.
But... look at the boiling point of my mind.
It's still zero!
- Name.
- I want to forget mine.
Who I am where from everything.
Still I would like to know.
You can have a little faith in the Big Boss.
What do you say Boss?
And this way Big Boss made that boy... heir to his world and his heart.
And gave that nameless boy name... that fitted his stature.
BOSS!
Boy saves Haryana's transport king's life.
Satyakant.
You're still reading 15 year old news about your son.
You know very well Raghunath.
One minute and 11 seconds.
Oh.
"Oh, this is a wonder spot, Jeeves."
I bet this reeks with romance.
"- I hope not, sir."
- Yes.
"Anyway, it's a nice place for rest and quiet."
"I consider it the most peaceful spot in the whole of England, sir."
"Good egg, Jeeves, good egg."
I—
I wonder what's happened to our passenger.
That Ethiopian fellow seems to have evaporated.
"You'll probably find him down the road, sir, draped on a bush."
Do something about it because it worries me exceedingly.
I'll go and have lunch.
"Yes, sir."
Hello!
Hello!
"Yes, sir, Massa Gabriel, I's coming."
- Us plays the horn too.
"- Well, come on."
"Come, come."
We're there.
- Where?
- Here!
- Ain't I in pieces?
- You're as right as right can be.
Will y'all give me your word I ain't dead?
"Come on, come on."
Get out of the car and buzz off.
Is us in Leeds?
Leeds is many miles from here.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that."
I didn't mean it.
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's my fault, you know."
What?
"Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility for my share in the whole mess."
You know?
I forced him into getting married.
"- You know, he wasn't ready."
"- Janine, this isn't your fault."
"No, it is."
"It is, I've changed."
"I was fun, you know?"
I was fun when we first met.
You're still fun.
[SIGHS]
We don't have sex anymore.
Lots of couples go through lulls.
"No, I mean we never have sex."
[JANINE CRYING]
"I mean, realistically, what do I expect him to do, you know?"
I don't think that's really...
"God, this tile is too small."
I have to tell Javier.
- What?
- This tile is too small.
I gotta go.
"I have to take a personal day, if anyone asks."
MARIEL:
"Well, my first husband was unimpressive."
I found him in bed with his big-breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives.
I feel a bit...
"- Yeah, yeah."
- Can you...?
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Mm?
It's done.
So are either of the kids' fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abi's dad sends money and a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know."
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe.
I'll need it for the beach.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
- I couldn't sleep.
"- Yeah, me neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
I couldn't get air into my lungs.
It's panic.
And the best way of controlling that is singing.
"Sing to yourself - it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
How's your head?
It's fine.
I heard you stopped by Med the other day to see Anna.
She wouldn't see me.
No.
It was us that wouldn't let you see her.
"At the time, you represented hope for her, Kelly."
Did something happen?
"No, no, not that."
"But yes, something did."
"Her neutrophil count came up overnight, and we started her back on chemo this morning."
We want to take another shot at the bone marrow transplant.
"I mean, assuming we still have a donor."
Not even a question.
"Yeah, in 24 hours, we think she'll be strong enough to do it."
That's... that's great news.
"Truck 81, Engine 51."
"All right, buddy."
You go be a hero.
I'm gonna schedule your donation for tomorrow.
- All right.
- 7110 South St. Lawrence.
Help!
Please!
Maggie's trapped upstairs!
- Where?
- Up there!
"- Severide, Squad!"
- On it!
- Anybody else up there?
- No.
"Casey, vent the roof."
"I beg your pardon, sir, for barging in."
- Get out of here!
"- I'm trying, sir."
"All right, I'll see that you do."
Wait here a minute.
MacGregor...
What the devil are you doing?
- Do you want to know who I am?
"- Yes, I do."
"Well, sir, see, I'm from the London Bureau of Boats, Barges, Brigs, all tethered bottoms and maintenance of, sir... that's it."
Maintenance?
This place is condemned.
I'm the last one.
Lucky you are.
"If you've got wet rot on the top, you've got dry rot on the bottom."
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.
Look at that.
- What...?
- Oh!
I'll see what I can do.
I'll put my report in... and I'll try and get them before they close.
"I haven't got a cork with me, so I'll be back later..."
"Terrible thing, you've got there."
"Dreadful thing, that."
"Terrible mess you've got there, terrible mess."
- Madam?
"- Some knock-out drops, please."
- Some...?
- Knock-out drops.
- You want a pick-me-up?
"- If I did, I would say so."
"We came this far by faith, Lord."
"And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected."
"We thank you for him,Jesus."
- In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
- Amen.
"Oh,you can cry like a river, girl."
"You're crying so bad, I won't even make fun of you."
"Oh, God."
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
"I want you to be good, okay?"
"And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know."
I done told you what to do.
"Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers."
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
"Once he get in the door, I want him to stay in there for four years."
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
"Well, I hope so anyway."
When I was young
"- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA."
"If I set my mind, I can"
- I can go.
I can st
- I can go.
Get in good college.
I can go.
You'd never met him?
"I've never seen him before this morning, hand to God."
"Look, the cops got it all wrong, man."
You know I would never do this.
You gotta believe me.
"You believe me, right?"
Yeah.
But it's not me you need to worry about.
"No, please, just don't tell Jackie."
"And it's not your sister, either."
Gibbs is my best agent.
Convince him.
"Tell him the truth, everything will be okay."
Minute's up.
No record.
This your first arrest?
First and only.
"I'm a good person, Agent Gibbs; ask Leon."
I'm not asking him.
I'm asking you.
"Well, I just meant he knows who I am."
He knows I'd never kill anybody.
Cops say they found you with blood on your hands.
I was trying to stop that kid from bleeding to death.
They said that you were asking skittish.
That you couldn't get your story straight.
They wouldn't let me talk.
I tried to tell them what happened.
They wouldn't listen.
They just assumed I was lying.
Okay.
I'm listening.
I followed him into New Haven.
He just parks and into the scientific supplies store.
What?
Open the car.
Open the car.
- Shit.
- What?
He's buying a Geiger counter.
God damn.
"Look, I need you to stall him for an hour, all right?"
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
"Look, you want to succeed in the life?"
Figure it out.
Work the problem.
And now what?
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna salt it.
With what?
Gonna find somebody on CraigsList trying to unload a couple pounds of yellowcake?
Nope.
Bullshit.
Is the internet ever wrong?
"If kitty litter's radioactive enough to set off a Geiger counter, what makes you think it won't grow me a third nut or some shit like that?"
"For the amount you've been breaking my balls lately,"
I could use a spare one.
[sobbing]
Hey.
You okay?
No!
"Oh, God."
Ohh.
Arrest me!
I'm asking for police custody!
I'm a criminal!
Arrest me!
Jeffrey... my friend.
Do you believe in God?
"No, but I enjoy the tranquility here."
Want to check the gun?
I trust you.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night ofdesolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams
When we have each other
Who needs tomorrow
When we have today
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?
"Please, leave me alone."
I'm frightened.
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
Next day...
I woke up and... both my... my eyes were swelled up.
What did the doctors say?
"It's one who sets the table, prepares a meal or teaches in a certain way."
"- You're an artist, isn't she?"
- Thank you.
Why didn't you use the Limoges?
May I serve you?
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.
"We go to all this trouble, and Rose and I don't eat very much."
- Really?
- Mmm.
I've always thought she had a very healthy appetite.
I can't stand women who eat two bites and say they're full.
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.
Can I have some?
And potatoes.
Mmm-mmm.
You don't need them.
Have you ever sat in on one of your daughter's classes?
- Rose!
- What?
That's the best part.
- Rose tells me you've never been married.
- Mom.
"That's all right, Rose."
"That's correct, Mrs. Morgan."
I guess I haven't found the right girl.
"I've had relationships that haven't worked out, but that will change."
Really?
Why?
"As I told Rose,"
I have a theory about love and sex.
Let me see.
Come on.
Turn around.
"You know, Bob, It's the third day of your diet... and that weight is just... falling off."
"- I'm, surprised you recognize me."
- Yeah.
- Something smells good.
What is it?
"- Oh, it's not for you, honey."
It's for the company.
I know you don't like lasagna.
That's why I made it.
"Well, if I don't like it, why does it smell so good?"
"- What, what do I get?"
"- Oh, it's over there on that dish."
It looks so lonely and so small.
Is this all I get to eat?
"Oh, no, honey."
You get a big salad with lemon juice and a big glass of water.
"Great. if I want seconds, I'll just, rattle my cup against the bars of my cell."
"Oh, honey."
It's not that bad.
You can have some of the hors d'oeuvres.
"Oh, good."
"No, no."
Not those.
The ones with the yellow toothpicks in them.
- The yellow toothpicks.
- Yeah.
"Oh, honey."
"I know it's rough, but it's worth it, isn't it?"
"- Emily, come here."
"Area one, clear!"
"Area three, clear."
"Room clear, stand down."
Is there any news on Richard yet?
"Well, he wasn't at the flat."
We've done our bit.
You've certainly done yours.
You all right?
He'll run.
Start afresh.
They've sent out an alert to all airports and stations.
But what if he's already gone?
Hello?
What?
Fantastic.
"OK, just hold on, would you?"
Someone matching the description of Richard Henderson boarded the Eurostar to Brussels.
The police picked him up at Ashford.
They've got him!
I've been tying to work out what I did wrong.
"Come on, it's killing me, what was it?"
Something I said or...
It was something you touched.
The picture.
Caught out by Jesus!
How irritating!
Irritating?
Is that your summary of what's happened?
"Oh, please, don't expect me to express guilt."
Come on!
You killed those people.
Why?
-
- Pardon?
-
- It's not so loud.
-
- I can't hear you for that shirt.
The milk woman loves it.
Don't change the subject.
We're talking about shirts.
We've got an empty shop here.
"Come on, you're supposed to be outside getting customers in."
Smarten yourself up.
What's the point?
I'll only make a fool of myself.
Then make a smartly--dressed fool of yourself.
-
- Call this smartly--dressed?
-
- It's style for an apprentice shopkeeper.
I know.
"It's a hell of a rig for a fighter pilot, though!"
"Granville, you're going out on your first solo mission!"
The world is your oyster.
"Go out, pick a victim, and come at him out of the sun."
"You're on your own, B--B--Biggles."
Bring 'em back alive.
I'll hold your parachute.
"What are you doing, charging into people that way?"
-
- You can stop people's breath that way!
-
- Ow!
"Well, I've got $50 that says you can't get one past me out there."
What do you say?
Ls that a yes?
"You know, I've got the lowest goals against in Pennsylvania history, right?"
Wow!
That's really funny because I've scored the most in Pennsylvania history.
"Yeah, but for girls."
Come on.
Combined.
All right.
Let's go.
And this.
Let's go.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Let's go.
"Come on, you got better than that."
"Let's go, you're the MVP girl."
"Oh, man."
I could get you in a game.
You just need to be distracted.
"Trust me, watching you shoot in that shirt is distracting enough."
So?
Ls this feng shui hockey for real?
"We got gear, uniforms and our fees paid."
"And they can run the practises, but we'll still play the games my way."
- So lots of skating and no scoring?
- That is harsh.
"You open with the Hounds, Saturday."
Drop the Zen crap.
Control the blue line and put me on the roster.
Then you'll have a shot.
I think... cleaning's overrated.
There's still hot food down there to eat.
There's something really truthful about this waiting... and doing the whole job at once.
"We're gonna use up all the dishes, and then it's time to clean."
So you want to talk about it?
Not really.
Hallie call?
No.
Call her?
And say what?
I haven't done anything.
I do.
I'm not a housewife.
And I found fleas in the bedroom.
You mean my pets?
"I think fleas are people, too."
And... they should be treated as such.
Those are my pets.
And you're going to kill them?
Are you a murderess?
"Seven, what do you think I should do?"
Be honest.
"Well, I've been honest."
Not with Hallie.
With yourself.
"Sorry, babe."
I cannot give you any more advice on this one.
Just take mine!
And you put on... your...
"You know, if Vanessa has a problem with it she should clean that (bleep) up."
"Hey, it's Dale."
"Listen, Hallie, why don't you just call me back, please."
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy,"
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy, not just 90%."
not just 90%.
You know?
You know?
This is what I'm thinking -
"This is what I'm thinking - pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, we'll shake hands, part as friends."
"we'll shake hands, part as friends."
What do you say?
What do you say?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
I could live with that.
I could live with that.
Lennie McPherson?
Lennie McPherson?
I am he.
I am he.
Phil Scott.
I rang you.
Phil Scott.
"They tend to be pen snobs, strictly Montblanc and beyond."
Why does he creep you out?
- He doesn't creep me out.
"- Yes, he does."
You get a bad vibe from the guy.
- It's complicated.
- Tell me.
I like complicated.
Ari does a great deal of independent reading.
You can see she's excited by the idea of fiction.
It's one of the things that makes her a good student.
- So you're taking my wife out.
- Uh...
Sorry?
"Well, you're going out with my wife."
"To, uh, some book event?"
"Right, right."
The book signing next week.
"An event for an author we both like, Leonard Addams."
Leonard Addams.
Do you...?
Do you think he's good?
I like some of his stuff very much.
"Ella's a fan, too."
"Well, I think he's a fake."
Very overrated.
He has his critics.
He certainly wouldn't fit in to what I'm trying to do with Aria's class.
Is he really your idea of a good writer?
"Well, I like a lot of writers for a lot of different reasons."
Hmm.
"Ha, ha."
- I may pass out here.
"- No, you won't."
- Do you know CPR?
"- Uh, n-no."
You're gonna need to take my right arm and put it across my chest.
Okay.
Make sure I don't roll over.
Then what do I do?
You're gonna have to give me mouth-to-mouth.
I'm sorry I said those things about the way you live.
I was scared.
It's like Allie said--people get mean when they get scared.
All right.
"She's a wonderful girl, Lisa."
You did great.
"You want CNN here so badly, why don't you call 'em yourself?"
"Because they'd just think he was crazy, and he wants everyone to know that he isn't crazy at all."
( cell phone rings )
Yeah?
Okay.
The media'll be here in 15 minutes.
"We're almost home, fruit loops."
( gunshot )
( everyone screams )
Get down.
Who took that shot?
( cell phone rings )
What the hell do you think you're doing?
!
What'd you think would happen if you tried something like that?
It was a miscommunication.
I'm sorry.
- Is it?
"OK, OK, that's..."
that's just the wind.
Donkey!
And apparently it knows my name.
"That's very funny, Shrek."
But I know it's you doing this.
"Hey, I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way.
"This place is not haunted by a ghost, and when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new King of..."
"It's right behind me, isn't it?"

"Well, that's what I'd call a ""knight"" to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say... grab the kids and let's get going.
And that's why we're the Kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
We probably won't see him for a month.
"So, what else have you got in your bag of tricks?"
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
"Oh, very nice!"
I am not happy!
Get your jacket off and get out!
"This season, on Hell's Kitchen:"
How dare you?
"If you don't get out, I'll drag you out."
Really?
It's the one you've been waiting for.
Did you... notice any black smoke?
"What are you, crazy?"
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
"I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally but not physically --"
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
Kind of?
She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulphur.
Maybe it's not a demon.
"I mean, kids can be vicious."
"Well, I mean, we're already here."
Might as well check out the school.
Right.
The school.
What?
"Truman High, home of the bombers."
What's your point?
I don't know.
"I mean, we went there, like... for a month a million years ago."
- Why are you so jazzed to go back?
- I'm not.
I just think it's worth looking into.
"All right, well, what's our cover?"
FBI?
Homeland Security?
Swedish exchange students?
Don't worry.
I got an idea.
Okay.
"[ ""Long, Long Way From Home"" by Foreigner) ]"
"Thanks, dad."
Got your lunch?
- Sorta.
"It's hard work, ain't it?"
"Hey, I'm just happy to help out."
That's what I hear.
"So, uh, can you do me?"
Pardon?
"What you did for lester, i want it done."
I didn't do anything to lester.
"Look, he's right over there."
I sit alone in a room all day praying for death to come.
You got to do this for me.
Please.
Listen to me.
I killed 5 men in my life.
4 of them had slanty eyes and were shooting at me and my buddies.
The other one was a drunk driver who ran over my 10-year-old nephew.
They all had it coming.
"But I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna kill a war hero, a brother in arms."
I just won't do it.
Then you're a fag.
"Say that again, war hero or not, I'll kill you."
You are a fag.
"Ok, all right."
We're on.
5 goddamn miles.
"You know, i nearly had a heart attack."
My legs feel like jell-O.
"Oh, that's all right, dude."
You'll get used to it.
"Yeah, when?"
"Uh, depends on you."
You're pretty good with that thing.
The marriage shall take place on the same day.
And it shall happen with Sheen only.

Okay brother!
"Be ready on time, tomorrow."
Okay?
- I shall get the priest.
- Okay!
- Bye!
Take care!
- Bye!
Are you okay?
Oh god!
You shied away?
The priest shall be on the way.
You shied away?

I got to know that she had a heart attack.

You handle it.

Keep faith in god.

"I'm gonna find him, wherever he is."
I think you'll find this room delightful.
"It has a lovely view down Main Street, just as you requested."
I call it the presidential suite.
The very best appointments.
I'm expecting new linens from the capital soon.

Don't push.

"-Yes, we are, ma'am."
-How long will you be gone?
-However long it takes.
"Way we figure, Eli Joe is just a day ahead of us."
Where to first?
-What's this all about?
-Thought you could use some help.
I'm much obliged.
But my business with this man is mine and mine alone.
"Got no argument there. lt's just, it's awful big country out there, is all."
"- How can you say that, Uncle?"
"No matter how much you teach a donkey, it can never become a horse."
"- Come on, now!"
"- Phone for you, Baba."
"Yes, mother. I am coming."
Why?
What happened?
is everything fine?
Mother is feeling somewhat ill.
"Uncle, I am moving."
"All right, then, Uncle."
What happened?
The car has broken down.
Let's check what's wrong.
I don't understand what's wrong with it?
It's become a problem.
The problem has been solved.
Excuse me...
Did you think that person to be the hotel's doorman who parks cars?
No.
Then you give your car to strangers just like that?
There are some people who don't look like strangers in the first meetings too.
Do you believe that he will return?
He will return.
He will surely return.
A girl...and a car!
"How wonderful, Lord!"
I pray at the shrine.
But He gives everything to him.
Anyway...
"Mother, you are unwell."
"Still, you are sitting here?"
- Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
- I quit.
He can suck it.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.

Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity and prove everybody wrong.
- What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"- The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said your eye is weird."
This eye?
"It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
Where is Liz?
Liz!
Get down!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
- Is Liz back yet?
- No.
Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
- I'm sorry?
- Which cat?

- to summon your angry nerd strength?
- I'm fine.

- Whoa.
I don't remember having that in my storeroom.
"Yo, guys."
What's going on?
[ Chuckles ]
Why aren't you out at the party?
- The thing is...
- We're in a weird situation.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
"I get it, fellas."
It's okay.
"I mean, look, you're 17."
"Life's crazy right now, and the one thing you can really count on is your best friend."
It's natural to kiss a little.
"You know, just see if it feel all right."
Dude!
We're not gay.
We didn't kiss.
"Uh, duh!"
[ Laughs ]
I did not kiss my best friend in high school either.
At all.
Ever.

This is just the greatest night!
"Oh, well, you know."
"Hey, if, uh, the mountain won't come to Muhammad-"
"Hey, Danny, look."
"As your accountant and as your friend,"
I sort of feel I have some kind of fiduciary obligation to advise you-
I know.
You want me to sell my dad's house.
I will.
"Hey, every month you don't,"
- you're incurring a wholly unnecessary tax liability.
- I get it.
- You like that?
"- Yeah, I get it."
Yeah?
What about this?
What if I put you in touch with a broker?
"I'd love to chat, Stan, but I gotta go home and get some sleep."
Good.
"Then you can be fresh for my poker game tonight, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
Hey.
Hey.
An accountant that works out of a topless pool.
Nice.
He's bugging me about selling my dad's house.
How much you say he bought the place for?
"He bought the land for 16,000 and built the house himself."
"16,000?"
Yeah.
You know how much it's worth?
A million and a half.
Excuse me.
Why don't you take this?
Then you can call off the bet.
What bet?
"I know you have sworn to seduce me, and at this rate you will succeed, so..."
That's a disgusting lie!
Who told you that?
Marie?
"She's a good friend, I have no reason to doubt her."
Once I wrote you a letter and asked her to deliver it.
I found out that she signed her own name to it!
Surely you realise she wants you for herself?
"- Dear lady, please..."
"- Don't worry, I'm going!"
She's right.
We're not suited.
I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities.

I survived 37 hours of Gestapo interrogation.
That wasn't luck.
- Don't make the same mistake twice.
- What mistake?
Treating me differently.
Compromising our objective because of what you feel.
- Feel?
- For me?
You have no idea.
"Sister Miri, thank you"
- for all your help.
- I want to come with you.
I'm not a nun.
Mother's been sheltering me here for a month while those pigs are out there.
My father taught me to hunt.
To be proud.
He'd be ashamed to see me now... hiding.
"Please, let me hunt with you."
You've got two more bottles of whisky to get through before midnight.

"If we're gonna build an army, we've got to start somewhere."
Two watch towers.
Six hundred feet of exposed no man's land.
What about that hill?
It's not guarded.
It's covered in land mines.
So is that path.
No problem.
What about a blind spot from the tower?
- There isn't one.
- No time to tunnel under.
- Patrols?
- Twenty-four hour rotation.
- Like a Swiss watch.
No gaps.
- Efficient bastards.
Maybe we don't need to break into the camp.

It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.

Absolutely.
Are you kidding me with this?
"Oh, come on, sweetie."
All's fair in love and murder investigations.
"What, do you think this is a game?"
As hot as it would be to see you two fight...
Especially after that kiss...
We need to work together on this.
It is in all our best interests.
All right.
We'll work together.
For now.
Wow.
This is actually gonna work out great.
"While you and Kendall keep Austin distracted,"
I'll search his house for proof that he's The Phantom.

"Oh, yay for you."

"You look stunning, today"
Today you're really beautiful

She always thinks she's beautiful

She killed our parents.
Our parents brought that on themselves.

It was in their house.

Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me... I told him to stop.
He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Huh?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together.
Clean up.
"What do you want, fucko?"
"You want some, huh?"
"I swear on my fuckin' mother, if you touch her again, you're dead."
Don't shoot.
Hide this.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
"I know there are women, like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide."
But I didn't.
I got to admit the truth:
It turned me on.

He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now.
He's married.

Is this true?
Ten past one.
That's my record.

"They're just sentimental value, nothing more."
"Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff and bring it up here, will you?"
Anything else you want?
"- Well, my rifle."
- No.
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.
You getting all choky seeing me behind bars?
God damn you.
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.
- The paper said they're charms.
"- Yeah, they are."
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.
Who are those fellows out there with those rifles?
That's the National Guard.
The paper said they didn't think we could hold you in jail... and they got kind of personal about it.

Must be too expensive.
Beautiful books about the revolution that nobody wants to buy.
What can I do for you?
"Hey, a first edition."
This is an antiquarian book.
It's been here for years.
No one will buy it like this.
Let alone follow its example.
"No, they'd rather buy this junk."
Rather than Marx and his revolution.

Ab from the assault group.
-I thought you'd never recognize me.
"Yes, I've changed."
Hair doesn't grow on brains.
It also doesn't grow on sandy soils.

You could give them to your capitalist friends.
They've already got them all.
Or else their children.

He wouldn't go to the hospital.
Of course he wouldn't.

- He's okay.

I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean to scare you.
"Jesus, Patty."
I'm sorry.
Look.
"Uh, the reason-- the reason why I'm-- I'm here is, um... you seem to be the only person who knows how to ground him."
And he could really use that right now.
"So if there's anything that you can do,"
I just-
- I'd really appreciate it.
Okay?
Why are you doing this?
What do you mean?
This case.
Why are any of you doing it?
It's destroying him.
It looks like it's destroying you.

"And, uh, no one's getting paid for this."
So I don't know why the fuck we're doing this.
"But... everyone needs a reason to wake up in the morning, and it's a pretty good fucking reason."
"I'm having a day, okay?"
Okay.
So... are you in?
- Of course.
BRENNAN:
Oh...
This is blood.
Aldo's?
"We can't be completely sure, there are tests..."
"Look at that, Bones."
Look.
That's the cage.
(Brennan groans)
Cam will want to do blood spatter analysis as soon as possible.
(camera snapping)
Bones.
I need to finish...
"No, look."
Look!
"Booth, that's a bomb!"
BOOTH:
"We got to go, now."
(grunting)
(gasping)
(Brennan groaning)
Crews are still battling the blaze at an abandoned office complex in Anacostia.
"The cause of the fire is undetermined, but fire marshals suspect the strong possibility of arson."
Booth says it was an IED.
"Yeah, but do IEDs usually take this long to burn off?"
HODGINS:
"No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas."
My hunch is it was powered by a petroleum gel.
"It sticks to everything and burns at over 2,000 degrees."
Which means there won't be much left.
Close to zilch.
"Whoa, Dr. B."
Cool!
I like fat black girls.
I can't believe this cruise doesn't have cocktail sauce.
"Finish your breakfast, Rallo!"
"Hey, Junior."
Huh?
"All right, pirates, in one hour we board the cruise ship to rape, pillage and plunder."
PIRATES:
Yay!
"And maybe this time, a little less raping."
"I think with the last boat, we all got a wee bit carried away."
"We're better than that, you guys."
"I never thought I'd say this, but if I have to eat one more friggin' shrimp"
I'm gonna kill myself.
I got one!
(flapping like a fish)
"Okay, okay, stop it!"
"Oh, my goodness, a talking whale!"
I'm not a talking wha...
"Oh, come on, that's... that's mean."
"What mysteries of the deep have you come to tell me, o sea monster?"
"Junior, it's me."
Your dad.
Daddy!
"""Dad,"" 14. ""Dad."""
"Listen, we're in a heap of trouble."
Somali pirates are about to take over the ship unless we stop them.
Where's your mother?
She's dead.
"Oh, right."
Where's Donna?
(funk music playing)
No it's cool.
What's going on?
"Well, um, Nathan's talking about quitting the team."
"And I just, I don't know what to say."
"Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up so I really can't help you out much."
But you're so much better with him than I ever was.
He's lucky to have you.
Thanks.
I don't want to keep you from your practice.
Hmm.
Go Ravens.
"Hey, um, I didn't mean anything, about your mom."
It's cool.
Okay.
You could have told me Travis was a group.
It's not like it's some big secret.
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that.
I felt so stupid.
You're not stupid.
You guys just don't like the same things.
"See, that's the problem."
He brings up art and books and I've got nothing.
- Hey you.
- Hey you.
And you.
"Welcome back, gentlemen."
Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus.
Suicides.
Now.
"Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski."
"Come on, Coach."
It's either this or I miss practice.
- You're kidding me.
- You're squandering my money.
You've been studying for seven years and you're only half way through.
- I'II get it together.
- Marry Michelle or earn your living.
- But dad...
- It's all arranged.
"You get a car, a house, and 25000 a month."
You can't force me to marry her.
The wedding is in two months.
Your friends are not welcome.
And your mother says she's waiting for some grandchildren.
"Hey, Marc?"
"What are you doing, you fucking faggot?"
"- Fuck you, bitch."
- What's going on?
He tried to kiss me.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She was dancing.
I thought you'd finished with her.
- It's nearly closing time.
- There are still five on the list.
Who hasn't gone yet?
I saw Christian and Johannes.
Johannes is too drunk for it.
Will you do Christian?
I am too sore.
"- Of course, baby."
- Thanks.
How do you feel about your mum and dad?
- What are you doing?
- Why won't he talk to her?
Yesterday's fireworks are still echoing.
"So, no thanks."
Brilliant.
"And now, if you're done with your story... please get out of my house!"
Your house?
Wow!
"But, I believe this house isn't yours, it belongs to Tisha."
"And, I believe Tisha is no more."
Do you think you're the only one who can create an illusion?
Tisha is alive.
I'm very happy to hear that.
"Anyway, if you had any kind of proof then..."
We do have proof.
Your fingerprints.
What?
You heard me.
Your fingerprints.
They are on the key.
When we were banging on the door...
Mr. Malhotra?
Mr. Malhotra?
You said the key was in the keyhole.
"The key is in the keyhole, but he never locks the door."
And we believed you.
And when you realised I would break the door down... you made your move.
"Hammer... quick, come on."
This is your proof?
!
Of course my fingerprints were on the key.
"I turned the key to open the door, remember?"
"Yes, I remember."
"Then, explain this."
And we'll be here for you when you get out of rehab.
B-But I won't know anyone there.
You know what?
I think it'd be a good idea if Tim dried out a bit.
"(slurping, belches)"
"And Lester, too."
He's an alcoholic.
I'm just addicted to seeing you pretty.
"(hiccups) Oh, Lester!"
"I'd better go, too."
I'm a sex addict.
Carpal tunnel.
(crying)
"Oh, this is so embarrassing."
We're all wearing the same smocks!
We don't belong here.
"I mean, look at all these weirdoes."
I sold my penis for meth.
I got drunk and had sex with my boss's car.
I huff propane.
"And the worst part is, I only took those pills so I could go on that Commodores Gold Record and All-You-Can-Eat Jumbo Shrimps Cruise."
And now I can't go.
"Just don't think about it, C-bro."
Kind of tough not to think about it.
"Hey, what're you guys looking at?"
"No, Shrimpy Dave, don't look!"
Is that shrimp?
I'm off the wagon!
Ew.
I thought he'd be eating it.
"Lord, help Shrimpy Dave."
(slaps) Ow!
The noodles slide into such a long and deep tunnel
Noodles
"I want to eat them, too."
I'm gonna eat!
Hold on.
Motel
You shouldn't hang such a thing here.
"It's my favorite, so it should be beside me."
"Oh, my!"
Oh goodness.
Where are you running off to?
You won't get far in a motel room.
"Well, my business isn't doing so well lately."
"Business, my butt."
You call hidden cameras a business?
"Wait, so you recorded me with a hidden camera?"
- Is that it?
"- No, I didn't."
I told you to pay up last week.
"Give me a few days, and I promise I'll pay."
- You rotten bastard!
- What?
You said you're a poet.
Where's your camera?
Hand it over now!
What camera?
"No, there's a camera, but you saw already."
"It was covered, so nothing got recorded."
- Shut up!
- Put on your underwear.
You're not wearing anything.
It's embarrassing so hurry.
"Today, you are a downpour from up above... that drenches all my heart."
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
Rhino.
I'll close the restaurant.
Mom wants you home; you leave.
Okay.
"Sorry, sir."
We are closed.
Someone named Varun...
I'm Varun.
And you are?
Your eyesight?
I had lost it earlier.
After a surgery now...
"Sir, who are you?"
Do you remember Deepa?
Sir!
I'm her father.
Why did you let us down like that!
"Sir, what do you mean?"
Didn't Deepa come now?
Where is Deepa?
"She told us happily that you offered to help us with the money, that all our problems will go away..."
Phew.
"Listen, O'Leary, I know we're up against it time-wise, but, er..."
"Yeah, big time."
"We've got like, we've got to save Simon."
"Dermot, give me a second."
There's a bit of a big deal happening.
Right.
"Sid Lowecroft is leaving, um, this is a little present for his daughter."
"Oh, OK."
Put this on.
But he doesn't know who I am.
"That's what the whole kick is, he'll get a kick out of the new guy."
"He won't get a kick out of it, he'll go, ""Who are you?"
"""Why are you gate-crashing my last day?"""
"No, he won't, as soon as he walks in, blow that."
"Then give him the doll, read out the letter."
Yeah.
It's some kind words that I've written down for him.
OK.
And then let one of these bad boys off.
"Doll, letter, boom."
Bingo.
I'm going to go and get the cake.
Let him know that we're ready.
You're not in this with me?
"No, no, no, no, I'm just going to go and get a cake."
"Right, hide under there when he comes in."
Right.
Are you ready for this?
Under there?
"Yeah, under there."
Under there.
"I'm fucking with you, Cooper."
I told you to come up here to see if we've broken you enough to obey instructions without question.
- And we have.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
"Katie, come on."
"Katie, come on, let me out!"
"Katie, let me out, come on!"
What the fuck!
"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
"Oh, what are you doing to me?"
- Why are you doing this?
- You thought you'd see your mother.
"- Oh, fuck!"
- What does she look like?
"Your mother, can you describe her face?"
Her hair colour?
She...
"Is she tall, short, fat, thin?"
- Where did you grow up?
- She...
What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?
The name of the girl who stabbed you?
"You don't know any of these things, do you?"
Don't you think that's odd?
It's fucking taking my memories!
"Overwriting them, technically."
Fuck.
Look in the mirror behind you.
Do you recognize yourself?
Do you even know who you're looking at?
Soon you won't be anything.
Ha
It was very strong ...
Fool!
Why you do not tell me before you do something like that?
!
Curse!
Why you not think about it in our lives?
I just want to train to get stronger.
Wow ...
That problem.
That's why I do not want to come across Bills-sama.
Huh?
Who is that Bills-sama?
can not be ... idiot ...
I knew it!
You're hiding something!
That's why you're acting so weird!
Is it a person?
There is a God.
It has the same level as Kaio Shin-sama.
he is coming here.
no problem.
He is a very cold and a very awesome God.
An awesome God?
"He is also called ""The God Of Destruction"
If there is something he does not like the the planet and lives ends up being destroyed.
Like when someone stamps on dogs shit?
sort of.
Like when you can not eat in the cafeteria?
sort of.
Like when someone urine into the hot springs?
Something like that!
What if I wake up?
Shan.
Believe it.
OK.
Come on.
Are they...?
They're wolves.
"Tom, they're wolves."
All this time.
It was wolves.
- My beast isn't a beast at all.
- How can there be wolves?
They've been extinct in Britain for years.
Maybe people just think they died out.
"Maybe they've been here all the time, surviving without anyone knowing."
"Right, you ready, Kyle?"
Sleeping animals are a lot easier to film than angry snarling ones.
Turns out The Beast wasn't a beast at all.
"Thought to be extinct in this country, these two wolves... have survived."
Their existence a secret for years... until I found them.
"Not a bad night's work, eh?"
They're waking up.
You should let them go now.
Why would I do that?
"Give us a hand, Steve."
What are you doing?
"I'm not going to leave them here for someone else to find, am I?"
So you're keeping them?
"As what, some sort of trophy?"
For now.
Then I'll sell them off to a zoo or something.
Why?
"-... noBankExchange."""""
-And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner...
... butweneedBankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy...
... it'spoliticallyexpedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
I'm talking about a 60-story building that'll employ 3000 people.
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George...
... FrankAnselmo'sin there.
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Please.
"Hey, Jerry."
"George, you decided to get a rug."
"Good for you, Jack."
"Well, I'm just looking, really."
"Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment."
I'll be right with you.
"Listen, George, I got some bad news."
I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
- What?
- What?
This judge has to use it for some scofflaw.
"And you know, you can't fight city hall."
"You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day."
- You didn't!
- I did.
And he told me that...
- I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
- Give me that thing.
How's your life?
All right?
"Yeah, not bad at all."
"And now, ladies and gentlemen of the press it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jake Jarmel."
"So, Jake, what's your percentage on this book?"
"Actually, I have some very interesting information on that."
"- You know, this is a co-venture..."
- Where did you get those?
- And as such it...
- Those glasses.
- Where did you get those glasses?
Just assume it's a ha bit.
- Ha bit left unchanged... tends to become necessity-like.
"- Philosophy, again?"
You're twelve
Talk like a 12-year old!
Why all this big talk?
"There's no childhood, no adulthood."

All right!
I lose!

Why d' you forget the almonds everyday?

That's my diary!
- So what...?
Only I can read it.
- That was so funny
Let me read some more.
- No way!
This is a private diary.
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up... her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me
"You won't tell anyone, will you?"
- Never
All right.
I'll read.
You listen.
Lock down the building!
This is Ryan Chappelle.
Nina Myers is loose in the building.
"Lock it down, now!"
"Nina, drop the gun and put your hands on your head, now!"
Kim.
What the hell are you doing?
You don't want to be any part of this.
Shut up.
Just turn around and walk away.
"If you leave now, you won't get hurt."
Kim.
"Don't do it, Nina."
"I swear to god, I'll shoot you."
You won't kill me.
"Nina, damn it."
"Kim, back up."
Back up.
"Kim, I want you to go back into CTU, tell them we got Nina."
"- Dad, listen to me."
We need...
"- Kim, go now!"
"Please, baby, just go."
Go.
"You don't have any more useful information, do you, Nina?"
I do.
"No, you don't."
Tony Almeida has just informed us that they were unable to confiscate this Cordilla virus in Mexico.
"This man Amador, where is he now?"
Latest working theory is that Amador has this virus and is headed back here to Los Angeles.
I let you live.
The tourist is still on the loose.
But I have a hunch Daddy's gonna come back for his little girl.
So he's still alive.
"Not for very long, he isn't."
Don't screw up this time!
Motts!
You stay here with him.
Hey!
Do I look like I need a babysitter?
Sit down and shut up!
"Oh, shit."
Mr. President.
I..
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability..
to launch missiles at any target in the United States.
Our satellites show massive troop movements..
"in Russia, Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula."
"What are your orders, sir?"
"I swear to you all, I swear.."
that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!
No.
General..
how soon can you execute an air strike on the White House?
Sir.
We can have Raptors on target in 10 minutes.
Then do it.
Let's go to work!
Sir..
"Carol, we have to end this."
We have to.
I'm not like him!
Then I'll be the one who break your ribs if you are!
- Break my ribs?
- Beat you hard!
How are you?
"Times without you, are my wonderful times!"
"Sounds like, you do miss me!"
"But, what can I do?"
Seems like I don't miss you!
"What you have just said, makes me even happier than knowing you are a love child!"
Nice ring!
- Is that from your boyfriend?
"- Yes, it is."
You the first to know.
Engagement ring.
So I should congratulate you guys!
When will you guys getting married?
Hurry up!
- I can't believe that he is still shy!
- That's not related!
- Wine...
- Wine...
Let's toast for Yawang!
- Toast!
- For what?
"An early wish to you and Xiaotian, for eternal happiness in marriage, and have a baby boy soon!"
Great!
Have a baby boy!
Drink it!
I want to go to the toilet.
Hurry!
Whay do you want?
She was calling for help because the wackos had tied her up.
And she took off with them?
-Yeah.
Are you Batman or what?
-I'm...
Should we send the dogs after him?
This is the reality now.
Dad.
I'll be damned.
Dad...
"I'm moving in here, Dad."
I have burnout.
-What?
I need rest.
The only cure for that is to start working.
"You don't like me, Dad."
-Don't say that.
Your tights look good on TV.
You were never happy with the fact that I'm just a firefighter.
You should've done your homework.
You're the one who drove me out before I'd done my homework.
You have no idea what it's like to sit in the garbage all night!
"Like mother, like son."
What would've happened to you and Mom had we not moved here?
"Stop patronizing me, you super sociologist!"
Fine...
I'll go out to play.
The garbage can is on fire!
It's that wacko again.
"-Don't go, he can be unpredictable."
They'll give him a lesson.
Look who's here!
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
This is not a discussion.
When I--
"- Hello, Artie."
- Artie.
- Artie.
- James.
"Okay, I think I know who this is."
And I've got to go.
You tail the agents.
Grab the tsuba.
Watch out For implosion grenades.
Good-bye.
Your agents Bering and Lattimer
Are compromised.
Not possible.
I ran a background check on Arthur Nielsen.
Where'd you get this information?
I have my sources same as you do.
I don't see how any of this is your business.
The three of them returned to the embassy last night.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I have no desire to stir up an international incident.
It's a great deal of paperwork and a great deal of scrutiny.
And you and I both get screwed.
"If you can't handle this,"
I will be forced to take this to a higher authority.
Everything all right?
Yes.
Peachy.
What?
The tsuba's heading back to the museum.
Mostly.
"Are you two lazy bastards gonna get up and help, or what?"
So how do you know Will?
We volunteered together at Amnesty International a couple years ago.
"Yeah, that's right."
"How is the Burmese situation, Tom?"
Better?
I mean good?
"Yeah, and he called me up out of the blue for Christmas lunch."
"So, here I am."
Really?
"So, listen, what's the deal with you and Ellie now?"
Is she your girlfriend?
Are you insane?
Where did you get those trainers?
- Why?
What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.
What?
"By the way, I do think you and Rachel have a shot."
"- I mean, if you don't screw it up."
- Thank you.
I'd created a monster.
Or maybe he created me.
I don't know what Will was so upset about.
All I meant was I don't think couples are the future.
You need more than that.
You need backup.
"The way I saw it, Will and I both had backup now."
It's like that thing he told me Jon Bon Jovi said:

"No, I know who bev is."
Who's rob?
Morning's brother.
With the truck.
What truck?
He had a truck!
"Anyway, last week, before we got back together, she slept with him."
No shit?
And she told you?
"To her credit, she felt we needed to be honest."
"What, is she stupid?"
"And this was gonna be your big, like,"
"""finally back together"" weekend?"
Yeah.
"For fans of irony, it's a real treat."
Man.
I figured you two would be fucking like bunnies.
More like bunnies with awkward silences and sullen looks.
I actually slept on the sofa.
Seriously?
"Well, I don't want to sleep in her bed."
She doesn't want to sleep in mine.
That's not good for the bunnies.
No.
"I'm sure, eventually, we'll get past this, but oh, my God!"
I was so not prepared for something else I had to get past.

I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.
All right.
Here's what you do.
When you feel like the train is leaving the station... .
"You mean, going in the tunnel?"
"No, no, I mean leaving the station."
But you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel.
"Okay, okay."

"And work our way down, right?"
You know what?
Just shut up and listen.

That was a really great dinner.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?
I've been ready since I was 1 4.
I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.
There were three parts to the will.
Mr. Malhotra donated a huge sum to many charities... one million Euro to his staff and everything else to Tisha.
But that will was burnt.
"Which means, according to the law..."
Mr. Malhotra died without a valid will.
"And that means... his only heir, inherits all his wealth."
Tisha gets everything.
Correct.
How much exactly is everything?
10 billion Euro.
"Sia, it's Tisha."
She tried to kill herself this morning.
She did what?
"Attempted suicide, sir."
She's at St. Marks' hospital right now.
What the bloody hell is going on?
"Sia, you go to the hospital."
I'll meet you at HQ later.
Let's go.
"I'm sorry, but I need to question Tisha."
"- Any problem, officer?"
- No.
It's just routine.
I'll wait.
Dad...
"That's fine, thank you."
"Tisha, what happened?"
I...
I...
I don't know.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
What?
How are you?
All has been arranged?
"All, the meeting will be in Quito."
Shall we?
lets.
"Your attention please,"
Equatorian Aviation announces the arrival of flight 422 from Guayaquil.
Something for the press?
"Please, tell us something about the convention."
"Well,we have selected the best models."

When did you return?
I just came in.
This is my first night off.

First night?
Do you accept that drink?
Then we shall meet tonight!
"Say, Adriana, come here, wait!"
"Oh, excuse me."
Alex!
"Inspector, what are you up to?"
"How are you, boy?"
Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it was such short notice.
Don't give it a second thought.
"Slaughtering vampires, arranging lunch with the queen, just name it."
Welcome aboard the Queen Victoria II.
The name's Captain MacRae.
One thing.
"While you're here on my boat, you'll abide by my rules, got it?"
And rule number one.
No women allowed on board.
They're bad luck.
Noah.
Did you remember to bring what I asked?
Yes.
It's stowed below.
Hold on!
Honey... (GROANS)
Amateur!
Does anyone else want a go?
"Well, if you're offering, sure."
Why not?
I'm game if you are.
(GRUNTS)
"Believe me, my dear, I'm just as disappointed as you are."
I've never seen Razor take to someone so quickly.
I suppose you can't be all bad.
"My name is Noah Van Helsing, from along line of vampire hunters."
"Now, what do you want with Blade?"
"The rule still stands, old man."
No woman on board my boat.
Young lady...
"You know, it's funny."
Looking at these old cases makes me wonder-- did we make a dimerence?
"I mean, çan we make a dimerence?"
Are we butte_ly wings?
Are we the wind?
It's like the horses.
"You try to figure out which one's the best fit for the track, runs harder, or prettier."
But when you admit that it's chaotic--
"Alvin, thank you."
We can talk after the meeting.
I can take it from here.
"Yeah, you'll, uh--"
"Give you, what, a half hour or so?"
Probably.
Right.
"Uh, I might be gone by then."
"But, uh, maybe not."
Let's just see.
Right.
Let's just see.
"Now, this essay about why I want to be Samantha's dad."
"Um, should I read it to you?"
[knock on door] I think I'm going to head out to the track.
- Mind telling Lulu for me?
- OK.
Thanks.
Can I read this to you?
"Uh, no, that's fine."
"There's this part in it about my sponsor, if you think that's OK."
Um...
Your sponsor?
"Yeah, how he said it's OK for me to be in a relationship-- have a relationship, you know?"
I work right across the street.
Yes.
We work right across the street from it.
Did you ever own a firearm?
I already told you no.
"No, I've never owned a firearm."
Why are you hassling me?
Just call County.
- Where'd you say you were?
"- You know, I told you where I was."
- What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a med
- I'm a med student.
I'm a med student.
What difference does that make?
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I told you what I am.
"Look, we brought you in because you match the ID."
Because I match the ID.
What?
"Young, black and handsome?"
That's
"- No, that's ridiculous."
I'll send them over immediately.
Jerry.
- Do we have photo IDs down here?
"- Yeah, bottom shelf."
Messenger off personnel face sheets for Pratt and Gallant to Area Seven Headquarters.
- Really?
Why?
- Just do it.
"Susan, Sean Simmons is being discharged to home hospice care."
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"My sweet, little, innocent..."
Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
"It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!"
"Oh, my God."
Ted... did you...
Big-time.
Nice!
High five!
Wait!
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family,"
I'm pretty sure you banged my mom-- mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney, let me ask you something."
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."
Who's your guitar-player-biker- who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa- but-said-screw-it- and-went-medium bad boy?
"Marshall, your hand!"
"I'll be looking for you in the destroyed fields, Bishop."
"Ok Kix, since you have so much energy tonight  why do not you take the first guard?"
Have fun with your book.
Mara!
"Come on, Bishop."
"Get up, Spartan."
There is something in the trees.
I'll send you back to hell!
Yellow-eyed devil!
Bishop...
"I've marked it, Commander."
I marked it clearly for you.
"Bishop, I'm here."
Did you miss the fucking shot?
10 meters away?
"You are the total ruin, man."
Did not Trajan take you out of the sewer?
I would be a damned commander!
And my team would still be alive!
"Now it's your turn, Bishop."
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot  bye, son of a bitch!"
"Listen, or you'll never pull the trigger again."
You do not have the eggs.
Reckless bitch!
"Mara, they were wrong."
There is life in the area of death.
I will not resign.
"I will not stop, Before we find our daughter."
You are with me my love
You're here with me now.
Ash!
"Come on, my friend."
Wonderful.
Great.
Um...
"So, a little bit about me."
"Uh, my service is called"
"""Goldilocks and the Three Dates."""
Katy...
I forgot to tell her not to tell you that.
"So, I've modeled my business after the charming story that it's inspired by."
"I send my clients on three dates, and like the beds that Goldilocks laid down in after eating the three bears' porridge, maybe one is ""too hard,"""
"and maybe one is ""too soft."""
But in the end we hope that maybe one is just right.
- Katy...
- Get after it.
You're losin' him.
Okay.
"Wayne, why don't you just tell me a little bit about yourself."
It's impolite to talk about yourself.
Keeps his truck clean.
Loves his dogs.
Enjoys a beer and a smoke.
Beer...
Beer and smoke.
That's...
"Wow, you know."
I get it.
Rustic.
"Trucks, got it."
We will make this work.
"I love it, okay."
"And then, um, Wayne, can you just tell me a little bit about your past relationship?"
You shouldn't air your dirty laundry.
And then what?
We depose those in power.
And once you've done that?
"Once you've killed Jeanine, who's in power then?"
"See, that's the part that she always conveniently leaves out."
Don't you tell me this isn't about you.
This is only about you.
I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.
Where?
They took shelter in Candor.
"As far as I know, they're still there."
Think about it.
"If we were to combine forces, Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable."
That's not gonna happen.
"Thank you for your hospitality, but we'll be leaving in the morning."
"Four, maybe this is..."
"Tobias, please, reconsider."
Don't you call me that.
My name's Four.
"You wanna tuck him in, or should I?"
(DOOR SLAMMING)
"Well, this..."
This meal looks lovely.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you about her.
(SIGHS)
No more secrets.
Okay?
(GASPS)
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
"I love you, okay?"
"You know that, don't you?"
I know that.
And I love that little girl in that room more than anything in this world.
I know that too.
Come on.
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(ENGINE STARTING)
BILLY:
"Hey, I would give you every dime we talked about, if I had the money."
The problem is I just don't have it.
Your partner here is starting to make me nervous.
"Why don't you sit your narrow ass down, ponytail?"
"Look, I know you guys are on the run."
And you need everything you can get.
"It's better than nothing, right?"
Let's lighten up.
"Look, this town is hot, and so are you, brother."
You fucked up.
You're on every goddamn channel.
You got no one else out there you can trust but me.
And I'm gonna let you walk with one.
What I'm telling you is take it or leave it... (GROANING)
Fucker.
Eight fucking dollars.
Liar!
Ugh!
(EMPTY CLICKING)
"Hey, wait a minute, he's got to have more money than that."
The movie director?
Yeah.
Shooting a film over on 1.
"""Gladiators."""
It's gonna make a billion in China.
"Oh, h-hold on."
You don't think that Austin had something to do with Phil's murder?
Was Austin filming last night?
He was supposed to.
"But for some reason, he shut down production early and took off."
About what time did he leave the lot?
I heard around 11:00.
Why?
Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery.
Where do we find Stage 1?
You work out?
[Bell ringing]
Hayley:
"Oh, look."
There's Austin.
"So, how do you want to play this?"
"Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris, he's bound to be on guard, so we can't let him know that we are looking at him as a suspect."
Kendall?
!
"Oh, she's good. [Chuckles]"
How did she get onto Austin so quick?
We're done for.
"She's already got him wrapped around her skinny, little finger."
Don't say I never did anything for you.
"There you are, darling."
Mm.
"So, who's our new friend?"
The retrovirus is acting quickly.
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other Wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring her back alive."
But I doubt she'll cooperate.
She's also stronger and faster than any Wraith I've ever seen.
Great!
All this time.
We thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us.
And I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Zaddik's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you!
"Dr Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you!
She took a blow to the head when Ellia hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard!
- That's an order!
Teyla.
"No.No, I meant every goddamn word of it."
You don't want to take back any of that?
Nope.
Nope.
Ok.
"Oh, and, uh, I slept with frenchie."
"I'm sorry, what?"
I slept with frenchie.
And I got the note to prove it.
You're carrying that around with you?
Wouldn't you?
"Jeez, it sounds like the end of the world down here."
"Jesus, he's pounding the leather off that thing."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
"Yeah, no more spic jokes."
"No, F.D.N.Y. Boxing team."
"We get him in the ring, we get some side action going, pick up a little extra cabbage."
"I mean, with me and you coaching him, we'll clean up."
Whatever happened to no more mr.
"Nice guy, you guys don't give me any respect, buh-buh-buh?"
That's the job.
This is a chance to make money.
"And for that, I will revert back to my happy-go-lucky whore self."
"Just, uh, think he'll go for it?"
Can't hurt to ask.
"Christ, let's let him finish up first."
- You gavin?
- Yep.
- On your break?
Because I am the man.
And that's the man's job.
Good news.
You may unbuckle your safety belt and move freely about the house.
Tyler is leaving.
What?
"Oh, thank God!"
Where's he going?
He and Clem are driving down to Tijuana.
What?
No!
No!
No!
- They are not!
"- Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine."
I gave them a whole bunch of cash and my dusty wallet condom.
And the mother bear's off to protect her cub.
"Tijuana, here we come."
(car engine starts)
- Oh!
- Oh!
Get out of the car.
You are not going to Tijuana.
You listen to me.
"Tijuana is a low-down dirty place where anything goes, which is why I love it."
But you cannot go because you are still a child.
So are you.
I think we can agree my childhood ended with that text.
"Okay, you know what?"
Listen.
I love your dad very deeply and I work hard to make sure that our marriage is strong and our love life is spicy.
And I don't feel like I should have to apologize for that.
Because of his son?
Greg had a fling with Hillie.
A fling?
It seemed like he loved her.
"He loves a lot of the girls, but he's not gonna get serious with someone like Hillie."
His father would kill him.
"Stephanie, would you keep this to yourself for the moment?"
Of course.
Thanks.
- The blue one.
- What?
That's the dress you should bury her in.
The blue one with the bow.
"[ Al ] It's right here, Sam."
It's in the closet.
How long have you been there?
"Uh, well, long enough to know that you think Greg's old man murdered Hilla."
Or maybe Greg.
I thought the kid was in love with her.
"According to her diary, she met someone new."
She broke it off with Greg on the Fourth ofJuly.
"Well, maybe they made up again."
I don't know.
"After the fourth, there are no new entries."
Except she did put this in there.
What is it?
A blood test result.
Her beta H.C.G. was positive.
Uh-huh.
"Speak English, will ya?"
"Two people died in that lake, Al."
Hilla was pregnant.
Maybe not.
"When I went back to search rebecca's place,"
I found this between the couch pillows.
Rebecca shot herself.
I think so.
"She lost a lot today Her fiancee,her life savings."
Her respect.
Could have been a failed suicide attempt.
Or a bid f sympathy.
Or an attemptto escape discovery that she had sex with finn the day she died.
"What's your gut tell you,boss?"
Take your shirt off.
Here we go.
I know it's kind of messy.
"Thshirt,mcgee,take it off now."
Take it down to abby.
Or would you rather wait for a search warrant?
Rebecca's dna.
I need to borrow one of your shirts.
You afraid all that white might burn out abby's corneas?
Do not make me walk around like this all day.
Come on.Help me out.
All right.
I can't resist a damsel in distress.
****************************
"Wow,it's just like chippende'S... without the bow ties or muscles."
Givee a second.
I just have to finish this e-mail to kofi annan.
Kofi can wait.
"What is it,jethro?"
The finn case.
Yes?
"If not, you'll have to bottle it into him, but do be careful."
You can choke a beast that way.
"Anyhow, nurse is on the job."
Yes.
I have the distinct impression that I'm under supervision.
Hmm?
Is she always like this?
Aye.
Funny how they are in their ways.
Judy here thinks she's responsible for all the stock on the farm.
"Well, sheepdog..."
"Keen instinct, I suppose."
"Oh, it's more than that."
She likes to take charge.
"Newborn calves, new kittens all get licking and nursing treatment from old Judy."
It'll be all to the good for this little chap.
It might give him a new interest in life.
"You're a rummer, all right, are you, lass?"
"Hello, James."
"- Hello, siegfried."
Savaged?
"Hammer blow, actually."
I trust you weren't using it on a patient at the time.
Sorry.
Can I do the honors?
That's okay.
- Come on.
"Thank you, James."
Pleasure.
James...
- Mm-hmm?
May I ask you a very Frank question?
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa.
But thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants.
I wanna do something for me.
We'll go as friends.
It won't be romantic.
Unless we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie so I can maybe picture you with a backpack.
- What's wrong with my tie?
- I need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
"So I'm the one who does the good deed, and that guy goes off with the girl?"
"Yeah, it's good to be that guy."
Do you go to NYU?
- I'm starting in the fall.
- I just transferred from BU.
Scott.
I'm Dan.
"Nice to meet you, Scott."
Maybe I'll see you around.
We got this for you.
"- I'll take that, thank you."
- What are you doing here?
What I should have done months ago.
"In five seconds, your phones are going to go off with the latest Gossip Girl blast."
[PHONE BEEPING]
She is nothing if not punctual.
"You didn't believe in me, and you still don't."
one shouldn't be crawling on all fours like a worm.
My star!
"Venom is a bit scrunched, but still alive!"
Reliable sources blame the Armenians!
A bit skittish they are now.
Venom was probably dealing with some big Turkeys!
That's more honorable!
"Mickey Micheyan sewed the shit, now he has to drink it."
"They're assholes, those kids."
"It's the moon, Mercury."
"Mickey, he's a marked man."
The stars are my thing.
You've got the jitters?
Wanna split?
There's a door behind.
I couldn't.
- Because of her?
- Yes.
What's her ass got that mine hasn't?
She's fragile.
That's all in your head.
And your head is here.
"You, the slut!"
"And you, the missionary, you wait long before you get it!"
Here they come!
My comrades...
"It's not the same syndicate, commissioner."
It's private here.
"It's not them, detective."
The landlord assured me they've been here since 9.
"Oh, I know these guys."
"You'd think if it had been anybody else's dog,"
It'd have barked or done something.
"My god, the dog's a monster who must weigh 125 pounds."
"Boy, I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to try to strangle anybody"
With that critter around.
No one saw or heard anything?
"Uh, nothing."
It was a total blank.
And the guy was by myself for only three minutes or less.
We timed the trip back to the tennis court.
"Doc, are you absolutely sure he was strangled?"
You want to come see for yourself?
"Oh, no, no."
There is another thing.
The victim apparently fought back.
How is that?
The knuckles on his right hand were bloody.
"OK, Doc."
This one I've got to see for myself.
Let's go.
[Cat meowing]
HESTER:
"Well, young man?"
RICHARD:
"Oh, yes."
Ms. Ramsey.
I was just looking for...
HESTER:
Snooping around?
"Uh, spying, I believe they call it."
"No, ma'am."
Nothing like that.
"Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts."
"Yeah, I don't speak virgin either."
The ring-- it makes you invisible.
You're not precious.
"Oh, good, you're awake."
"Look, Ted, there's something we have to talk about."
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?
Losing your key privileges?
"It's about the 20-year-old, Ted."
You have to bang her.
For me!
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?
I thought I disgusted you.
"Yeah, that was all an act."
"Look, look, look, I love Robin and she's the only girl I want to be with."
But my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
"Oh, yeah."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-what-what are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's got to be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No.
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night-stand material, Ted."
Oh.
Oh.
Here's your mom.
Here comes Mrs Ellis and that Mrs Turner.
Here's your chance.
Try and sell them something extra.
Let's see a bit of salesmanship.
She's as bad.
She'd pass you on the street.
They're no good once they've been to Majorca.
Brown.
All she thinks about is being brown.
"And nearly everywhere, if you believe what he says next door."
"Well, who's got a better view?"
"20 Navy Cut, please."
"Same for me, Granville."
And a box of matches?
(HE MOUTHS)
Too much sun dries the skin.
It's very destructive.
-
- I go blotchy.
-
- She'll wish she'd kept more clothes on.
"And here, where me bra finishes, it always starts to peel."
It's further down where it gets me.
I can stand hardly any exposure round me navel.
Me skin goes all crisp.
Top of me thighs is where I get it.
"It's the ultra--violet, according to that friend of our Edmund."
He should know.
He's as big a violet as I've ever seen!
-
- How is your Edmund?
-
The Troubled World.
Come on.
"Hey, Ponch."
"This weekend, are you gonna work dark?"
"No, Clark, I need the extra money."
"And now, the continuing story of the people we know."
Neighbors of yours and mine.
The people living in The Troubled World.
"Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
You mean to tell me you watch this stuff?
Cari just told Bob she's leaving for Brazil with Susan and Jamie.
I'll read it when the book comes out.
"Cari, don't tell me lies."
I don't wanna hear more lies.
Prove your love by staying with me.
But you know I love you.
I left George for you.
But not until I left Carla.
"Cari, sometimes I doubt your words, doubt our future."
Sometimes I'm sure we have nothing together.
"Bob, don't say that."
I can't bear it.
I won't hear it.
"Then prove your love, stay with me forever."
"I will, my dear, after we return."
"No, Cari, it's if you return."
You know me better than that.
You know I never lied to you.
"Haven't you, Cari?"
Haven't you really?
"Oh, Cari, I love you, I need you."
I want you here.
- Because two words.
Bloody Mary.
"That's just an urban legend though, right?"
- Of course it isn't.
- Shadows have power you let this thing speak and there is no telling what could happen.
Pete was playing ping-pong with one of those things.
Weren't you supposed to go pull files or something?
Thank you.
- And pull anything from Studio 54.
- Got it.
- 54.
- Heard you.
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Sure.
"- I haven't lost a penny, Mom."
- Myka with you?
"No, she's downstairs on the Whitmans."
I'm getting ready to search their room.
What's up?
How's your radar?
You mean am I having a vibe or something?
Give it a second.
Anything out of the ordinary?
- Anything at all.
- With Myka?
With anything.
"You know, now that you mention it, there is something."
- What?
- The buffet is overpriced.
- Other than that?
- Nope.
No vibe.
"- Well, it's about time."
Get me to that barricade.
"Thanks, Rocky."
This is Paige Grunion with Channel 17 Hard-core News.
I am coming to you live on the shoulder of the 5 Freeway.
And standing here with me are Will and Dale.
They are the drivers of the green monster van.
"- Tell me, gentlemen..."
- Monster truck.
Monster truck.
What possessed you to take such radical and desperate measures... to stop the BMWyourselves?
Oh!
Dude!
We are just doing our duty as Americans.
"Right, Will?"
That's right.
And that's not the first time we've had to take matters into our own hands.
"Mark my words, they'll be pulling over soon."
We really scared them.
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
- Did you see the look on their faces?
- Sure did.
- Whoa!
- And we'd be happy to tell anyone about it.
Anyone.
- Anytime!
- On-On Oprah.
Or Geraldo.
- Or SallyJesse.
Or any-any...
- Larry King.
"So, you get along with your mom ?"
"You know, you all tight and shit ?"
Yeah.
"We got along, tight and shit."
-How come you never talk about her ?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.
It's because you don't talk about her.
What do you want me to do ?
"I don't know, just say something about her."
"I mean, you don't say anything about her."
"Well, she's dead."
"God, what do you want me to do,"
-run through the streets screaming ?
-lf it helps.
"Well, it won't, so drop it."
Didn 't mean to press you about your mom.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
Get along with your dad ?
Y'all tight and shit ?
"Yeah, we're both tight and shit."
Our DNA matches.
- [ Sara ] What is this place ?
"- Well, in a few months, it'll be Club Med for the homeless, but right now... just an old furniture spot I used to work at last summer."
"Hop, step, back."
Okay ?
"Real simple, do it with me, right ?"
Try it one more time.
"Add on the next part after that, all right ?"
"Six, seven, eight."
"Step, back, break, spin, out, up, step."
Chilly on that ?
I can't afford to run down the boss's daughter.
Why don't I pack us a picnic lunch?
This is the kind of a day to play hooky.
I've already thought of that.
Good.
But I'm on my way to pick up Nancy.
"There was a washout last night, and the train's been stalled about five miles out of town."
Oh.
"Well, I guess a big railroad like that can get her here safely."
"Probably, but I..."
I did promise to pick her up.
"All right, I'll go with you."
"No, but I promised her, I..."
Unless I'm in the way.
"Oh, no."
"No, you're not in the way."
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
What happened in Los Angeles?
"I saw Colonel Blair, and he thinks I should get my papers in a week or so."
I know Karen Blair quite well.
Perhaps I can speed up your orders?
That'd be wonderful.
Don't mention it.
Beautiful tune.
"The words are pretty, too."
Do you know them?
I think so.
* Love is all that matters
* And we've got love
* We have walked off with a prize
* The stars that I used to see
* Are not where they used to be
We pay these guys for that?
Okay.
"Now follow- Who is that, Marguerite?"
Follow Marguerite backwards until we see where she got that tray.
Keep going.
Keep going.
'Cause we want to see where that top chip in the far left column came from.
Okay.
Give me the casino angle.
Boom!
Let's see what we got on her.
"And while you're at it, give me Bella Petto, south deck about 11:00."
"Go tight on the topless chick near the middle, in the black bikini bottom."
"She's good, but about 1:30... got two blondes putting oil on each other."
Got it bookmarked.
"Mitch, this is business."
"Just a skosh more professionalism, if you don't mind."
See.
See.
"While you're getting your perv on, this guy's lifting this other dude's wallet."
Freeze it.
Blow it up.
Let's see what we got on him too.
"I'm in a surveillance zone, baby."
What?
I bet 50.
"Holding three clubs, aren't you?"
Fold.
When does the Pussycat Dolls go on?
Fold.
I'll see your 50.
Raise you a hundred.
Where is he?
I'm talking to you.
Did you hide him in a hole?
Get out from my house.
Should I go out?
I'll throw you out.
I don't even bury you in the cemetery.
"Captain, come out of your hole"
"I told you get out, he is grieving too."
But you're not grieving.
I'm going to make you grieving;
it could be a relief for these poor people.
Whom are you threatening?
What are you coming to my house for'?
What they are coming to your house for?
Because of their loved ones!
Because of my dear brother!
Let me go Sardar Hossein!
Get off my back!
Leave him alone.
I told him:
"Captain, the sea is stormy!"
Don't go!
"But he didn't listen to anybody, left and killed seven breadwinners_"
You said:
"Captain, how does the sea seem?"
I said:
"I am Captain, not God."
"All of those 7 breadwinners were in need of food, just like me."
Leave him alone.
"Get out, get away!"
I said get out out!
- This is amazing.
- This is the greatest van in the world.
- A lot of good times went down there.
- A lot of mold.
- Yeah.
Lot of memories.
- Joseph Middleton.
"Here's a tidbit nobody knows, including you guys."
Joseph Middleton was my first casting director audition in Los Angeles.
- Really?
- Probably my last.
- Was it for this?
- Because it's offer only after that.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Good one.
- Good one.
- And Aaron Yoo was deathly ill here...
"Oh, my God, yeah."
He could hardly stand up.
"Yeah, poor Aaron showed up for this, just out of the hospital."
He flew into town that morning with stitches in his side.
- He had surgery on his abdomen.
- He looks healthy as a horse but it's just good acting.
- He's doing an amazing job.
"He's in agony right there, right?"
"Like, he can hardly stand."
"- Yeah, we set up, like, a cot for him."
- The deck chair.
"I use the ""we"" term liberally, because it wasn't any of us here."
- Right.
Yeah.
- I brought him Jell-O.
You have to go.
- Turn around!
You won't hurt him.
You can't.
"- Thank you for teaching me the meaning of pain, Nurse Oaks."
Glad I could return the favour.
- Isabel.
That was quite a performance.
- Hmm.
"- Do you know Hawthorne's ""The Gray Champion""?"
- Yes.
It's the story of a legendary warrior who comes to the aid of those oppressed by tyranny and injustice.
- Yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
This is your finest performance yet.
You... you are The Gray Champion.
- I am The Gray Champion?
"- Yes, this fine institution of..."
"of healing has been overrun with decadence and filth, and... like an avenging angel, you have purified it."
Don't you see?
- This is still part of my treatment.
"- Yes, exactly."
Exactly.
This is all part of my plan.
You and I have purified Rosewood.
Now... you're finally home.
Isabel.
"Isabel, you're healed."
- I'm healed?
- Yes.
Yes.
Ah.
"Dakers, it was."
I shouldn't think this place was quite her style -- a bit quiet for her.
"She's rather marvelous, isn't she?"
Mm.
She has married again?
LYALL:
"Number five, I think."
POIROT:
"Oh, mon Dieu."
LYALL:
"Looks a bit of a gorilla, doesn't he?"
"An animal attraction, would you think, Mr. Poirot?"
Well...
"Well, well, well, things are looking up."
Hello?
Hello.
"Been looking all over the place for you, little lady."
"Not out fishing today, Major?"
"Yes, earlier."
Didn't have much luck.
"Perhaps, Major Barnes, you were fishing too close to the shore."
I noticed you by the harbor.
I expect you're right.
Too much damn dynamiting going on.
Dynamiting?
The fishermen drop dynamite around here.
Damned lazy beggars.
"The fish, not being fools, keep out at sea."
[ Chuckles ]

- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master DeIacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
"Up, quick!"
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
"Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us."
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(men laugh)
only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.
- (baby screams) - (Liszt groans)
"George has gone off, it seems."
- shall we go and look for her?
- Can you walk?
Not presently.
"Could, and less for men ..."
Sorry.
It was a joke.
"- Of course you would, right?"
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Immediately.
This is the second glass?
Addons We are ready for the game.
Yes!
Addons Touch the screen to read terms and conditions.
I accept the terms and conditions.
Yes?
- Wait!
- Accept.
Do not read it all.
It is the law.
Conditions ...
Nonsense ...
No one read it.
"Addons you have not read the terms and conditions, want to continue?"
- Yes!
- Why not?
"Addons Please note, that to win the prize,"
Addons game should be played until the end.
"Disruptive Addons every player game, will bear the consequences."
What are the consequences?
Addons By knowing that at all you like confrontation online
"Addons to answer a simple question, profiles connected to each other."
- Dave?
- Yes.
Addons you started.
"I've met someone else, Thomas."
Someone else has visited me in hospital.
Who is it?
Does it matter?
"You can stay here, until you find somewhere else."
Who is it?
- Michael.
- Michael?
Whose dad has a factory?
That's neat.
His father has a factory   and then he goes to the asylum and exploits proletarian women.
Neat.
Don't say it's difficult.
We had a deal.
- You promised me that...
"- Honey, go back in."
There's a man in my room.
He has a black slug on his upper lip.
What's he doing here?
"Asger, your woman is shell-shocked."
"No, she's just upset..."
"Honey, Hossein will go with you next time."
I'm not going back to Christiania again.
I'm through with that.
- And I need to smoke less.
- First you show Hossein the routine.
Get dressed.
You are not well.
Are you in pain?
"Are you scared, maybe?"
Hossein has something that will ease the pain.
In Persia they say that opium is good for anything.
How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!
"Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that."
But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for the drive."
I had a great time.
It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
You're welcome.
"Hey, listen, listen!"
"If anybody asks you, we was out smashing' mailboxes, OK?"
Wha... what?
"Oh, man, the paint's still wet!"
"No, no, no, no!"
Get out of the store!
Hey!
Don't eat the radial!
"Here, take-a the snow tires."
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?
"- Whoa, boy!"
- Hey!
"Hey, guys!"
There's one goin' this way.
I got it.
"Come here, little tractor, come here."
"Yeah, that's a good tractor."
"No, no, no, no, come here."
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to go wandering off all alone.
What are you doin' with those old racing' tires?
"Come on, Doc, drive."
- You mean the Veterinarian man?
"- Yeah, that guy."
I don't get it.
He sleeps with his patients.
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff
Why is that funny?
Back home we've puppy dogs and kitty cats.
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it partner, there are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share."
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.
"- I got a good one for you, Violet."
- Lay it on me!
"Oh, damn!"
- What?
- I think I forgot it.
"Well that's the good thing, Daze."
I'll be here if it comes back to you
"Ten, Nine, Eight."
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinkin' that, since how you're 18 and all and you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meals, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
How can I drink?
"Want me to attend to you, eh?"
"No, I didn't mean that"
"Never mind, let me do it!"
How's that?
T aste good?
"Well, the taste is a bit strange"
That's the water I've just used to wash my feet
T ake some more!
No!
It's good for your body!
Gao Jian!
Big Brother!
Go!
Master wants to dispose you of your vital energy
What?
Dispose my vital energy?
We've today all the heroes from close and afar
I appreciate all your bravery and uprightness
It's our honor to attend to your call
We are more than willing to obey!
Thank you!
Thank you!
As long as we can get rid of the Three Devils
Please use us as you see fit!
"Y es, yes!"
May we have your good advice?
I won't dare!
Please take your seat
"Everybody knows that Y an Qingwang, Zhou Sanzhao"
Fan San are the parasites of our martial arts field
They are here to mess up!
- I have you.
- What?
!
What do you have?
You have what I have...
nothing!
"You, my boy, were in Mom and Dad's bed."
"Oh, ho-ho-ho."
"What was that, the sound of power suddenly shifting?"
Nothing happened.
"Yeah, and it didn't happen in Mom and Dad's bed."
I have you.
I have you by your ovaries.
"Hey, Cor, buddy, I'm not gonna kill you."
That was one of those wacky brother-to-brother murder threats.
Yeah.
"Listen, I'd like you to do something for me."
- Anything you need.
- Tell me how you do it.
What I was doing with Rebecca?
"No, no, what you were doing with Rebecca, I don't have the lung capacity for that."
"I just wanna know, how do you get a girl to say hi?"
"- Oh, you're wasting my time."
- I have you.
"Now, ordinarily I wouldn't reveal my foolproof method, but I know I can count on my favorite little brother to keep a secret."
I'm listening.
"- OK, you got eyes?"
- Yeah.
- Use 'em.
- How?
Look at her.
Look into her.
Wait a minute.
"Monica, how did you do this?"
"Well, when we were on our way home from rehab,"
"Dad had told me what had happened,"
So i just wanted to make up
"For all the bad things i've done,"
So i called papa joe's
And i made arrangements with my debit card to have your stuff back.
Regina: oh my god.
"Regina: wait wait, but..."
But how did...
How did you do it?
I don't understand.
"Well, mom, dad,"
I've been painting again since i've been in rehab.
And the director saw my stuff
And he thought i should have an art show
And i did and i sold all my artwork
And i made enough money to get mom's stuff back.
- What?
- Yeah.
"Oh, baby, i'm so proud of you."
"I am so proud of you, monica."
I've missed you so much.
I've missed all those things about you
That make you so special.
And i'm gonna be a good mother to you...
I promise you that...
If you'll just let me.
I told you i was gonna make you proud of me one day.
and you have.
- I hope i did.
"- Okay, 1...3...5..."
- Okay.
- Got it?
- Yeah I'm good.
"Oh, stop moving the pier."
Nice knowing you.
You've got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you're training?
- Can we do this later?
- There may not be a later for you.
"- Oh, oh Mr. Scott..."
- Was I talking to you?
Get in the car.
I'm driving you both home.
You're mother's going to love this.
You getting drunk on her watch...
There's some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about.
Why does interesting scare me?
"No, no."
"Listen, the company's been hired to do some flood control."
They want me to supervise.
How long is it going to be this time?
"Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months."
"So, what's the upside?"
"It's a lot of money, sweetie."
Way more than I make now.
We could be good to go for a while.
Maybe even afford that art school you talk about.
Is this something that you want?
I only want to do this if it's right for us.
"You should do it, dad."
What happened to you?
Nice to see you too.
You take a look at him while he's sleeping.
"You know how cute he is, with his tush all squished up in the air like that..."
Did you see him?
See who?
That-a-way!
We're in lockdown!
This door stays closed till you hear the all-clear call.
The perimeter's sealed.
He's not getting out this way.
My jewelry box!
"Jamie, Mommy told you..."
"All right, Jamie, you've had your fun."
Now it's time to give that back to Mommy and go to sleep.
Jamie...
I asked you to give it to me!
Would you look at this thing?
It's amazing.
We've got to come up with something really great to do with it.
What if we tied mattresses to ourselves and jumped off it?
Nah.
We could do that off the roof.
We could launch mannequins into the Prestons' Jacuzzi.
Uh-uh.
It's not good enough.
We could get a squirrel to dive off it into a cup of water.
Not good enough.
Not for her.
Not this old beauty.
"Well, how about if we got a vat of Jell-O..."
No!
It's not good enough!
I got it!
It was her evening gown Gina didn't want the messenger to see.
"And, in the normal course of events,"
Danny would have been suspected of the murder.
But things are never normal when little--
"Hey, look at the new dress."
Della picked it out.
"Oh, I did not."
Isn't she pretty?
Sure is.
How about a date?
"Merle, I think you owe these people a very, very large encomium."
"What for, Julian?"
Well-- thanks.
For saving your life.
"Oh, I was going to give them all a big kiss for that, silly."
"Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc."
"Burbank, CA"
"Now, you may not be the man I want, but don't make me kill you."
Turn around slow.
You John Tyree?
I am.
You and this country have already cost me a good horse.
Which one?
"You got your mind set on it, we'd better find out."
"One more thing, though."
I didn't kill the marshal.
Know that!
I didn't kill him.
I won't try to prove it.
Only the man in Texas.
"All right, where?"
"Is he a dentist, then?"
"Well, he's a dentish."
He's got a hammer.
Davus?
Yeah?
Smash out Grumio's bad tooth.
"Of course, boss."
Just give it a wipe.
Very good.
Very medical.
"All right, fella."
Just lean back for me there.
Do you not want to know which tooth it is first?
"Yeah, go on, then, mate."
It's that wonky one there.
I'll sort of aim in that ballpark.
Stay still for me.
"I-I might leave it, actually."
"Yeah, probably for the best."
"No, I don't like it!"
"Everyone's loving it under the new boss, man."
I've heard several people call you 'nice' and one woman even say 'fairly hot'.
"Well, if you listen to what people need, they will thank you for it."
"Thanks for letting me get my new partner, by the way, Big Paulus."
"Good, isn't he?"
"Well, he's tall, yeah."
Which is what it's all about now we've raised the jug and swapped the papyrus for apples.
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
"Oh, my Jove!"
Where did you get him from?
I just saw him guarding the grain store.
"I was, like, 'Big boy, you're coming with me!"
Would you like to speak to Mrs. Brown?
"Oh, no, no."
Don't disturb her.
I'll just leave these with you.
"What is it, Ellen?"
"It's Mr. Skinner, ma'am."
Harold!
What a surprise.
You're just in time for dinner.
"Oh, no, thanks."
"Well, I owe you a meal."
"Remember, you bought my lunch a few weeks ago, under pressure."
"Well, thanks."
I've eaten.
"I had an appointment with John,"
But he seems to have forgotten all...
"Well, come in."
I can't imagine John getting his appointments so mixed up.
"Darling, your act was absolutely priceless!"
Darling?
Mmm?
What are we going to do about John?
Do you have to worry about that now?
"Well, let's face it."
We're running out of ways to meet.
We can't pull this one again.
Ellen will be suspicious.
"And if I take you to lunch once more,"
John is going to start asking questions.
"Yes, I know."
Have you talked to him about bringing out the new line of modern stuff?
He won't discuss it.
"Nora, Johnny, you need anything..."
"Gary, Gary, get a plate."
You just dropped mustard on my half-dead ex-husband.
How you holding up?
"Surreal, man."
"All the patients we brought here, it's never personal."
This is...
I don't know.
"Hey, Mac said you can take the day off tomorrow."
Take as much time as you need.
"Oh, no."
I'm working.
"I sit here all day, I'll go crazy."
I came as soon as I could.
- What'd the doctor say?
- Could go either way.
"All right, so we got options."
"Okay, everybody, I'm selling squares 10 bucks a pop."
We're also doing pool bets...
Over/under's at three days.
- Mom...
- Over/under for what?
If he lives?
Either way pays.
I thought Johnny's parents were divorced.
They are.
There's no way an Irish woman would miss a good death.
Mom and Dad have a complicated relationship.
It's not complicated.
I hate him.
"But if my coma bets pay off, I'll love him."
"Frank, whatever you're gonna do, do it on Wednesday."
Do you want to see a miracle?
It is your law.
The puppet who made you jump in the air.
You do not jump and do not jump no more!
None!
None!
You can not understand.
I come!
I promise.
- Do you want systems too?
- No!
I have no shame.
It's not my fault.
The fault is mine.
Idiot.
Where have you hunted?
"Fear not, the police will be here in 3 minutes."
"First, let me speak."
"I, the massacrer of the evening, I was not there."
I don't know this gentlemen at all
"If you do this for me, there has never was a girl in the courtyard ..."
Silence!
What the hell on earth are you looking for?
I don't know.
We are not going to play a tambourine together.
She certainly has a motto princely.
"Wherever I walk, the rogue disappears."
"""The countess scal ..."" ie ""the barefoot princess,"" so to speak ..."
Mankiewicz ...
You have seen death the mother at the hands of Venini.
The 4 brothers Venini ...
The 4 fingers of Mickey ...
- No.
- I feel all right.
- That's good.
I'm glad.
I'm getting old.
- Are you getting old?
- I don't remember everything.
"But you know what you always said, Dad?"
- What?
- You said that when a person reaches 80... they have the right to forget whatever they want.
- Is that right?
- That's what you said.
"So I tell everybody, if they forget something..."
"I said my father says, ""When you're 80, you can forget - you have the privilege to forget whatever you want."""
- How do you like that?
- [Chuckles]
I made that as a real... appointment... and maybe it's really true.
- I've got something for you.
"- No, no, no."
- I've got something for you.
- What do you got?
What have you been asking for for the last two weeks?
- I don't know.
What did I ask for?
- Take a look.
Come on.
"Oh, for heaven's sake."
Thank you.
My husband looks good.
[Chuckles]
What can I say?
I used to be thin once upon a time... believe it or not.
"I mean, you should be angry, too."
Look what they did to you and what's-his-name--Charlie.
Look at that!
"I mean, how can you sit here and let that kind of thing go unanswered?"
"Come on, we don't need to talk about that."
"What, we're not supposed to tell Allie she's a test-tube baby?"
You sorry bastard.
Hey...
Charlie's hurt.
Yeah.
Is he going to be all right?
"I don't know, honey."
If Ray will let us get him to the hospital...
No one's going anywhere until I get what I want.
( knock on door )
GUARD:
Campus security.
Dr Penzler?
We had a report of a gunshot.
Hands up.
Get your hands up.
"Yeah, you keep 'em up there."
Okay.
Here's the situation.
"I'm holding these people hostage, all right?"
I've already shot one of them.
I'm angry and unpredictable.
Look at me!
"What we're doing here, we're waiting for the FBI."
There's two more security officers coming from other parts of the campus.
"Yeah, so?"
What do you want me to do about them?
- Sir.
"These papers are in order, sir."
Seems Sharpe distinguished himself.
Not here he hasn't
Brawling with common soldiers!
- it won't do Sharpe
"- No, sir."
"Harper, you struck an officer."
- it's a shooting matter
"- I woke him up, sir."
He thought I was an intruder.
"All my fault, sir."
If you say so.
But we have standards here Sharpe
An officer must behave like a gentleman.
Even if he is not a gentleman.
"- Yes, sir."
- We march in an nor
Form a rearguard.
Full kit in five minutes!
"Sweet is the silent mouth, Cooper."
"Didn't say a word, did I?"
"Strange officer, that."
Sharpe.
He's not a proper officer.
"Proper bastard, though."
- Name?
- Cooper.
Sir.
"Where are you from, Cooper?"
"- Shoreditch, sir."
- Previous employment?
"Since I have a private number, Hallie won't pick up."
Neither will any of our friends in case it's you know someone annoying.
They will... call you back.
"But since we all have private numbers, it's nearly impossible for us to communicate by phone."
"Fortunately, I pick up my phone."
"Otherwise, this game of trading voicemails would never end."
Hello.
"Hey, it's Hallie."
Hey.
Jerk off!
This guy is on his cell phone and can't drive.
Sorry.
Hey... are you ok?
Yeah.
I'm ok.
How are you?
"Hey, um, you want to meet up for dinner tonight and maybe just... clear the air about everything?"
Yeah.
I think we should.
How does 8pm at Cascade sound?
All right.
Sounds good.
Great.
I'll meet you there.
Oh...
You didn't think I'd forget... did you?
"Wow, they're beautiful."
Thank you.
So what are the big plans for tonight?
"Well, that was um, Hallie."
"She wants to uh, get together and so we can talk about everything."
I think she forgot it was my birthday though.
"Say, you in the blue serge suit!"
You look like a man with sporting blood flowing in your veins!
Would you like to see the forbidden quarter of Algiers?
"Gather around closer, please!"
I've a little item to show you!
This is called the ever-writing ballpoint pen!
Sells for $ 15 in the leading stores!
"Back up a little, please, you bother me!"
You can write as easy with your left hand as your right!
It doesn't make a difference!
You geeked it!
And I had a buck on you!
You're yellow!
You should've taken that with you!
- Maybe you could've hit him with it!
- Leave him alone!
"He don't mean nothing, Tony!"
I don't mind!
A fight's only a fight!
- I still got that million-to-one shot!
"- Okay, boys!"
Main event on!
"- Get ready, main event!"
- Luth!
Intermission's about over!
"Hey, Mickey!"
Give Stoker a hand with his bandages!
Main event in the ring!
I wish I had the champ in there tonight!
"I know I'm right, Gus!"
"Tell you, I can feel it!"
"- Okay, boy!"
Finished measuring?
Anything else?
Choose the material.
I'll take the one in your hand.
Cloth-cutting.
"Murderous tailor, I've guessed your real game."
I've done nothing to offend you.
Why do you want me dead?
Sifu Tam is angry with you.
Taking revenge is a poor way to solve the problem.
Please pass on this message to Sifu Tam.
I want to be friends with him.
- Foon.
"- Yes, Sifu?"
- Get him a new pair of scissors.
- Yes.
Still dirty.
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
"More money, more money..."
Ruined another one.
Help!
"Get a grip, you coward!"
"Sister, it's you!"
I thought it was that painted face!
Nothing to worry about.
You were born without courage.
Why are you afraid of a painted face?
- I nearly died from the shock.
- Go and dry the clothes!
Give me a minute to recover.
"I told you before, you only use two fingers to squeeze."
Why do I have to squeeze with two fingers?
"Our message is about peace, love and universal harmony."
Loser!
And about finding balance and cosmic energy through Zenovation.
- Open up your minds to a new reality.
- Losers!
- Screw harmony and peace.
- And that chi stuff.
This is just too easy.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
"And the pictures of the kids, your family, nice people."
"Hey, mind if I wear this?"
You got any tickets to the policemen ball?
"Well, guys, you ready?"
Okay.
- We're back.
- We're back.
What happened yesterday was our fault.
- Un-American.
- Un-Pennsylvanian.
- Un-Charlestownonian.
- Un-Hansonian.
This town needs a good punch in the nose.
- A kick in the teeth.
- A jab in the spleen.
Bernie's hitting us below the belt.
"Fellas, we're here to show you how to help fight back."
- And we have reinforcements.
"- Guys, come on in."
These are our boys.
Dit.
"Guys, I know."
We work in a firehouse.
I know everything you guys know.
"All right, and believe me, I say this as a dad."
"You know, no dad could be prouder to find out that his daughter is terrible in bed."
- Right.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
"- You know what, to colleen."
"May she continue to make tommy's life miserable for many, many, many more years to come."
"Here, here."
"Mike, do me a favor.Call shawn in the morning, will you, find out what's going on."
Ok.
"Holy shit, guys."
Another 8 grandioso.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
Awesome.
Nice.
"You know, we gotta give some of this to charity, don't you think?"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"That's a good idea, right?"
"Hey, charity."
Yeah.
"Yeah, let's not do that."
That sucks.
What's wrong with you?
"You know, guys, my mother made all this possible."
"You know, maybe we should give it to like a cancer charity or something."
"Yeah.Yeah, that is a really good idea, actually."
"Well, wait a second, shitbird."
I thought you said we we weren't doing it.
Really?
- You would?
- You are so observing...
I bet you'd make a great photographer.
Home sweet home.
"I really had a great time, Jocelyn."
"Anytime Resin is indisposed, I'll be your walking partner."
"Tomorrow will be a rough day, I've been assigned to..."
Skirt's security task force to find the Yuri.
- Sounds very gums.
- It really bothers me.
All this fashion espionage.
Someone just takes our hard work... and hand it over to Vogue.
It really pisses me off!
I'm going to make it my mission to aprehend Yuri.
"If anyone can do that, you can."
A spy's work is never done.
"Right, I really enjoyed that walk."
"Good night, Jocelyn."
Sweet dreams.
"- I'm sorry, Jocelyn."
- No big deal.
"Quick, quick, quick!"
I need my comb!
"Fabulous, fabulous!"
"That, wonderful."
This is the best session!
"Come on, ladies!"
Embrace the water!
Embrace it!
Make love to it!
"Let the water wash away your sins, ladies!"
Me too.
"I think we're ready for business, Dennis."
- Sir.
- You must be very proud of your mom.
"Yeah, being the vice president is better than being the president."
"Oh, I'm sure you're right."
'Cause nobody wants to shoot the vice president.
"So, you must be feeling pretty excited about now."
Please sit.
- Hmm?
"- Well, I think I'm a little nervous."
"Well, good!"
Good.
Night before a confirmation hearing.
"Anything else, I would've withdrawn your name."
"- What about this Webster, sir?"
"- Ah, one second."
Anybody here hungry?
"- No, thanks."
"- No, sir, I'm not."
Thanks.
"Otto, could you whip up some Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?"
"No problem, sir."
"Ah, the kid."
Met him.
"You know this young congressman, Webster?"
"No, sir, I don't."
No matter.
He reminds me of me when I was his age.
That's bad.
"K, you need to put out word that no matter what this kid does... nobody's to give him a hard time."
"He's misguided, but he's got something."
She made me realize
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I know that now.
I'm three months pregnant and you're already out trying to fuck other women!
What's gonna happen 10 years from now?
How could I ever trust anything you say again?
Jenna.
"Fuck you, man."
It's over.
- Jenna.
- Get out right now.
I'll tell you when you can come back and get your shit.
Maybe Kimmy can help you pack.
"- Jenna, we're having a baby."
- No.
"No, I am the one having this baby."
"I'm the pregnant one, not you."
And she's better off with no father than a lying asshole like you!
You're overreacting.
It was a couple kisses.
"After three years, Jenna, things happen."
"- Not to me, they don't!"
Get out!
- And go where?
Get out of here!
Go back to fucking Kim!
"What, are you gonna fucking stab me, Jenna?"
- Get out!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out!
"Well, your instincts are admirable, but you don't have to put aside your feelings for the sake of any of us."
I'm not saying I want to be the woman's best friend.
I'm just saying...
"I have been so busy blaming her,"
I don't think I've ever really seen her for who she is.
OK.
"So, what are you proposing?"
The truth of the matter is Holly is a part of our family now.
"I think I should embrace that, if only to set an example."
"I mean, we all have to put the past behind us where it belongs and move on."
- You think I'm crazy?
"- No, Nora."
I don't think you're crazy.
Good.
"Because if there's one person I count on to be my reality check, it's you."
Saul?
What?
It's the past.
It's not behind us.
You have to tell me what.
Tell me.
William and Holly had a daughter.
- What?
- Her name is Rebecca.
She's 20 years old.
She's here in L.A.
"I'm so sorry, Nora."
I'm so sorry.
- No one wanted to upset you.
- No one?
Who else knows?
Who else knows?
Who did you say?
"The new arc welder, I don't know his last name."
- What new arc welder?
"- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift."
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant.
This guy took his place.
"What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?"
"Reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual, busting his ass."
"There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik."
What is this?
"Mr. Reznik, have you recently suffered any head injuries?"
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?
No.
- Trevor.
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Why do you go out of your way to come here every night?
Is it out of the way?
An airport?
For coffee and pie?
Suppose I went to Danni's...
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.
Could I do that just in any diner?
Is someone chasing you?
Not yet.
But they will when they find out who I am.
Oh really!
Who are you?
Can you keep a secret?
To the grave.
I'm Elvis Presley.
This notebook is the work of a genius.
He was just 17.
And a prodigy.
- How do you know him?
"- I'm sorry, Duval."
I thought this was some drug deal gone south.
I thought he'd give us someone to go after.
Go after for what?
The kid who wrote this...
he's dead.
He O.D.'d.
It's not uncommon.
Exceptional intellects don't fit in.
"Without the proper care, many self-medicate."
"Based on data from our users, 83% of those with an IQ higher than 150 use some form of medication."
"Yeah, but heroin."
Searching for prodigies O.D.ing on heroin.
Should I show you the others in this geographical area?
Others?
What others?
Margo Mallory.
Cellist.
Julian Edlun.
Linguist.
Fluent in eight languages.
Victor Ruiz.
Passed the bar and practiced law at age 16.
Duval:
This has been happening all along.
All O.D.'d like Kevin Whitfield.
All within 18 months.
Maybe there is someone to go after.
Give me 10 hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
HOOK:
"Ladies, in this world we are slaves to time, and ours is running out."
"In other words, tick-tock."
(ZIPS SLEEVE)
I was hoping it would be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
That's a good girl.
"This will allow you to climb, but there are other dangers."
Thankfully you've got me to protect you.
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
- (BIRD CALLING) - (WIND WHISTLING)
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
HOOK:
"No, you're afraid."
Afraid to talk.
"To reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things would be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
Mothers do love Izzie.
My mother would've loved you.
"Uh, I stashed all the tequila, took the condoms out of the cookie jar."
"I also replaced all your trashy magazines with back issues of the ""Annals of Surgery"", okay?"
Does it smell musty in here?
My mom's house smells like peppermint.
- It's so homey.
- My house isn't homey?
- I feel at home.
- I was raised in a hellhole.
- This place is a palace.
"- Why isn't my house homey, George?"
I can't explain it.
It's just a feeling.
"Well, Izzie can't fix a feeling."
"She is freaking out, people."
Just tell her something I can fix.
Rebecca peed on that couch cushion.
I've been sleeping there for weeks.
"Thanks, Alex."
You're... a good friend.
You're welcome.
Keep drinking.
- Mark.
"- Hey, there you are."
- Want to get a drink?
It's four in the morning.
"- I probably, uh, shoulda called first."
"Hey, I hear your mom's coming into town."
Good times.
You'll be fine.
Just keep the talking to a minimum.
All right?
Get in the car.
What?
We're taking a little ride.
Senator.
"All right, gentlemen."
"Ah, thank you."
How are you?
Thank you for coming.
How are you?
Hi.
"We should, uh, talk to the staff about Rebecca not being able to come."
We should all be on the same page.
"- I'll get right on it, senator."
"- Hey, good to see you, senator."
"- Joe, I'm glad you could make it."
- Hey.
Yeah.
"We got those CEOs to blink, but trust me, in November, we're going to have 'em on the run."
- Senator.
"- Hey, Cathy."
- Hello.
"- Don't you worry, I promise I am going to push that through, even if I have to haul that committee into chambers myself."
Appreciate it.
Quite a turnout here.
"Thanks for hosting this, dad."
"Hey, my son, least I could do."
"You know, I would still be picking out his ties"
If he would just let me.
"Somebody needs to dress this boy, you know what I mean?"
- What's going on?
- What?
I was giving the matter my serious consideration.
"Then when I saw him sulking, Jesus!"
"He was very good-looking, though."
Very handsome.
"Not really, Mary."
Not when you got up close to him.
Beauty's only skin deep.
"It wasn't even that deep, Mary."
He'd loads of little spots on his chin.
"Tiny, little ones, now."
Millions of them!
Only noticed 'em when you were right up against them... then you want to throw up.
He was thick as well.
"Come here, Jackie."
Was he passionate?
No!
But he thought he was.
You know what I mean?
"He was just a big, thick monkey."
"Looking for somewhere to stick his banana, what?"
Ha!
Yvonne Burgess!
He stuck his tongue in me ear once... and I'm not joking yous.
He was trying to get it out the other one.
Don't know what he thought I had in there.
"His sense of direction wasn't the best, either."
- Know what I mean?
- Jackie O'Keefe!
"You're bleedin' disgusting, you are!"
"Any news, Sharon?"
No.
Not really.
"We'd like to eat, sometime this year!"
"Jude, how did the batting cages go?"
"Do we need to call the Padres, see if they need another big hit in their lineup?"
- Huh?
- I don't think so.
"Oh, come on!"
Planning my retirement.
- Bread me.
- Oh!
Guys!
"So we, uh, make an appointment yet for the hand surgeon?"
"- Uh, no."
- Why not?
"Well, I talked it all over with your father."
Is this about money or something?
Isn't that what the settlement from Vico is for?
- Fix my freaking hand?
"- No, Brandon, it's not about money."
"We just, um... we just feel that it's a little too risky, Brandon."
"And, uh... your father and I are saying no."
I don't get this.
"It's my hand, my money, my life."
And I wanna play piano again.
"Like, really play."
Why is this so hard to understand?
I want the surgery.
"Brandon, we are eating dinner."
Can we please discuss this later?
"Yeah, well, I'm not hungry."
- So you talked to Mike?
- This afternoon.
And you just... decided?
Lieutenant?
"Aw, holy shit."
Yeah.
I'll be right there.
There's been another murder.
Milwaukee.
Why don't you just come in here and sit?
How long was this one dead before they found her?
What's she doing here?
Not even an hour.
The husband came home with the kids.
"Would you come with me, please?"
- What?
- Come on.
What's going on with this girl?
I happen to like her.
Is it any of your business?
"Yeah, it's my business because it's my ass."
Mitchell's talking about... putting another team on the case.
Mitchell's what?
Who the hell's he going to put on this case... that's not already working on it?
"I mean, we followed every goddamn lead."
We got enough evidence to put the guy away for life.
We've got one fucking problem... we have no idea who did it.
And she is the only one that saw that killer.
That's why I keep coming back to her.
"I'm telling you, she's the key."
To the case or to you?
Ridge...
I bought her flowers.
I bought her fucking flowers.
Me.
That chip allows you to see the future.
"Yeah, I can see the attraction."
"You have to tell me what's going on, Artie."
"Well, he may have figured it out already."
Seriously?
"I mean, it's Pete we're talking about."
I can't get ahold of him.
His cell keeps going to voice mail.
- Alice has obviously the Farnsworth.
- Dude...
He's in a big hotel.
There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno.
He said that this chip saved his life.
- And you stole it?
- It's what we do.
"Pete Lattimer, white courtesy telephone."
"Jillian, take the money and run, don't walk."
Find a beach.
Never look back.
I am gonna go get your husband.
"Wait, hold on."
You're not arresting us?
You're letting us go?
"What happens in Vegas, okay?"
Just get outta here.
It looks like you were telling the truth.
Don't hurt Jillian.
Do you know what?
Hurting is half the fun.
You wanna know what's more fun?
The other half.
Who are you?
"-lt's a risky exercise, man."
Take care!
- Do not be afraid.
Stepa will survive my attack.
"I'm not anxious about him, I worry about you."
You may get bruised.
Nowwhat?
"Well, did you take this prisoner?"
-You really know some tricks!
- ls yourwar over?
-Over.
"- l'll teach you how to use all these tricks against me, an ex-con asshole!"
It is not a real trick.
A pal taught me this move in prison.
-Let me go!
Let me go!
- Let him go!
"Ifyou do it again, you're dead."
Platoon!
Stand up!
Attention!
At ease!
-Are you teaching the young ones again?
"-Yes, we are, comrade corporal."
"Well, listen to the battle order."
Tomorrow at 02:40 Odintsov's battalion will perform a battle recon mission at our hill.
Ourtask is to get as close as possible and disclose all alien firing positions.
-ls it clear?
"-Yes, completely."
Malakhov!
You are assigned to Sergeant Pozdneeva.
-What for?
I am saying that I can help you.
Have you found a clue?
Is that...?
It can't be.
This was left at the scene of the fire.
I believe that this scrap of cloth is from the cloak of Professor Moriarty.
Moriarty?
An odd little man who fancies himself a criminal genius.
"So, he stole the engine..."
Dear...!
"Please help them, Mr. Holmes."
Ouch!
Ouch!
What the devil is this?
An engine?
!
Who would dare drop such a filthy old thing out of the sky?
!
That's Moriarty's aircraft Pteranodon!
Did he intentionally drop it on me?
After him!
Give chase!
Go!
What a wonderful engine!
"With this, there's no doubt that I will win the world championship."
I knew that we couldn't win with the engine that the Professor built.
Did you say something?
Uh...well.
Nothing.
Out to sea?
Where are they heading?
"""The judging committee has approved the entry of a mysterious aviator..."""
Alright.
What do you got to drink around here?
You don't have much time.
Soon they will come to harm you.
And I will not be able to stop them.
Unless you are able to give me something to placate them.
Some... piece of information...
Which I can use to protect you from them.
I already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperon.
"Steadily, steadily."
"Down, down, carefully..."
You're all right Indy?
"Gently boys, gently, gently!"
I told you it would be all right!
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
Oups!
What is this stuff René?
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
"Well, I have to be going now René."
I like you René.
Very much.
Perhaps we meet someday under better circumstances.
We meet again freulin.
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now...
"But let me tell you something, I know you love this car."
You love this car so much that you come in two days a week.
Two days a week to just look at it and then you walk out.
"Gerald, life's too short, man."
Life is too short.
Okay?
Things change in an instant.
Take it from me.
Okay.
So be a man.
Take control of your life.
Be a man.
Buy this car.
Show all these people that they're wrong.
That you can make a decision.
I'm gonna really think about it.
No.
"No more thinking, Gerald."
No more thinking.
No more dithering.
"No more wasting everybody's time, especially your own."
'Cause that's what you're doing.
You're wasting your time every time you come in here.
Buy this car because you love it and because you want this car and you want to drive off this lot in this car today.
Buy it.
Okay.
Okay.
Mr. Garrity!
"Yes, sir."
"All right, Gerald over here would like to go ahead and start paperwork on purchasing this hybrid here."
"Yes, I would."
"Congratulations, Gerald."
- That was a cheap shot.
- What are you...
"You know, excuses are like assholes."
"Everybody's got one, and they all stink."
"- Oh, yeah?"
You wanna go at it right now?
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
You wanna settle this now?
Let's do it right here.
Let's settle this son of a bitch right here.
"Hey, hey."
Take it easy here.
Jesus.
"Show a little class, will ya?"
Geez.
"Look, I'm an old man."
I don't fight no more.
I let my daughter do my fighting for me.
"And maybe in a couple years, when this little graham cracker... might have the stuff to compete, maybe we'll see."
Wait.
"You know what, asshole?"
Why don't you go to hell?
"- Dee, stay out of this."
- No.
This guy has been all over us since we walked in.
"I tell you what, jerk."
Why don't you take you big mouth... and go someplace else with it?
"Listen, little buttercup, I'm just bustin' your old man's balls."
- You don't have to get your panties in an uproar.
"- Oh, my God."
Are you standing there?
"Come on, move."
Adam!
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I was trying to save the Bank.
I was trying to fix it but Dad made so much mess.
I fucking hated him.
That's why I hated you.
"Ok, gents, let's go."
You coming?
Of course I'm coming.
Police!
Good evening!
We are the police.
Please stay calm and remain where you are.
Move away from the art
Where is the lady of the house?
"Stand aside, police!"
We have a warrant for the art.
"We are the police, stay where you are."
Thank you for your cooperation.
What's going on?
"Madame Clios... by order of Interpol, all the art is seized and you are to stay exactly where you are."
Fucking awful night.
"What doesn't kill you, et cetera..."
Monsieur!
What now?
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees

Let me release him!
Stop!

"This bastard, I'll teach him a good lesson"
Dad!
You don't need to beg me on his behalf!
I've invited some leaders here... to discuss how to get rid of the Three Devils
I'll also take this chance to clear up our school!
Clear up our school?

It'll surely soothe you!
Come down!
I'm high up here.
If you don't let me down
Lunch.
"- So what do you got today, Mel?"
"Liverwurst and Swiss, I think."
"Oh, yeah."
There's liverwurst and Swiss.
Yeah.
"All three of 'em, liverwurst and Swiss."
You wanna swap?
I got a bacon and avocado... and a tuna fish and tomato on a kaiser roll
I'll give you the liverwurst and Swiss for the tuna fish and tomato... and I'll throw in a piece of chocolate cake.
"No, you keep the chocolate cake."
"Besides, I got a piece of, lemon meringue pie anyway."
"Well, I gotta get rid of one of these sandwiches."
Toss it down the shaft.
"Oh, we have a... wastepaper basket here."
I'll throw it out.
Ah.
"Thanks a lot, fella."
That's nice of you.
Thank you.
"- Hi, honey."
"- Hi, sweetheart."
Happy birthday.
"Well, how was your day?"
"Fine, fine."
No... surprises.
I just hope it stays that way.
"Well, honey, you're really gonna be surprised, because there's no surprise party."
"- Just five friends and a nice, quiet dinner."
- Good.
Come on.
Take off your coat.
My name's Danny Ferman.
I'm one of the attorneys representing Malcolm Miller.
"Look, if this is about that juror, the cops already turned this place inside out."
"Okay, so I assume they checked the camera footage already."
Fakes.
Just there to scare anyone looking to cause trouble.
Like you.
Were you working the night of the assault?
You were here?
Yes.
And I've already been interviewed.
"Okay, what did you tell the cops?"
- That I don't remember seeing him.
"Bar was a little crazier than usual, but..."
My girlfriend was having a little birthday thing.
Girlfriend?
So you're...
Gay guys are the best tippers.
"Yeah, I mean, not that..."
"You know, it doesn't matter."
Anyway.
Anyway.
"Birthday, okay."
"Cake, presents, the whole thing?"
Yeah.
She needs a lot of attention.
"Did you happen to take any photo, videos or..."
Look at this.
Okay.
Recognize him?
No.
Could you send me this file?
Yeah.
- Change your mind?
- Enough of this.
"You want to deal, you deal with me."
You leave Lucy out of it.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
You see?
I can be reasonable.
"Of course, I still have a job to do, and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or-"
I know.
Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"If she knows all this about you, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.There's a reason why the feds want you to testify.
I say we hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, if we go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
- I am listening.
"We are after talented musicians at schools, especially after Candan..."
- Ercetin's popularity.
- Yes.
And we have come across your thing your name.
"You are very kind, Mr. Ceyhan."
"Of course, we can meet."
Is it necessary to meet today?
"Well, right away if possible."
The studio is free at the moment.
We could do some recording...
My partners are here too.
"So, we could sign a contract too."
"Well, if you say today is necessary."
I am listening to you.
Then ...
let me give you the address.
"Okay, I am writing it down."
"It's IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek, Bemol Records, Cevat Ceyhan."
Which bazaar did you say?
"Ma'am, it's the IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek."
"There aren't any mistakes with the address, right?"
Of course not.
What kind of a mistake can there be?
"Alright, sir."
"So, that's your place."
Come on.
We are waiting for you.
My accent always works within the music sector.
"Oh God, my voice is gone."
God damn it.
Hello?
The cosmetics in the bathroom cupboard and the electric toothbrush.
The first time those items appeared round here was last January.
"We got together at a Christmas do, I semi-moved in the next month."
"So, where do you sleep every Tuesday night and alternate weekend?"
I kept my place on.
Expensive.
I want to keep my independence.
Really?
Is that true?
"I'm sorry, I really do need to get back."
Will you tell him that we met?
Will you?
Are you kidding?
It'd freak him out.
"Best both keep quiet, then."
Pretend like this never happened.
I like that plan.
"Oh, do me one favour?"
Anything.
Change those sheets.
What do you think about having them over?
Who?
The neighbours.
We could make it a thing.
"Drinks, nibbles."
Do we have to?
I think we should get to know them better.
Find out what they're really like.
"Morning, Mr Sellers."
"Good morning, Michael."
We're having everyone over ours Friday evening.
A few glasses of wine.
"Yes, dear?"
It's Mrs. Richards.
A fatal accident?
She's had some money stolen.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty,"
I tell Polly.
"That's all right, but don't tell anyone else, not even me!"
You know nothing!
- Basil?
"- Yes, dear?"
You've got to help me handle this.
She's in a frightful state.
I can't get a word in edgewise.
She's had £85 taken from her room.
"I said we'll search everyone, but she insists we send for the police."
What do we do with someone like that?
She just keeps on!
"Mrs. Richards, how very nice to see you!"
Are you enjoying your stay?
There's no need to shout.
I have my hearing aid on.
"Mrs. Richards, I've explained to my husband..."
I've just been up to my room.
"£85 has been taken from my bag, which I had hidden under the mattress."
"Oh, yes?"
It's a disgrace!
I haven't been here a day.
- What sort of staff do you employ?
- Mrs. Richards...
"If you knew anything at all about running a hotel, this sort of thing wouldn't happen!"
"Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"
What?
"Well, why..."
- Why don't we think about it?
"- Okay, I will."
I just did.
I want to do it!
"I'm so sorry, but I could really use the money,"
- and I think it could be fun.
- There you go.
A star is born!
D-d-don't worry.
It's not gonna change a thing.
"My job with you always comes first, I promise."
"Come on, we've got a million things to do."
We gotta talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
I hope your afternoon is free...
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
I like the other one better.
The one on the trolley cars.
What do you think?
I don't know.
"My god, it's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that."
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
I can't believe it either.
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember, your predecessor, Marissa Kessler."
Murder victim.
Multiple stab wounds.
Does that ring a bell?
"Sorry, sorry."
"All right, Randy and the Captain are probably already there."
You must be Ms.Cole?
Missus.
Ah!
Splendid.
Please take a seat.
Husband in forces?
He volunteers as an air-raid warden.
But he wasn't fit for conscription.
He fought in the war in Spain.
Splendid!
That's splendid.
"Now, about the job."
We need to cultivate a more convincing female angle in our output.
"Mr.Buckley here, has been appointed to the department as a Special Advisor."
"Not ""Special"" enough to get paid, obviously."
"He seems to think, you are what we need."
"I said, ""Might be""."
She can't be worse than the chaps you got.
Did you write...this?
Hm..hmm.
This rapta-rama chips?
I...
I was the secretary at the copy-writing department.
But...all the copywriters got called up.
"""So-be-fee."
"It ain't beef, but it ain't bad!"" Yes, sometimes, you have to make do of what you got."
Ah!
Splendid.
Ministry wages start at £3 and £10.
And obviously we can't pay you as much as the chaps.... so shall we say £2 a week?
Thank you.
You a cinema goer?
It's their atlas.
Do sit down.
"We are looking for a new home, and can only retain Thomas and Betsy."
We're sorry to have to leave you all.
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.
My only real concern is how long it will take them to move out.
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.
He has his own barouche.
- You have two brothers?
- Yes.
Edward is the elder.
He's travelling up from Plymouth and will break his journey here.
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John...
This is your home now.
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?
One can presume she wants to count it.
What are you doing?
Gifts for the servants.
Where is Margaret?
She's taken to hiding.
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.
I have.
I've said yes and no.
"Good morning, Fanny."
"Good morning, Miss Marianne."
How did you find the silver?
"You're hiding something, please co-operate."
Co-operate?
What do I've?
"Nothing, let him come and take it."
Would I be like this if I had Rs.20 crores?
Leave me sir.
"Sir, he has two bank accounts, both are empty."
What's this trouble sir?
"If I don't get tea, my boss will dismiss me sir."
I'm going sir.
A link is missing.
He won't lie...no way.
Why did he send his photo then?
"He's a thief, why should he tell truth?"
"He can lie to us, right?"
May be the peon is lying.
Thank God!
"My money...crores of my money, where is it sir?"
You said you'd no money.
"Not mine, it's Minister's."
Why didn't you tell the truth earlier?
How can I sir?
"I'm a proxy, trusted proxy of Minister."
He punched me and took everything.
Who is he?
How does he look?
Rajinikanth...superstar Rajinikanth punched me and took everything.
"I swear on my mother, it was Rajinikanth!"
My money...my money...
where's my money?
"Mother promise, superstar Rajinikanth took it away."
Bloody crap!
Kike.
Did you hurt my baby?
"No, I..."
You son of a bitch.
"What did you do, where is he?"
Where is he?
I don't know!
You're going to find him.
"As God is my witness, you are going to find him."
"Yes... yes, you!"
"I'll call the police, I swear to God."
I swear to God I will throw you back in that cage
If you don't bring my baby home.
"Baby, how the fuck am I supposed to know"
Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck.
"I don't give a fuck, you will figure it out."
"Go, go, go!"
"Okay, okay."
"Fuck, I'm ready to go inside and get in shape."
I think my baby girl is in for a treat tonight.
"(Man) Yo, that's the shorty that wanted me to wifey it up,"
But she let the next nigga hit it.
"I was like, ""How you want me to wifey it up"""
"And you let dude hit?"""
"Shit, that's why you can't trust these bitches, man."
"(Pete) Can't trust niggas, neither, man."
"Yo, she even got the name ""Danny"" tattooed on her pussy,"
"But I don't know if it was for me,"
"'Cause that nigga's named Danny, too."
(Laughing)
- What?
A fishy fin?
"- No, a Mickey Finn."
"Oh, Mumsie."
You and these Mickey Finns.
I'll have no peace until I get one from the nursing home.
What did you say?
The doctors use them on the violent patients.
Why didn't you say?
Why didn't I think of it?
- Get me some.
Plenty of them.
"- Mumsie, I was only joking."
Wait!
Sit down.
"Ethel, I have something very important to tell you."
You know how much my reputation as a writer and as a woman means to me.
"You're loved and respected the whole world over, Mumsie."
"Till now, yes."
"Ethel, many years ago, your father was in China."
Money was short.
"I was young, beautiful."
"It was easy, and so was..."
I fell by the wayside.
"So, you slipped, darling."
So do tons of people.
You found your feet again.
"For some months, I lost my head completely."
"Ethel, suppose someone found out and was threatening to expose me to the world."
What would you say?
I...
"I'd want to kill him, Mumsie."
Bad leg?
You haven't got any skill in your fingers.
"How's your castaway getting along then, Doctor?"
"Pretty bashed about a bit, actually, Jon."
God knows where he came from.
Bugger doesn't speak a word of English.
"He isn't from around here, that's for sure."
[Men laughing]
"Christ Almighty, Lukey!"
What the hell's the matter with thee?
[Ursula]:
When did Dr. Mead say he'd be here?
When he's finished his surgery.
So what do people from Poland have for breakfast?
Probably some awful kind of sausage.
But I'm sure porridge will do him much more good.
We'll soon find out.
Nothing wrong with his appetite.
- Glad to hear it.
Are the sisters of mercy in attendance?
"Yes, we are."
"Good morning, Doctor."
Shall we go up?
"Morning, Janet."
I'm glad to see that bruise.
"Doesn't look very pretty, but better it's there than not."
"Eh, nurse?"
What's his temperature?
- It's a little over.
Make sure he drinks lots of water.
"So, Polish, is he?"
It would appear so.
"Oh, God, can't you help her?"
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the devil.
"Now, kindly undo these straps."
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother's in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?
Thank you.
"Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good."
Nothing you could do could make it any worse.
I can't do it.
I need evidence that the Church would accept...
-...as signs of possession.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Another war flick.
How boring.
How could you do this?
And you?
You are worse than a traitor.
You're a murderer who's going to kill all the people who won't be able to leave through this door anymore.
They promised to let me go to the future.
"We have you, fräulein."
We don't need him.
But what do you mean you can't come right now?
"Listen, this isn't a marching band that's coming, eh?"
"I want you in my office, now."
Espínola.
Espínola.
Espínola.
"It's gone dead, God."
Evacuation Order.
Have the agents return to their time periods and their homes.
Only essential staff and security.
"Yes, Sir."
And what do we do with Juan?
"-If you don't mind, take him to your house."
I'm staying here with you.
"-No, Angustias, you go home."
(Machine gun fire)
Well I think that I'm going to have to stay.
(Machine gun fire)
"Oh, thank God."
God and this wonderful machine.
You've got to hurry.
Lola is telling them about the Ministry.
He's from nigeria.
Nice to meet you.
"Yeah, you, too."
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Well, at least"
One of the dubois women is happy in her work.
Bridgette loves working at the library.
She doesn't even mind the fact
That you can't really talk in there.
Will hate to see it end.
Meets all kinds of interesting people.
Even helped a nice young girl set up an e-mail account.
Hmm?
"Come on, bridgette dubois, librarian at large?"
Isn't that good for at least a smile?
Hmm.
"Well, I guess not."
"Hey, come on, I mean..."
"I just, I can't stand the thought of this monster getting away with this,"
"The thought of devalos losing his job, his license."
"Look, I know he made a mistake,"
"But the truth is, if that had been one of our daughters,"
I would've done the same thing.
I think he showed remarkable restraint
In not murdering the son of a bitch.
See?
It's easy.
Now you can write e-mails to whoever you want.
Wow.
Thanks.
You're a very smart kid.
"That's why I brought you along, just in case."
But we didn't come to fight.
We came to burn railroad bridges.
"If you don't like the plan, you're free to drop out now."
"If you come, you'll do it my way."
[train bell]
- Cloudin' over.
- Yeah.
Is it gonna rain?
Might could.
"It rains one minute, shines the next."
[conductor] All aboard!
[train whistle]
"- Good morning, conductor."
- Morning.
Didn't you get on at Marietta?
You're the one who saved Xiao-Mei.
We owe you a lot.
"Oh, that's just my duty, it's nothing."
"Drink up, come on Mr. Jeng."
You could help this old fool.
"Thirst and respect, huh?"
"Mr. Wu, why did you say you were a fool?"
(laughing)
"If I tell you son, you'll still never know why."
(laughing)
"Oh yes, I understand you."
"Well, I feel like"
"I'm half drunk and half sober, half of me is mad and half of me a fool."
"I work half a day, and I get half day's pay."
Everything is just half and half again.
"(laughing) Well then, you would be half an old bald head and half a young man,"
We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.
"Naik, detail 10 men for guard duty."
The remainder will pile arms and prepare for work.
Halt!
"Gunga Din, water."
"Gunga Din, bring water!"
Bring water!
Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
"So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?"
"- Salaam, sahib."
- Who are you?
What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
"Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children."
The children are looking bonny.
"Come on, everybody, in the other room."
"Go on, get up."
On the double.
Get in there.
You heard me!
Quick!
That's right.
Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
"- Trinkets, sahib."
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
"- Go on, open them up."
Who are these playful subjects here?
What's different about it?
There's nothing different about it.
You're just like your father.
So easy to trip up.
"- So, how was work?"
- Same as always.
Although I had one customer come in looking for a makeover.
She needed one.
"Dyed blonde hair, blue eye shadow, ash brown foundation."
Hideous.
"Anyway, she was shocked when she found out how old I was."
Oh.
How old were you?
Sorry.
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.
He wants to take me to some Alzheimer's benefit.
I said forget it.
I can't believe he still asks you after all these years.
Why don't you go with him sometime?
"Please, those days are over."
I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband.
That's my life.
I have no interest in starting another one.
"Besides, he knows my situation with you."
You're not seeing him because of me?
How would it look?
"The mother's dating, and the daughter stays home alone."
"Mom, who's looking?"
Hello.
Hi.
What's that?
Don't tell me.
That's European or something?
Bet you got a story to tell.
This is Davis Hartley here.
I'm not some nickel and dime street mutt.
I'm not trying to rip you off or anything.
It would be stupid.
A guy like you?
Got a couple pounds of Lead in his eyes?
What's that?
Is that maybe grief or something like that?
You want to talk about it?
Maybe you think I'm trying to rip off your experiences to put 'em in my novel.
But that's not true.
Davis Hartley is not some moral cretin.
Not precisely.
I'm trying to make a point here.
I'm a professional New York City car driver.
You know what that means?
I'm the greatest individual at being able to find anything in the world.
I could find a penguin in a sandstorm.
- I don't know what a penguin would be-
- Stop talking.
Please stop talking!
Hello!
Stop talking!
You want to help?
"After I stop, I'll be busy for a while."
Find a guy named...
Alex Bohemia.
Who do you think I am?
"I'm not in trouble, Carl, you are."
Please tell them they're wrong.
Did you kill Lawrence Ridgeway?
I'm sorry.
No.
You shot him?
It's my job to look out for you.
To look out for this family.
People depend on me.
"When they told me about the rifle,"
I thought... but I didn't want to believe it was you.
Ridgeway told me about the account.
"If that money disappeared, and they came asking, he would have pointed to me."
He was a loose end.
I had to protect us.
And why not blackmail the Secretary of the Navy while you're at it.
That was nothing ;
it was an empty threat.
It was a diversion.
Man is still dead.
"But that AUTEC money is just sitting there, and we're about to lose everything."
I did this for both of us.
"We needed it, Phillip."
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
"Oh, no."
"Vance nails you with the shredding detail, huh?"
"Yes, from redacted to unredacted to recycling to..."
"Tell me, I have a question."
Hmm?
Do you believe?
Believe in what?
is that necessary?
Herman will see you've slept with me.
- ls he jealous?
- You better believe it.
- And where'll I sleep from now on?
- l'll show you.
He's staying all next week.
It'll give me lots of time for the treatment.
What'll you say about me?
That you're a writer in need of some peace.
He knows I'm a member of the Literature Club.
"Isn't it a bit perverse, Christine taking in two lovers at once?"
Perverse?
You're going to help me with Herman?
You care about as much for Herman as for me: not at all.
A great deal.
"Take the keys, so you can come and go as you like."
We'll be back late.
Bye...
Give Herman my regards.
"I will, and you start your novel!"
Drive carefully!
Chapter One
When I arrived at V. yesterday...
"Damn... I'm wearing your shirt, Johan!"
Home movies?
Johan.
Henk.
Gé?
"Snip, snip, snip..."
Do you take Christine to be your lawful wedded wife?
What is your reply?
- So sorry.
Uh.
- Hi!
"Oh, it's you."
All of the research I could've been doing while chasing this Will-o'- the-Wisp Psychiatrist.
"- So, you hit someone?"
- With my cane.
I struck him across his fat face.
- It was fatter than mine.
- Why?
He had a leg tremor and Nystagmus.
- That's abnormal eye movements.
So?
- It was obvious he was in the advanced stages of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
I told him as much.
That's a neurological disease.
It's brought on by excessive alcohol consumption.
- She knows what it is!
"- I don't, actually."
"Well, you should, seeing the company you keep."
I-I still don't understand why you hit him.
He called me a nosy old Jew.
"Jew, yes."
"Old, perhaps."
"Nosy, never!"
"Ok, well, uh, good for you."
- What is that?
- That's a flight tracker app.
"He should be in the air by now, if he got on the plane."
"Makes you wanna dance, doesn't it?"
I am so sorry.
I feel like I've been in this car for four years.
I'll take you.
I just gotta make a quick stop first.
"You know what, when people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or the store."
"No, thank you."
"You know what, this is for computer classes."
"Know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
I really don't.
To get you rich.
"'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gon' blow up."
How do you know I'm not rich?
Your teeth.
"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon."
They know the window of opportunity's only open for a moment.
You gotta get in when you're young.
Get the money and get out.
"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy."
I don't have sex for a living.
Neither do we.
Neither do they.
"Yes, they do."
Where is my phone?
We are strong

What is your location?
"Dark Sensations, in the Bronx."
I wish you were here.
Mr. Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
"You are Erik Berg, right?"
Hello.
I know you.
- I work in the law.
- Oh well. in section two?
During alderman Wallenberg.
I have read your articles about police informants.
- Do you have time to talk a little?
- Yes.
Thank you for standing for.

"We do not have approval from the management, not even unofficially."

"- No, I'm sick."

SHOOTING TIPPING STlLLE OF THE COURT
Unlikely many reports on a moped robbery I must say.
- We should just ...
- It's okay.
Continue In just.
Do what you do best.
"If no make a fuss, so please direct them to me."
What the hell was that about?
- Who is it?
- It's Niklas.
He's good.
"What I said earlier, it was ..."
A meeting?
We're isolated because of Han and Puyo's embargo.
And Puyo's preparing to attack us.
I want to ask Commander Jumong what he plans to do about this.
Call the Commander.
You can't talk to him now.
Why not?
"Is he really dead, like the people say?"
What are you talking about?
The Commander isn't dead.
Even Sosuhno has disappeared.
Yuntabal.
Tell us what's going on.
Where's the Commander?
I can't tell you.
I can't trust you until I meet him.
He's the one who failed to protect us against Puyo and the Han.
We'll take matters into our own hands.
Let's go.
I'll talk to Songyang before attacking Jolbon.
He'll want to avoid a war once he finds out Jumong is dead.
We'll be ready to attack as soon as you return.

Dante!
Dante!
I've gotta rest.
"I told you, you shouldn't have done that last hit, man."
You've been doing too much lately.
"You're not doing enough, friend."
I love the venom and the sweet venom loves me.
"Hyang Gi, get a bit closer."
"Smile, smile!"
Okay!
"All right, one, two..."
Wait!
Really...
"Hey, move your breasts up a bit, like this."
Mom!
"Wedding photos are like your honeymoon, you only get it once."
"Mom, you're not a professional, leave it up to the pros!"
You're being completely rude!
"Rudeness is momentary, pictures are forever."
"It's fine, right Mr. Choi?"
"Yes, are you ready now?"
"The kids are going to get tired, stop it."
"Ahjumma, please take my mom to a cafe or something."
We won't even get one good photo because of mom.
What?
We're going to be spending the entire night like this.
And my feet hurt.
You think you'll get anything with no suffering?
Endure it!
You think I'm doing this because I have an excess of strength?
Let's go.
"Let's go and drink some tea, and get some fresh air."
There's no need for us to be here.
Are you the only one whose feet hurt?
You think I like doing this?
Ma'am!
"I'm sorry, Oppa."
Let's start.
All right.
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.
The demon is a liar.
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
Come in.
Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
He's here already.
"It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
"Do you want to hear the background of the case first, Father?"
Why?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
"Would you like some brandy in that, Father?"
The doctors say I shouldn't.
But thank God my will is weak.
He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.

The dark vault.
You've never seen the dark vault.
I'm gonna hazard a guess here you're never gonna want to see the dark vault after we move that to there.
"Okay, you get the..."
"No, you know what?"
Let's do this tomorrow.
"You know, we better secure it."
"You know, let's move that trunk."
"When I say ""let's,"" I mean you."

"Steven Rubell, who was one of the co-founders of Studio 54, he considered calling his club Wonderland."
"Oh, my God!"

"Yeah, okay, let's go."
- My ten grand?
"- Right, about that."
"Well, Artie, you know, last-minute Apache helicopter rides to the middle of nowhere,"

Did it work?
- Look who's here.
"- Oh, my God!"
"Yeah, making breakfast."
Come on.
"So, Myka, you said I was a good kisser."
NARRATOR:
"You bought it for him, give it to him!"
"I won't give him this one, I've underlined some sentences."
He'd ask why.
How many weddings should there be?
"Three more, three in a row."
All rather late today.
Seems to take a long time.
What's the time?
I don't know. I won't cook today.
Have you done your shopping?
Some of it.
Meat.
"Pay day's not until Monday, did you have enough for it?"
Monday?
Not till Tuesday.
This is sure to save us!
I thought it was Monday.
"No, Tuesday. lt's the fifteenth today, isn't it?"
"Tomorrow's Sunday the sixteenth, Monday the seventeenth..."
Then we'll have to have something left over from Sunday.
It's enough to make ends meet till Sunday and you'll still have...
"No, I've already bought chickens."
I bought chickens in the week.
"I had a look at the market today, there were very few there."
I don't buy them at the market.
I bought them in a shop.
"Look out, the next ones are coming!"
Get ready!
Put your foot there.
"Here's part of it, I'd add this."
"Ah, you've got it pinned already!"
Won't you try it on?
Yes.
"And he's sincere and easygoing, and sexy,"
I just really like him.
Daddy?
Christine.
What?
- That's my date.
- That's my father.
- You're father?
- Your date?
You got to be freaking kidding me.
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now."
"So leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hi, Christine, this is Jeff."
Haven't heard from you since our date.
Don't know if you got my message so I thought I'd leave another one.
"I'm hoping that you didn't get the first message, because now there'd be two messages on your machine and that would make me look not cool."
And I think we both know how cool I am.
Bye.
"Well, he sounds cool."
Why aren't you talking to him?
I thought you liked him.
"No, I do like him but he's new Christine's dad."
I mean we had a great first date and everything but don't you think that's weird?
That he wants a second date with you-- absolutely.
Shut up.
You'd marry me in a second.
"Besides, I'm too busy to date."
Seriously?
You're scraping the crusty bits off the sides now?
I'm sorry but I'm an emotional eater.
"Hang on, hang on."
All right look the recipe says it serves 12.
I had one and a half you dropped one on the floor.
That means you had nine-and-a-half servings!
Well excuse me Little Miss Solve-Your-Fancy-Math-Problems.
I-Got-Into-Stanford- and-Your-Daughter-Didn't.
[Gasps]
You lashed out at me.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to.
Here.
Like I would want that.
Oh.
Okay.
Dang my generation's foolish beliefs that food can make the pain go away.
[Taking deep breath]
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's all right, I mean, we're jumping on each other."
Because you know we feel helpless and there's nothing we can do.
Although frankly a little bit more you than me.
Well excuse me but I don't think I recall throwing macaroni fractions.
In your face.
"Oh, do you wanna go?"
-Is this how it's going to be?
Is this how it's going to be?
"-That's the way it's gonna be, yeah."
Come on.
"Oh, all right I can't hear you with that in your mou... hi."
Hey.
-How you doing bud?
Tia?
"If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too."
[tires screeching] [brakes squealing]
You the party I'm supposed to pick up?
- [Bene] just the children.
- All right.
"Meter's running, hop in."
I got it.
[cabbie grunts]
I've been waiting here forever.
"You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people."
We're exactly on time.
"Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up."
"I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months."
We have seats on the 50-yard line.
[Tony laughs]
Deliver the children to this address.
You'll be paid after you arrive.
This is a big fare here.
"If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip."
"Now, everything's been arranged."
I'll see you Friday.
- Ok.
"Goodbye, Uncle Bene."
- Goodbye.
"- Have fun, you two."
- [tires screeches]
[engine revving]
[horn honking]
- Look at that dummy.
- [honking horn]
"Get off the road, you dummy."
Who did it?
We did it.
Better not be anything missing.
This is private property.
So was the radio private property.
So were Manfredi and Johnson.
What about the radio?
"Yeah, what about it?"
Cut the horsing around.
We know he's the stoolie and what the payoff is.
- So let's get on with it.
-Let's get on with what?
"What is this, anyway?"
A kangaroo court?
Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
"You're all wire happy, boys."
You've been in this camp too long.
You put 2 and 2 together and it comes out 4.
Only it ain't 4!
"What's it add up to you, Sefton?"
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy.
Because I'm telling you the Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barracks.
"And whatever you do to me, you're gonna have to do all over when you find the right guy."
Watch it.
The kommandant.
"Achtung, Herr Kommandant."
"Good evening, sergeants."
"Little coffee klatch you are having, eh?"
"Gloomy in here, isn't it?"
Where is the barracks chief?
"Yes, sir."
Sammy!
"""Sixties."
"Looks older""?"
"Senior roles are not to be sneered at, Ambrose."
- Gravitas.
Experience.
Maturity.
- Ugh.
We all have a part to play in defeating Hitler.
Not this part.
It's a corpse role.
He's dead before the end of act three.
Mr. Smith.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mr. Hilliard.
"Ambrose, you must see--"
"You, me, the industry, we are all at the service of the war now."
The war.
The war.
Damn the bloody war!
"The war has skimmed off the cream, and we're left with the rancid curds!"
I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a bomb crater on the Marylebone Road.
Oh!
No one told me there was a meeting.
"No, we've been rather trying to keep this under wraps for the present."
It seems that there's a someone in Mr. Swain's department who knows a someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk.
That their engine broke down before they were even out of British waters.
Pity.
"Pity all round, really."
Your first draft boded so well.
- Well...
- They're talking to Phan and his crew?
"- Phan's crew, yeah."
Thanks for the info.
Just letting you know what it looks like.
Gotta think about this a little bit.
Things are moving fast.
Let me know what you wanna do.
"I'm gonna go visit the shoe shop next door, OK?"
Don't go anywhere else.
Come straight back here.
She's such a good kid.
God knows how that happened with all we put her through.
"Yeah, I worry about that."
You know Bob's new girlfriend?
What was her name again?
Lorna.
How did they hook up?
I have no idea.
Bob keeps his business to himself.
"I think they met at a club, or something."
I think she's having an affair with Jim.
You know anything about that?
You're kidding?
"Alison, don't lie to me, please."
I won't tell anybody you told me.
I think it happened just the one time.
When?
"When he was on his way back from Seattle, I guess."
When he was on the island.
That's the DEA building.
They've got offices over there.
"Do you know that for sure, the DEA got offices in there?"
And when we see we no longer know who we are!
"But my friend ... in the country of the blind, the Guerci suffer."
"We must not, you should not watch."
Refinement of the morning!
Sdolcinature!
She is almost as beautiful as my mother.
You could have telegraphed.
It was easier to take the train.
"On what platform you fell, a small mine?"
She was a woman betrothed to a gangster.
I spent the night with her.
I do not know where now.
And here I am.
- Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
- I lost your luggage.
"The portrait of my mother, the last letter of my father,"
"I have his tie, handkerchief ..."
I don't know where ...
"""I loved,"" is not the truth."
You touched me.
Emotions ...
I do think about your father.
Beautiful was your father.
"It always falls before the beauty, especially if you do not bend."
What is the truth?
Wash whiter?
"My shirt the trip, the night."
The rain ...
Do you do this to cause idiocy?
I provoke the imbecility ...
The im-be-cyl-li-ta!
And when your mother came to Paris for the last time I ...
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?
(LAUGHING MANICALLY)
Stop that.
What a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
-Hat it?
-Yes.
"I used to hat the White Queen, you know."
"Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear."
Her head is so small.
It's tiny.
It's a pimple of a head.
But this...
"What I could do with this monument, this orb..."
"Nay, this magnificently heroic globe."
What could you do?
"Unbind him, Stayne."
How can he work if his hands are bound?
"Well, then, shall it be a bonnet or a boater?"
Or something for the boudoir?
"Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif, snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke, cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau, bongrace, fan-tail, night cap, Garibaldi, fez..."
Hatter.
Fez?
Leave us.
The trees seem sad.
-Have you been speaking with them?
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
Perhaps a bit more kindly.
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.
"-What news, Bayard?"
"Come on, its my turn."
Please?
Just keep it legal.
"Wait, you sure your parents wont come home?"
They could.
"But, this isn't their Jacuzzi."
Brooke... whose house is this?
I don't know!
Does it matter?
Here you go.
"Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty."
Oh!
Sorry.
"Things have worked out pretty well, huh?"
"Karen's café gets to stay open, and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law."
"So, how are you doing with things?"
"Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday."
Dan and counseling.
It's kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar.
"Well, if you think it would help, I'd be happy to talk to Nathan."
I think he'd like that.
"I know you like my women, Keith, but come on!"
Deb's still my wife.
Won't be for long if you keep this up.
I'm taking Nathan to dinner tonight.
Do you have a problem with that?
- Yeah.
He needs a break from you.
- You can't stop me from seeing my own son.
"Oh, actually I can."
"By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer."
Your choice.
What ever happened to that Amazon he used to go around with?
That Felice...
Felice something?
She was mad about him.
He wants to marry me.
"It would even things up, wouldn't it?"
We'd both be married.
It would make things so much fairer from now on.
-From now on?
-When we run into each other.
We won't.
"We know the same people, we go to the same places."
"-It would be difficult not to, wouldn't it?"
-Not at all.
"But what possible harm could there be in our having a drink now and then, or lunch?"
A great deal of harm.
"All right, Bran."
I'm sorry.
I just thought it might be fun.
"And remember, Isabel, there will be no telephone calls in the middle of the night, no mysterious telegrams, nothing."
We're not gonna have any trouble.
"I'll do exactly what you want, Bran."
Exactly what you want.
Oh.
"Oh, Alec."
"I just ran into Brandon Bourne, an old friend."
"Hello, Bourne, I've heard a great deal about you."
Get me a cab!
"Quick, get me a cab!"
Rosa.
How do you feel?
Baffled.
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.
portugal.
These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
CzechosIovakia.
italy.
poland.
bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.
brazil.
Cuba.
holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water."" AII died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
people are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
What's the matter now?
I think Grandma would Iike it not too spicy.
May I start eating?
You saw your sister naked in the shower?
Sort of.
I was hiding in the laundry basket.
"Hey, Stacey."
"Hi, Brad."
I saw you in the drug store yesterday.
You were buying Juicy Fruit gum.
Are you going to the dance Saturday?
"It's a '50s sock hop, you know."
I'm thinking of going to the dance.
"Can I wear your jacket today, Brad?"
"Oh, come on, what do you want for it?"
I want to take you to the closet...
No way!
You are so bad.
What'd you say to her?
I told her what I wanted.
I don't think she's that kind of girl.
"She's a girl, Frank."
All girls are that kind of girl.
She didn't used to be a girl.
"Hey, guys."
What are we looking at?
What's that?
I think it's an elbow.
What's it doing with that other elbow?
Doesn't look like anything
"I ever want to do, that's for sure."
Will you stop cleaning?
Why do you do that?
My dad demands complete order and sanitation.
"I know a place where the girls are naked all the time, where guys can see naked girls all they want, 24 hours a day for anyone with guts and a hundred bucks."
"I'm pretty sure you didn't give it to me the other night, Joe."
"You're right, but that's only because at the time"
"I didn't want to burden you with what was only a gut feeling, with fortunately turned out to be wrong."
You thought she was dead?
I did.
But I have confirmation that is not the case.
So where is she?
When's she coming home?
I don't know.
And she's not.
At least not anytime soon.
The word is that Doris is active again.
That's all I got.
Everything else is classified.
It's classified.
Wow.
Mm.
I want you to please keep looking for her.
"You shake the trees and you find her, okay?"
"Steve, your mom stayed hidden for 20 years."
She is not gonna be found.
She'll surface when she's ready.
Yeah.
When do you think that's gonna be?
I think that'll be when she's prepared to face you.
Hey.
How you holding up?
"I'm, uh..."
I'm a mess.
"You know, I just keep telling myself"
I did everything I could to save him.
"No, Catherine."
The proof of the pudding is in the eating!
Five years ago misfortune struck me and I lost a child.
- But now you're already seven months pregnant.
- Just so!
This time I want to know for sure.
Doctors are just men and have no idea what goes on inside us.
Come on...
Bruno?
Why are you snooping around here?
"It smells so strange here, all the way out to the courtyard."
It's Lisol.
It smells healthy!
"No, it reeks..."
"like in hospital, as when mother had our baby."
Why are you mopping up here?
So that you have something to ask.
Here!
This is women's work.
Hah!
"Whenever you want something from me, I'm a lady to Mr Bruno!"
But when I want something from you...
What do you want from me?
Nothing at all!
It looks so different here.
I've fixed it up so I can sleep here.
Sleep?
Yes...
I'm not telling anyone...
"A real little room, something like that is what I've always wished for."
With a mirror...
"But to sleep here alone, Bruno..."
I would have been afraid to.
"What about your store, Ladyjaan, and your customers?"
Is it not right for us to go back to where we belong?
"Not for me, Ladyjaan."
Are you not angry at what they did to you?
"Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan."
But I still have both my eyes and I have such friends.
"Haroun, you have found so much more than wealth here."
You came for a dream and found love.
"Now, what did you bring for me?"
It's for Hameeda.
"Well, actually... it's for you both... together."
Lotus root.
You put this on her on the night of your wedding.
It's for a lifetime of deep loving.
Here it is.
What do you think?
It's uh...
It's beautiful.
Is this yours?
"Oh, yeah."
"It's an old bakery, actually."
I just love the idea of making old things new.
There's something cool about it.
"Forgive me, Doug, but I have to return to where I belong."
You showed me such love.
Thank you.
But it cannot be.
I do not expect you to understand.
But there is no other way.
I'm sorry.
I will carry your love with me forever.
Spices.
I want to see this.
"You coming, Quute?"
"- What about the tunnel, sir?"
- Blow every charge now.
(Beeping)
"You were right, Tarrant."
That was the monorail.
Let's move.
Put down your guns.
Servalan!
Now!
"You see, I told you, Quute."
"They're marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
She got away.
"It was Servalan, wasn't it?"
"Well, we both saw her, and she seemed to recognise us."
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're ready for teleport.
About time.
Stand by to teleport.
"Slave, where are those cruisers now?"
"Sector 12, Master."
You outmanoeuvred them with consummate skill.
Thank you.
"Set a direct course for base, maximum speed."
Teleport operating.
What are you smirking about?
Do you realise we've got half the Federation battle fleet looking for us?
"The next time either of you pull a stunt like that, I warn you it may prove fatal."
We've just seen an old friend of yours.
- An implacable old friend.
- Servalan.
So like we told your people.
I can't imagine what these last 18 months have been like.
"So what do you want from us, Agent Pritchard?"
I want to start again.
If you have anything of Kevin's from that time...
We haven't touched his room.
So you can take whatever you want if it helps.
[Sniffles]
But don't call us again unless you have answers.
This is everything from Kevin's room?
Yep.
"So, start your timeline at zero."
What's your first event?
I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.
It happened a month before the first killing.
I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.
All right.
We'll call it event one.
Kevin Whitfield's event two.
"God, it's weird being here."
It looks just like your old place.
"Yeah, I kind of like it here."
Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
"Hey, you don't have mine, do you?"
I'd like to see who came to my funeral.
"No, you wouldn't."
[Scoffs]
"Duval, did you really bust my car window 'cause I made your mom cry?"
Yeah.
I did.
Good for you.
Liz Kenyon.
"Oh, you'll be the prettiest mouse at the ball."
"What do you mean, mouse?"
"Uh, nothing."
Sounds like Elka's ready to go.
- Do you need a lift?
"- No, no, no."
We're gonna wait for Joy.
You go ahead without us.
So the newly beautiful mouse headed off to the ball.
It's almost too easy.
"Now, what's our ending?"
We'll find out at the ball.
The Earl is there.
"The two sisters will vie for him, and then whatever happens, that's the ending to our book."
What?
No.
"No, no, no, no."
You can't let a little thing like a scooter and an eye patch stop you.
How about this?
I knocked my crown out trying to open my eye drops bottle.
You cannot give up.
This would be a terrible ending.
Where would Cinderella be if she'd stayed home and felt sorry for herself when her sister was off having fun at the ball?
Look at me.
I'm hardly Cinderella.
"Victoria, she's right."
Jill is the one that got beautiful.
"Oh, that's true."
You've had your time.
Jill's Cinderella now.
Shut up!
"I'm Cinderella, and I'm going to the ball."
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?
So I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
"I need it, I got to have it."
It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
"Lois, do you understand what we are involved in here?"
I don't care.
I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't you move, you motherfucker or I'll blow your brains out."
Shut the car off slowly.
"For a second, I thought I was dead."
"But when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
"Michael, lock the door!"
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't."
I don't really give a fuck.
You'll do 25 years.
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
"I'd like to ask one, too."
"What is it, mr."
Collins?
How long will it take them boats to go from new york to bristol?
"Overnight, mr."
Collins.
Just overnight.
"Oh, excellent, excellent."
"Yes, well, just a moment, mr."
"Maybury, i'll have mr."
Fisk answer that question.
"Oh, mr."
Fisk- mr.
Maybury would like to know if all 6 of the new boats will be taken from this model.
"Oh, of course not."
Each one is to be larger and more luxurious than its predecessor.
"Well, tell mr."
Maybury i'll come in and explain the details myself.
Thank you.
"Oh, would you mind coming back a little later?"
"Oh, i don't mind waiting."
Patience is its own reward.
Make yourself at home.
"It seems to me, mr."
"Palmer, that nothing, nothing can be too fine for our clientele."
I?
s working.
"Gentlemen, i think we'd better close this transom."
The enemy is right here in our camp.
He's nibbling.
"Let me take a peek, jim."
He don't look like no big fish to be- he looks more like a sidewinder crab!
Zach didn't even sleep with Hallie.
And even if he had how could I blame him?
I practically...
pushed him into Hallie's arms.
She was right.
Maybe I do play victim sometimes.
Everyone's been right about me.
"You're afraid of a real relationship, Dale."
I've just had a blind eye to it.
I've scared of getting hurt.
Because he's too perfect.
I've kept Zach at arm's length.
You are so afraid of getting hurt that you end up picking guys that have absolutely no substance.
Hey...
Am I gonna live the rest of my life...
with guys like... this?
Just to... avoid someone... real?
No.
Hell no!
I'm ready to change.
If I get... one more chance...
I won't screw it up... again.
If I just get one more... chance.
I'll be right there.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to come by and talk.
"Look, I think we've done enough talking."
I'm really not interested in talking with you.
I just wanted to say that I understand that this isn't gonna work.
"You and I, that is."
Ok.
Why did you hang out with me?
Says here they got reason to believe they're headed for Houston.
Seems to me they just may fit the description of the folks you boys are after.
Son of a bitch.
Think we may even have a photograph of them.
They ran out of a convenience store earlier.
Surveillance camera?
"Yeah, I think so."
Texas.
"Looks like they're headed our way, boys."
"Hey, you got another cup?"
"Sure, if you don't mind drinking after me."
"No, not at all."
Goddamn.
Texas.
Whew.
You think it was our people who whacked that state trooper?
We'll know as soon as we get the photo.
Hurricane...
He's waiting on the bad guys the way a kid waits for Christmas.
"Yeah, well, Hurricane's a force of nature."
I like old Hurricane.
Nice fellow.
You know what he told me this morning?
What?
He said he was thinking of coming to L.A. and joining the force.
You're kidding.
Honest to God.
He said that he thought me and him and Mackintosh would make a hell of a team.
No shit.
(LAUGHING) He said he wanted to take a crack at the big time.
Jesus.
What did you say?
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast!
This'll take weeks to repair.
"Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2."
My ship has run off course en route to sector 1 2.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa!
Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to.
Sorry.
Howdy.
My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
"And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up."
"This is my spot, see, the bed here."
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
"I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit."
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
"Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot."
I need to repair my turbo boosters.
"Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?"
Good.
- We should all keep in touch.
- Definitely.
"Mark, pay me more attention."
Mark!
This is the last time that you see me.
I wanna go to Marosi.
Are you out of your mind?
I want to look him in the eye and I just wanna ask him some questions.
I really dont't think that's a good idea.
He said that he killed Jesse.
So I just wanna meet him.
And either you gonna help me out or I'm gonna have to sort this myself.
"Hello, Mr. Wells."
I want to talk about my brother.
I killed him.
"I chose him,"
I took him and I killed him.
"Three acts, simple."
I don't believe you.
"They found the bodies of the other 4 boys that you killed, but not my brother."
Why not?
I burnt it.
Why would you do that?
Because he was younger.
And what I did to him... was disgusting.
I like young boys.
And I liked Jesse.
A lot.
You're already facing life for the other 4 boys that you killed.
"So you took the rep for Jesse in order to secure yourself privileges in prison, didn't you?"
Get yourself back on the front pages.
I saw you at the station and your picture later on such a beautiful boy.
"I thought I've got to have him, even if it kills me."
I like your spiel nobody's ever told me that before.
Spieling is my profession.
I kept lobbying with Christine...
and hoping that you would come.
"I like you going for me, Gerard."
"I, dirty old man."
loving HUSBANDS OF christine HALSLAG
- My God!
"- Hey, what's up?"
Three dead!
Look at those urns!
I'll be damned!
Chrissy's family grave.
She had all three of them cremated.
A fourth and they can play bridge.
- Did you know they were dead?
- Of course.
"The whole town knows, and even pities her."
Pities her?
"She let them die, and I know how!"
"- Oh, come off it!"
- She had one crash with a parachute.
She fed one to the lions and sank the other at sea.
Bet she didn't tell you!
Bullshit!
One of them had to show off in the Safari Park the second one's parachute didn't open and the third...
And who'll be the fourth?
!
- Get your hands off me!
- You or me!
Are you Sicilian?
"No, I'm Calabrese."
"We're practically paisan, do me this favor."
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.
"Besides, the new tenants pay more rent."
How much more a month?
Five bucks.
Here's six months increase in advance.
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.
Come see me in another six months.
"Of course, the dog stays."
Right?
The dog stays.
Who the hell are you to come give me orders?
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street!
Do me this favor.
I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me.
They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
What a character!
That landlord is here...
"Roberto, the one who owns those ratholes."
He's been asking all around the neighborhood about you.
"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Don Vito."
"What can I do for you, Don Roberto?"
What a misunderstanding!
Holy Mary!
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!
I'm giving back the money you gave me.
"Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!"
- We are.
What's happening in D.C.?
I'm working on legislation that would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It will be like taking 100 million cars right off the street.
- It'd be groundbreaking.
- Impressive.
- The other...
- For the record?
I don't see why I should be the one to take the fall for this.
- I wasn't the only one that knew.
- You're bearing the brunt because you're here.
"Believe me, I wish that Tommy and Kevin were here too."
- Is it always like this?
- You dreamed of having a baby sister.
"Sarah, you know what?"
"I was six, OK?"
That wish didn't include Dad cheating on Mom.
"I didn't know what to do, Kitty."
So I thought the best thing to do was nothing.
So shoot me.
Oh.
Do you like cigars?
I got some good ones and we could...
That would be great.
You didn't know what to do so you did nothing.
"I would've told you, Sarah!"
"Justin, where are you?"
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
- I can't make it.
I'm sorry.
- What?
My mom's been cooking all day.
"- Much better, Donna."
Thanks.
Listen I didn't thank you how I should have yesterday.
Going through all that with me at the hospital.
It's okay.
What'd your wife say when you told her what happened?
"Not too much, you know."
Did you talk with her about taking walks?
"Yeah, we may do that."
You didn't tell her.
I didn't want to worry her.
"Besides, it turned out to be nothing."
What happened yesterday wasn't nothing.
The doctor said I should take the treadmill test but he doesn't think there's a problem.
"What the doctor said was, you're under extreme stress, you need to relax and he suggests taking long walks after work."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look, I'm okay."
I'm fine.
Thanks.
- Detective.
- Thanks.
My boss is leaving town.
He wants to hear your prep on the Ortiz testimony.
- He'll come here if necessary.
"- Yeah, all right."
Tomorrow at 2:00?
Tomorrow at 2.
Is Stan Heywood there?
"Stan, John Kelly."
I'm Robin's friend.
I got something for you.
Whenever you want me to drop it by.
I couId tell you a thing or two myself.
Who supports us?
What about after this experiment?
Who will work?
Me.
"You think I don,t support us?"
"You don,t know what it,s like being stuck here, spied on by those voyeurs in black coats!"
"I can,t even fart without being graded!"
"Think that,s fun?"
You gotta be kidding.
What do you think I do?
I work all afternoon.
You sit on your fat ass and push buttons.
"That,s all you,re good for."
Here come the insults!
",Fat ass, and all that."
"Listen, I,ve got things to say, and I mean it."
"I,ve about had it with this experiment!"
"I,m fed up living with you."
"- Why,d you come then?"
I never forced you!
You did!
I was supposed to go to Canada.
Who wanted to do this?
Who stopped me from going to Canada?
Who stopped me from acting?
"Admit it, it was you."
"Now you say you didn,t want to come here?"
- I did it for you.
"- You,re such a liar!"
You were glad to come!
"What,s more, we,re gonna get tossed out, and it,s all your fault."
I've got three kids.
Shut up.
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.
"Dawkins, you're surrounded."
Drop your weapon or we will fire.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon now.
Fire.
What the hell is this?
His mouth is glued shut.
This isn't Dawkins.
"Flight 106, arriving from Los Angeles, please proceed to baggage carousel number two."
Commander McGarrett?
"This is about my sister, isn't it?"
She disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom which is a federal offense.
So we arrested her soon as she landed.
Great.
Jail?
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette.
"Okay, officer."
I think we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
- Let me check with my supervisor.
- Thank you.
"I'm sorry, I messed up."
"I missed you at dad's funeral, Mary."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
I was actually afraid that he would kill me.
He finished...
"Got up, and, um..."
Said goodbye.
And i said bye.
That was it.
"Oh, my god."
"But he gave me my ziggy, so..."
Have you talked to anybody about this?
Like a therapist or a counselor or someone?
You're the first person i've ever told.
"Oh, honey."
"There was a point where i thought that i had moved on,"
"That i had worked through it and whatnot,"
"But, no."
I know that i'll never be over it.
"But i know that i have to keep moving forward, you know?"
That kid is--
He's gonna have a good life.
But the name of his father
Is not going on that fucking poster board.
You're never gonna believe this.
Hey.
The theme for the school party
Is elvis presley and audrey hepburn.
"Oh, dear god, no."
Exactly.
Where's amabella?
She's in her room.
I'm admiring how beautiful...
"Remember after the remodel, we just walked around,"
Staring at how perfect everything was?
... you'dforgetwhogot you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur...
-... offtheCanarsieLine?
-Are you crazy?
A spur is $1 20 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps..."
... wecan'taffordit.
Then you'll have to forget the whole thing.
I love the second-act opener.
Then you won't wanna miss it.
"""""This was a real nice clambake. """""
I'm building up my lOUs with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop...
... orI won'tsupporthim  for re-election.
And the off-ramp?
Next year.
-lt's already in my budget.
We treat her in all possible ways.
But she'd better be taken to a hospital.
-Where is she?
- Overthere.
-Was it what you wanted to tell me?
-Yes.
Let's go.
"Oh, Lord."
Why are you keeping her here?
At this time everyone is hiding theiryoung maidens.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
"OK, I'll send Mikhail over."
Do you recognize this buffoon?
"Yes, it is the guywho used to dance around with an officer's cap on."
Do not shoot.
Let's playwith him.
Wait!
The onlything l do not need now is a bullet in my back.
What a bastard.
Can you imagine that I was shot at bythis sniper again.
He has made a hole in my vodka canister.
Not much of a marksman.
-But the remains ofthis vodka seem to be inside you.
- l hate losing such good things to the wind.
Do not breathe myway.
Wow!
"Well, some people are charmed against bullets and some -for luck."
Right?
"-Do not worry, Olya."
-What are you talking about?
It is a question oftime.
"We'll kill him, be it me or not."
Kat's accident...
Casey.
"Why did you become a priest, father?"
Was... was there...?
Your grandmother.
That's right.
El Papa Mexicano.
I love that story.
"Yes, um a story."
My parents split up when I was... quite young.
"My father, never saw much of him."
So I lived with my mom.
"My friends were mostly... well, her friends, adults."
"Always moving, always changing schools."
It was when we lived in D.C. that... they called it a nervous breakdown.
Except it wasn't a breakdown.
You know how sometimes kids have an imaginary friend?
I had one.
"To me, he looked like a... little red bird."
He could do just about anything.
Correction.
He could make me do... just about anything.
At first he made me feel special.
Then...
I can't remember most of it.
Thankfully.
"Post-traumatic amnesia, it's called."
"Afterwards, I just wanted to move on with my life, put it behind me."
"But my mother, she was always finding new ways to use my story to make a buck."
"""This is the path God gave us, sweetie, use it."""
But I...
I ran away from all that.
We were playing pinochle.
It's a rough game.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Since you want us to speak up, there was a man removed from this barracks last night."
A Lieutenant Dunbar.
We'd appreciate your looking into it.
That's if they haven't shot him yet.
Why was the man arrested?
Sabotage.
He blew up a train.
"They'd have to prove that, wouldn't they?"
Isn't that what the Geneva Convention says?
You can't just take a man and shoot him.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Of course you did.
Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar.
The S.S. is running around in circles.
The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people.
And von Scherbach has caught the fish.
"Most amusing, isn't it?"
Uh-uh.
You are being rude again.
I just wanna go to sleep.
Nine-thirty.
General von Pfeffinger will be at his desk by now.
Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
"Hauptkommando Berlin, General von Pfeffinger."
Dringend.
You'd oversee security across all of North America.
"More power, more authority."
You'd never have to set foot in the Quiet Room again.
"I have to get back to work, sir."
♪ [device beeps]
[exhales] Jesus.
You got a gut feeling about who did this?
I have someone in mind.
"Hey, didn't hear you come home last night."
I didn't.
I fell asleep in my car.
- You what?
- [chuckles softly]
You're working too hard.
"I know you want that promotion, but don't kill yourself for a swimming pool."
You're right.
"I'm sorry, did Ben Larson just concede that his job isn't the be-all end-all of everything?"
Maybe it's time I put us first instead.
Why don't you come home early tonight?
I'll be here.
Unless you want me to sleep in the car again.
[chuckles softly]
Um...
"Ben, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."
What?
[chuckles softly] What is it?
Um...
- [high-pitch squeal] - [groans]
Shit.
Migraine?
"Hydrate, aspirin, and caffeine."
- Lots of caffeine.
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know.
"You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?"
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There.
"Be a nice girl, now."
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
"If Daddy took a spoonful first himself, Baby might do a patty-cake for him."
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
"Annie, don't ever worry me like that again."
"There you are, you two."
I've got letters for both of you.
There.
Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"""Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure..."
"""of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a""..."
What's that?
"""...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine."
"""8:00 p.m. Friday."" That's tonight."
"I worried so about you, dear, while you were away."
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
"- No, I haven't, have I?"
He was a witness at the Chandler inquest.
"Maybe he wouldn't help, but you gotta start somewhere."
And he'd be fine.
"Mr. Louis Ord would be fine, just dandy."
"I felt like a fight, Father."
I felt like a fight.
"How many, sir?"
"You alone, f riend?"
I have a small table.
"The bar is good enough, thanks."
It looked like feeding time at the zoo.
All you needed was money to start with and bicarbonate of soda to finish.
- What'll it be?
- Rye and water.
- Plain water?
- Yeah.
"Here you are, sir."
"- Come here, sweetheart."
"- Yes, sir?"
Didn't you used to be a waiter here?
"Louis Ord, 45, single?"
"I seem to know your f ace, but the name--"
Remember a guy named Johnny?
"In this business you meet lots of Johnnies, sir."
You were a witness against this one.
He acted like a mine had gone off under his feet.
I hadn't seen a guy look that scared since jump training.
- Who are you?
- The name is Murdock.
- Capt. Murdock?
- How'd you know?
"- Johnny's told me about you, captain."
We have to work through this.
"- We have huge issues, Peter."
- All couples do.
I'm guessing our issues are pretty unique.
This...
This is really not the right time to talk.
- When is the right time?
- When it's not my dead husband's birthday.
Fair enough.
- I have to get back.
- I'll call you later.
Where is everybody?
"After Shane tells Silas that man is in the DEA,"
Silas tells Shane he's your boyfriend and you don't care about Judah no more.
"So he smashed the cake and run upstairs, and Silas go outside to fuck up the stucco with a basketball, and Andy go upstairs to get norched."
I eat from stress.
Shit.
Silas.
Silas.
- Talk to me.
- You're insane!
He's a fucking DEA agent!
Yes.
"Yes, he is, but it's okay."
He's okay with it.
So he's a crooked DEA agent.
Even better.
"Peter protects my business, Silas."
"Well, maybe now, but what happens when he breaks up with you?"
Or do you think you're so great that that's never gonna happen?
- What happens when he dumps you?
- He can't do anything to me.
- It's OK!
Say the same in smile madam
"I will slipper you, if you still follow me, idiot!"
Thank you.
Have I done what you said as it is?
You did improvising it.
- But why did I do it?
You till date have used brain for all the operations.
"Please just use the body for this, it would be enough."
"Hey Giri, send these photos immediately to P. R. O Venu."

We get 20%.
Is it the commission Mr. Mutyam?
- Discount Mr. Rathnam.
"[₹5,000with20% discount=₹4,000]"
This is with dry fruits and almonds.
It would be very good.
"Just ₹ 10,000."
"I think a lot would come, as discount Mr Mutyam."
"This too is bit expensive, but..."
Jayaraj's dark biography revealed!

Cheap tricks played by the opposition people.

Yes madam!
Sir is like fire.

The cafeteria's right this way.
They know me there.
I'll get us a good table.
- You would do that for me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"I'm very tight with Bertha, the lunchroom lady."
"Yeah, I once rescued a dolphin from her hair net."
"OK, maybe it'll last a few years."
"Yes, I'm acting principal now, and the pressures would be daunting for a man half my age."
Fortunately I have a vitality that belies my years.
I'm the only one who doesn't know how it's done.
"Listen, I think I found something that kind of works."
- What?
- This.
"Hi, Shawn."
- Wow.
From across the hall.
"- Yep, I got a 30-foot range."
"- What, you just jerk your head?"
- Watch again.
"I'm still young enough, I can do this twice in a row."
"Shawn, it's so strange."
I was just thinking about you.
And that's without conditioner.
"Cory, what is it?"
"- You were just drawn to me, weren't you?"
"- No, I thought you had head lice."
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm great."
"- Oh, good."
"- Hi, Topanga."
I was just thinking about you.
You ever seen 'em?
"""Eeeh!"""
"And the mom's like, ""What the fuck?"
"""Oh, my God, why don't you just listen?"
"Why don't you do what I tell you?"""
And the little kid get up all disrespectful.
"""I don't know!"""
"""How come you can't be a good mom, Margaret?"""
Gonna call the mom out by the first name.
I wish I would call my moms out by her first name.
"I would no longer have a mouth on my face, do you hear me?"
I'd be talking from a hole in my neck like Terrie from the smoking commercials.
You ever see her?

"""Hi."
"""My name Terrie."
"""And I'm a smoker."
"""And you put on your wig, put in your teeth,"
"""and go about your day."
"I'm a smoker."""
A what?
"""A smoker."""
A mimosa?
"""A smoker!"""
I'm sorry.
"But for everybody who has seen that commercial, that is not just cigarettes."
"That's meth, nigga."
That's what that is.
"Oh, oh!"
"Oh, I would love to see her drinking from a water fountain."
I would love it.
You want a piece a this?

"Oh, that's good, that's good."
"Yeah, shoot that guy in the face, Kyle."
"Yeah, nice."
You guys...this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away.
I think we better just get on-board with it.
What?

Are you crazy?
"No way, dude."
We promised each other we would never do that.
- Remember?
- Yeah!
"I know, but I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school."
We're losing all our credibility.
"I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now."
"Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake!"
What so bad about hanging out with me?
"Shut up, Scott Malkinson."
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.
"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes."
Don't make fun of my diabetes.
I'm Scott Malkinson.
That's a lot of cash for a corporal that barely clears 30 thou a year.
You think it's dirty?
"It's gotta be, right?"
"I mean, why else would Jared hide this much cash in his garage?"
"Plus, where'd he get it?"
Maybe he stole it from a bank.
This looks like a dye pack went off.
"Hmm, apparently our marine isn't as squeaky-clean as he seems."
"Well, only way to find out is to figure out where the cash came from."
FBI specializes in bank robberies.
"Maybe I'll send Gregorio the serial numbers, see if she can trace 'em."
Gregorio?
Aren't we supposed to leave her alone?
It's just a quick check.
It won't take her a minute.
"Yeah, uh-huh."
(imitating):
Uh-huh.

"Lasalle, you know these people?"
"Melody, what are you doing here?"

That's who I am!
Stay the hell away from my son!

"I will just have to take my frustration out... on your good friend, Sam, who is working here."
"Okay, I'll do it."
What do you think of our new owner?
Pretty tough broad.
"But, uh, I guess she has to be."
She's a cooler.
Serious?
Told ya.
Maybe I'm not a cooler.
Well played.
Only one guy's left Acme recently- a Richie Tomczak.
"Uh, but it was for medical reasons."
"His doctor said that he had some bad disease, only had a couple months to live."
"What did I ask you for, a medical report or address?"
"Uh, yes, sir."
An address.
Mr. Tomczak?
Richie?
Hey.
Holy-
I guess your doctor was right.
What did you tell the cops?
What do you think I told them?
I told them the truth.
"I mean, pretty close."
"Actually, I told them, uh, I went there to talk to Richie... about some possible counterfeiting problem we had."
"Anyway, I told them the door was unlocked."
Sit down.
So they'll focus on the murder.
Right.
You think Tomczak was involved with the chip counterfeiting?
There's a pretty good chance.
Regulations are regulations.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
"I'm fine, Dad."
- Elle.
- Yeah?
Don't ever call me Dad again.
"How do you think he'd feel about ""Mom""?"
"Let me know when you're going to do that, so I can run."
"Reid, you probably saved my life in there."
Probably?
I totally saved your life.
And I'm pretty certain that it was caught on tape.
You know what you said in there?
To Bryar?
That you know what it's like...
The guy was a delusional psychotic.
I was playing into his fantasy.
Go to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
All right?

She knows he was found in his grandfather's grave.

Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
"Except her dad was a doctor, so he jumped up to save her."
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor and bit it.
In front of everyone.
Do you remember that?
"Three stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week."
"Ha, ha."
"Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom."

We're not here.
Why?
Where did we go?

Damn.
"Hey, so, what made you and your mom decide to stay in town?"
"Oh, she got this business opportunity."
She's gonna open up a little store.
It's always been her dream.
"So, yeah, we're staying."
And I'm thinking about going back to high school.
- So you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Enough of homeschooling.
"You know, I'd like to be a normal teen for once."
But I have to ask my mom first.
She'll have an opinion.
I wish you were there now.
I have to write a paper.
I was thinking about squeezing one more out on the vampires of Mystic Falls.

Sorry!
He is always late!
It's unprofessional!
I'm leaving!
Alex!
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
We are going to solve the murder case at the castle
They're singing too slow.
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"- Goni, not now!"
"Alex, you should've done a full turn by now."
"But you're late, no wonder he is all mixed up."
I don't understand what's going on.
Are you asleep?
Can I give you a hug?
You know that I'm stressed.
The play is opening in 3 days and so many things aren't ready.
That's no excuse.
You're right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I didn't mean to bother you.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
"So are we friends again, Gonki Galonki?"
Did Gonki Galonki enjoyed the rehearsal?
"Yes, yes, yes?"
"No, no, no?"
What loud?
Obnoxious?
Forceful. I'm Patty Chase.
- H i.
- Angela's mom?
Angela.
Rayanne talks about her all the time.
She's in love with her.
She wants to be Angela.
Really?
Gosh they seem so different.
You know kids.
They find one person and they just can't get enough of them.
Like being in love only they are not allowed to have sex.
Right.
"No, don't you remember there would be like this one person..."
"who had like perfect hair, or perfect breasts, or they were just so funny..."
and you just wanted to eat them up.
J ust live in their bed and just be them.
Like everybody else was in black and white and that person was in color.
Rayanne thinks Angela is in color.
Major color.
Thanks.
"So, how is Rayanne handling this whole incident?"
- She's great. I'm the basket case.
- Angela's just the same.
"'Who's going to shoot me with this body, Mom?"
' She says.
They think they're immortal.
And they have other things in mind.
Speaking of which Jordan is unbelievable.
Your daughter has complete taste.
Any responsibility I might have is to my clients.
- So there is something?
- You trying to trick me?
I can't have this conversation.
- lf there's a conversation to be had...
- Ready!
"All right, see ya, Mom."
Mm-hmm.
See ya.
"All right, Dad, let's go."
"[Jessie] lf l get something long, I couldn't dance."
"[Lily] I love this, you don't need a longer one."
- What about yours?
- l'll find it a week after the wedding.
I'm just going to go on the record right now to say I really don't like salmon.
Would you look at how beautiful your daughter is?
- Don't I know it.
- Dad hates all fish.
- That is untrue.
- [Eli] Just have pizza.
- We can have pizza for the kids.
- Are we getting paid?
- Can we pay you not to play?
- [knock on door]
"Since Eli's friends are playing, would you like to invite your friends?"
"- No, thank you."
- Somebody want to get the door?
I didn't know planning a wedding would be such a big deal.
- You'll find out soon.
- l'm not getting married till I'm 40.
- You mean when you're old?
- Sorry.
My barefoot Cinderella.
Jesse!
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
"Singers, actors, just once a kid that wants to be a doctor."
-Hi.
-Hey.
Listen I've been thinking.
Being with you.
It's a real headache.
"And it's hard, it's complicated."
"I mean, it's a lot of work."
I'm starting to think the song outside my door.
Was a little bit misleading.
I'm not finished.
Being with you might be all those things.
But the only thing worse is not being with you.
Did that get to you like it got to me?
"Yeah, a little."
Guys with guitars.
Why do the ladies find us so dang irresistible?
Are you sure you're ready for all this?
I was ready for all this the first time I met you.
I just didn't know it.
Now come on I think I owe you pizza and a movie.
-I mean if you're hungry.
-Are you kidding?
Right now I'm torn between kissing you.
And checking the bottom of your shoe to see if you stepped in a donut.
Let me just ditch Hannah.
What about your omelet?
Sorry dad.
"Oh, no."
"I'm... too sleepy, I guess."
You ask Joe.
"Joe is probably hungry, though."
"Joe, you talk with Mother and dads."
They can help anybody.
"You see, mother and dads, Joe isn't very well."
Sometimes he doesn't realize what he's saying.
"But it's all right, Joe."
You can talk with mother and dads.
They're wonderful.
"You've probably never had anyone like them, because you wouldn't have had all the trouble you've had."
"Every now and then, Joe thinks he has a son like me."
He even calls me Joey.
It was funny.
"I wasn't afraid of him,"
But...
He's a good scout.
He's ok.
Good night.
"Can I get you something to eat, Joe?"
Thank you for bringing him back.
"With all my heart, I thank you."
"You are proud of him, aren't you?"
"He is the kind of a boy you really hoped for, isn't he?"
"Isn't he, Joe?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that.
"He ain't the kind of kid I'd put my money on, exactly."
"You got him conned into one way of thinking, so what the heck?"
"Let him stay that way, for all I give a darn."
"He didn't swallow what I told him, anyway."
- You don't know that?
"- Oh, my God."
- I don't think so.
- You tell the story.
"It was just someone driving by and went, ""Denzel."""
"A car full, of..."
"No, there were like six people."
"They were like, ""Denzel."""
And they were drunk.
This was probably a Friday.
I remember a lot of people getting out of bars this night.
"Friday night, 7th Street, Avenue A."
"- Yeah, at like 1 a.m."
- We're in the middle of the action.
- Did you happen to think...?
- Hello.
Not a real punch.
"Oh, I was so terrified I would hit you by accident."
"There was a take where you were supposed to, but you didn't."
Pete asked me to slap you and I couldn't do it.
- I started to cry a little bit.
- I saw you two having that discussion.
I was like:
"""She's gonna hit me."
"I'm ready for it."""
It's gonna be cool.
It'll be a good reaction.
That was the only time I started to cry a little because I felt like...
- You actually started crying?
- I was hiding it.
- At the thought of hitting me?
- Just the thought of hitting Michael without him knowing.
Here.
"-Rodney, I'm going to cry."
"-No, and don't say anything silly."
"Betty, you know how glad I am that I married you?"
"Oh, Rodney, I hope so!"
Your dad is over there.
Go say good-bye to him.
"Go on, go say good-bye to him."
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.
Take care of yourself.
"And, whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Say, do me a favor, dad."
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask you, but she might need it."
-I'll keep an eye on her.
-The draftees assemble over here.
Come right in close.
"Now... as chairman of the Draft Board, let me say that all of us regret... having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
"Please, try to come back safely to your homes."
We've prepared some gift packages.
"Step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees, in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
"Hubba, hubba, hubba!"
"Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the good-byes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
I need a sergeant by dawn.
"I'll never make a proper sergeant, sir."
So?
I'll never make a proper officer.
"Indeed you will, sir."
You'll make a grand... killing officer
Killing officer?
"God love you, sir."
I thought you would have known.
"There are two kinds of officers, sir."
Killing officers and murdering officers.
Killing officers are poor old buggers who get you killed by mistake.
"Murdering officers are mad, bad old buggers who get you killed on purpose."
"For a reason, for a country, for a religion."
Maybe even for a flag.
"You see that Major Hogan, sir?"
That's what I'd call a murdering officer
Teresa!
"Oh, that Hogan."
He's a murdering officer all right
"Damn it, Hogan!"
I wish I were down there.
So do I.
So do I. But our first duty is to protect Mrs Parker.
"That's my girl, Teresa."
Mmmm!
"Rica, huh?"
Tengo otra muy buena para ti.
Jesus!
No!
"Mr Sharpe, sir."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
I used to be in charge of all this shit.
And now...
"I'm gonna have to hurt you, Henry, but it's for your own good, mate."
"Just give me your arm, son."
Hey!
Shit!
"Henry, it's Jimmy."
"We've only got few moments until they won't let us escape, mate."
"Okay, just give me your arm."
"Okay, just relax."
Here he is.
Here he is.
Bingo!
This little fucker is how they've been tracking you.
Goodbye.
In a few moments... your mechanical parts are gonna start shutting down.
Your friend Akan's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.
"Slick handles all Akan's cops, guns, real estate ?"
", lot of shit."
This (helpful?
) dot on the map.
It is Slick's place.
"All you gotta do is break in there, kill him, open up his rib-cage, take out his beating heart... and fucking eat it."
I'm kidding!
"I'm kidding, don't you fucking eat his heart ."
Under his heart is his charge pump?
Yeah?
Bring that to me.
Use this and I'll contact you on this.

Great jacket!

- I didn't hit you in your head.
To my son.
I hope you pursue all your dreams and your desires... that you have within you.
I love you very much.
"- Ooh, that is so nice."
- Whatever.
"Oh, no.!"
"God, we thank you for this day, Lord."
"And we ask you to go with junior, Lord."
"And we thank you, Lord."
"Go with him as he try to better his education, Lord."

Then I won't go to Stanford until next year.
But you've been thinking about this for like forever.
Yeah and didn't you just order the official Stanford coffee mug.
Mouse pad combo pack?
"Don't you have an omelet to make, mister?"
[Sighs] No wonder Oliver's always on tour.
Boy's not as dumb as I thought he was.
[Sighs]
"Look, you're right, I mean, I have always wanted to go there."
But I've always wanted to go there with you.
And you know I can do that next year.
But it's such a sacrifice.
"Yeah, but look what you've done for me."
"I mean, you've taken me into your house."
"-Uh, whose house?"
-Omelet!
Yes ma'am.
And you let me be Lola.
I get to ride around in limos and private jets.
And live the rock star life.
"I mean, I can never repay you for all of that."
-True.
-That didn't require a response.
Sorry.
Go on.
Look the point is I just want to do this for you.
So please let me.
-You really are the best friend ever.
-I know.
"Aw, if grown men could only hug like teenage girls."
There'd be no more wars.
"When I ask, do you wanna dance?"
That's great.
This-- this is nothing.
I hope not.
This is unexpected.
"Yes, well, uh, turns out that Bill is gonna have to work late again."
Oh?
"Uh, so, we won't be able to use these ballet tickets, which is why I'm giving them to you and Stephanie."
"Well, that's, uh-- that's very thoughtful of you."
"Well, I can see the two of you are really hitting it off, and since I feel I had some hand in this,"
"- and, uh--"
- Wait.
You were watching us?
"No, I--"
"I was just getting the mail, Paul."
I can't help it if Stephanie's laugh travels like a hyena's.
Your friend Stephanie.
"All I'm saying is, uh, please take the tickets."
I will.
"And, uh, I better call Stephanie right away, see if she's available."
So... cross your fingers for us.
Fingers crossed.
Enjoy the evening.
We will.
Oh.
You're home.
As usual.
"I supposed you want dinner, as well."
"I, uh, haven't even given it a thought."
Where-- where have you been?
I was just next door offering Paul our ballet tickets.
"Uh, well, it turns out he's dating someone."
Stephanie.
And you do not like your mom.
- And I do not even.
- I had not had sex forever.
OK.
- It's about female empowerment.
- OK.
Women do not need self-empowerment.
Stop it.
No...
- Oh my God!
- I am going to vomit!
- Why?
- Who was that?
- Hold on!
- No.
- Did you fart?
- No you?
- No.
- Donald that keep under wraps.
What's wrong with you bastards?
Comedies are more difficult than dramas.
"So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again and then I did, in a photo, in a briefing room and I was being sent to meet him with a gun."
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
What's he saying?
"This man's a young Ronan Murphy, a suspect shot by Daniel Waldron during Operation Damson."
"What, they knew each other?"
Did you fabricate the improper relations between you
- and Detective Sergeant Arnott?
- No.
- Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you?
"We've got the Carson wedding, the Dankowski party, two funerals, and Jill calls in sick today of all days."
"Sara, I'm sorry, I have to handle this."
There isn't anybody else.
"- Mom, what about..."
"- Glynn, do they want roses in this?"
"Judy took that order, ask her."
"Mom, this is the most important day of my life."
You have to be there.
You promised.
I know.
"Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?"
You're next.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Before you audition.
Is there anything you'd like to say about your contemporary piece?
"No, it's pretty self-explanatory."
Did you have a good ride?
I slept through most of it.
I guess you've got stuff.
Baggage?
Three suitcases.
One big one.
Sorry I had to split so soon after the funeral.
"If I could have gotten out of that gig, I would have hung around longer."
Guess it was pretty tough leaving all your friends.
Here we are.
Put them anywhere.
I'll give you the grand tour.

Hi...
"Oh, no, not again."
"Uh, I think it's an allergic reaction to something I ate, you know."
"Come on, come on, come on."
- My throat's starting to close up.
Oh!
- It sounds like you're dying.
"Rose, it's the third time this month."
Are you sure you're not allergic to me?
"Barry, please don't think that."
That's a terrible thing to think!
I'm gonna be blacklisted at every restaurant in Manhattan for not keeping reservations.
"Why don't you call me next week, okay?"
If you still want to.
- Sure.
Feel better.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Think I should start with a joke?
"Oh, you're serious?"
"No, I don't think so."
There's not enough time.
- For what?
- For you to develop a sense of humor.

I got them all.
You didn't get plain?
I didn't know there was plain.

So who removed the wire from Bob Keaton ?
I don't know.
Still searching.
Just switched over from a local criminal database.
"Okay, take your time."
"H, I've been thinking about this crime scene."
"The wire, the scene being processed..."
"It's above my pay scale, isn't it ?"
Maybe all of ours.
Who's this ?
"""David Park."""
This guy's not a criminal.
He's a GS-14.
David Park has government clearance.
Let's have Homicide bring him in.
"Thank you, Eric."
Mr. Park.
Yeah ?
My name is Lieutenant
Horatio Caine.
Caine.
"Yes... now, I understand you work for the federal government."
Census Bureau.
I count people.
"Now, a GS-14 clearance is a little high on the food chain for a census taker, don't you think ?"
"Again,"
I count people.
"Well, I guess that could explain why I recovered your fingerprint from my victim."
And that would also tell me that you removed his surveillance wire.
So that's how you tracked me down.
I want to say that it's all A's fault but I'm the one who gave your mom that ticket.
I don't like knowing what I'm capable of.
"Yeah, but you didn't go through with it."
Okay?
That's the difference.
"It was a silent auction, and a private book-signing and coffee with the author."
"I liked his early work, that book about the teacher in Newark."
Do you want coffee with Leonard Addams and an autographed book?
Count me in.
What was the name of the Newark book?
Loose Leaf.
"That was good, wasn't it?"
"Well, why don't you come with us, Ella?"
How many people can you bring?
- As...
As many as I want.
"- Come with us, Ella."
"All right, I will."
"You know, Aria might be right about this."
Toby does have every reason to give us a hard time.
"I suppose, but that's just not the feeling that I got from talking to him."
- Do you know what I mean?
"- Yeah, I do."
- Hey.
- Hey.
What is with you and the Artful Dodger?
- Who?
- Caleb.
Thought the thing at the meet was a one-off.
- It was.
- We just saw you talking to him.
You gave him something that looked like a wet mitt.
What a god damn waste.
I want Lanagan Pike in the back of my car.
As soon as you can.
They're going to kill me!
"- Take it easy, Mr. Pike..."
- Are you kidding?
"Hanging a protest sign off a coal plant smokestack,"
I got thumped so bad I couldn't see out of this eye for 3 days.
- Just breathe.
"- Look at what he did to you, and you're a doctor!"
Stay still.
"I told her I was coming down, she came after me anyway."
"She didn't know what she was doing, how to walk up there."
We both fell right through the floor.
She shouldn't have been there.
You were trespassing.
"She was doing her job, too."
"OK, bend your knee."
It was an accident.
"I'm going to keep you here for a few hours to monitor you, check for toxicity in your blood."
OK?
OK.

Dr. Young to the NICU.
We need to start questioning him.
And I need to be sure he's medically clear before I release him.
Excuse me.
What's happening with the jackass?
- Excuse me?
- The kid who caused all this.
He's OK.
"I mean, he's not, but his injuries are."
Thank you so much!
- Mom really did that?
"- Oh, she did!"
Wow!
I did not see that coming.
What about you?
- Are you OK?
"- Oh, I couldn't be better!"
Even with the town not getting behind the mosque
- Like we thought they would?
- I'll bring them around.
"And you getting arrested for that whole non-bomb thing, plus Fred Tupper trashing you on the radio?"
- I couldn't believe that!

"Those exact same things happened to me, and look how that turned out."
- It turned out pretty well.
- I think we're right on course.

[ knock!
knock!
] What's going on?
Charles called.
My cell battery died.
I'm waiting for him to call back.
Have you been waiting here all weekend?
- Yes!
"- Oh, Ann!"
Why does he have to live in Ottawa?
Why does he have to be engaged to somebody else?
Why is he such a stupid jerk?
I still do.
Huge.
"So, are you gonna have sex with her?"
I was her mentor.
She was my mentee.
I am not going to take advantage of a girl that looks up to me.
"Dude, God has dropped a porn star into your lap, okay?"
Don't disappoint Him.
He can be a jealous and a vengeful God.
Mmm.
Amen.
I am officially done with this conversation.
"Aaron, I am with you."
"And right now, you can still influence her life in a totally positive way."
And it would be creepy and weird if you slept with her.
"Hey, hey, hey."
We all agree that it would be creepy and weird.
That's why we want him to do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come on.
It happened on a doctors without borders trip in Indonesia.
A lovely woman was a few weeks from giving birth to a child with a heart defect.
I operated on the baby in utero.
"Fortunately, both the mother and child survived and are now thriving."
I found out later she named the baby after me.
Very flattering.
"Aw, little Dr. Lonsdale."
"Um, Everett, actually."
I know.
That was a joke.
Oh.
-l was playing with Joe Horton.
-Horton;
He's a bad boy.
-You wanna look out for him.
"-l did, in one hand, especially."
"We both drew one, only I drew first."
Got him right in the belly.
You mean you shot him;
Not conclusively.
He's gonna live.
What happened;
How'd the fight start;
"I had a few too many, I guess."
I don't remember.
I never saw you that drunk.
Then I'm a liar.
-How long were you in jail;
-Not long.
"Who got you out, McCurtin;"
Hasn't he always before;
Yeah.
When are you going to tell me how the fight started;
"I told you, I was drunk."
"Now, if you'd rather I hadn't come home, I'll get out."
"I'd rather you didn't lie, Brock."
"Come on, let's go into town and face whatever's got to be faced."
Not me. I'm going to Denver.
You're going to Salt Fork and get this thing over with.
Then you're coming back here.
And it might be a good idea if you spent a little more time here in the future.
You can't run me anymore.
I wasn't cut out for living your way and I'm sick of trying.
Everything is going absolutely according to plan.
Right now the most important thing to me
Is sending jake home.
It's mind-boggling.
"Like, I just wanna punch the guy."
"I can't do it, so I'm gonna punch him mentally"
"And just beat down his spirits, drive him crazy."
He's gonna go nuts.
"He's gonna try to talk his way out of everything,"
And there's nothing he can do.
"Peace, bro."
Jake's a joke.
I'll be damned if I lose the next competition to him.

Yeah!

Whoo-hoo!

But winning the competition is still very important.
"Very, very important."
What the hell was I thinking?
You said it we're not gonna get caught.
Hi!
"Lizzi, what happened?"
We were worried.
I've been running around like a crazy person.
Think you gave me the wrong address.
There's no book store on 3rd.
Oh my God!
Did I say 3rd?
I meant 13th.
I feel terrible.
"No, it's alright!"
I found a store that gave me a 40% book discount.
I'm so excited right now.
Did you tell the girls?
They loved the idea.
I'm gonna go in a girls' room and freshen up and we've to start planning.
ASAP cause I wanna be involved in every single detail.
Partez!
You're having a party?
Sure you've got enough liquor there?
"You know, smuggling liquor for a party."
"It isn't just a violation for you, it's gonna reflect poorly on all of us."
"Then it's a good think we only got diet soft drinks, Evian."
You gotta be kidding me.
You got him working for you now?
You with them?
"They're my friends, that's all."
"Actually, he's thinking 'bout pledging with us."
Just realized the Kappa Taus are a whole lot more fun than the Omega Chis.
Is that true?
"Turn them over, George."
I wanna see them.
Come on.
I'm calling.
- What do you got?
- Gary Fogel never had cancer!
"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you for me when in fact, it was an unauthorised hi."
- You didn't say hi?
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what you came to tell me?
- Correct.
- You never said hi.
- Correct.
"- You still like me, don't you?"
- Correct.
What?
"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day."
How can you say that I still like you when I didn't even say hi to you?
Coming down to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Jake...
The doctors thought he had cancer but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
"- So, what was wrong with him?"
- Nothing.
He's been lying to me for two months?
- That's right.
- What kind of person is this?
"There's one other person who might do something like this, and that's you."
- Well...
- I don't even think you could do it.
"No, I could do it."
"- Yeah, I guess you could."
- Come on.
That will allow me to climb up into the air ducts.
(whistles)
"Holt, this is where you come in."
You're gonna create a diversion.
Can I do Church Lady?
Don't care.
I'm gonna do Church Lady.
Isn't that special?
(organ music plays)
"That will allow me to drop into Lester's laundry cart, and then we'll all rendezvous at the nurses' desk, where we'll sign out because this is a voluntary facility, and we can leave any time we want."
"See you later, Mr. Brown."
Or not.
Totally up to you.
"Sorry, Cleve-bro."
We're staying.
What?
We're making some real progress.
Okay.
(panting)
(ship's horn blares)
Dirty-Rassen-frassenpercalumin chabadamin-back-rackalacka!
"Ooh, a Jet Ski!"
Spring break!
Cleve gone wild!
Ahh!
(ship's horn blares)
"Aw, hell!"
I keep waking up tied to a bed.
I feel like Hugh Jackman's cabaña boy.
You should be so lucky.
You were pulled from the water by Somali pirates.
"And they kill everyone who isn't of use to them,"
From the programme.
Tubby Baker.
"Very pleased to meet you, Pauline."
"Oh, don't be."
I'm only a lowly secretary.
Enid is the PA.
She has the desk planner and the intercom.
And what have I got?
Some Handy Andies and a plastic lemon.
We're on lemon and hot water.
"I told you, we're slimming."
How's it going?
This week?
Not great.
"I can have 7,000 calories a week, and, so far, I've had 3,800 and it's only Tuesday, but, hey, two days on potted meat and water biscuits."
That could level me back off.
"Speaking of chips, where are you taking her?"
You're not escorting her to lunch?
Of course!
"Pauline, it's Tuesday!"
I was thinking of having a sandwich.
Can I interest you in sitting on a bench?
In the square?
No.
I don't have time.
"No, fair enough."
"Well, I won't clog up the mighty wheels of commerce."
"Very pleased to have met you, Pauline."
"Enid's got a lot more leeway than me calorie-wise, she can have a jacket potato and a yoghurt."
I don't think I've ever had a yoghurt.
"No, you don't look like you've ever had one."
No offence.
"What I mean is, not in person."
I see.
He's just heard about you.
We have an Internet romance.
The Internet.
Really?
It'll be six months in April.
You're my second client who's found someone on the Internet.
"There was a girl from Goias State, not bad-looking... rather provincial, who married a French computer professor."
Gary is a visual artist.
An artist makes a lot of money in the US.
Americans respect artists.
Yesterday he told me that he loved me.
I get goose bumps talking about these things.
"6'2"", waist-length hair."
Any tattoos?
He only mentioned one:
a huge tribal symbol on his back.
You're going to meet this Gary.
I'm going to give you a discount I wouldn't give my own mother.
Fifteen percent.
Thank you.
""" Marjorie and Jo-Jo live and work in New York City."
They have been married for one year.
"- They have a big dog called Rex."""
"- Settle, people."
"""They live in a very big apartment on Fifth Avenue."""
Fifth.
Shut up!
"Shut up, guys."
"She said, ""Shut up!"""
- Thank you.
Tomorrow's another day.
Time to go to the bar.
-Karaoke?
"Sure, karaoke."
He comes and goes His roads nobody knows
A traveling man he is
Nice to see you normal like us.
Without the superman stuff.
"Thank you for the dark motions, Jakki."
"Next, the indisputable local tango queen:"
Marjukka!
You came like a flame that day
"Charming, intoxicating"
"You came to me, took my heart I was yours, all yours..."
Look who's here!
The mad loser.
You're sitting in my chair.
Your place is in the back.
Never knew the perils Of the burning flame
Never knew it could bum The happiness to ashes
I looked into the flame Brilliant and burning
You were my only one My universe
Always on my mind
Operation Ostrich is off the ground.
Did you take the scooter?
"-Yeah, I told him I'm moving."
Are you sure he didn't notice anything?
-He never does.
How's the virginity barometer?
No change.
Right.
You know what?
"Yes, sir."
Commander...
"Don't worry, sir."
I will go.
"No, that's crazy."
Woo-song...
"Commander, let me go."
Lt. Suh can't go.
The Japanese will recognize him.
I will go instead.
You won't make it back alive.
"I know, sir."
Chun Woo-song...
It will make my wife and my son proud.
Confirm Chun Woo-song's position and go directly to the Field Marshal.
"Yes, sir."
Chun Woo-song!
Everything is riding on this letter.
This is our last chance to wipe out the enemy.
We will exact revenge for you and your family.
"I will sacrifice my life for the mission, sir."
What brings you here?
I have a request.
A request?
I will strike Konishi again on the 18th of this month.
Without Yu Jong and the ground forces?
That's right.
Are you proposing that you and I strike Wekyo alone?
No.
I'm asking you to make the Japanese think that Chosun Navy will attack Wekyo on the 18th.
"I know about our meetings with the Japanese, Admiral."
Tell them that I am preparing a full-force attack on the Wekyo.
Mine.
Kenzi?
Jenny?
- Yes?
- Hey.
You gotta hear this.
I was checking out Samir in our system.
"- What, he has a rap sheet?"
"- No, but Jenny does."
- Jenny?
- She was picked up a few weeks ago in the garage of Samir's office.
- No kidding.
- I checked with the arresting officers.
Samir told them that Jenny had become obsessed.
"He slept with her, but she became delusional."
Thought that they were having some sort of a love affair.
"What, so the entire relationship was in her head?"
That's nuts.
She's been stalking him for months.
"Begged us to keep quiet, didn't want his wife to find out."
- Which means what?
"- Look, our fox screen shows the wine Samir was drinking was laced with tranquilizers."
"Olivia did not have the presence of mind to drug him, Bo."
She's not our killer.
I think we have bigger problems.
Yeah?
Bo?
I found the head.
There's a note.
"""Beloved, I've taken steps to remove the obstacle between us."
Join me at the farm.
"We'll start our life together."""
[laughter]
That Carl is crazy.
The annual bridal sale...
- is now...
"- Max, hold my hand."
Open!
[all shouting]
"Ladies, ladies, one at a time."
Oh!
"Well, I may be limping down the aisle, but at least I won't be limping in something Swiffer might sell to dust off ceiling fans."
[woman screaming]
"Oh, my God, girl!"
here she comes!
Here she comes.
"My girl, Rhonda, had that dress first."
"Oh, your girl is gonna have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands."
"Hey, Max, Caroline!"
Try it on!
Follow me to the changing room.
"(Caroline) I'm never coming out in this dress, I'm scared."
"(Max) So on the count of one, two..."
Maybe it's not that bad.
(both) It's bad.
Okay.
"So you're telling me,"
"Versace got murdered, but no one's taken out whoever made these?"
I know.
I feel like Tweety Bird is gonna sue us for copyright infringement.
I feel like we should have giant toilet paper rolls under here.
"Well, maybe we'll like these better when we're out of this bright light."
"Max, we are the bright light."
"Ladies, you forgot the matching hats."
Whoa.
What...
What happened to your wrist?
"- Oh, it's an a-allergic reaction."
- So take it off.
"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close... to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
Better the sores weep than I.
"Hey, hold on."
That slut just got here.
How'd she get beer already?
- You see a ring on that finger?
- Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Are you saying that this invisibility thing means I might not be able to get beer?
I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee and bagels and rent.
- Rent?
- But not being able to get a beer?
Unacceptable.
Excuse me.
Hot girl coming through.
Oh.
Hmm.
"Three beers, please."
"Damn it, ring!"
"- Oh, yeah, baby."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Later, you should totally go out and buy a switchblade."
"- Mmm, sure."
"While I'm out, maybe Daddy picks up some diapers and a little mild salsa..."
- because we're low.
- Oh.
Mmm.
That's a bad one.
"If it's no easier by morning, I'll call Dr Campbell."
Don't be such an old woman.
'Now a special announcement.
The German government announced tonight their response to a British communication and gave their proposals for a settlement of the Polish problem.'
Where's Dad?
- In front of the fire.
Kettle done?
- Not for an hour or so.
- Right.
"I've come to a decision, Ma."
What about?
Enlisting.
What?
- All the lads are talking about it.
"Well, you can't enlist."
You can't stop me when I'm 17.
- You're forgetting one thing -
Neither can Dad.
- I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about your condition.
"If Doc Campbell gave me the all-clear, so will the navy."
The navy?
"- As soon as I'm 17, I'm going to join the navy."
Have you told your dad any of this?
"No, he fell asleep before I could."
"My mind's made up, Ma."
It's what I want.
I'll see you in the morning.
We need to order a new stethoscope.
I suspected it was on the way out.
Just tried it on myself and it appears I'm already dead.
Neil or Arjun?
Neil is fine.
Let's not complicate this case any further.
Drink?
"No thanks, I'm working."
To murder.
Murder?
Even you believe that Kabir Malhotra was murdered?
People and their strange habits.
For instance... when people are having a drink and smoking at the same time... they always hold the glass in the non-dominant hand.
"Like Kabir Malhotra, I too am left-handed."
Oh my God!
You're right.
And if he was left-handed... why would he pull the trigger with his right hand?
He was murdered.
"But, who did it?"
There's a well known Latin phrase.
'Cui bono?
'
Who benefits?
'
Exactly.
We need to re-examine the evidence.
I'll see you at the airport in an hour.
Why are you doing this for Kabir Malhotra?
I'm not doing it for him.
"Neil, this is Mark and Aiden."
They're on the Malhotra case too.
Here are the details on the will you asked for.
"Oh, and Samara came by... she dropped of the blue prints and documents that you wanted."
I still can't believe that you are a police officer.
I swear.
Marrakech.
I need two thousand dollars.
Listen to me.
I brought some people to see you.
Look.
I got these pieces.
They're good pieces Marcus.
Indiana!
"Yes the museum will buy them as usual, no questions asked - yes they are nice."
They are worth at least the price for a ticket to Marrakech.
But the people I brought are important - they are waiting.
What people?
The army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
Wouldn't tell me what they want.
What do I want to see them for?
What am I
- In trouble?
"Yes, Dr. Jones."
We have heard a great deal about you.
Have you?
"Professor of archaeology, expert on the occult."
"And uh, how does one say it - obtainer of rare antiquities."
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You would be more comfortable.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"And you studied under Professor Ravenwood, at the University of Chicago?"
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Ah, just rumors really."
That's great.
Beautiful.
Some deal I made.
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.
You'll live better here than most people outside.
Some deal!
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth.
"He engineered it, Michael."
When Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.
He thought you double-crossed him.
"Our people with the detectives said he was half dead, scared and shouted that you'd turned on him."
"They already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder one and more."
The FBI has him airtight.
"He's on an army base, 24 hour guards."
We can't get to him.
You've opened yourself to five counts of perjury.
What about Fredo?
What does he know?
"He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him."
"Roth, he played this one beautifully."
I'm going to talk to Fredo.
"I haven't got a lot to say, Mike."
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark.
I didn't know all that much.
What about now?
Is there anything you can help me out with?
Anything you can tell me now?
GIBBS:
"Ziva, take Elliott with you."
Come on.
(whispers):
Game show host.
Did you see that?
Is she serious about this whole game show host thing?
"Oh, the doc does not mess around when it comes to peoples' personality traits."
Gibbs smiled at her.
I saw it.
And the way he walked to the elevator-- it was...
It was what?
Bouncy.
Gibbs' walk definitely had a bounce to it.
"Yeah, happy feet."
I saw it.
Feet are the most honest part of a human's body.
"Eyes are not bad indicators, as well."
I saw Ryan's dilate when Gibbs walked into her office the other day.
"So, what do you think this means?"
"Oh, interest, excitement, you know."
It's a neurovascular response.
"The fact is, the only one who knows what a person is thinking is the person who's thinking it."
I thought you PsyOps agents could interpret everything.
No.
"And even if we could, we wouldn't tell you."
Mm.
"So, Dr. Ryan-- is she...?"
The best.
The annoying big sister I never had.
"I'd do anything for her, and if Gibbs hurts her, I'll kill him."
(laughs)
"So, it IS raining..."
Huh?
"Oh, dear..."
What's wrong?
There!
"Hello, hello..."
Hello.
Huh...?
"The Middle East, Europe and the Communist Bloc...?"
They never give up.
They can't help it.
They don't have a grasp of the whole situation.
It's no time to be following old dreams.
Exactly.
"All things are in flux, and times change."
"Just as horse-mounted peoples linked East and West, and great nations that ruled the seas linked the world, it is our duty to expand the world."
"This Foundation is here for ""war"" and ""revolution."""
"You understand that, don't you, Yonamine?"
I understand.
"Shall we get into our main agenda, Yonamine?"
What is the suggestion you have?
Please have a look at this...
A support robot?
Yes.
"I am the ESR-M48 cognitive robot, Romlin."
I was bui;t to assist the Dangaioh pilots.
Have you heard about this?
I'm in Maintenance.
I don't know much about the Development Team.
Here is my certification.
"Since Dr. Kazamaki's busy,"
I am here today to give you three a physical.
Christian is the powerhouse.
That's not what I expected.
Christian...
You haven't made many souffles?
No.
Yours...
Was also delicious.
Congratulations.
Upstairs.
Ohh!
Ohh!
"Man, he's still here."
Why?
Why?
Send him home.
(Christine) Christian is staying.
What the hell?
"(Gordon) Those souffles were phenomenal, all four of them."
And that's why no one is leaving MasterChef.
Wow.
"It makes me a little uneasy that the judges kept all four, because I realized who might be going home tomorrow."
"Congratulations for bringing top-level technique, restaurant-quality souffles."
Thank you.
"Get some rest, 'cause tomorrow is one hell of a day."
"Yes, chef thank you."
(Gordon) Well done.
Thank you.
(Announcer) Next time on MasterChef...
I want you to taste this.
(Announcer) Christian and Chef Ramsay face off.
I've had better.
You may want to be a [bleep] smart ass and start acting like an arrogant [bleep].
Give me that.
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.
"Tell everyone if they find anything, give me a call."
This is Detective Wagenbach.
I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
- You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
- You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
- Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
- You are lying to her.
"- What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"- No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
- Christ!
- Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
- What?
"- Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
I volunteered you guys.
- You can't be serious.
- Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
- What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
- That was all business.
That's my beautifully restored Cutlass 442 you're driving.
"Okay, that was pleasure."
"But... now, here I am, offering you the payday of a lifetime as a gesture of good faith."
"And trust me, you do not find plays like this for sale."
All you need to do is find yourself a crew.
"Then you can buy yourself a whole factory of Cutlasses, like that. [Snaps] Huh?"
"- Okay, sold."
- Okay.
"- Where is it, Seth?"
"- Sorry, Richard."
Larry here just bought himself a 33 million dollar payday.
"Take it easy, pal."
- I'm warnin' you.
- Ah!
[exhales]
- [growling]
"- What the hell, man?"
- [roaring]
- Ah!
What the hell is your problem?
Ah!
This job is the old man's dream.
You're just usin' him to keep your bitch happy.
[grunting]
So that's why you hate culebras so much.
"It's not because you're scared we're gonna eat you,"
- it's because of her.
- Bingo.
Ah!
[Malvado] Could it be that this sacred bond between brothers has finally snapped?
Where do you think I got this?
- Great.
Go learn something.
His tongue and his dick were cut off.
LAPD didn't mention it?
No.
"They didn't find his tongue, but his dick was in his mouth."
Jesus Christ.
"What the hell's happening here, man?"
We honestly don't know.
"But, obviously, someone's mad enough to send you a message, and he was the message."
But we don't know.
Here you go.
All records of foreign sales by Borns Tech of cluster bombs.
Are you kidding me?
I asked Borns Tech.
They just say they don't make them.
"We're asking for all of Karl Stoltz' military records, too."
We need to tie him to Borns Tech and prove that they hired him to kill Rachel Kennedy.
That guy doesn't have any records.
"Go serve the State Department, the Pentagon."
DOD.
"Oh, believe me, I'm gonna serve all of them."
I'm just starting with you.
I told you what I told you as a favor.
I understand that.
"Sorry to be such an asshole, man, but I got to do what I got to do."
Fucking with the FBI over one case.
Sure you want to do that?
"Yeah, pretty sure."
"What's up, bud?"
What are you doing?
I'm drawing your picture.
Rose?
You here?
Rose?
Hi!
"Don't come in, I'll be right out."
"May I have a glass, too, please?"
"Good to see you, Greg, how was your trip?"
Are you all right?
"Oh, just a little dizzy, the traveling doesn't agree with me."
You need a glass of water?
- Wha... what happened to you?
"- Nothing, I just made a few changes."
- What did you do to your hair?
- I lightened it.
Your face...
You're wearing make-up.
"Yeah, well, women do wear makeup from time to time, Greg."
"It's not like I had SURGERY or anything, although my mother offered."
But... you never...
- Are you hungry?
- You never wore makeup.
"I know, the... the ""No Frills Girl"", RIGHT?"
"Well, like I said, I made a few changes."
"- And you lost weight, too?"
"- Well, thank you!"
"Now, these have no oil or butter, trust me, it's delicious, you just have to get used to it."
Among other things!
Wha... what've you done?
"What've I done, I..."
I...
"I'm wearing makeup, I lost a few pounds,"
I didn't name names before a Senate Committee.
"Oh, Miss Pugh, your uncle's here to see you."
Forgive the deceit.
Your landlady didn't look the sort to approve a gentleman caller.
"To be perfectly frank, she's the first person I've met for weeks who didn't recognize me."
She doesn't hold with the pictures.
Ungodly.
Ah!
That's...
That's charming.
It's from Rose and Lily.
The real Rose and Lily.
They ran away to join the ATS.
"Rose thought if she could fix a propeller in a film, she could learn to mend an engine in real life."
Ah.
They're both mechanics now.
Um...
Baker's planning a new film.
Air-raid wardens.
Wants me in it.
He's pretty much left the part up to me.
"So, I was thinking, newly retired cat burglar, not quite reformed."
That's why he's so good at the rescues.
He knows the way in and out of any property.
"Thing is, in the hands of the wrong writer..."
"So, I was wondering if you would consider putting your time and talent..."
I don't do that anymore.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
You'll get-
- You'll get soap in your eyes.
Here.
Hmm.
Wait a minute:
Listen:
There's not a sound:
"Not an animal, not a bird:"
Nothing:
Not even the wind:
It is as though the planet were keeping quiet: : :
Better to listen to us:
It is astounding:
Ten thousand years old:
Must have been quite a place in its heyday:
I wonder why they left:
Perhaps a plague:
Could be:
Wait a minute:
What's that over there?
A religious symbol?
"[Buck] Well, they could be:"
These markings remind me of Egyptian hieroglyphics:
I'm gonna holograph this for Dr:
Goodfellow:
He can tell us what these hieroglyphics are saying:
Buck:
What?
Over there:
Looks like it might have been a temple at one time:
I will see:
[Beeping]
Hawk!
Buck!
It looked...
I thought you disappeared:
!
I didn't try to kill myself.
But you tried to hang yourself from the fan.
"No, dad!"
"I was watching TV and... all of a sudden, I don't know what happened but..."
I fell unconscious and...
Wh... what's going on?
"Dad, you need to tell me."
I really need to know.
- What's happening?
"- Excuse me, this is going to have to wait."
Can you please step outside?
Sure.
What does this mean?
Why would someone want to kill Tisha?
"Mr. Khanna, it's critical that you do exactly as I say."
You'll never guess.
Tisha was attacked.
But she's alright now.
"Even so, you instructed Mr. Khanna that he should say that his daughter is dead."
How did you know that?
Because it's what I would've done.
"So, it's obvious that there is a killer hiding somewhere."
"Or, perhaps Tisha is lying so that we don't suspect her."
Perhaps.
It's possible.
What does anyone get by killing Tisha?
10 billion Euro.
Sunil... ask Mr. Malhotra's lawyer who inherits after Tisha?
Got that.
"That's it, right?"
"The question is, who would want to kill Tisha."
"But there's a dark side to progress, Hogarth."
Ever hear of Sputnik?
"Yeah, it's the first satellite in space."
"Foreign satellite, Hogarth, and all that that implies."
"Even now, it orbits overhead."
Boop.
Boop.
Watching us.
"We can't see it, but it's there."
Much like that giant thing in the woods.
We don't know what it is or what it can do.
"I don't feel safe, Hogarth."
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?
"I'm talking about your goldarned security, Hogarth!"
"While you're snoozing in your little jammies, back in Washington, we're wide-awake and worried."
Why?
"Because everyone wants what we have, Hogarth!"
Everyone!
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?
The Russians?
The Chinese?
Martians?
Canadians?
I don't care!
"All I know is, we didn't build it, and that's reason enough to assume the worst and blow it to kingdom come!"
"Now, you're going to tell me about this thing."
You're gonna lead me to it.
And we are going to destroy it before it destroys us!
"I mean, slapping all that money down on the saloon?"
EZRA:
"Well, I've been living parsimoniously."
J.D. :
Parsi-what?
EZRA:
I've been saving.
J.D. :
Oh.
Now that the down payment's been made...
... allthat'sneededare afewprudent investors to infuse a little working capital.
Mr. Jackson?
"I don't know, Ezra."
What do you know about running a saloon?
I've spent my whole life in saloons.
You may trust I have ample experience.
"What about you, Josiah?"
Money is like manure.
Not good except it be spread.
May I take that as an affirmative?
No.
"Gentlemen, gentlemen, envision the future."
"Glistening wood, sparkling mirrors, a new piano, lush green felt tables."
That does sound good.
And it proves you're a smart lad.
-You know the answer to the question.
J.D. :
You bet.
-What's the question?
-The question is...
... whatdoeseveryone in this town want to do?
What does every visitor here want to do?
We just had an attack of insanity and decided to keep you from committing suicide.
"Very bad idea, come to think of it."
Hey!
You're forgettin' our guest of honor.
"Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan."
- Hey.
Gimme.
"Come on, gimme."
- Hmm?
"Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if I ain't too inquisitive... what was you and your old man gonna do up here?"
Work.
Oh.
"Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?"
Probably.
"Can't understand it, a guy taking his wife way out in the wilderness."
"Stupid, if you ask me."
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He loved me and I loved him.
"Well, I wouldn't let him go alone."
"Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason."
We thought it an excellent one.
I still think it's stupid.
Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.
"Well, tell me somethin'."
"Uh, didn't he have some object?"
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?
"What I mean is, did he have a hunch, or did somebody give him a tip?"
"- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be."
"- Me, tired?"
- You cheated.
"Stop, stop."
- You're so cute when you pout.
"- Stop, stop, stop."
Poor baby.
He's a loser.
- Stop.
"- Oh, he's just a little loser."
- You know what I think?
"I think we worry too much about Brian and Adam, you know?"
"I think they're gonna be fine, don't you think?"
I sure hope so.
Wanna slap it?
Wanna slap it?
"Yeah, you don't want to start planning two of everything, like when your married friends split up."
"Honestly, I can't believe all this is about Marjorie."
"Baby, uh, these people are her friends, okay?"
"I'm just saying, you were standing-- you saw Adam's face--right next to him at the altar."
I don't care what she was going through.
You don't put someone through that--public humiliation.
"- Orange, please."
"- All right,"
- this is the last orange.
- So she should have gone through with it
- so as not to embarrass Adam?
- Yes.
No.
"If she didn't want to get married, she saved him the trouble."
I don't even know why she said yes.
She's a coward.
I think it actually takes a lot of courage to do what she did.
"No, no."
What are you doing?
No!
Let me go!
"Oh no, I've been caught!"
"Help me, Big Sis!"
Ow!
Ow!
I'm gonna die!
No more!
Not there!
This is a situation neither the North nor the South should want.
"Not only that, there's absolutely no consistency to the Venom's destruction."
So it's most likely the work of someone operating independently.
"But who in the world would make the North and South fight each other, and for what purpose?"
"President Hunter, you have a guest."
She has been anxious to see you.
It seems urgent.
Turn her away.
- Even you should understand what kind of crisis I'm facing right now.
- Hey!
Get out of my way!
"Hey you, you shouldn't be here!"
I'm telling you to let me see him!
A Helmajistani?
"Nope, don't know anyone like that."
But a lot of Arabs live in that building over there.
"So you're Kashim, huh?"
"You reek of alcohol, you worthless brat."
"Are you trying to ruin the reputation of ""Bdakshon's Tiger""?"
As if I even care.
State your business.
A Chinese girl asked me to give this to you.
You need to be home where you're safe.
You could chain me to this porch and I'd still never touch you like that again.
I got off the phone with Mrs. Potter's housekeeper.
Mrs. Potter had a heart attack.
Paige?
"I'm sorry, Emily."
I wanted you to know that.
- I think maybe you're being framed.
- What changed your mind?
I think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me.
So this is what a real date with Ezra Fitz looks like.
Lead the way.
I gave your mom the museum ticket.
- Why would you do that?
"- A has something on me, and..."
"A has something on all of us, Hanna."
"Okay, so your sister's pregnant."
How'd that happen?
I figure pretty much the usual way.
"It's not really a ""how"" question, it's more of a ""why"" question."
"Well, I mean, I guess Melissa could have gone all maternal but I doubt it."
"Ugh, this is so creepy."
Where are they now?
Philadelphia.
Shopping.
What do you think this means?
"I don't know, but Toby wanted us to have it."
There.
"It's in Braille, so..."
"- You want to see this, Aria?"
- No.
I can see just fine from here.
'£15.9 shillings a week to £20.
'The dustcarts stayed in the depot.
'The general opinion was that the whole business stank.'
He's got wooden splinters in his head.
"Body was discovered just after 7:00, sir."
The sergeant reckons he was a jumper.
~ Really?
~ There's been a few of them lately.
"They've pulled two out of the Tyne already this month, sir."
"If he was aiming for the river, he was a bad shot."
Debt.
Unemployment.
Is this where they found him?
He hasn't been moved?
"No, sir."
There's no blood around him.
He was dead when he hit.
~ Have we got a name?
"~ We've got his wallet, but there's no ID."
There's no money in it either.
"So, robbery, maybe?"
We've got this.
"It's a receipt for a pawnbroker, a couple of betting slips from the dog track and a note that says, ""Gwendolen Howard, 5:00 Wednesdays."""
Who's she?
Gwendolen Howard?
Sir?
"Sir, we're a bit shorthanded with the bin strike."
I need to release men to other duties if we don't absolutely need the scene sealed.
"It's a crime scene, Sergeant."
"No, no, no."
You heard him.
Seal it.
"Sir Sugiura, how dare you!"
Harassing a Mehebu woman?
I was offering her a chance to earn some extra money in our substation
It's no big deal
I know you Japanese policemen too well
Take that blind prey of yours and scram
"It's true, and she accepted it too"
Another word from you and I'll have the hounds feast on you
Phooey!
"Fine, fine"
It's hard to reason with you savages
You deserve it!
Chicken!
"You're back, Sapu"
"Chief, the matches you wanted"
Sapu?
Let the kids eat more meat.
They're too skinny
Mouna!
Mouna!
"Bakan, why does Mouna need so many matches?"
Who knows?
"Had any meat, my boy?"
Have a drink!
Father!
Father!
"Father, can we slaughter a cow?"
Not enough to eat?
"It's enough, but we haven't had beef for such a long time"
Do it then
Let's slaughter a cow!
Hooray!
So unless he's here to report a crime...
I can't allow him in this building.
I don't know.
Makes you think.
Vic says the guy was a real crackerjack cop.
"Somebody like him can get booted, man, none of us are safe."
Come on.
The guy's old.
Probably lost his edge.
–Nothing's gonna happen to us.
–How are you so sure?
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.
"Stupid, huh?"
"–Vic, I..."
–What's stupid is Joe's twice the cop you'll ever be.
You're too sloppy to even know it.
–Here we go again.
–I guess so.
"You know, I'm gettin' a little tired of this bullshit."
I'm gettin' tired of constantly having to clean up after your bullshit!
"Every time something goes to shit in your life, I become your whipping boy."
Why don't you find someone else?
–Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.
–You want my transfer request?
"Say the word, Vic!"
It'll be on Aceveda's desk first thing in the morning!
–Fine.
Write it up.
–Fine!
Asshole.
–What'd you call me?
They took care of Tunney when he was gonna talk.
How come Figgis didn't do somethin' about it?
He was Ray's right-hand man back then.
Then they tried to kill Superboy.
"They were hiding him, Freddy."
Then they burned down Figgsy's house when they think he might talk.
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.
Not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy.
I think you been hangin' around Figgs too much.
He's the only one getting cash out of that house... and he's totally playing you—
just like those assholes in the city.
"And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing you can do about this."
"Yes, there is."
"I can find Superboy, and I can bring him in."
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.
I don't want any part of this.
I don't want any part of this place.
"Come on, Cindy."
Shit.
Freddy.
"Look, I don't know about Ray, okay?"
But everyone in Garrison is not a murderer.
No.
"They just keep their eyes closed and their mouths shut, just like me."
"Hey, Freddy."
"All right, thank you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, sweetheart."
I love you too.
"All right, terrific."
You reek like too many frozen dinners.
You drank an entire bottle of cheap Merlot by yourself last night because you live alone and you're hooked on Xanax.
"So you tell me, who needs therapy here, huh?"
I'm just gonna top up my coffee before we get started.
"You do that, doc."
"You've always been strong but you feel your world is spinning out beyond your control and instead of dealing with suddenly feeling vulnerable you're compensating by swinging your big, manly nightstick."
Stab in the dark.
Samir?
Succubus whore!
Samir?
Kenzi?
Arm up.
People are really starting to lose their heads.
"Easy, killer. it's just me."
"Bo, what happened?"
- What's wrong?
What did Samir say?
- Not very much.
"Nothing, actually."
"I'm sorry, Jenny."
"When I got there, Samir was dead."
"Olivia, she's kind of insane."
She got there first.
I was too late.
No.
No.
No.
- No.
No.
- I don't deal well with hysterical.
"Bo, what are you doing?"
"I'm taking the edge off, I think."
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm notJeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
"Aw, Serena finally has"
The perfect relationship with her daddy.
But will her dream come true be Rufus' worst nightmare?
"Oh, of course."
The theme of this evening seems to be torture.
"You're not a fan of, uh, university galas?"
Quite the opposite.
I'm in my natural habitat.
It's torture because it's at Columbia.
"And by some cruel Twist of fate, I go to N.Y.U."
It's like being locked out of lanvin
On the day they get fall in.
"Sorry, I don't mean to ramble on."
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Wait.
I know that name.
"You read ""Gossip Girl""?"
"No, I read college applications."
I work in the admissions office at Columbia.
I was just looking at your application today.
I'm sorry?
"Look, it's, um, it's not our policy to do this,"
"But e-mails go out tomorrow, and you're standing right here,"
"So welcome to Columbia, Blair Waldorf."
"Champagne, please."
Whoa.
Are you okay?
You got crazy eyes.
I think I just became a Columbia student...
For real.
It doesn't make any sense.
I
"Is that why last night, when I asked you to honka-honka me..."
- you only honka'd me?
- I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"- Thanks, baby."
- Mmm.
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
"I'm sorry, bro."
I totally overreacted.
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
And wait...
You-You forgive me?
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple cee-gars."
Get over here!
"All right, so where are those cee-gars?"
We'll break 'em out in a minute.
"Hey, Barn."
- Ted?
"- Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say ""bro-in-law""?"
Shut up.

"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
Those words had been dancing around my head all night.
"I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase."
"Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses, they'll know."
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time he dealt blackjack.
"That was over 40 years ago, and the words still catch."
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
There it is!
"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
"Yeah, try it."
I had heard it at least 14 times that night.
I couldn't lose.
"First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal."
"There were certain institutions and people that frowned upon it, but it's legal."
And not everyone can do it.
Just those with gifted minds.
I have a gifted mind.
That's what got me into all this mess.
"I was counting cards and I was up over $640,000."
All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.
"Well, that's all right."
I've been winning and losing for years.
- Seth.
You're in my room.
- Yeah.
- How'd you get in here?
"- I, uh, took a left at the grotto, and I hopped the funicular to the dumbwaiter."
This is a... nic
"- So, what are you doing in here?"
"- Well, when I have a problem, Marissa, I like to talk about it incessantly."
"Yeah, no, that's it."
"I just think I burned out anyone else who will listen, so..."
- Is now a bad time?
- I'm game.
So...
"I think I really messed things up with Summer last night, hurt her pretty bad."
"- Yeah, you did."
"- Okay, not going to sugarcoat this one, huh?"
- Not for you.
"Look, if you really want to be her friend..."
then maybe you should think about just apologizing.
"- You know, say you were sorry."
"- Yeah, no, I know."
- Sounds so simple when you say it.
- I think that's a good place to start.
Okay.
"Uh, do you happen to know where Summer is right now?"
I just have this thing that I've got to tell her.
"- Yeah, she's at the club having lunch with her dad."
"- Oh, yeah, her father."
"Cool, well, I'm just going to, you know..."
"Whoa, Seth, you know what?"
Don't go there now.
"Just, uh, give her some space."
"- It's an honor, sir."
- I've been meaning to have you up here for some time.
- Really?
Excuse me.
Willie?
"Thank you, Willie."
"Yeah, you betcha."
You unseated that old bastard Bettis.
He must've voted against me 70 percent of the time.
You know what this is?
That's a shark steak sandwich.
Fucking shark steak.
- You want half?
"- Uh, no, thank you."
- Are you a vegan?
Had lunch?
- No.
Uh...
So you choose not to break bread with the president of the United States?
Thank you.
"When I was in the Senate, Bettis could always be counted to leave half a grand at the poker table."
"Always stayed in, never folded."
Always wanted that miracle card.
"- That's good, isn't it?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Now, Truman, he was a poker player."
"Damn fine one, as I understand it."
"Son, I understand you may be making a mess of our plans... to put Laine Hanson into the vice president mansion."
"Right now, sir, I cannot see supporting Laine Hanson."
- How old are you?
"- Me, I'm 28."
"And at that age and experience, you think you're the one to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?"
Ah!
"If only I had my wallet, I wouldn't have inconvenienced you like this!"
"Once I get my wallet back, I'll pay you back."
Teacher Gil...
Did you get scolded a lot?
It's because I'm so upset!
You have no idea how dashing and what a gentleman my Yoon Jae is!
You made people say that he's an idiot...
It's because I'm sorry and upset for Yoon Jae!
Go home and stay there quietly.
Don't go around again and cause more trouble.
If you need something...
I'll get it for you.
You'll get it?
Forget it!
"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it."
Go home.
"Don't go anywhere else, okay?"
Does she know how nice these clothes are?
Anything I wear is a total killer.
I only look like an idiot because I'm wearing it in this body.
Well...
"When I get my wallet back, I'll dress him like this."
Yoon Jae...
It would be nice if I could see you before I left.
Your call cannot be connected...
Um...
Can I found out what room Patient Kang Gyung Joon is in?
Room 560.
Okay.
Hey.
Doctor Seo's really different today.
What was your mission?
To have fun.
And drive the wheels off it.
That takes serious effort.
You have ruined it!
They were new!
I should've got some second-hand ones.
Running an old knacker is a good idea because track days aren't covered by road insurance.
If I wanted to get insurance it'd be around £120 for the day.
So I go out without it.
"If you broke it though, stick it in a ditch and go, ""Look!"
"What happened? "" I've heard that happens."
Yes...
I've seen cars pushed onto the road.
This is the Palmer Jaguar.
A track day thunderbolt.
And a more fitting remedy for a man who had once proclaimed...
I am a driving god!
Oh my goodness!
This is a properly great car.
It uses the three-litre V6 out of Jaguar's X-Type.
It has 300bhp and it weighs 600 kilos.
"That is very, very light."
"And it means it's very, very fast."
It really can travel at some incredible speeds.
"Straight up to...120, 130."
Absolutely awesome power in this thing.
Turn it in far here.
Use that torque.
The lowdown power.
Come on!
HE LAUGHS MANICALLY Yeeeeeees!
The day after tomorrow. you know what you gotta do out there. we've decided to get a little bit of insurance.
Don't fuck it up.
All bets are closed.
All are closed.
are you ready?
Are you ready?
On my mark.

I had this little black dog when I was a kid.
We tried like hell but it was so stupid.
Maybe it was retarded.
They got retarded dogs?
I don't know.
"No, I'd rather stay."
"The hair brush, please."
Brush her hair.
"Carmela, take the dress off."
Let's hear the news.
Turn on the radio.
"Yes, Prince."
The Duchess is calling.
"Sirs, please follow me."
We are being summoned.
Hare is the Armed Forces radio...
We interrupt our program for an important report.
Mount Vesuvius' sismograph has registered... a sudden rise in volcanic activity.
All commanding officers must report to their bases... for further instructions.
"I repeat, all commanding officers must... report to their bases."
"This night, seeing those unhappy people..."
I have a confession to make.
It isn't easy.
Another time?
"Don't be afraid, we're in Italy."
It was in Italy that confession was born.
"I haven't been honest, Captain."
I wasn't honest.
I'm not here to help the civilian population.
"No, in no way."
I'm here to help Senator Wyatt...
"The President of the USA, the WAC..."
"No, that's a lie too."
I'm here for myself.
"For me, myself, I!"
How?
I don't know.
All:
Votes for women.
Violets for votes.

"Layout is ready, illustrations are late."
Where are we on print?
Depends on which magazines.
And how much lead time.
"Time, Life, Redbook."
National editions or regional?
What do they have to do with teeth?
- He speaks.
- Excuse me?
What do Chesterfields have to do with teeth?
Dentists recommend them.
"For what, stains?"
This is our first major shot at the cigarette market.
Do you have any idea how big this is gonna be?
"Oh, this big?"
[sighs]
"Mr. Little, people buy cigarettes for their taste, for the quality of the tobacco, not for their teeth."
We've got dentists.
"So, we have to get people to buy Chesterfields because dentists recommend them."
Makes your food taste even better.
The brandy's never been smoother.
Helps settle the stomach.
"Doesn't sound very ""dentisty."""
"And what does sound ""dentisty"" to you, Mr. Fitzgerald?"
Mr. Fitzgerald?
This is...
"She doesn't realise that she can have me as well as you lot, but she will and when she does I'll be here, waiting."
You can use the inside toilets from now on if you want to.
Thanks.
"Electricity, 40 a quarter, and I'll get you your rent book."
Hey?
We have to find a way of getting shot of her.
We just have to...
"Sheila, will you..."
"I'm not fighting her any more, Frank."
If she wants the babies she's entitled to that.
"Yeah, but, Sheila..."
"It's too exhausting, hate."
"Anyway, the best woman's won."
"I'm married to you now, there's nothing she can do about that."
And if you love someone set them free.
"I'm sitting you free, Frank."
I'm trusting you.
"Hey, hey."
Hey!
What you doing?
There was too much sunlight yesterday.
I'm feeling a bit insidey outsidey.
Thought I'd make these for myself.
'Squidgy-gate.
Camilla-gate.
'Watergate.

All these private secrets?
"'What good does it do, eh, to let them out?"

"'And what you don't know can't hurt you, that's what I say."
This is Calvin.
You're thinking about the pledging from the Omega Chi.
Spitter and Quiter.
Excellent.
You're awesome.
"Thanks, I think."
"Hey Eth, you met my friend Calvin."
I have.
On more than one occasion.
The mystery guy.
That's cool.
It's weird for me to picture but... completely cool.
"So, how've you been?"
Couldn't be better.
"So fellas, I have a little anouncement to make."
"Join me, in the basement, for a chapter meeting in five."
"All right, libations will be provided."
"- He can stay, right?"
"- Well, can he keep a secret?"
"Because, if you can't keep a secret."
You should leave the room right now.
- You all with me?
- Can we see a little of the ZBZ swear?
We're going to throw a party.
A theme party based on the book The Great Gatsby.
Which we all know is a big Lizzi favorite.
"There will be great costumes, fun music and a dance instructor that's gonna teach us dances from the 20."
Did I just fell asleep with my eyes open?
I haven't finished yet.
That's just...
- the upstairs party.
"- But downstairs,"
"But you might gain many detractors, calling you a traitor who sold out her kingdom."
I don't mind.
"If you wish it, you may kill me afterwards."
So...
"Don't kill everyone, please."
Very well.
The battle is over.
"Please call off your soldiers, Rear Admiral Klom."
"Wait, damn you!"
"Hey, are you okay?"
"I believe in you, and your king."
Huh?
"Rear Admiral Klom, I can't bring myself to move."
Would you mind helping me stand?
Sure thing.
Thank you.
"With all of you, I'm sure the people of Estabul will be..."
"Again, people have died."
"Again, I made Claugh kill people."
I knew this war was necessary.
That's why I didn't charge Froaude with any crimes.
"I put Claugh in charge because I wanted to save more lives, even if only a few."
Or is that just my excuse?
"Brother Sion, are you going to cry?"
I've read about it in picture books.
"That's a face on the verge of tears, right?"
It's the first time Iris has seen one!
"Sister Ferris never cries, and Brother Lucile always smiles, which is really scary!"
Lucile is quite scary.
"Hey, are you going to cry?"
C'mon!
- I won't cry.
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
-What kind is that?
-The kind that re-elects the President.
Where else?
Second cities like Chicago?
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden that nominates a Mondale.
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
We'll make you a winner right here.
"You're not a New Yorker, are you?"
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
Huey Long country.
"""""Every man a king,"""" but no one wears a crown."
I love this guy.
Thank you so much.
Lovely evening.
"Kevin, give me a call in the morning."
I need some stuff for The New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
-Let me assure you--
-The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
-Thank you.
"Yes, thank you."
(KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS)
Colonel Grant.
As-Salaam Aleikom.
(IN ARABIC) Wa alaikum assalaam.
"Sit, please."
It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
Okay.
Then let us work to resolve it.
"Indeed, yes."
"All along, I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return."
As your Major Sinclair can confirm.
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shoot-out."
The shoot-out.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
"Although, there is still a fatal traffic incident..."
About which we must question Mr. Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes, but complications do occur."
Hmm...
May I visit him?
"Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
As for Mr. Stonebridge and Mr. Crawford...
"Tomorrow, we will send troops into the desert."
"I only pray we find them, before the bandits who have his daughter."
It would be deeply regrettable...
If all my men brought back...
were their two corpses.
"Rest assured, Minister."
How do you mean?
"For example, he says that Dave is de-prioritizing me, that he doesn't pay attention to what I actually want."
"Yeah, but, honey, that's just Dave being Dave, you know?"
Yeah.
"But so then, what if Dave being Dave is sort of like"
Dave bulldozing me?
Please continue to look at the fish!
Enjoy them as they come at you!
"I get it, dude, it's advanced snorkeling."
Dave...
"Hey, I'm trying to do this exercise!"
"Why don't we talk about this during down time, okay?"
This might be what the therapist is referring to.
You're missing out on life.
"It's happening right now, out here, all around us, all right?"
And you're too busy complaining about your problems to enjoy all these beautiful little fish that are...
Marcel!
Yes?
"Marcel, we have a real problem here!"
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!
The circle of life is circling our lives right now!
"Do not move, do not panic."
Shark!
What?
Shark!
Jason!
"Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!"
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Don't worry!
"She won't just be my victim,"
"She'll be his victim, too."
"Pretty good, right?"
"That'll kill him, won't it?"
Good man like devalos.
Respected man.
No way he'll be able to live with himself
If he let's that happen.
"I know who you are, you know."
Pardon me?
I know you're a prince.
I know about the problem.
"I know about the money, and I want to help you."
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.
"But I know it's not much, but it's what I've got."
And when you get all that money
"That you've been writing to people about,"
You can pay me back.
I just want enough
To cover my library debt: $92.18.
"I think you are mistaken, little girl."
You've got me mixed up with somebody.
You don't have to pretend with me.
"I know you're a prince, okay?"
I've read the e-mails.
"And I know that you have enemies everywhere,"
But I'm not one of them.
"And look, even if you don't get all your money back,"
I want you to have this.
"I'm sorry, young lady, but you've got me mixed up."
I must get going.
"No, you can't just not take my money"
You're embarrassed.
She's not a stranger who just walked in.
Remember that when you're talking to her.
I want to try something else.
Go out and come in again.
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"- Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
Excellent.
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor, admit to the saddening fact..."
"Until I, miss, admit to the gladdening fact..."
Talk to her.
Sit.
That I firmly refuse to change the smallest detail on your lovely little nose.
I insist on saying that my nose is neither little nor lovely.
Dear Mademoiselle Francine Principale...
"You love her, don't forget that when you're talking to her."
How did I do?
Not too bad.
Want to go get some coffee?
Can't.
Do you have to stay with him all the time?
Are you assistant-director?
He's my father.
So you're assistant-father?
Hello?
"Yitzhak, it's Alex."
"Hello, Alex."
The rehearsal went well today.
"Yes, it's coming along."
The father was a Soviet diplomat who lived in Paris for five years... and then immigrated to America in 1968.
When's the flight?
- What flight?
- Mikhail's flight to New York.
- I want his passport.
- No!
You're a cop.
That's evidence.
You think it was a coincidence that guy was Russian?
Who knows what Mikhail was involved in.
Sebastien... what happened to my brother could've happened to me.
Thirty-two years ago it was only luck that kept me in France.
He made a sacrifice and never knew It.
I gotta go.
The killer did not know Mikhail is dead.
You go to New York with that face and-
Maybe he isn't.
"Would you like a vodka before you sleep, Mr. Suverov?"
"- No, thank you."
- You're welcome.
What you see before you is called gridlock.
- Next exit.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I'm writing the great american novel here on the job.
Literary kind of stuff.
Knock the fillings outta your teeth.
Yeah.
I see Everything.
That's what it is.
"It's all about looking around, observing stuff."
"Take you, for instance."
Like that accent of yours.
"- Oh, uh..."
"Uh, I was just looking at your hair."
I'm very interested in your hair.
- Why?
- Because it's... it's interesting hair.
"I mean, it's very exquisite hair."
It's the most exquisite hair my eyes have ever beheld.
"Well, actually, I did comb it differently this morning."
"So, um, with all that said, would you be interested in going out with me?"
All right.
I guess so.
When?
"- Uh, tomorrow, after school."
- OK.
See you then.
Has a brand-new couple taken shape before my very eyes?
What can I say?
I've got the boom!
(sighs)
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.
"Yeah, you got your, uh..."
floor-length flannel armor on there.
- This happens to be very comfortable.
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, you're looking positively Amish."
"Alan... tomorrow I have three busloads of these Garden Club ladies coming to the gallery, and some of the paintings are just a little risqué."
Risqué?
What do you mean?
Like flannel-off-the-shoulder kind of...
What is with this?
Is this welded on?
This has nothing to do with me.
"It is about you, and it is always about you."
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Don't say anything.
I'll follow you to the station.
Do you think I did the right thing...
cutting my hair?
I can't believe this about your grandfather.
He's in big trouble.
"Yeah, I know, with the creek and the no paddle."
"Damn Oregonian barbers, man, making my head too small for my body."
- How do you work with this mirror?
"- Grandpa, front page, jail?"
- I was in that photo.
"I got cut out, though, ... probably 'cause of my hairdo."
- Sorry to see you're so upset.
- I'll survive.
It'll grow out.
- I'm talking about Caleb.
Looks like someone was way off base.
Accusing you of making everything about you.
"- My God, she is right."
"- I was just kidding, man."
"No, dude, here I am, going on and on about my haircut."
My grandfather's in the cooler.
"I'm like a monster, dude."
"I'm all I think about, and not in a good way."
- There's a good way?
- Talk to me about anything other than me.
"Go, give me anything."
"- Ah, here it is."
First day of A.P. Physics today.
Excuse me.
you piece of shit.
Know this kid?
Yeah.
Know where he lives?
Yeah.
You deliver mail to his house?
Yeah.
any letter from school to his house comes directly here.
You understand?
Another letter from school goes to that kid's house head first.
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No letters from school.
no more letters from anybody.
my mother had to go to the post office to complain.
How could I go to school after that andpledgeallegianceand sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?
make the call.
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back from outside phone.
Got a nickel?
Get him on the phone.

For a guy who moved all day long
Pauliedidn'ttalktosixpeople.
With union problems ora beefin thenumbers onlythetopguysspoke with Paulie about the problem.
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.
My father worked there till the day he died.
The old man loved his female employees.
I have more relatives and half-relatives working for me than you can imagine.
(chuckles)
What am I talking about?
This is about Clayton.
"Even though I was older, he always looked out for me."
We use to call him the Mayor.
(sighs)
I just want to see him pull through this.
RYAN:
"It's okay, let him go."
"Gibbs, Gibbs, let him come back to you."
(sighs)
Just be patient.
Think about something else.
"The sweater I wore to your house the other night, what color was it?"
I know you remember.
No!
"No, no... (sighs)"
We think the shooter has a connection to AUTEC.
"You know what AUTEC is, Mr. Wickes?"
I do.
A lot of unhappy folks from your company knew exactly where SECNAV was gonna be today.
Do any of them have a connection to AUTEC projects?
Lawrence Ridgeway.
"He wasn't the man with the gun, but..."
Details.
(sighs)
Wickes built something for AUTEC back in the '70s.
Before my time.
Ridgeway was the only one still around that worked on it.
How did you know?
- How long have you been following me?
- A while.
"- Look, I haven't got much time to explain."
It's not safe for me.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else and he knows you have it, Harry."
- Are you talking about the bracelet?
- I know you're a good man which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you!
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
"- You're already starting to feel it though, aren't you?"
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Don't go.
"It's a balance, Harry."
It's yin and yang.
Luck like this has its own unique price.
- Gold.
- Steel.
- Gold.
"Whilst at Cambridge, Sebastian Faulks appeared on what TV quiz?"
- University Challenge.
- Pass.
University Challenge.
Life On The Mississippi is a memoir by which American author?
Mark Twain.
You're totally not going to do this.
"They are wonderful, aren't they?"
"For them, a painter who died is a painter whose quoted value goes up."
Look at Modigliani.
Barbey and Nanteuil are astute businessmen.
You see evil everywhere.
Professional bias.
You should not stay here.
This house is full of souvenirs.
I know a wonderful boarding house.
I lived over there when I arrived in Paris.
Rather say that you fear for my life.
Is that it?
Yes.
Taste it.
It lacks a little of violet perfume.
I come back.
Whatever.
Remain by my side.
Why don't you want me to go?
It will take only thirty seconds.
It is April 12.
"I know, so what?"
It's the anniversary today.
The fatal date.
"Listen, Princess, every year at this date, it's the same."
You are afraid.
"Meanwhile, Mr Fantômas has not returned for four years."
I'm superstitious.
"Come on, you're going to Mr Thomery's bal later."
Exactly.
Mr Thomey was ill-advised to give up this bal barely a few days after the tragic death of my friend the Baroness de Vibray.
I tried to dissuade him.
"Hi, Daddy."
He was the one that got the license for this building.
Nice guy.
[Woman] You gave me a little bit of a scare... when you told me you had pains in your chest and back.
You have to let somebody know.
If you're having pains in your chest and your back-
In my chest that goes through to my back.
- Is that what's happening right now?
- Mm-hmm.
You know what?
"I think maybe I better take you back to the area, just to be safe."
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm
-Yeah -
- She might be pregnant.
[Laughing] How do you say-
She
- She says maybe you're pregnant.
[Laughing]
- That would be interesting.
- It would be a very good thing... if you would - if you would find me a really good husband.
It's already too late.
"If you're pregnant, it's already over..."
- [Claire] Oh.
"- I've seen you with a new young man around here, Claire."
I know that you do have someone new in your life.
- Oh.
- Do you remember that?
Memory is one of the things she hasn't got.
And I think his name is Albert.
"- Oh, Al..."
Why her?
Like there's not enough rich people on this island.
"She's away from home, out of her element."
Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
"I need everything on Dana, okay?"
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rentals..."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
"That's it, matches the description of the car Dawkins stole."
"Five-0, we'll take it from here."
- What are you doing?
Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
- Food or water?
- No.
Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now.
"If he wants to get off the island, he needs to change his appearance."
- Coming in?
It's a men's room.
"That's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid."
You can go anywhere.
Lemonade mix and mayo.
It's old prison trick for dying hair.
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.
Looks like our man's a blond now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
Fifteen minutes ago.
Factor in the time for a dye job and he couldn't have made it very far.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
- I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
And... guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"- Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
Fun fact:
"Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
"- Oof, poor Jake."
"- Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks."
"- So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?"
Aren't they a little young for that?
- They're four.
"- Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me--"
"I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."
- We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
- I didn't have to then.
- So does this van have side-impact airbags?
- Not in the back.
- Oh.
I'm going to climb Mount Everest.
Bike across Death Valley.
I'm going to eat my weight in garbage.
Why would I want to waste my indestructableness on business?
See?
I told you overreacting would work.
"Harvey, stop fidgeting."
Try and look like we're having a good time.
I feel like all we're being judged on is how we look.
How do I look?
Gorgeous.
Now will you stop asking me that?
Stop yelling at me.
Nobody's going to vote for us if it looks like we're fighting.
But do I really look okay?
"Okay, I'm sorry."
Let's just dance.
Got to go.
"Dreama, have you seen my camera?"
"No, but you can use mine."
"Look for it, please."
Something tells me this is about more than a camera.
Thank you for helping me back here.
My pleasure.
I was feeling a little disoriented.
"Ooh, I wonder if I could scurry up those curtains."
"Come on, Hilda, let's go."
Call the elevator.
I'll be right there.
(chuckling)
I'm beginning to think you have a problem.
"And now, the moment everyone's been waiting for."
My pleasures are...
Bathing and...
I also keep birds And I like to play Go
Kichiemon also enjoys Go Why not challenge each other?
"Yes, an excellent plan"
Over a game of Go...
Yes It was at a Go tournament
"""You've called halt four times"" ""No, it's only three,"" that's how it began"
"""You're just an idiot, how dare you call me a liar!"
"Draw!"""
I'm so sorry
He always longed to die at war
Dying over a silly dispute
Must have been a shame
At least...
If he had died in a manner more worthy of a warrior...
One moment
I've always been... handy this way
"That's all for today, Soza san"
"So I stand at 7 wins, 3 losses Do come back"
Welcome
Don't stare
Done yet?
Not yet
Tell me when you're done
I hope it's a lot
"A lot, a lot"
"A lot, a lot"
Revenge?
That's right It's just a play
A play?
This'll be your first
Hey.
TRIS:
Hi.
MARCUS:
Son...
You can't ignore me forever.
"I know you're thinkin' about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
She died trying to hide something from Jeanine.
Something that was entrusted to Abnegation a long time ago.
"Marcus, stop."
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
Mind telling me what's inside?
A message from The Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
Divergents will destroy our society.
Unless we destroy them.
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them.
Every last one of them.

The polar winter.
This is the planet at its most hostile.
Those that stay here at this time must face the harshest conditions on Earth.
The High Arctic in late autumn.
Empty and abandoned to ice and snow.
Most animals migrated south weeks ago.
"The few that stay will face violent winds, plunging temperatures and months of darkness."
A female polar bear searches for shelter.
"Other bears are out on the frozen ocean looking for food, but she won't feed again until next spring."
"Using as little energy as possible, she starts to dig a shallow nest."
The snow here is easy to work.
It's soft and light.
- Because I'm gay?
- No.
I didn't say anything.
He must have asked around.
But I didn't tell him.
I swear.
I have to go to class.
You can't make it to any teacher conferences?
"I can, I just need to reschedule for tomorrow."
You don't have to see all of them.
"You should meet her French teacher, Mr. Carinci and, oh, are you going to meet Ezra?"
- Ezra?
"- Ezra Fitz, her English teacher."
"Aria's crazy about him, and I can see why."
"He's very smart, he's attractive, sensitive."
Does he also play guitar?
"Uh, not that I know of, but he does know how to handle a loose cannon."
Today Nick McCullers showed up.
McCullers.
From the library board?
"The same one, with the very same paranoia."
He was about to launch into the gay agenda there in the cafeteria.
"Ezra totally calmed the waters, completely defused the situation."
- It was something to see.
- Mm.
I'm sorry I missed that.
You should meet him.
You'll like him.
I'm late.
"Listen, uh, Ella."
I thought maybe we could pick up where we left off.
Maybe next Friday?
"Wilson, Cats, let's go."
Christo.
Yep.
"When the footage comes in, overlay it on the gris map."
"We get lucky, maybe we can trace Valera's escape route."
You got it.
All surveillance cam footage from the 900 block of Shortridge.
Thank you.
Any idea just how many cameras big brother's got pointed on downtown Atlanta?
"8,200, give or take."
Excellent.
I need this.
Make it happen.
I'll download the SANs and work it up.
Graham.
"Max Collins said he didn't know his mother was in town, right?"
Lab just ran prints lifted from Jessica's hotel suite.
We got a hit.
"Max, it's your fingerprints."
This isn't what you think.
What were you doing in your mother's hotel room?
She wanted to talk.
About what?
About Sara.
"Whether you guys were still happy, same as always."
"Since when do you two have an ""always"" kind of relationship?"
"What do you want me to say, Dad?"
"She was a crappy mom, but for the last six months, she's been trying to make up for it!"
She wants to be a part of my life!
Okay.
Do you have any idea where she is now?
No.
- The colony collapsed.
Mites might've caused it.
"In fact, they did."
Took over every hive.
Not long after Woolsey took over Betty's Bees.
Might almost be poetic if it didn't suck so much.
Kentucky didn 't sabotage Betty's Bees with a lot of might.
- She sabotaged Betty's Bees with:
- A lot of mites.
- Take a lot of mites to cause a collapse.
- Sure does.
I grew up with generations of those bees.
The first hive was an infestation in the corner of my bedroom.
I was 5.
- I tried to kill it.
- Oh.
I was stopped.
"Mother was a Methodist and Daddy was a pragmatist, so:"
"""God put those bees there for a reason."""
- They were right.
- You lived with bees?
That sounds magical.
We called it the Honey House.
The Honey House is empty now.
"We left together, me and the bees."
Those bees built Betty's Bees.
What happened to those bees?
Could it be sabotage?
A conspiracy?
How dramatic.
You think someone intentionally murdered my bees?
- Just a thought.
Mama's not really happy.
When are you coming back?
"Yeah, I'm"
"- I'm not sure yet, angel."
As soon as I can.
"Listen, I gotta go."
"I will uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"Bye, I love you papa."
"I love you too, Julia."
"You two, uh, takin' off for the airport?"
Yeah.
You sure you're doin' the right thing?
"I mean, you know, you just met the guy."
"Could be he's only uh, after your money."
"Well, that's okay."
I'm only after his body.
"So, how much longer are you planning on staying?"
I gotta think through some things.
Gonna take a while longer.
Don't forget about me.
Jacob Keane?
I'm Agent Henry.
I'm with the agency you used to work for.
What agency?
We're very impressed with what you did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The director would like to know if you'd entertain the notion of taking on a certain freelance assignment.
And why would I wanna do that?
'Cause you're a rich man now.
"I already was a rich man, Agent Henry."
You gave the money to Marta.
"After everything, don't you think it's the least she deserves?"
"Anyway, uh, Serena might be a little upset."
"Well, you were right."
She can stay in Charles' room.
It's getting crowded around here.
No kidding.
"Throw in your ex-husband,"
And now we're a Nancy Meyers movie.
I hope you don't mind.
I know it's awkward.
"Well, I mean, it is a little unusual, don't you think,"
For a doctor to move in to his patient's building?
"Well, not if he's the father of the patient's children."
What are you getting at?
Is it possible that...
Will's also trying to get close to you?
Absolutely not.
I'm the one that told William to stay away
If he couldn't make good
On the promises he made to the children.
And I'm sorry if this is uncomfortable for you.
"But if William wants to move in to be closer to the kids,"
I'm not gonna stand in his way.
Mmm.
Holland?
"Hi, it's Rufus."
Um...
I have a favor to ask.
...And the social scene at N.Y.U. Was criminal.
"Ten freshmen, a keg"
And a tub of hummus on a card table isn't a party.
It's a tragedy.
Hmm.
Gina Linetti is the real hero here.
- But isn't Gina Linetti more of a state of mind?
"Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today."
"Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital."
"Hey, how's the sheriff?"
"- Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!"""
So I think he's fine.
"Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well."
"- Oh, that's great."
- Yeah.
How are you doing?
"- Fine--you know, just getting bandaged up."
"Actually, can you give us a second?"
Thanks.
It hurts so bad.
I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
"- So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now."
"- Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me."
- I love you.
- I love you too.
"Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?"
- Yeah.
B positive.
"- Well, guessed wrong."
"Hey, Craig?"
"- Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back."
- How was Florida?
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.
"- Come on, man."
"- Now, before you say anything,"
I know we disobeyed a direct order.
I'll be careful.
What the hell?
You left me alone in a dance circle.
I was trapped in a ring of clapping strangers who wouldn't let me go unless I busted a move.
I have no moves to bust!
What happened back there?
I don't even know.
What's going on?
Huh?
You've been acting a little strange all night.
You made that comment about still gettin' crazy even when you're a mom.
It just got into my head.
"Then we went into the bathroom to drink,"
- and crazy girls in these crazy dresses...
"- [ Chuckles ] ...about to pound a giant bag of wine, and I saw myself in the mirror..."
[ Laughs ] I only saw the ceiling.
"I was like, glug, glug, glug."
Sorry.
Continue.
I have a baby at home.
"And here I am, in this slutty dress, ready to party my ass off in the bathroom of a bar, acting like..."
Like your mother did when you were a kid?
She was the Ultimate Party Slut.
And that's not coming from me.
That was an actual title she won in Daytona.
You think Adam should back off?
Duh.
"Check the Magic 8 ball, buddy."
[ Gasps ] All signs point to Pete.
- Adam liked Kim first.
"- Well, too bad."
Kim digs Pete.
I'm thinking of a few of you specifically when I say that last part.
"Hey, hey."
Are you at all qualified to be teachin'?
"I never use the word ""teach."" I always say ""instruct."""
Nice try.
"You've made it a point to turn others against me, and I don't understand why."
I've not.
You have.
"And as a result, I'm sad and alone..."
And I don't like it here.
Hello.
Hi.
I read  Obidant.
I really liked it.
I didn't realize it had come out already.
About two weeks ago.
Huh.
"Listen, it's nothing personal, but..."
"I'm really trying to do my best up here, and part of that means not getting involved with anybody in, say, a human way."
"So if you'd like, you could come visit me at my office."
This is not my office.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Please don't act like somebody who doesn't know how to handle themselves.
I don't know what you mean.
Act as though you attend these things all the time.
How?
Feel like you don't want to be here.
Like me.
See how little I wanna be here?
But I very much want to be here.
"Oh, Jonathan."
Are you proud of me?
[Siren wailing]
Hey.
You locate the captain?
No.
Not yet.
"Knocked on his door, no answer."
Checked his car.
It was in his parking space.
Just got the key to his condo from the building super.
Let's do this.
[Groans]
He's down!
Radio for backup.
I'm going to need backup and an ambulance at the captain's residence.
[Door closes]
He's alive.
His housekeeper's not.
He wanted the coins that were stolen from the jeweler.
I told him Farley Kolt had them.
"And he said he found Kolt in Los Angeles, spent three days with him, and was sure he didn't."
You might want to check with LAPD if Kolt's body has been found.
I doubt he left him alive.
"And if he didn't wind up with the coins, who did?"
Maybe he got rid of them before this guy caught up with him.
I don't think this guy thought so.
That's why he's here in Portland.
He had photos of all of us.
"Me, Nick, and you, captain."
They were taken by a private investigator from New York.
His body was found this morning at a downtown hotel.
And we found a camera in the trunk of a rental car.
Downloaded the photos.
"[laughs] Yeah, you mean, whenever Seth would let me."
Bought you a souvenir.
"Aw, shucks."
It's everything I ever wanted.
"Everybody needs their Shangri-La, kid."
- You ever see that YouTube video?
- YouTube?
"- What, are you watching YouTube now?"
"- Yes, I am."
"And they got this one, shows this dog, he runs right out in traffic, right out in the middle of the freeway, cars and trucks comin' from every angle, just to save the other dog's life."
"Okay, YouTube is a masturbatory wormhole."
The point of the story is  he does whatever it takes to save his pal.
Like nothin' else in the world matters.
Nothin'.
Whatever happened to that Seth and Richie?
[phone vibrating]
"You know he's not going to answer, right?"
He knows you betrayed him.
"I'll talk some sense into him, all right?"
Show him we can all do this.
"You really think you can live happily ever after with him, don't you?"
I can sure as hell try.
[phone beeps]
- [Seth] Yeah.
- Seth?
!
Seth.
"- Hey, listen to me."
- It's okay.
I know why you did it.
Just meet me back at Uncle Eddie's.
"Okay, you got it."
"A jerk and Greek bro, and the rest of Omega Chi."
I had a lot of good times there.
It's gonna be a hard decision.
"I don't want it to be about you, or Evan or my dad."
"You know, I just gotta... do what feels right."
Or you'd be picking Kappa Tau.
Need a drink?
"I could use 'bout a million drinks, I've been running around all night."
What do you want?
Sparta hooch?
"Actually, I brought my own."
Nice flask.
"Sorry, I crossed the line, I didn't mean to..."
Apology accepted.
To a long and meaningful friendship.
"Right, friendship."
I gotta go back upstairs.
Find someone.
"Which is why I think in many ways,"
Ferris Bueller is my generation's Gatsby.
So... do you think that Gatsby is really great or just a totally decent guy?
Would you excuse me?
I need to find a bathroom.
I don't think you're heading in the right direction.
Sure I am.
I've seen a lot of people round here.
"Maybe you should use the one upstairs, it's much nicer."
- There's pot pourri.
- That won't be necessary.
"No, you can't go in there."
- Why not?
- A girl got sick.
I can see through... anything.
May I help you?
Where's Vanessa?
Vanessa?
What can she do for you that I can't do?
"I can do everything she do, honey, and a whole lot better."
"Walking around here, thinking she cute... showing them little pencil legs."
"Honey, I seen better legs on a pool table."
And another thing...
"Vanessa this, Vanessa that..."
talking about how cute she is.
I've seen something at the zoo cuter than she was.
"Come on, get in there with your half-dead self."
Thank you.
Let me tell you something.
Here's my phone number.
"Call me, sweetie."
"We can get together, have champagne at my house."
"The bubbly kind, you know?"
"And I got one of them little bikini nighties, you know?"
See-through.
"We now run the market in D.C., Baltimore... and Philadelphia."
"At the rate we're going, in three months... we'll be ready to make the move on New York... because if I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere."
Goldilocks.
"Hello, Mr. Byers."
How are you?
That's great.
The boat comes in tonight.
You brought me back something?
Nothing.
We're just about to have lunch.
Hey!
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- Him hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
- If you're concerned with the truth...
why did you lie about me?
- Your name didn't even come up.
- Not the gun thing.
With Sharon!
What you said to her about me and Jordan Catalano.
- What are you talking about?
"- l heard her, Brian."
You told her terrible things.
Okay.
"Oh, yes."
One minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party?
's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losing' her marbles?
"Well, obviously she wanted to have the party?"
before the move.
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favourite since kindergarten.
"Hey, hey."
"Come on, Potato Head."
"If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me."
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
"Come on, guys."
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
"But what ifAndy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?"
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
"Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced."
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
"That's what we're made for, right?"
Pardon me.
"I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!"
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Yeah.
Previously on Gilmore Girls:
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved and...
Jess was driving and you had an accident?
But I'm fine.
What accident?
Jess was driving Rory's car and he crashed it.
- Have you talked to Dean?
"- No, he gets home tomorrow."
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.
"If you hadn't brought him here, this wouldn't have happened."
This is my fault?
- What did you do to your arm?
- Here.
- What is this?
- Just read it.
"Now I have to find Jess, and I have to make sure that he's okay... and if that cuts into your screaming time, that's just too damn bad."
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!
Not long after the accident happened...
"Luke walked him straight to the bus station... stuck the kid on the bus, sent him home to his mom."
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.
Okay.
Do you wanna come in?
All I know is that Jess is gone.
"Well, what will we do for entertainment around here?"
Beats the hell out of me.
- Where is this place?
These Jew broads got alotta money.
Maybe the family owns the whole fuckin' block.
"You're liable to end up with a big fuckin' score here, ya motherfucker."
See!
You with your fucking mouth!
"I had a meeting with Tuddy around 11:00, and here I am a backup guy for Tommy."
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to get away.
I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.
"When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check."
Have some coffee. lt'll wake you up.
"Joe, can we have the check?"
What are you doing?
-l got to go.
"-Go where, Henry?"
We just got here.
I got that thing.
I gotta go.
"Alright, wait a couple of minutes and we'll all leave together."
"Ok, this way you don't go out like a bunch of hobos, staggerring out one at a time, eh?"
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
"You don't mind, do you?"
That's very annoying.
"Good, huh?"
"You'd probably do alot better with Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table."
-Ready?
"-Henry, lighten up..."
We just got here.
"Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!"
"- O, who hath done this deed?"
- Nobody.
I myself.
Commend me to my lord.
Why... how should she be murdered?
"Alas, who knows?"
You heard her say herself it was not I.
She said so:
I must needs report the truth.
She's a liar gone to burning hell:
T'was I that killed her.
"O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!"
She turned to folly;
and she was a whore.
"Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil."
- She was false as water.
- Thou art rash as fire to say... that she was false.
"O, she was heavenly true!"
Cassio did top her:
ask thy husband else.
"O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell but that I... did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity."
- Thy husband knew it all.
- My husband!
- Thy husband.
- That she was false to wedlock?
"Ay, with Cassio."
"Nay, had she been true..."
If heaven would make me... such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite...
I'd not have sold her for it.
My husband!
"Ay, 'twas he that told me on her first."
What?
With the money from this.
My girlfriend needs bigger boobs.
It's the first thing I'm buyin'.
What about you?
I like my boobs.
"So your girlfriend just straight up said, honey, buy me boobs?"
"Naw, she didn't know about it, but she's mad at me, so,"
I'm gonna surprise her.
"Hey, turn around for a sec."
Where'd you get your boobs?
"Yours are real, huh?"
Nice.
"Riley, if you don't stop looking at my boobs,"
"I will uppercut your dick,"
I swear to God.
That would hurt.
Is everything okay?
"Yeah, Riley's just telling me about how he's buying new boobs for his girlfriend."
"What, is she mad at you or something, Riley?"
Yeah.
She mad at me 'cause I wanna go to Mars.
This just keeps gettin' better and better.
Wait.
You were serious?
"Yeah, and I signed up on a program, where you can win a one-way trip to Mars."
I think it's like a nine-month ride in space.
"And she don't understand why I wanna do it, but I'm like, come on, man."
It's Mars.
"Like, I could be the Magellan of space."
"I mean, I might not actually be Magellan."
I'm sure I'd be like his first mate or somethin'.
"Nah, you should frame it, or take it to one of those places where they encase stuff in plastic."
I'm a key employee.
Gaming Commission says key employees... aren't allowed to wager at the casino that employs them.
This was given to you by somebody who was repaying a debt.
But they're gonna have me on video cashing the thing in.
That doesn't look good.
"No, no, no."
"Hey, man, you want to make a little money?"
Yeah.
"Cash this in for me, I'll give you 10%."
That's 200 bucks.
"There's a catch, right?"
No catch.
He's just lazy.
'Cause he's lazy.
"That's hard, man."
Right.
Two thousand bucks.
How 'bout that?
"So, how are things going?"
I was gonna head over to my dad's and start clearing the place out.
"Ah, good move."
Mary's gonna go with me.
Ah.
It's easier to go in with someone else.
"- Yeah, I hear ya."
"- Hey, guys."
"I know you didn't find anything on that guy that took my wallet, but here's the thing."
"I've been looking all day for a betting slip, and then I remembered it's in my wallet."
"It was a five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Seahawks, Chargers, Lions, for God's sake."
It's the first time in my life I got 'em all right.
"Ticket's worth $2,000."
I'm gonna have some coffee.
"What do you want, some, uh, milk, or what?"
Milk?
Coffee's fine.
- Yeah.
I drink it.
I'm hip.
- (CLICKS FINGERS)
I don't know.
"This is espresso, you know?"
It's like coffee-zilla.
"I said, I'm hip."
So she moved me up a grade because I wasn't fitting in.
"So, now I'm even more not fitting in."
I was getting good grades.
"You know, like all A's."
"So, my mom says, ""You need stimulation."""
"And I go, ""No, I'm stimulated enough right now."""
- That's for sure.
"- She goes,"
"""Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge."
"""You need a challenge."" So, now I'm challenged, all right."
"I'm challenged to hold on to my lunch money, because of all the big mooses who wanna pound me because I'm a shrimpy dork who thinks he's smarter than them."
"But I don't think I am smarter, I just do the stupid homework."
If everyone else just did the stupid homework they could move up a grade and get pounded too.
Is there anymore coffee?
"Look, it's really none of my business, kid, but, um, who cares what these creeps think, you know?"
They don't decide who you are.
You do.
You are who you choose to be.
(CLATTERING)
Did you hear that?
- Take yourself way back.
"Look who is here, Miss Sunshine."
"- Hello, Jocelyn."
- Hi.
How is everything at the mental ward downtown?
"You know, reigns, but always a learning experience."
You're a tripper!
That is lot 163.
"Jocelyn, where have you been?"
Kim Basinger needed to go up on that wall hours ago.
She's the cornerstone of this entire operation.
What could've...
- possibly hold you up?
"- Well, I guess you haven't heard?"
- Heard what?
"- Oh, nothing."
Just the revolutionary new nail color from Mac.
Everyone's freaking out.
Chi Chi fainted.
You should've said that right away.
I'm gonna have to have someone messenger me some.
- Where did you learn that from?
- You know...
- tricks and betrayals.
- But it can be tricky sometimes...
- to take yourself at him.
- I'll try not to.
You've been upstairs?
"If you get the chance, there's a fantastic photo exibition... up there, it is brilliant I think you'll really love it."
Reminded me of you.
I've wrapped it up downstairs.
Maybe we can...
He's required to call on the widow.
Is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
Standard  Poor's going to lower the city's credit rating.
We're going to close two firehouses.
Results: 150 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit to run the San Francisco Ballet.
The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
- And a drug dealer.
- And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but he's very welcome."
"The stock exchange, where are they removing to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
As to these works... they're for you... because you and the piano will always be as one.
"[ Chattering, Indistinct ]"
[ Both Laughing ]
Ohh!
Here's the hermit crab.
"Ah, gentlemen."
"From the sounds of this evening's revelries, your soiree was eminently successful."
- My congratulations.
"- Oh, thank you."
The man is positively aglow.
"We must be better at ""morale-ing"" than we thought, Hawk."
"Major Giggles here wasn't even at the party, and we cheered him up by remote control."
"Hey, Beej, I got a great way to end the war."
We shell North Korea with crabs.
"No kidding, Charles."
You missed some good food and a great time.
"Thank you, gentlemen, but you need not concern yourselves."
"I'm doing just fine, thank you."
Each of us must dance to his own tune.
"Gentlemen, this way please!"
"Xiao Si, attend to the customers!"
"My lord, have a drink"
"Hurry up, Xiao Si!"
"Coming, coming!"
"Gentlemen, please take a seat!"
Very Good!
"Master, you're very skillful!"
Why are you still here?
Didn't they tell you to get off?
Y es!
Y es!
"In looks I mean, and the way she talks."
I wouldn't love anyone with a character like mine.
"Charles, we're going to have a heavenly time alone."
"When, next morning, I saw Julia drive from the forecourt and disappear..."
"I felt a sense of liberation and peace such as I was to know... years later, when after a night of unrest the sirens sounded the ""All Clear'""."
I believed myself very close to heaven during those languid days at Brideshead.
It is thus I like to remember Sebastian... as he was that summer when we wandered alone through that enchanted palace.
Welcome!
Come inside please!
Come in and have a drink.
This way please.
Something's wrong.
They're too busy!
There's too many waiters!
White Tiger!
Give yourself up!
We'll get you!
There's no escape!
Bounty hunters from six provinces!
Seems like the end of the line for us.
Be careful!
Get us?
Never!
White Tiger!
White Tiger!
Split!
Mr. Huang...
What is it?
I'm there for the money.
Come in and get it.
I just scared him off.
"♬ Without a word, it keeps growing ♬"

♬
♬ I don't know the reason ♬

This place is really extraordinary.
How could there be such a place like this?
It's pretty enough to make me faint.
Then come again.
"People of Urk believe that if they take the pebbles from this beach, they will be able to come back here for sure."
Here.
"You just lied, didn't you."
"If what you said were true, you think there will still be pebbles left here?"
They would have been all gone.
The people who came back must have put the pebbles back to their rightful place.
"Yeah, well, I get that a lot."
"Actually, can you help me with one more thing?"
I'm not a very good typist.
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.
Is there any way you could type up an e-mail for me?
Don't be upset with me.
Arianna...
"Arianna, what are you talking about?"
What are you doing here?
That e-mail I had your little girl type...
It went to a crime boss named tom harper.
William gerwin got his parole by agreeing to testify
In an organized crime case.
He sent away one of tom harper's top lieutenants.
Harper never knew who the snitch was.
"That is, until now."
"Oh, my god, you do know"
"What that man is gonna do to gerwin, don't you?"
Absolutely.
"And by the way, he's already done it."
Gerwin is already dead?
It happened about an hour ago.
That man took everything from me.
There's no way I could let him take
"Everything from my dad, too."
I want what he did to remain a secret.
"Well, I'm sure it will."
Now...
Maybe...
Maybe there's no reason for anyone to know now.
Good.
But there is one person who deserves to know the truth...
Yeah.
He's an animal.
And I sorta get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up.
Ouch.
Yeah.
"So, how do I fix it?"
You get a new partner.
"Yeah, I'd like that, but I don't think that's gonna happen."
Well...
I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL.
"So, you're going to have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on some anti-inflammatories."
"Can I get those, uh, to go?"
Please?
I'll be back.
"Hey, stay."
I'm not a dog.
Stay.
What happened to you?
Oh.
"Uh, I blame you."
"I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks, all the fun we've been having together."
All right.
"Well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo, I'd love to know what's going on here."
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
"Department of Public Safety's trying to figure out what the hell happened,"
Where's Chin and Kono?
"Inside, getting background."
Is that your sister in the car?
"Yeah, I just came straight from the airport."
"You realize if she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her in the car like that?"
"Can we focus, please?"
Yeah.
I think he's going to quit his job.
"I'm sorry, Maggie."
I gotta go stop him.
(INAUDIBLE)
"Ted, I had to leave the bar, but it's okay."
I left Maggie with Robin.
You left Maggie with Robin?
Relax.
I've got things under control.
You don't understand the situation.
This girl is like a super-powered man magnet.
"Oh, Teddy."
I know a little something about man magnets.
"You see, your friend may be one of those magnets that can hold up a picture of your kids on the fridge, but I'm one of those magnets that can pick up cars in a junkyard."
- Who's this?
"- Robin, this is Jim, a good friend of mine from work."
"Oh, well, hello there. (GIGGLES)"
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, boy."
"What does being ""ready"" even mean?"
"I mean, I thought I was ""ready"" last year."
I wound up getting left at the altar.
"I'll be honest, guys."
I'm a little scared.
"Okay, Louis, then Betty."
"We're all scared, Professor Mosby."
Doesn't being scared let you know you're on to something important?
Yeah.
"I mean, if you're not scared, you're not taking a chance."
"And if you're not taking a chance, then what the hell are you doing?"
Right?
"I think you're ready, bro."
"Sir, you are watching, arent you?"
I know that you might be very happy.
But you might be thinking why..
..your Krishna didnt come back.
Just few more days.
We are destined to stay away forjust few more days.
III definitely fulfill the promise that..
"..I made to sister-in-Iaw, sir."
III definitely come back.
III definitely..
"III definitely come back, sir."

"darling, I missed you everyday!"

"darling, I missed you everyday!"
"finally, I met you after so many days!"
Whenever I had missed you!
"They're called ""roving bugs""."
It's a technique used to remotely activate a phone's mic and eavesdrop on the owner.
The FBI's been doing it for years.
Did one of the Seleção do this?
Dunno.
Micchon?
Any luck?
Got it!
"It's from No. 01. ""Request MPD to investigate Eden of the East."
What?
!
What does he want with Eden?
Takizawa-kun?
What's wrong?
Thought I bailed on you?
You had this poster in your other movie theater too.
Somehow it seems like they're linked to my movie-related memories.
What now?
It'll take some time for your friends to wire money.
I've got enough cash for us to take the Chinatown bus.
You wanna wander around the city for a while?
But-
I think I might've lived around here when I was a kid.
And I'm curious about that room...
Maybe I can find some proof before my past disappears forever.
"didn't you say ""it doesn't have a golden ring""?"
Did you mean...
This is Juiz.
Hey babe.
Something really neat's about to happen.
Do tell.
The son of the hardline party's leader is the culprit behind the missile attacks.
"Oh, shit"
# There goes the charabanc... #
"Has anyone ever told you, you have beautiful tits?"
"Yeah, loads of people."
And skin so pale you can see the veins.
"Well, my Auntie Kim got skin cancer off the sunbed so I don't use them."
"And spray-on looks shit, so..."
- What's your game?
- It's OK.
Um... he's my brother.
There's something really wrong with him.
- He really should have mentioned it.
- What?
"Um, he's really, er... passive aggressive."
"Basically, he's just a knob."
I don't care.
"It's only for an afternoon and I've got a regular fella, anyways."
- So...
- Classy.
"Still, plenty more fish in the sea, eh?"
Come on.
You all right?
What are you talking fish for?
Is there anything we can get you?
He needed to feed.
"So, you're saying we should have let him tear that girl's throat out?"
"No, I'm saying he can't survive like this forever."
"OK, but we can't turn him out onto the streets."
He isn't safe.
"Mitchell isn't safe with another vampire in the house, not while he's feeding."
"Annie's right, I'm just about holding it all together, and he brings"
"- chaos here, I'm sorry."
- What are you gonna do?
"Well, I have a plan, i do."
But I need money.
I need it fast.
I was thinking about that guy who wanted the snowmobiles.
- Yeah.
- You think he's still interested?
"Yeah, I think so, but you'd have to find some way to deliver 'em."
Set it up.
Set... it... up.
"- [ Dick ] $100,000?"
- That's right.
"You wanna sell me a lotto ticket worth $6.4 million for $100,000?"
Correct.
I want out.
"However, this is a one-time-only offer, Dick."
"I want the money, I want it tonight at the station."
"If I hear any excuses, any bullshit like, ""I can only get part of it""... or ""I need more time,"" the deal is off."
- Be reasonable.
It'll take days -
- Deal's off.
"- I'll get it, I'll get it."
- Good decision.
"[ Russ ] Now, I believe that i have solved all of our problems."
[ Crystal ] What century is this guy in?
"Put a motor on it, Jake!"
A year and a half behind this freak.
"One, I found a buyer for the snowmobiles, a guy in Colorado."
"I'm renting a trailer, and i'm gonna deliver them myself."
- But why Colorado?
"- But, uh, uh!"
Number two: the lotto ticket.
I always mix that up.
Mm-hmm.
"Anyway, I suddenly found myself needing a G-7 encryption form."
Which are very hard to come by.
Try impossible.
But there was one left.
And as I'm reaching for it... this.. force of nature beats me to it.
"I mean, we laugh about it now, but the rest, as they say, is history."
I hate couples.
You asked how we met.
"Granted, you kind of had to be there."
"Oh, no."
"No, not you guys."
You're great.
Just couples in general.
"The Jamaican resort I went to last Christmas, it was couples only."
And you were flying solo?
Changed my perspective.
Couples everywhere.
It was crazy.
Look at this airport-- it's got every variety.
Like those guys--
Self-Important Pete and his Electric Lady.
"Course, they haven't spoken directly to each other since the brownout of '06."
Then there's those two--
Daddy Issues Debbie and her college professor Marty Midlife-- teaching her all he knows about advanced economics
- and the Kama Sutra.
- Wait.
"Tony, that's no couple."
They're clearly father and daughter.
Think so?
Yeah.
"Okay, I am, kinda, but that doesn't change anything."
I still plan on doing the best job I can do while I'm here.
How lucky for us.
I would never have taken this job if I didn't respect what I.A. does.
We investigate our own.
When they've done something wrong.
But I.A. also defends and clears the innocent when wrongly accused.
Nice.
You been practicing that?
- How'd it sound?
- Good.
But I'm not the one you need to convince.
Joe Penn was a whiner.
Wanted morphine for four stitches.
I handed him off to an intern.
What about Valerie McDougal?
Valerie was brought in about 1:00 a.m.
She was involved in the same bar fight as Joe Penn-- come on!
The bartender-- she was pretty messed up.
Two broken ribs and a busted lip.
"I wrapped the ribs, glued her lip, and gave her some pain meds and told her to take it easy."
Is Valerie still here?
No.
Her boyfriend came and picked her up around 3:00 a.m. boyfriend?
Yeah.
Some big ugly-looking cop.
- How'd you know he was a cop?
- Ha.
Flashed his badge.
How'd you know he was her boyfriend?
I saw 'em kissing.
- Anything else?
And my personal favorite is blaming the wife.
Pointing out all your little faults.
Leaving you to feel like you're the one with the problem.
"Do you just back into things and not look where you""re going?"
Look at that.
"That""s a serious..."
"You know how much that""s gonna cost?"
"- Maybe you""d be better off in a Chevy."
"- David, I work hard for my car."
A Mercedes was the first thing that let me know that I accomplished something.
I love my Mercedes.
"You should hire Bobbi, too."
Get some great stuff on Mike.
"You""ll need it when your custody fight gets ugly."
"I don""t want to fight with him anymore."
I want to be boring for a while.
"- I want to live a modest, uneventful life."
- What?
I met somebody.
Does this woman look familiar to you?
No.
And then he took me to a show.
Can you believe it?
And this has been going on for months?
Yeah.
"I couldn""t tell you because..."
"- he""s married."
"- He""s married?"
"But he hasn""t been in love with his wife for a long time."
"I mean, he""s only staying with her because of the kids."
They have kids?
"Well, three, but one of them is from his first wife."
Nothin.
I said I can't find anything wrong with her.
Mr. Smallwood.
I just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night.
Are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
"Listen, mister."
Connie called me.
"She told me that you check out, and that's good enough for me."
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
What she put in a diary you take above my word?
"Everything that happened that day, Roberts."
Now!
-l told you.
-The super says you were there twice.
The super says.
The snitch says in her book.
"What about what Roberts says, huh?"
All right.
"I was there before she died, okay?"
Okay?
And I brought her something.
I was desperate to break it off with this girl.
"What happened, Roberts?"
Now!
I bought her a bag of quinine.
"I brought her a beat bag, looks and tastes like dope."
She's not going to know it's not dope until after I leave.
I needed to talk to her. I needed to tell her how things were gonna be.
She wasn't gonna listen to me unless I did... .
Unless I gave her something.
"So I gave her the stuff, told her we were done..."
"... shefreaksout,thisandthat."
I'm gonna do myself in.
"Believe me, for her that was like going to the crapper."
That's how many times she threatened that.
And that's it.
"I broke it off with her, and I left."
"Why did you go back, Mike?"
Because I was worried about her.
Because exactly what I was afraid of actually happened.
I get there...
"I'm home, Ma"
"Bless you, son"
"Mummy, why is everybody screaming?"
"""Through the coming and going of times, of seasons..."""
"""may love never fade from hearts"""
"""Unto each other yive strength..."""

"""Unto each other grant succour"""
This hallowed home of ours... we hold sacred
Here we dreamt our dreams
3 large white rums.
With Pepsi
With Om...?
Shut up.
I got To talk To him... about Nitu.
"Besides, we brothers are meeting up after years"
It's a new drink.
I ordered it.
"Yes, give it a try"
But I don't take cold drinks.
"Yive it a try, for our sakes"
Cheering a cold drink?
What drink is this?
This drink will become popular
Isn't she beautiful?
Very beautiful
"Jagadish, just look."
She's exquisite
"What are you staring at, Jags?"
So beautiful
Because blood relations never break.
Good bye!
Sheen!
Sheen!
- Shadab!
- Yes!
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.
"Son, I want to talk something important with you."
"Yes, tell me!"
I was having a talk with your father regarding your marriage.
What have you to tell?
"Mother, this is a matter of the house."
I shall accept whatever you and father decide.
This is your generosity!
Yet we feel we should know your views.
We wish to talk about your proposal with Sheen.
Do you like Sheen?
"Mother, you know that I don't like interference in my work.-Yes."
"So, how can I interfere in matters between you and father?"
I am okay with whatever your decision might be.
- Bye!
- Be happy!
"If we could ask sheen, just once."
Sheen likes India very much!
She tells people in Karachi that we are half Indians.
So let the marriage happen!
She will become a complete Indian.
"Brother, India and Pakistan's relations are so sensitive."
It can go bad anytime.
And...
Let the marriage happen in this country.

Has the gold arrived?
- Yes.
All right.
When can we pick it up?
Today itself.
I am floored!
"Not exactly, Baby."
You're vanquished.
What about the money?
- Ask Tiwari.
He looks aRer the transactions and accounts.
All right.
But who will come to pick it up?
Balwant.
At Malighat.
Sharp 4 p.m.

- Yes.
I wish to speak to Inspector Vijay Varma from the special branch.
Go on. I am InspectorVerma speaking.
A gold consignment is arriving at Malighat at 4 pm.
Little appreciation of my cooking!
I want us to work together to remove the obstacles to Griff being rehired.
"Allen, I'm the obstacle."
- Last word?
- Last word.
You like the kielbasa?
- New chief came to see me.
- Gillray.
"He's planning on eliminating supervisory and middle management positions, so..."
I'm a supervisor.
"Allen, you gotta do your best to protect me, I..."
This is not the Allen Conner I know.
- He's my son.
- Mm-hmm.
You're not even a little ashamed of yourself maybe?
A little bit?
"He's in trouble, Frank, I know it and you know it, and I just, I..."
I just gotta keep him close.
"If I can, if we can do that, I can..."
I have a chance to help him.
"Otherwise, I don't know where he is, or"
- how to find him or he could be dead in...
"- OK, OK."
- OK?
What does that mean?
- OK.
Griff gets his job back and I keep mine.
"I won't forget this, Frank."
"Yeah, well, I'm going to try."
"I just, when I started these classes I had this feeling that it was all part of my destiny, but I didn't know how,"
- but now I do.
"- It's so great that you're back in school, Tash."
Carter?
Ben went into the storm drains at first and pierce.
The city doesn't have any cameras down there.
And there are literally thousands of exit points.
"Yeah, Ben knows that."
He's been doing this a while.
This is him.
I'm gonna join you in.
"Listen, Ben barely trusts me so he can't know you're on, okay?"
Understood.
Andy will run a trace.
"Ben, talk to me, man."
I want $2 million.
"Not enough for what I've been through, but it's the most I can carry."
"Ben, you know I can't ask the government for that kind of money."
This is not an official operation.
It's not my problem.
You get me the money or I call bin-Khalid's men.
I took one of their phones at the construction site.
"Please, man, listen, you're strung out"
And you're not thinking straight.
"Eric, I've never been more clear in my life."
Show up at the 7th street metro station with my money in one hour.
An hour?
"Ben, you got to give me more time."
For the government to find me?
"No, you show up on time with the money,"
You get the list.
"If any of those things don't happen, Eric,"
I will sell the list to bin-Khalid's people.
Period.
Ben!
- guinea-pig pie.
- Smells good.
You just accept that?
It's pecan.
How cuckoo do you think my country is?
It's come to this...
"""What's cooking"" and ""smells good"""
gets me in trouble?
"Mom, you're already cooking for tomorrow?"
Don't make a big deal.
My baby's graduating.
He won the award for Integrity and Character.
"""No absents, no tardies,"
"""respectful to students and teachers alike."""
"My school had an award like that, but instead of a sash, that kid got a punch in the mouth."
"Proud of you, though."
"Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face, a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?"
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid because he didn't want me dating his sister.
She was no nun!
"Jay, can you please take care of the steaks?"
Sure.
"On the eve of your big day, we're celebrating with rib eyes, and you and I are gonna have our first scotch."
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
I've been waiting to open a special bottle.
Huh.
Looks like the mice got into it.
"Hello, hello?"
!
Where's my son?
- Dad!
Alright mate?
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks you alright?
Got you a gift.
It's still in the shop.
Oh man that's perfect!
'Coz I can just collect it when I get yours next month.
No Laura?
"No, no, she had a work-thing and couldn't shift things around."
Couldn't shift things around?
"I'm not 6, Slade."
I'm only doing this for my mum.
Have you heard from Danny?
"No, has he not called?"
Maybe he couldn't shift things around.
"Hello, I'd just like to say a few words."
"You know it's a celebratory moment for a father when you look at your son, your baby, and you realize that he's reached the age where he can no longer call himself young."
"Because if he is becoming an old fart, then where does that leave me?"
A gravedodger?
"So I'd like you all please, to raise a glass."
- Ignore his crows-feet and his receding hairline.
- Thanks mate.
"And wish a happy birthday, to my little boy."
To Mark.
Happy Birthday!
"Sorry, sorry..."
I wanted to say something too.
"As you all know, we've had some difficult times in the past."
I have two sons.
Mark... and Jesse.
Hey mom...
But only one of them is here every year on his birthday.
I think it's just a question of joining them together...
legato.
Simplicity is the hardest thing.
It's the final thing.
"Well, er..."
"- Next week, then?"
- Yes.
"Good day, Your Highness."
"Monsieur, Baroness Dudevant is here."
Baroness Dudevant?
I don't think I know her.
"Well, send her in."
This is the first time I've found a use for my title.
You are incredible!
"I only need a minute of your time, then I'll go."
Very well.
I'll give you exactly one minute.
"I am leaving Pa... (PLAYS ""MINUTE WALTZ"")"
I am leaving Paris.
You can't have failed to notice I've been pursuing you.
I'm in love with you.
I don't know you at all...
(STOPS PLAYING)
"I don't know you at all, but I know this:"
you are great.
You have made a single instrument speak the language of God.
"And I wanted to learn it from your lips, you see."
"Anyway, you..."
"You don't want me and... it's become complicated, like everything between two people."
"It seems to me a pity, because it could have been so simple."
I'm begging you to give this up.
"I know that you're in need, with your children and your mother's funeral."
"""with the $12.95."
"And I got away with it."""
I had a gangster situation happen to me where I had to be gangster in the situation.
You just had to be.
"Sometimes you just gotta, you know, buck up and do what you gotta do."
I was trying to get a cab in February.
"The cabdriver saw me, looked at me, and then sped the hell off."
But he got caught at the red light that was right in front of me.
"So I was like, ""Oh, snap!"" So you know what I did?"
I went Denzel Washington Training Day on his ass right there.
I was like...
"""Okay, all right."""
"""Yeah, my nigga, my nigga."""
"""Yeah, so you're telling me"
"""you were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""That's what you're saying, right, huh?"
"""You were just gonna drive--"
"""That's what you saying."
Huh?
"""You were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""It's negative 20 degrees out here."
"""My fingers are about to fall off my hand,"
"""but you was about to drive the fuck off."
"""That's what you telling me, right?"
"""Okay, well, let me tell you something, Abu."
"""That's right."
"I said it, Abu."
"""You just live here."
I run shit here!
"King Kong ain't got shit on me!"""
He just ran the light.
He ain't want nothing to do with it.
That made me so happy.
"I was really, really happy."
That's why I'm here right now.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
I wonder if that person still reads my novels today.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
"I see, so Izumi-sensei, you too..."
"""Sensei""?"
"Oh, n-nothing!"
I knew you wrote novels on the web!
I-I see.
But to think I'd see the day where I could talk to you like this.
"Big Brother, why are you bothering me?"
You should just leave me alone.
I'm just...
Do I trouble you?
T-Trouble...
It's because you're my little sister.
And Mom asked me to take good care of you.
Is that your reason?
I still don't know what counts as taking good care of you.
So I just do things that I feel would count as such.
I don't get it at all.
"Other than that, I'm just lonely, after all."
I'd like to eat meals together with my cute little sister.
"And I want to take care of her, too."
"Even a troublesome little sister like this, who hardly ever talks to you?"
So you were aware of that.
I want us to get along.
Because we're family.
Are we a family?
Of course.
"I know I'm new here, but aren't dinosaurs extincted?"
- This one's about to be.
"- Heatwave, wait!"
"Look, if anyone sees you taking down that dino on your own, there goes your cover and your mission."
It's attracted to the light!
"Chase, take your lights!"
That got us attention.
Now what?
We need to lure him somewhere with no people around.
"Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!"
He's following but we still gonna need an assist.
I'm comm-link to Chief in.
Rescue headquarters.
Go ahead.
"Dad, OK, first, don't worry I'm with the Rescue Bots!"
What?
Who gave you permission to...
They did it.
I mean...
"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this but the Rescue Bots aren't robots, they're from another planet, they're aliens!"
How long have you known?
"Wait, you know?"
"Cody, where are you?"
"Chief Burns, if I may, we're headed westbound to Lake Street with the dinosaur in pursuit."
"A dinosaur, again?"
"Cody, you're driving, are you?"
No!
Why did we take the old squad car?
That's why.
I'll explain later.
"Cody, you jacked my ride?"
"Listen, the T-rex likes lights."
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
And that's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
"Right after I got here, I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup."
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
What's up?
Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You piece of shit!
you motherfucker!
Look at me!
I always wanted to be a gangster.
To me beinga gangsterwasbetterthan  being president of the United States.
Even before I went to the cabstand for an after-school job
IknewIwantedtobe partofthem .
it meant being somebody ina neighborhoodfullofnobodies.
They weren't like anybody else.
That's because he stepped in with the c-block.
Pete stepped in because Adam was too much of a wussy to talk to Kim himself!
- Ahem.
- We'll be right with you.
"Yeah, you guys good?"
Want a soda or anything?
Grayson:
No?
Great.
Why am I the only one looking out for Kim here?
"She wants tall, cool Pete, not lame, weird Adam."
You don't know the first thing about Adam!
You don't know the first thing about Pete!
"Hey, guys, do you like role-playing games and stories with dragons?"
"Get out of here now, please!"
Run for your lives!
"I'm hosting a trunk sale outside-- cigarettes, bad lite beer, and urine samples so clean you'd swear it was from the math club."
Parking lot. 10 minutes.
I think I'm having an asthma attack.
Leave now if you value your pants.
Just go.
Go.
"Dude, the cops are coming to..."
[ Inhales sharply ]
I can't lie to you.
Let's just... get in your car and see where the night takes us.
"Laurie, you're nothing like your mom"
- and you never will be.
- [ Sighs deeply ]
Where is your baby right now?
He's at home with a sitter.
"Where would Baby Laurie have been if her mother was out at a bar, partying?"
Any time you like.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."

"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
Yep.
Yep.
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
White Ford Fairmont.

"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it,"
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it, pulls out right in front of me and overtakes."
pulls out right in front of me and overtakes.
Did you get the make and the model?
"EJ Holden, green with a white roof."
Come in.
"Hey, Stephen."
- How are you?
- Good.
I just wanted to say I had a really great time with you the other night...
- on our date.
"- Me, too."
"Hey, did you get the flowers I sent?"
You sent.
Of course.
Thank you so much.
I love them.
"Um, then why are they in the trash?"
Can I be totally honest with you?
Molly put them in there.
She's a little bitter.
"Listen, I know it was just one date, and I don't want you to attach too much meaning to the flowers."
"Apparently, that's not a problem."
"Anyway, I was just wondering if, hopefully, there might be another opportunity to...."
"Well, someone is popular today."
Check it out.
These flowers kick those flowers' ass.
You want to know who they're from?
- Yeah.
- No.
"""Congratulations, you've been named ""to Manhattan Monthly's 'Ten Most Eligible' list, a who's who of the city's most datable professionals."""
I'm so excited for you.
She doesn't seem that bitter.
They are going to interview you and everything.
"Oh, you're gonna have your pick of any man in Manhattan."
"You know, I'm just... think I'm gonna..."
Okay.
About six years.
"You get some kind of sick pleasure from that, the boss' daughter?"
"""Boss""?"
I thought we were friends.
I love Mary.
And I think she loves me.
I want your desk cleaned out by tomorrow.
"After this is over, I'll be going back to Maine."
I don't wanna see you there when I go into the office.
How you feeling?
What's happening to me?
"- It's in her DNA, isn't it?"
- That's what makes her special.
Mum...
"I never believed that part of your story-- ""My grandfather was an alien."""
- Allie...
- Your dad--could he do things?
"I never saw it, but, yes, he could."
- But you never could.
- I can play drums and sing harmony.
A lot of people would tell you that's amazing.
There's you and me.
"The way I know where you are, how you're feeling, if you're safe."
I always figured that was just because I'm your only daughter and you love me so much.
"Yeah, I suppose it could be that."
"It's what made your dad sick, isn't it, doing these things?"
"You're not my dad, honey."
You've got a lot of other things in you.
"You've got Charlie's family, too."
MAN:
Everybody in position?
He's not gonna last much longer.
"Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely doesn't want you to know this, but he also smoked off and on."
"It all started when he was 13, on a camping trip in Minnesota."
"Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate."
It's summer vacation.
"Okay, but just one."
This is my first and last cigarette ever.
"And that was the first of many, many ""last cigarettes ever."""
That's it.
"I am done, I am out."
Last...
Cigarette ev-arrh!
"So, by that point, I'd heard it all before."
Last cigarette ever.
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked in six months.
Is this about the McRib?
"It's gone, dude, let it go."
"I'm worried about work, okay?"
"They just hired a new head of the legal department, and he's going to be letting people go."
So that's why you're worried?
The new head of the legal department is Arthur Hobbes.
"As in ""Artillery Arthur""?"
As in your former boss?
Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss
Marshall or anyone else had ever had.
"The last time Marshall worked for him, it ended like this."
I quit!
Yikes.
So does he hold it against you?
Worse.
"I'm sorry, who are you?"
"I'm, I'm Marshall Eriksen."
Who cares?
My Leno was great.
This is the guy that you hate.
So sad.
Wow this thing is everywhere.
"Hannah and Jesse, America's new sweethearts."
"Good night, everybody."
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
"Oh great I just took over ""most viewed"" from ""Kitty Kat Flushing a Toilet."""
Uh that just means that you're bigger than.
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
[Whispers] You should be proud.
What was I thinking inviting Jesse back in the band?
I mean Hannah's irresistible.
There's no way that he could.
Go against her feminine charms.
I just want to go home put the wig on.
And smack that home wrecker in the face.
You know as much as I'd love to see how that works.
I think you're freaking out for no reason.
I mean you can still date Jesse as Miley just not in public.
Why does my life have to be so complicated?
Oh yeah.
Poor little most famous 17-year-old in the whole world.
Now will you just focus on the positives okay?
We're both going to college together we both have wonderful boyfriends.
-Except for you're more...
-No.
No cracks about Oliver until I find something.
Equally embarrassing about Jesse.
Daddy?
"Your dad has a broken pelvis, which are the ring of bones around his waist."
Some of his blood vessels have also been damaged.
He's bleeding inside.
Can you fix it?
"We're gonna try, but he's lost a lot of blood already."
It's very serious.
It was supposed to be me.
"I was supposed to go get the pizza, but I-I... didn't want to go out in the rain."
"It's not your fault, and it's not your dad's fault."
"Hey, jerk-off!"
I can't drive for a week.
Not that I could anyway-- my car is totaled.
What was so important you had to be talking on the phone while driving!
Come on!
What was so damn important!
Hey!
That's enough!
"- Hey, get that guy away from me!"
- Shut up!
.
"Jason, hey, I know you're mad, but your father's condition is very serious, and your brother and sister need you right now, okay?"
"Come on, Jason, I'll take you to the Family Room."
"Dr. Kovac, one of your patients is getting agitated."
- Which one?
T- he girl from the nursing home.
"- She's in a coma, Inez."
- Not anymore.
- Where...
- I'm Dr. Kovac.
Wh-Where's my mom?
"Okay, keep your hands up as if you were holding a tray."
But the guys without motivation always get sucked into them.
So what should the guys with no motivation do?
"Unlike Sion, I've never wanted to be involved in troublesome things like changing the country."
Is there some place where I could just take afternoon naps and live my life without hurting anyone?
What?
Hey...
"Kiefer, did I say something strange?"
Are you almost ready?
"Oh, right!"
"Okay, Kiefer, come here a second."
- What?
"- Go on, go on."
Congratulations to you for your release.
Congratulations to me for my imprisonment.
- What's this?
"- Do you agree with this, as your request?"
Perfect.
Deal concluded.
What's this all about?
Written orders.
Release of Kiefer Knolles in exchange for Ryner Lute's imprisonment.
Who are you?
A fiend so great who can make direct deals with the military?
Not really.
"Why would you do that, Ryner?"
I betrayed everyone.
I got everyone killed...
People don't kill people.
Monsters do.
War is a monster.
Kingdoms are monsters.
Greed is a monster.
"My mother, on the other hand, resisted what she called the sly ways of the place with a fiery, feral determination."
"She dwelt in Moybeg, but she didn't live there."
And it seems she never gave Barnhill's letter to Emma.
Perhaps she felt that a note from beyond the grave was just too much for my sister to bear even as a grown woman.
What's this?
What do you think it is?
Stolen goods.
- Mrs. Coyne.
"- Rose, please."
Men are a deal more likely to do favours for a woman than for a man.
Did you want me to flirt?
My name is Andrew Black.
I'm the doctor's son.
He is REALLY nice.
Bailiffs!
What are you doing?
They've got the flag up.
"Well, they may put it down again."
Blirts!
Jail for our friend.
"I have to tell the truth, Seamie!"
You said that.
OK.
"You guys, he's being very annoying."
"Uh, Shel, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to me immediately afterwards?"
"Oh, no, sweetie."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
"I mean there's still a few girls in Detroit who think they had sex with Cleveland from ""Family Guy."""
Okay.
I want Danny to spend time with my son.
He promised that he would and now he's trying to pull out.
At ease.
The lieutenant will be with us a week or so until the Krauts ship him to the officers' camp.
Seems like all the rail road lines are fouled up.
Somebody blew up an ammunition train.
"Somebody, my eye."
The lieutenant did it.
Right in the station with 50 German guards around.
Glad to have you with the organization.
"Yeah, you're just in time for the Christmas pageant."
Looks more like the lost company of Tobacco Road.
He's an actor.
You should see him do imitations.
He can imitate anybody.
Do Lionel Barrymore again.
- Do Alan Ladd.
-Do Cary Grant.
"Hey, do Grable."
"Now, see here, Scarlet I'm crazy about you and always have been."
I gave you kisses for breakfast kisses for lunch and kisses for supper.
- And now I find that you're eating out.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Not Gable, Grable."
That's enough.
They were shot down two days ago and they've been on their feet ever since.
Price here will show you to your bunks.
"Fix them some tea, huh?"
We had a couple of unexpected vacancies.
Which will it be?
Upper or lower?
"Uh, it doesn't matter, just so I can get some sleep."
- Lieutenant Dunbar?
- Yeah.
"For example, once, when Charlie and I were at camp..."
"... Ilostmy swimtrunks,andI had  to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and..."
... Ijustcouldn'tenjoy the pool at all.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?
"No, no. ln this case, I think you would be the pool."
Maybe this was a bad idea.
"No, no, it's a great idea."
It's right up there...
"... withthewheel,fireandrefrigerators that give ice through the door."
-Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
-What?
Why?
You can't be with me without it being some competition with your brother.
It's not a competition.
"And even it was, shouldn't we do it first before you decide who wins?"
You are unbelievable.
-That could be taken a couple of ways.
-Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.
My eye!
"Man, I love sunsets."
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.
"It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know."
What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.
"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."
"Boy, I hope that's guacamole."

"I already work with the greatest detective in the world, and I cannot wait to get back home to her."
"But, sir, you should seriously consider Kendall for membership."
She is one hell of a detective and sneaky in all the right ways.
You're sure about this?
"Absolutely, sir."
"You just keep getting more and more interesting, Mr. Castle."
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.
Hayley: [Sighs] Okay.
Are you not packed?
I can't do it.
Pack you clothes?
Walk away.
"Hayley, I need to know what happened to me."
"Okay, there's one last thing."
"Just before you left to get your memories erased, you came to me with one final request."
Like what kind of request?
"That if you demanded to know the truth,"
I show you this.
What is this?
"It's a, uh, secret website on the dark web."
What's on it?
Not a clue.
You installed a password that only you would know.
"Called it ""Blair's combination."""
From a short story I wrote when I was 17.
Never saw the light of day.
What was that combination?
4 left... 17 right... 21 left.
[Beeps]
I'll step out.
"No, no."
"You've, um..."
President Choi Eung Chan!
He planned all this and..
Is this true?
Is it really the President?
The President?
!
Then to take the President down...
You purposely spread bribes around him to make him look corrupt?
Are you afraid?
Just please bring back honor to my dead brother.
Shaking the nation...
Is something that I don't want
I'm just asking to bring back honor to those dead soliders!
And...
"Please let's end it all, General."
General!
Young Joo...
Why did this happen?
Young Joo ssi...
Bad punk.
I told him not to run around the scene by himself so many times..
He never even listens to his director.
Bad punk.
I didn't even know it was about his father's case and blamed him for giving me too much work...
And vented my anger at him.
I'm sorry Prosecutor.
"Prosecutor, I'm so sorry."
"You, dead or alive, you're still like my son."
"What you couldn't finish, I'll do it for you."
The people who made you like this...
I'll catch all the bastards who did this to you and feed them prison rice.
The justice that you always wanted...
... whenI hadthechance to kill that man...
... alltheseyearslater...
... Ihadto do it .
I reckon I'll find out soon enough if God hold me to judgment.
But I'm glad I did it.
"I have to say, this is-- Well, it's a little unusual."
"Um, what shall I call this document?"
A pre-matrimonial stipulation agreement binding to both parties.
All right.
Where do we start?
First and most important...
... shemustbe availableondemand to the marriage bed.
-Except when I'd rather not.
-Agreed.
"And he will, of course, have accounts set up in my name..."
... atallthestoresandsalonsintown .
Of course.
Because she has to do the cooking and shopping for the house.
Only if you want to starve to death.
You'll want a chef and a maid.
-Trust me.
-Fine.
And he must absolutely stop spouting that maudlin poetry at all hours.
Only if she agrees to wear her wedding ring...
-... whenshe'soutinthepubliceye.
-l'll pick out the ring.
-Mm-mm.
-Agreed.
"is that it, then?"
-Can't think of anything else.
-Neither can I.
You both agree the wedding will be tomorrow...
"After he died, I came back here and lied."
And I've been lying ever since.
You want the truth.
"And when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
-They want anything but the truth!
-Connie!
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
I told you that I'm committing myself to you all the way... that I plan to worry about you and take care of you.
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael!"
-How's that?
-Fine!
I'll get it.
-Merry Christmas!
-Aren't you going to invite me in?
Not very friendly after practically breaking my back getting here.
"Hi, Joey!"
"Say, there's a blizzard blowing out, a big one!"
You got a drink?
I'm froze.
You're nowhere near froze with all you've got in you already.
I see the Navy hasn't managed to cure you of drinking.
Cure me?
"Honey, the Navy started me in tricks you never heard of."
Say!
"You sure made a lot of changes around here, ain't you?"
You bet we have.
"And, for a start, you can pick up your things and go."
Ain't nobody going to tell me what I can't do in my own house.
-This isn't your house anymore!
-I don't care what you did.
"- Speak for yourself, okay?"
Can you please just open it?
- For me?
- What is it?
"It's a pony, baby."
"I don't-- Come on, for me, please just..."
These are White House passes.
Yeah.
That might mean we're going to the White House.
And that your dad here has a job interview with the Secret Service.
"This is really cool, John."
"- You're just gonna stick with ""John""?"
- Yeah.
"Now The Roger Skinner Show, today live from the White House."
"Hi, folks."
President Sawyer is one of those academics who never served a day in his life and now he wants to tell the military how to run things?
He's going to make peace with Iran because he has friends there now?
Come on.
"Sir, I have the first lady for you."
Remind me again why we let these guys broadcast from our lawn.
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?
I knew it was something.
"Hey, babe."
How are the French taking it?
The treaty's gonna be a tough sell here.
- How's it going there?
- Raphelson is the key.
"We lose him, then we lose that Southern voting bloc."
"If this goes down, you're looking at a one-term president."
I know two people who wouldn't have a problem with that.
Do you still have that watch I gave you?
"For Claytor, everyday is part of a grand-if solitary-adventure."
He's been away form home for nearly three years and it could be three more before he returns.
"From Africa, he will head east to the four remaining continents between him a home."
Claytor has grown accustomed to being a stranger everywhere he goes
but he is also changed by every place he visits and every person he meets.
"I think there's a part of me that's become a little bit African, because the Africans have a saying which is when you ask them when they'll come back or what time something will be ready they'll smile and look at you"
and say anytime from now.
So when people ask me when I' going to get home sometimes I just can only say anytime from now.
"Look, right there."
A chamber.
Okay.
I see it.
Go on.
Get off my foot.
"Oh, will you--?"
Go on.
Do you see anything?
Spiders.
"Now get moving, MacGyver."
"Get moving, don't dawdle."
All right.
Look.
Huh?
There.
A sigma.
Ah.
"Do you recall your Greek, MacGyver?"
Sigma is the letter...
S. Yes.
As in Solon.
It says
That's terrified.
She highlight a subway stop in Queens?
There's got a friend over there.
Field cards from a patrolman Rossi of the 11-6.
You could have knocked me over with a feather.
"I mean, Gillian Booth walking these streets?"
Me and my wife are big fans.
"Now, she promised she'd send me a picture."
"But after seeing how confused she was, I wasn't so sure she'd remember."
But sure enough.
In what way confused?
Like a lost kid.
She said she got on the J train by mistake.
She was wandering around for about an hour.
- Was she on anything?
- Not that I could tell.
"I mean, she knew her name."
She just didn't know how to get home.
It was kind of sad.
- See?
- Great.
"What, did you put her in a cab back to the city?"
"Uh, no."
"I called the bus, sent her over to st."
Jim's.
I gave her a bunch of my cards too.
"Next time she gets lost, she can call me."
"I'll come pick her up, I'll take her home."
Great artist like her.
"EMERGENCY ROOM SAINTJAMES HOSPITAL THURSDAY, MARCH 2"
You know I can't tell you anything about Ms. Booth without a waiver.
"You know, I don't think I phrased my question right, doctor."
We'd like to call...
"I forget his name, but that guy."
"Prosecution calls to the stand town coroner,"
Dusty Diamond.
This ought to be swift and painfree.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?"
"Remember, darling, if they ask, tell them everything, everything."
Well... do you swear?
Hm?
"Oh, um..."
"Well, I'd like to know what I'm swearing to."
"Um, perhaps I could read it."
'Cause I can't very well give a good book recommendation if I haven't read it.
"Mr. Diamond, please."
"Yes, I swear."
Hm.
"Mr. Diamond, so nice to have you today."
Mm-hm.
Let's start with:
Were you friends with the Mayor?
Friends.
"Mmm, mmm..."
Thirsty.
"Friends, ah."
"Um, yes."
"Can we get to the meat of the matter, sir?"
Yes.
What was the cause of death?
Cause.
"Well, um, first of all,"
"I, uh, ascertained that his heart would beat no more of that beautiful blood and then I further ascertained that his lungs would breathe in no more of that lucky air."
Lucky because it was allowed to go inside of him.
But the reason I was chosen to do that operation is that I can read.
"One might even say that I'm the pick of the ""litterate."""
"Evening, laddies."
Say howdy to Sergeant Vickers.
He's our friendly neighborhood retention officer.
Too bad he didn't come to a friendly neighborhood.
No offense.
We just don't like war-to-war salesmen.
Hey!
You're a great bunch of kidders.
I like a good joke myself.
"In that case, may I present Major Winchester?"
Major Winchester.
You must be a career man.
L... [Chortles]
[Chortling Continues]
Let me ask you something.
Doesn't it bother you to sweet-talk young kids... into risking their lives all over again?
"- Hey, I'm just offering a little free advice."
- Like how to avoid old age.
Ah.
Nothing I like better than the free exchange of ideas.
That's Sergeant Hutchinson over there.
He's on that short-timers list of yours.
"Oh, yes."
Excuse me.
Enjoyed shooting' the breeze.
- Oh.
Wait a minute.
"- Let the man be, Pierce."
We all got our little tasks in life.
"- Incidentally, there's a meeting in my office tomorrow at 0900."
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.
It's real.
That's why he's called Superman.
"Hey, Freddy, where did you find this place?"
Johnny Ola brought me here.
"I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!"
"-I see it, but still don't believe it!"
"-50 bucks, Pat."
"Roth won't go here, but Johnny knows these places!"
"-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it."
-I want to see him break a brick!
"Relax, we're taking you to the hospital."
...and you'll continue to get those.
I don't believe that President Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba as we have over one billion dollars invested in this country.
The American public believe in non-intervention...
Fredo!
Where are you going?
"I'm getting a real drink, because I can't..."
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.
"Reeves, what's the protocol?"
How long should we stay?
I think a half hour ought to do it.
Just long enough to bring in the New Year.
It's New Year's Eve.
"Come on, just for a minute."
There's a plane waiting to take us to Miami in an hour.
Don't make a big thing about it.
"I know it was you, Fredo."
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!
"Well, we must play to our strengths, must not overreach ourselves."
- Right.
- Er...
How does 12 boiled eggs sound?
"Er, usually like this..."
"Nice gag, Eddie, and totally unexpected."
"Perhaps a little sophisticated for BBC2, though."
I can just see it now.
"""How's the golf going, Tarbs?"""
"""Oh, really?"""
"""Do you wanna hear a stupid joke about an Irishman being stupid?"""
- Can't wait.
"- What do you suggest, then?"
"You're supposed to be my friend, you freeloading parasite."
Smelly Eddie to the rescue.
"When I was watching TV-am in the lav this morning,"
I saw this fantast ad for a new mag called Poncy Cooking.
"And when you buy part one, you get part two completely free."
That sounds like a marvellous offer and one not to be missed.
"Actually, it's a clumsy setup for a gag later on."
"- Oh, what a shame."
- Yes.
- Let's go to the newsagent's.
"- Okey-dokey, diddly squat."
Over we go.
Don't ever say I'm not there when I'm not needed.
You're not there when you're not needed.
Thank you.
"- Ready, Eddie?"
- Ready-weddy.
- Let's go.
"- Right, then."
It's all in there.
I don't know what to say.
"That it, then?"
Yeah.
WALDRON:
So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again.
And then I did.
"In a photo, in a briefing room."
And I was being sent to meet him with a gun.
ARNOTT.
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
(Mumbles)
What's he saying?
"This is a young Ronan Murphy, shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson."
What'?
They knew each other?
Did you fabricate the improper relations
- between you and DS Arnott'?
- No.
Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you'?
- What is your verdict?
- Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
Your...dinner invitation.
You're a married man.
This is it.
Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence.
And now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
"I give up, Higgins."
What is it you want from me?
"Are you, by any chance, the T. Magnum who played on the American bridge team... in Sao Paulo in '72?"
"Say good-bye, Higgins, because the answer is no."
I will not make a fourth for your Wednesday afternoon bridge club.
- I don't play with amateurs.
- We are all Life Masters.
"- Well, then, you're better than I am."
"- Magnum, I wouldn't stoop to ask if it weren't a bloody emergency."
- What happened?
Your fourth die?
- Yes.
"Higgins, uh, I'm sorry."
Look.
I was just joking.
I quite understand.
Look.
"I am on an investigation, but if I can wrap it up by tomorrow afternoon, I'll play."
Splendid.
"Now, what can I do to assist you in your work?"
What do you know about Robert Caine?
"Well, only what I've read."
A rather obscure judge till his recent nomination to the Supreme Court.
"However, those who should know speak very highly of him."
- Shall I pull some clippings?
- That would be very nice.
Thank you.
- But I have to leave in an hour.
- I'll have them ready for you and warm up the Ferrari.
Splendid.
"Higgins, who died?"
Mr. Blackmore.
Everybody out in the trenches.
Quick.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Do you want to get killed?
Not particularly.
"Hey, you two."
Outside with you.
- Must you two always be the last?
"-Oh, yeah?"
You try jumping in those trenches first.
Everybody jumps in on top of you.
How do you think I got my hernia?
Ugh.
"Go on, let's go."
Aha.
Aha.
Aha.
So it got to be Christmas Day in Stalag 17.
"You ask me, it was more like the 4th of July with all the fireworks that were to go off and bust the camp wide open."
It sure started off innocently enough with a party going on in every barracks.
"I love you, I love you"
Is all that I can say
"I love you, I love you"
The same old words I'm saying in the same old way
"I love you, I love you"
Three words that are divine
And now my dear I'm waiting to hear
The words that make you mine
"Come on, Animal, let's trip the light fantastic."
Leave me alone.
"Ah, don't cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive."
Snap out of it.
"So you neglect him most of his life, I'm out of the house a week, and there you are?"
"He surprised me, Dan."
"You know, Nathan's a good kid."
You got him so screwed up he doesn't know what he wants.
"Deb got her hand up your back, Keith?"
Deb's the best thing Nathan's got going for him right now.
- She's trying to save him.
- What the hell do you think I'm trying to do?
"I've been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny."
"I don't mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring, but leave the good one alone, would you?"
Hey Peyton.
Missing these?
Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet.
I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with.
She was shaking them like a pom pom.
Maybe she'll be a cheerleader.
Or President.
You gotta think big.
"Alright, you never know."

"- Well, if I work here, could I get tickets?"
- You don't work here.
- What's that right there?
"- Oh, you... you wouldn't want that job."
"- No, sure I would."
Sign me up.
- Seth...
"- You don't want to know the pay, the hours, job description?"
"- No, I'm good."
"- Minimum wage, long, uh, taking tickets, cleaning toilets, and the light preparation of fried foods."
- I'll be sure and wash my hands between the last two.
"I have to ask Nat, the owner."
"But he's never here, so..."
- Perfect.
"- Okay, I'm Alex."
You can start right now.
"If I don't fire you by the end of tonight, then come back tomorrow."
"- I have a mop, Ryan."
"- You've got a mop, bro."
"- So, you're doing all this for Summer?"
"- Yeah, for her friendship."
"- Wow, you really are changing."
"- Yeah, I am."
"Changing urinal cakes, that's how committed Seth Cohen is, to the new Seth Cohen."
"Okay, now you're talking about yourself in, like, the fourth person."
"Well, it's a whole new dimension of selflessness, Ryan."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to the urinals."
I don't know where they are.
"Check out the new Ryan Atwood, studying at the breakfast table."
"Klinger, Colonel Potter tells me you're going down to Seoul for him."
Son of a gun.
Now that you mention it--
- You were planning on going to Seoul the whole time!
- It's only an inch from Inchon.
You sneak!
You stole three days from us.
"""Stole"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say, ""creatively acquired""?"
"Klinger, this is a list of pieces of music."
The military library in Seoul should have at least some of them.
"Please get them for me, will you?"
Thank you.
Gentlemen.
- That's the most fun he's been in two days.
- Get back as fast as you can.
We want a few minutes before the party to beat the daylights out of you.
Hey!
"Hey, Captain Cook, what about the big dinner party?"
"- You better be quick, or your goose is cooked."
"- Yeah, you bums, you!"
You guys are all talk and no food!
The natives are hungry tonight.
Listen to the pounding of those gums.
"If Klinger doesn't get here soon, we're gonna be the featured danglers at a lynching."
"What do you say we go see Colonel Potter, find out if he's heard from him?"
"- Yeah, let's keep low."
Maybe they won't notice us.
- Yeah.
[ All Clamoring ]
- Coast is clear.
- Good.
So where's Chris?
Good question.
"Hey, Christopher."
So you just send me a text and then leave?
I don't want to bother you any more than I already have.
Bother me?
(chuckles)
Is that what you call what you did?
"Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry."
I-I shouldn't have done it.
"Look, I don't understand."
"I took you in,"
"I tried to do the right thing, believed Tucker was mine."
Why did you lie about it?
I guess I was just desperate.
"You know, to get away from Darrell, to try and find a good daddy for Tucker, I..."
Get away from Darrell?
"What, did... did he try to hurt you or something?"
(sighs) Let's just... no.
"Melody, you gotta talk to me."
What's going on?
"Darrell has a temper, and I was afraid."
Not just... not just for me but for Tucker.
"I tried to get a restraining order against him, but they said I had to wait until something bad happened."
"And I was afraid, and I just-- I didn't know what to do."
I never meant to hurt you.
Okay.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Don't worry about Darrell.
He's not gonna hurt either one of you.
First his accountant said that he was laundering drug money through high-cash businesses.
"""Immediately, bring him back!"
"We'll chat and lay food on the table"""
"We'll bring him home, we'll settle it, And throw a fiest in his honor"""
--I came home --Very good
--Did you get wet?
--None of us are infallible
"Pasha, they left."
They flagged down a car and left.
36-63-13
--Yes?
--Please call Lyudmila to the phone --Could you call even later at night?
--Do excuse me --Just a moment
--Hello --Gera?
--Yes
"--I was calling Lucy --She's asleep, dad"
Please call her
Let them stay overnight there.
Don't drag the child back and forth.
She's traumatized as it is.
"Good evening, comrade Vasin."
To what do we owe the honor?
"Lucy, you guys come back home in the morning..."
--Yeah?
"--Well, that is..."
--...if you can review your moral code?
--Really?
"Dear Comrade Vasin, we won't come until YOU review your moral code"
--our moral code is doing just fine.
--just fine?
!
Did you take my casette player with you by accident?
--Or did you simply steal it?
So we headed downtown.
On a bus.
Almost fresh.
I got 'em on the plane yesterday.
"Thank goodness I saved 'em, huh?"
Barbara.
Mm-hmm?
I understand about Roger being a great pool player...
Fantastic player!
His life's dream is to play competition on TV.
But what I don't understand is the part about the gold teeth.
Ah.
"Well, um, his gardening truck."
Did I mention that Roger is terrific with tropical flowers?
And therefore I know he's gonna be doin' real well over here.
"Anyway, his gardening truck was rear-ended, and his mouth..."
Steering wheel.
"So, he had this friend whose cousin was a dentist..."
"Some friend, right?"
And he gave him a deal on these new front teeth.
The problem with tailing a bus is that it can be pretty humiliating.
"See, a bus creeps along while the rest of the traffic moves around it."
"Well, all the, uh, enamel fell off, leaving just the gold casings."
Yeah.
So that's why you don't have a photo of Roger.
He's embarrassed to get his picture taken.
Come on.
The next pool hall is right up the street.
Okay.
"Barbara, does anyone know that you've come here looking for Roger?"
Ha.!
Only half of Bayonne.
"Oh, my God, this can't be happening."
[Crying] Next week was our anniversary.
I'm so sorry.
Are you married?
"No, I'm not, and I can't imagine what you're going through."
But everything you tell us can help us find the person who did this to Tony.
"I know this is hard, but I want you to try to remember that when you're talking to Agent Rossi."
Ahem.
"Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and relax."
I want to walk you through an exercise that's going to help you recall everything that happened last night.
"- What, like hypnosis?"
"- No, no, no."
Not at all.
"Now, just close your eyes and do the best that you can, okay?"
All right.
Think about last night.
"You and Tony, you went to the Halloween festival in Greektown."
What time was it?
"[Kiersten] Uh, around 9:30."
[Rossi] Crowded?
- [Muted chattering] - [Muted music]
Yeah.
Uh... there were drums and loud music.
"Uh, some people wore costumes."
Tony and I went to the festival every year.
We actually met there when we were in high school.
But this year we decided not to dress up.
- Boo!
- [Gasps]
What is it?
"A kid dressed in a mask jumped out, scared me."
Made Tony laugh.
For a second I thought it might have been-- lt was like going out the jump door.
I was falling through space.
"Count, sucker, and pull the ring."
One thousand.
Two thousand.
"Then, lights."
The ground batteries had picked me up.
"I tried to side-slip the chute, but I couldn't."
"The lights got brighter, blinding me."
He's coming to.
"Go ahead and make with the music, f riend."
We love it.
"What's the letter say, f riend?"
"- Tell us about it, f riend."
"- Quiet, Krause."
I haven't yet solved the code.
Repeat the message in the letter.
I hadn't read it yet.
I just started to when you sapped me.
You place me in an extremely distastef ul position.
"By nature, I'm a gentleman."
Truly gentle.
Brutality has always revolted me as a weapon of the witless.
Like your f riend Baretto.
"Yes, and Krause here."
Although Krause's inclinations are more psychopathic than intelligent.
"He suffered an injury to his brain once, and ever since then.... lf you make me leave you to his quiet whims, I will never f orgive you."
Go take a flying jump f or yourself.
I'd f ormed a higher opinion of your ability to make decisions.
"The rest is to dance time, f riend."
"You like music, f riend?"
I like music.
"And then audition day 4:00 in the morning, I don't wanna get out of bed and go audition."
So my mum physically pulled me  out of bed.
Imagine if I'd stayed in bed that day.
Liam.
I went back on the show with a bit of a point to prove.
One massive fat almighty yes.
Thank you so much.

I went:
"And she was going, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."""
"And I'm like, "" No, this clearly means no."""

e were absolutely gutted  when we got kick ed off.
I just don't wanna go home.
I just don't wanna go.
"And then as I was, Iike, about to leave..."
Zayn MaIik.
Liam Payne.
... they just called all five  of our names out.
Harry didn't have a clue.
"I remember him saying, Iike:"
"""Yeah, you kept us back because you wanna try and make us cry."""
"""We're young boys and we're all gonna be crying."""
Make a bit of good TV.
And he was proper having a fuII-on strop about it.
"And then I made a decision, and I did this in about 1 0 minutes."
Why don't we put these five boys into a group?
Don't...
Let's get married.
You're a liar.
What if I'm serious?
I'm not in the elite like you are.
Bull always wanted to be a detective.
And?
And now...
"I've finally become a detective, and my career is on track."
All I can think about now is work.
You sure?
I can't think straight anymore.
That was amazing.
I remember.
That cleaning lady...
Which case was it?
Here it is.
"""In 1998, a restaurant chef, Shigehiko Kashiwagi,"""
"""was struck by his employee, Yasuo Ikezawa, with a frying pan,"""
"""and had his proceeds stolen."""
"""Ikezawa fled the scene and remains missing."""
"""Kashiwagi's wife Kiriko is also a suspect and has disappeared as well."""
"""The two are wanted on robbery charges."""
Did the victim die?
"No, but his right side was paralyzed and he's confined to a wheelchair."
"Robbery, and aiding and abetting."
"If that's Kiriko Kashiwagi, Ikezawa must be with her."
"Wow, this is a huge breakthrough!"
I'm glad I remembered!
I was just going through expiring cases.
Expiring cases?
The statute of limitations expires...
- I'll drive you home.
"- No, I'll get there myself."
"Okay, Mike."
- Tell me I'm a genius.
- You're a genius.
Come on.
You can do better than that.
Remember the mail we were sorting' through at Doug's place?
"Outdoor Life, Field  Stream."
Got me thinkin'.
Outdoor types always go back to the woods.
"I got ahold of a buddy at the Coast Guard who knows a guy in Park Service... and I said, ""Hey, there's a couple of good bottles of Patrón in it for you if""-"
"- Just tell me, Sam."
- State Parks has a record... of Doug's license plate at Mangrove Campground.
- Keys.
- Yeah.
"Now, look."
"I'd go there with you, but..."
Veronica sort of set up a mini vacation in Boca.
"- You know, one of those swimming' with the dolphins-"
- I'll take care of it.
I can't believe that you found them so quickly.
That's amazing.
My friend Sam may have bruised a couple federal statutes along the way... but nothin' a gift-wrapped bottle of tequila can't smooth over.
"- Well, you won't get in trouble?"
- We found him.
That's what's important.
I knew I could count on you.
- Is that loaded?
- Yeah.
"Well, you're not gonna bring that with you when you go getJasper, right?"
It'll be fine.
~ Have you finished?
The pies have come.
~ Not yet.
"Our mate Michael, the best-dressed Bolshevik in Newcastle."
We're all grateful to him for standing up for our right not to have our rubbish collected.
"It used to be I was talking rubbish, or he was talking rubbish, now the whole of Newcastle's talking rubbish"
~ because we can't get it collected.
"~ Hear, hear!"
~ Scott.
"~ Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"All right, seriously."
I love Peter Magath.
Just like I love Michael.
Lifelong friends.
I love that Peter's an original.
"I love that he had a vision of what he could be and he pursued it, even when we laughed."
I love that he has faith in others.
Maybe even in me.
God knows the world needs people like that.
~ Peter!
~ Peter!
"Right, music!"

"I've taught my cub all that I can, and now it's time for him to go out and maul some tourists on his own."
You know what?
I'll get you a glass of water.
"Ooh, hey, hey."
And a Pop Tart?
"Oh, well, if you want a Pop Tart,"
I do not have to go downstairs.
You have a problem.
"Hey, buddy."
"Oh, thank God it's you, man."
I was so scared to come out of my room.
But I really needed a drink of water.
I almost let Clementine get it for me.
Clementine's in your room?
N-No.
"All right, look, this is crazy."
You got your mom right where you want her right now.
You need to take advantage of it.
- What do you mean?
"- What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but your mom wouldn't let you do?"
Go to Tijuana.
Then you go to Tijuana right now!
How can she possibly say no when she won't even look you in the eye?
You really think she would let me go to Tijuana just to avoid talking to me?
Only one way to find out.
- (chuckles)
- Look.
I also want to clarify one thing
- about that text.
"- No, no, no, please..."
"I would be doing those things to your mother, and not the other way around, because... no, look at me."
You got to look at me.
"I've this intention to learn, too."
You wish to learn kung-fu from my master?
Shut up!
His Highness is such a noble person.
"Master Liu, I know Shaolin kung-fu has never been learned by my people."
But the time has come for them to start learning.
"Your Highness, although kung-fu is for everyone,"
I'm really not capable of being your master.
So you turn me down?
Don't move!
Your Highness!
Please sit down!
"Mr. Liu, I hope you'll reconsider."
"Come on, let's drink!"
"Come on, cheers!"
Cheers!
Close all Shaolin schools in this area!
Yes!
"Your Highness, please don't be emotional."
Don't you still want to learn Shaolin Chin Kang Fist and Wu-tang 8-divine Sword?
"If Law Ching of the Wu-tang also refuses to hand over the 8-divine Sword book, what shall we do?"
I've got an idea.
You'll have the book.
I must have it by any means.
"Mr. Law, please!"
Please!
Playing chess is like having a sword fight.
"Strong, fast, and accurate."
"What a good sword, your Highness..."
Do you think your Wu-tang sword is better than mine?
I came here tonight to play chess.
Please don't mention anything about swords.
Keep them coming.
"See, Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city."
"He was first locked up at 11, and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 16."
"See, hits never bothered Jimmy."
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.
"I mean, he actually enjoyed it."
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.
Give me your wallet.
"You might know who we are, but we know who you are."
You understand?
"He was one of the city's biggest hijackers of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters."
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.
And almost all of them were gimmies.
"I mean, they just gave it up, no problem."
They called him Jimmy the Gent.
Tommy...help the lady.
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off about the really good loads.
"Of course, everybody got a piece."
"Thanks Jimmy, I'll be back for the rest later."
"Ok, see you later..."
"Henry, come here."
Say hello to Tommy.
"Youse gonna be working together, okay?"
Help him.
Go ahead.
"Hey Jimmy, you got anything good?"
"And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?"
He made them partners.
I'm telling the truth.
I'm not sad.
I'm not.
You...
Face reality.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
You're lying!
Shoot!
I let her influence me and spoke lines not in the script.
I'm lying?
Why do you say I'm lying?
Because...
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
What do I do?
I can't counter her...
"Oh, right."
Because Dad carries my photo with him every day.
"This line... ""Because Dad carries my photo with him every day... """
That's supposed to be Lola's line.
Angel was pressured by Gong Xi into speaking Lola's line.
"Next, Angel's line should be..."
Dad carries around pictures of our brother and me every day too.
He doesn't just keep your picture.
They really did swap lines.
"Gong Xi made Angel say Lola's lines, and then changed Angel's lines into Lola's."
She actually has the ability to make Angel automatically collaborate with her performance.
Angel fell into her trap.
"No matter how busy Dad is, he always shows up for my piano recitals."
"That's because if he doesn't show up, people will criticize him behind his back."

I don't know.
I know I want what's best for him.
But there's one thing I can do and that's protect them from Darrell.
Then figure out how to do that.
"There's a right way to handle this, Christopher."
Find it.
"What about this financial manager, Simon Delaney?"
(phone ringing and buzzing)
(cell phone beeps)
Okay.
Anything?
"Yeah, here it is."
Simon Delaney.
"Apparently, he's also an officer of three other LLCs connected to Garcia."
Which means three more possible drug-laundering companies.
Is Garcia's name on the title?
"I'll have to find out, but if so..."
We might have enough for an indictment.
Mm-hmm.
There's a Special Agent Pride on the phone for you.
"Squishy, I can help you."
I read the topic...
"""Describe a personal hero who's changed the course of your life."""
"- Mom, stop."
- Let's brainstorm.
What makes a hero?
Hmm?
Someone who's great at...
"crafting, matchmaking, parming chicken or shrimp or eggplant or meatballs."
"Listen, I did write about someone in the family, but it's a ""he."""
Yay!
It's me!
"I am he, and he is me."
"Bevy, she clearly picked someone else, perhaps a decorated war vet who had a date with two different Shirleys last night."
That's right.

"You picked the random old guy who just hangs around our house all day, eating our smoked fish?"

"Next stop, Lametown."
"Hey, I liberated an entire country."

"Oh, sorry, I drifted off to sleep there."

Shopping with Sophie is like when I worked in a Thai massage parlor.
We are going down.
Not if we go before Sophie and hide every ugly bridesmaid's dress that Sophie would like.
"If she can't see them, she can't make us wear them."
How did you come up with that so fast?
It's the same plan I used in 2010 when I was a bridesmaid for Chelsea Clinton.
Bad dress and then her father followed me into the coat room.
"Oh, wow."
Look at this place.
It reminds me of that movie.
- Bridesmaids?
"- No, Nightmare on Elm Street."
"I don't know what you're worried about, Caroline."
I think they're all quite lovely.
"Nash, please."
You're a poor person from Ireland.
I'll ask your opinion when I need to know where to go to get free leg braces.
"You were right, Max."
"She can be a real ""B"" sometimes."
"I'm sorry, but I don't even know why he's here."
Bonin' O'Brien here... is gonna distract the sales lady while we hide the ugly dresses.
"Hello, ladies."
Same plan.
Who's the lucky bride?
"Or should I say, who's the lucky cradle robber?"
Don't mind me.
It's just my crazy sense of humor.
"Oh, the ladies here love it."

He shook them quite a lot.

"Remember how I always thought you were crazy for how you loved Travis so much, you wanted to shrink down and live inside his blood?"
I am so sorry.
I totally get that now!
I'm so glad.
"You know, sometimes I still sneak in Travis' room and watch him sleep."
Travis and I live together.
I've said too much.
Can you believe my boss almost tossed out these old aprons?
"Luckily, I rescued them for us to use."
- For what?
- We could swaddle little baby Bobby with them.

[ Chuckles ] Okay.
Trav is so resourceful.
It's basically one step above dumpster diving.
Exactly-- a step above.
That's even better.
"Jules, it reminds me of..."
We would put them in reservations or ship them to...

"In fact, we encouraged mass emigration."
Eichmann's assignment during the '30s was to find places to move them to.

"In every society, there are pent up hatreds."

"Ten,nine,"
Thank you.
Tell me you took a long time just to make me a burrito.
"Oh,look at that."
You covered your hideous mole with a Band-Aid.
Thoughtful.
"Seriously,just get that removed."
I will when it gets colder.
# I'll blame it on a place #
# Where I keep my questions hidden... #
"At this very moment, in the town of Couer d'Couers  a girl named Chuck was attending her father's funeral."
"The only parent she had ever known was accidentally, inadvertently killed  by the boy she loved  who was, at this very moment  attending his own mother's funeral, who had actually died twice."
It was a blood vessel bursting in her brain  that caused Ned's mother's first death.
"However, young Ned had a secret gift:"
He could touch dead things and bring them back to life.
She wrote a script.
She wants me to buy a purple tank top.
- She is bananas!
- Hey.
Honey.
Mama's sorry.
"I know all this affects you, and I don't want to drive you crazy like my mom did with me."
- So...
- Were you saying something?
Oh.
Yeah.
Did you not hear me?
"Well, I just thought you were doing all this lining-up business because you heard Mommy getting crazy about Grandma's stuff."
"No, Mama."
Don't worry about it.
I've got my own crap.
You spend all day being the perfect boss.
And the perfect mom.
And the perfect wife.
"But sometimes... sometimes, you just gotta be a little bad."
"Oh, shoot."
"Guys, I gotta go finish some reports for work."
"You need something sweet and salty, just like you."
"Honey, are you eating something?"
"No, I'm doing work reports."
- Mommy?
- Mommy's busy!
Your little midnight snack is nobody's business.
"Introducing new Shhhh-nacks, from Frito Lay."
Utilizing a patented silencing technology previously only available to secretly American-funded death squads in El Salvador.
New Shhhh-nacks let you hide the shame eating you do to fill the void left by such things as:
"Maybe the wrong one, but..."
-I'll never forgive myself.
-You blame yourself too much.
You did what you morally had to do.
Here.
"-Charlie, can I speak with you?"
-Surely.
The court will come to order.
"Remain seated, please!"
Has the prosecution completed its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?
Yes.
The prosecution rests.
No more questions.
You may step down.
We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the stand as a witness for the defense.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Dr.
Matthew Swain.
"Dr. Swain, do you know of any act of force or violence... which Lucas Cross perpetrated against the defendant?"
I certainly do.
We've spent too much time torturing a girl who's emotionally unable... to speak for herself.
"Lucas Cross was a drunken, and a wife beater... and a child abuser!"
"I object! ""Child abuser"" is an exaggerated and inflammatory word."
"When I say ""child abuser"", I mean it in the worst way possible!"
"I object, your Honor."
The deceased is not on trial.
Lucas Cross' character as to force and violence is on trial here.
"You may continue, Dr. Swain."
Tell me you're sending this.
She's relaying a message.
"It says ""century""."
Starbuck's been hit.
I say again :
Starbuck's going down.
"There's really not much more on the eye in these scriptures, but there is... several interesing stories about the temple."
Listen to this.
"""Five pillars of the temple were fashioned after the five priests"
"- devoted to the one whose name..."""
- Laura.
What ?
The cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others.
"She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was on board one of the cylon baseships."
And that she had been seen on New Caprica in your school.
The child is alive.
Yes.
Yes.
The child was at the school.
"Yes, I kept her there."
And we suspected that the cylons captured her during the exodus from New Caprica.
"Yes, it's true."
"Listen, the thing you might want to know is that when she..."
Do you have any idea what we've gone through ?
You of all people... know what it's like to lose a child.
The difference is your child's still alive.
"And eventually, I hope you become grateful of that."
I want to see her.
"What you mean, she's gone down."
Gone down where ?
Somewhere in the north valley.
"Okay, get your men on the line."
"Um, Alan, when people win awards, aren't they usually happy?"
I was just a kid who took a summer job and kept getting promoted while I was trying to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life.
"Now it's 27 years later, and tonight, I won something."
"I won the realization that I am Alan Matthews,"
"I am 42 years old, I am a grocer."
You want to quit your job?
"Ah, I just want to take a hot bath."
You don't want to get in that tub.
It's disgusting.
"Uh, what..."
Excuse me.
Could I have my robe back?
"Hey, I'm naked under here."
Enjoy.
A motel room.
Only three hours from home.
"I should be in my room tonight, not in a motel room in the middle of nowhere, with a toilet seat that has not been sanitized for my protection."
I don't believe that paper strip for a minute.
Better?
A little.
"I told you, we just got this room so I could clean up for my date tonight."
"Eric, I've been a good brother on this trip."
"I mean, I've indulged your little whims,"
I've been very supportive.
Why're you doing this?
I'm just not ready for the summer to end yet.
"Well, I am."
"I mean, I got a girlfriend."
"I got Shawn, I got school."
I got a life waiting for me back at home.
"Yeah, you do."
"That must be nice, huh?"
Mm.
"In the time I have known you,"
I have always sensed you wanted to be a good man.
Do you want what happened to Thomas to ever happen again?
Of course not.
"Then go to Inspector Mallory, confess your crime and expose your superiors and the corrupt system that protected you."
"Father, I'm not sure that I'm brave enough."
I think you are.
God has given you the chance to salvage some greater good from your acts.
I strongly suggest that you do the right thing.
"Afternoon, sir."
Is the Inspector in?
"He is, sir, yes."
Go straight through.
Thank you.
"Oh, Sergeant, there's a man outside, he's behaving rather strangely."
I think he must be drunk.
Is there?
Right.
Thanks.
I've got nothing more to say.
Mrs Lightman?
Who are you?
I'm Max.
I am so very sorry... ..for what I did to Vera and to your son.
How did you get in here?
I want to confess to the murder of Vera Blanchett... ..and to my role in a barbaric police cover-up.
You what?
I should have known it was too good to be true.
"Come now, Mrs McCarthy."
Not every man who invites you out to lunch will turn out to be a murderer.
And I didn't even get to taste the Dover sole.
"Ooh, but there is a ""Whittle Your Own Banjo"" workshop at 5:00."
I have whittle-to-no interest in that.
"Ooh, it says they have the loosest slots around."
I guess the Darby sisters from my hometown are here.
I did see a bunch of lounge chairs over by the swamp exhibit.
"I guess we could sleep there tonight, and then the next night, well, hopefully we'll be dead."
"Come on, red!"
"Max, no!"
That's all of our money!
No more bets.
"Oh, that is so stupid, and not cute stupid like when you thought Velcro grew in nature."
And red is the winner.
"Well, rootin' tootin'!"
"I always bet on red because my last name's Black, and that's ah-not been a winner."
"Okay, now that we've doubled our money,"
- maybe we should stop.
"- Come on, red!"
- No more bets.
- No!
I didn't even get to touch it before you lost it.
Why do you hate having things?
Red again.
Just call me Al Roker 'cause I'm making it rain.
"Max, we're winning at something."
"Don't just stand there looking pretty, toots."
Order daddy some wings.
"Oh, my God, I look pretty and I get to flag down a waitress."
Waitress!
I'll have a sarsaparilla and some wings for big daddy.
Sophie's calling.
"Pfft, like I'm gonna get it."
"Well, Caroline's not answering."
Why?
Did something happen with SBK?
Nope.
Something happened with Chivonne.
There's a banger.
Lucien.
"He a player, runs some corners."
He got it in his head that Chivonne is gonna be his girlfriend.
And he don't care what she got to say about it.
What do you mean?
Happens sometimes.
"Youngblood sees something he likes, decides it's his."
Doesn't matter that she don't like him.
It don't matter that she just 14.
"One way or another, he gonna get what he wants."
"Now, this boy, Lucien, he keep coming at her, got his boys following her, just making her life hell."
Did she talk to the police?
You mean did she snitch?
No.
"She worried that it's gonna come back on her and her aunt, and it would."
That's why she came to me.
What did she ask you to do?
I wouldn't let her say the words but I know what she need me to do.
And truth is...
I want to do it.
That's my baby girl.
"Anybody mess with her, they deserve what they get."
"Crazy, huh?"
"Everything I've been doing, working with you, working with the police, it was so, eventually,"
I can be a father to her.
Turns out what she really need is a gangster.
I don't blame you for wanting to protect your daughter.
"No, I only stopped by to--"
We were discussing something quite different.
"All right, never mind."
"Oh, put them right over there."
Has anyone else been here this evening?
Anyone called?
Just Enos Watterton.
He wanted to make sure you got away all right.
- I didn't know then you'd missed the train.
- Enos Watterton?
- Oh.
- Sandy-
"- Sandy, if you won't tell me, will you please tell Perry what's been upsetting you so lately?"
"I mean, that's part of the reason I wanted to talk to him."
"Oh, for heaven's sakes, Beth, I don't care what you do."
- Sandy!
"- Driver, wait."
"Taxi, taxi!"
[jazz playing]
"Sellers, Sellers."
[phone ringing]
Yes?
Who?
"Oh, Sandy--"
Ha!
"Well, I guess we all miss a train once in a while."
"I'll catch the first plane in the morning, sir."
The only reason I bothered you was to double check to make sure that I have all the papers they'll need in Phoenix.
What?
"I mean in the briefcase, sir."
I had the impression that you put everything in there yourself and--
"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't actually."
-Indiana...
"Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked."
"Yes, they are nice."
They're worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
"But the people I brought are important, and they're waiting."
What people?
Army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
They wouldn't tell me what they want.
"Well, what do I want to see them for?"
"What am I, in trouble?"
"Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard a great deal about you."
Have you?
"Uh, professor of archaeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?"
Obtainer of rare antiquities.
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.
"-Oh, thank you."
-Thank you.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago."
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Uh... well, just rumors, really."
"Somewhere in Asia, I think."
I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.
"We were friends, but, uh... had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid."
Mmm.
"Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?"
I understand.
[Collective chatter]
[Sirens wailing]
Magnum .44.
I bet it was from the same gun the exterminator used.
Who the fuck are you?
"Agent Shaw, from the c.I.A."
So far you haven't been very cooperative.
And just why is the c.I.A. Interested in this case?
"We're interested because in these sensitive times, two months before elections, the exterminator has been stirring up a lot of resentment against incumbent politicians and the entire judicial system."
"This could easily be the work of the opposition party, or maybe even a foreign government."
"Dr., uh, Megan Stewart, please."
What do you think?
I think you have to take a shit.
It's coming out of your mouth instead of your asshole.
[Phone ringing]
Hello...
Dr. Stewart.
Hi.
"- Hi, there."
"- Hey, listen."
What time do you get off work tonight?
I'm on call all night.
Damn it.
There is another solution.
"The nurses call it, ""midnight admission."""
Midnight admission.
"It's, uh... it's an empty, private room."
Shame to let it go to waste.
Okay.
See you soon.
[Pa announcement] Coronary emergency.
"Dr. jenester, to emergency."
Yes.
- Mayhew.
Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.
Faith and begorrah!
A fellow potato-eater.
My real name's McGill.
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
"They all want a pipe-hittin' member of the tribe, so to speak."
I digress.
Good things are happening.
"Fact is, your nephew's gonna get out in no time."
That's wonderful.
"There's still a few details to be ironed out, but now that the DEA is involved,"
I think he's looking at time served and probation.
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"Excuse me, the DEA?"
Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
"I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news, but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers."
I understand that.
But what does that have to do with the DEA?
"They're after some mystery man, some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg."
They want this guy like the ax wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up!"
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Look, look."
I think...
I just think that we should
I am still in Tangak_
He is not late.
Put it down!
What did they do to you?
I had to bring it so I did.
- A man must honor his promises.
- Well done!
"Well done, what?"
A man must honor his promises;
"I said ""well done"" for it!"
- So?
- So what?
- A man must stay to his promises!
"- I did promise nothing, did I?"
"Bashirou, why did you put the cradle here"
"Bashirou, what happened to you?"
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
I like you;
I liked your father too.
"- If I would say something to you, it's because of"
- I understand!
"It's because you don't want me out of money, you want me to take re of my family."
"But Mr. Zaer Kheder, I said something else to you before going to Tangak."
"Yes, you said!"
But I can't burden ketfledrum to you.
To whom I should say not to play and let this little boy play kettledrum?
"Whoever you see, was waiting from last year's Moharram to this year's to play kettledrum, cymbal, and horn and morning Alam Iifling"
Everybody has his own vows.
All of them have their own intentions.
Whom should I ask for'?
"Mr Zaer Kheder, ifs cheating!"
"Sir, uh, turns out the camera's broken."
Sometimes the things you think are going to work don't work out at all.
"Son, it's a party-- lighten up."
"Whoa, where you going?"
Where you going?
Where you going?
"- I little wine, if you don't mind."
"- Oh, here's one."
Here you go.
Julian... why don't you show my dad that new sketch you did for me?
"You know, the one in my bedroom."
"Oh, yes, perhaps you can help me name it."
"I'm torn between ""Lame Excuse"" and ""Transparent Distraction."""
"Julian, just give me a second, okay?"
"First of all, I'd like to make a little toast, everybody, okay?"
It seems that some magazine decided that my daughter is a great catch.
"I don't need a magazine to tell me how great she is-- she's beautiful, she's bright--"
I'm damn proud of her.
- Hear hear.
"- Not done, Johnson."
Sh.
He is not done.
"Alex, I just want you to know that I couldn't be more happy if you'd find a nice fellow out there, someone who cares about you half as much as your old man."
He's out there somewhere.
"Hey, I know that ring."
Why do I know that... ring?
What the hell are you doing here?
"Okay, Dad, first--"
I loved your toast.
"Yeah, I heard it through the door."
"Very moving, sir."
Is there something going on between you two?
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
"But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down."
[Captain Boots purring]
I'm joking.
"We've done several focus groups on the show, and what I've gleaned... the blond, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
Jenna.
That's my friend Jenna.
"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
I'm not missing them.
They're just not there.
I think I can fix that.
"So, your job is you take things that are already working, and you fix them."
That's a great job.
"Why don't we, uh..."
You're missing that third kind of heat.
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
"Okay, the black guy?"
The black movie star.
"I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
"Isn't he, um... crazy?"
Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
The important thing to remember is he was never charged with a crime.
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
Nor should it be.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
I think I do.
What are you doing?
Most people watch shows that are slightly too clever for them.
BOTH:
False.
You're going false.
What are you guys going to go for?
I...
"I think true because I think most people are watching at home going ""Yeah, cos I was actually going to say that, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
True.
You think true.
"OK, well I can tell you the answer is true."
APPLAUSE 56% of people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show.
APPLAUSE
My least favourite quiz show is definitely Countdown.
"God, imagine having to play THAT day after day."

"So, at the end of that round, it's no points for Rob's team and four points for Aisling's team."
CHEERING
"And The Winner Is, is the name of our final round."
Here's your question.
"People who can do, do you know poached eggs?"
"We can all poach an egg using the little boat, but using the swirling technique..."
"Aw, impossible!"
"Yeah, I try and it always ends up looking like a testicle with a ghost."
LAUGHTER
I made breakfast!
"When I was growing up, we used to be jealous of those rich kids that had, do you know like the motorized little BMW car things that they'd go round the garden in?"
"Oh, yeah."
"And now I can afford one, I can't fit in them."
LAUGHTER
You could get one for your own child.
"Nah, cos then I'd think, ""spoilt brat""."
--And that I was being a bookish bureaucrat

Let me ask Tolya to drive you home
"--you have a cold, and the city is..."
"--Galkina, this is so primitive!"
Take me home and put you in my place?
Only you sign me off too soon.
The night is young.
I'll knock down those guarages and stop that wedding!
And your extortionist won't get the apartment either
--He will get it --He won't.
I'll speak out against.
"I will speak for it, and everyone will support me."
Then there will be no room for both of us under this roof
"In that case, it will be me who will stay"
At last!
I tore off your mask.
"Pavel Ivanovich, Sorokin just came"
Coming!
"Galkina, I thougt you were my friend."
I even wanted to marry you.

--This morning.
--What about your wife and kids?
--That does not concern you.
"I never cheated on my wife, and I never intend to!"
Holding on to your power chair?

"Raya, instantly connect Sorokin with the 5th SMU, and say they must return the machines NOW!"
"Uh, Anezka and her friends are trade-show models for the tournament this weekend."
They're here to take publicity photos with the team.
You're police.
Did Joey do something wrong?
NG:
"No, we just..."
We're clearing up a misunderstanding.
"Hey, why don't you, uh, go hang out with the team, okay?"
I'll be right there.
"So, you were talking about why you were angry with O.G."
Right.
"Yeah, I was angry with him."
But I had no reason to kill him.
I won.
Tendu signed with Team ProFine.
"Now, O.G. was furious, okay?"
"He kept badgering Tendu to change his mind, but..."
Something wrong?
"Tendu was supposed to be here by now, for the publicity photos."
"Called him, like, an hour ago, but he didn't answer."
"Wait, you don't think whoever tried to kill O.G."
"went after him, also?"
We can't rule anything out.
You know where he was staying?
I could send a car to check on him.
"We need to talk to him, too."
"I don't know for sure, but I bet he was at the same hotel as O.G."
There was only one room registered under O.G.'s name.
Then try looking under Tendu's real name.
I only learned it when we were drawing up the contracts.
It's Marcel Otolik.
O-T-O-L-I-K.

Robin?
What's happening?
"Batman, I want you to come with me later today and rob a bank."
"Robin, don't even joke about such a thing."
Have you lost all your sense of judgment?
"Holy reverse polarity, I did it!"
I got you out of Black Widow's clutches!
"Of course, I knew what I was doing but with my cerebrum short circuited I couldn't stop myself."
"You sit down here, Robin."
I'll retie your hands and pretend that my brain is still short circuited.
"Sure and it's a dark hour in Gotham City, commissioner."
Yes.
But I was faced with the decision and I had to make it.
How will we be breaking the news to the people?
We'll tell them the truth.
Batman was shot and killed when he and Robin...
Robin?
No doubt he's gone into hiding.
Most likely in the Batcave.
Maybe I can talk to him.
Get him to surrender.
So no more of the Dynamic Duo's blood will be spilled on the streets of our fair city.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Batman is not here.
I know that.
- We've lost the Caped Crusader.
It's a no-brainer.
Run!
"Oh, God, no!"
"Okay, man, let's see him."
"Ma'am, had you ever seen him before last night?"
No.
What happened after you heard the sound?
I got the gun from the lock box in my closet.
Do you need the lock box too?
We'll let you know.
I moved toward the sound thinking that it couldn't be Chelsea because Chelsea comes up the stairs in a certain way.
I wasn't even supposed to be home.
"I saw the boy, he turned towards me."
Things like this aren't supposed to happen to people like Chelsea and me.
So how is Chelsea?
"""My mom is so brave, the way she defended our home."
"""She is my role model in all things."
"""I am so proud to be her daughter."
"""I only hope that in the same situation, I would have as much courage."" Thank you."
Chelsea!
Chelsea!
One more!
"Turn around, Chelsea."
Chelsea!
"Mom shoots a burglar, daughter holds a press conference."
I love LA.
"Evening, Counselor."
"Hey, you two got a minute?"
"I got a 314 awaiting a plea, but Morales wants a copy of your report on the Sennett house shooting."
"With all the press, he doesn't want to let it hang."
It's not as simple as it looks.
"The rest of the crew's still out there, and Chelsea Sennett's in too many right places for it to be a coincidence."
"Well, he and Trimbole are a little too close with each other for mine."
"OK, so what's the population, hmm?"
"12,000, 15,000?"

'Course they know each other.
'Course they know each other.

"Well, since he's Trimbole's alibi,"

"My son's gone, my baby is gone!"

"Ah Kwai, help me"
My son's gone...
"You only think about your son, and not about me"
"That's not true, but I've spent so much money in the hope that I could have a son"
A son...
You should have the ability

"He missed it. """
"Oh, oh, oh."
Ha ha ha ha.
"Oh, ha ha!"
"Oh, touché, Tarby."
"Oh, that was brilliant."
"No, the same thing has happened to me fumfty times."
We-hell.
I can see it's gonna be a scintillating evening with everyone cracking brillo gags like that one.
Yeah.
Hey.
Maybe there's a series in it.
Dinner At Richie's.
An ultra-sophis chat show.
Good evening.
This is the BBC.
"Tonight, Sir Richie Rich will be talking to the Queen, the Pope and, of course, the Tarby."
It'd be a disaster.
You'd get drunk and make a pass at the Pope for wearing a dress.
Bloody good telly though.
"So, what incredible 12 courses will you cook for your fantastically amiable showbiz chums?"
"Unh-uh!"""
"""I'm from Brooklyn."
"""I'm from do-or-die Bed-Stuy Brooklyn."
You took my spot.
"I don't play that."""
"The lady was like, ""So?"
"I'm from Oakland."""
"My mom said, ""Y'all get in the car."""
"I said, ""Wait a minute, Mama!"""
You supposed to fight her!
"Don't be a punk!"""
"She said, ""Baby, I'm not a punk."
I'm a survivor.
"That's what the hell I am."""
"You don't mess with people from Oakland, folks."
You just don't do it.
"Even in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, you notice they went over that Golden Gate Bridge, but they did not mess with the Bay one?"
Did you notice that?
"'Cause there would have been far more dangerous creatures on the other side, just waiting for 'em like,"
"""Hold on, bruh."
"""Hey, yo, who these Flavor Flav-looking niggas, bruh..."
"""coming over here with these ashy knuckles, nigga?"
"Who the fuck are these peop--"" The movie wouldn't have been called Rise of the Planet of the Apes."
It would have been called The Apes Died in Oakland.
There would have been no sequel.
Don't do it.
"Apes were gangster, man."
You ever had a gangster situation just happen to you?
"Like you, right here."
"She's like, ""No."""
"""I was at the HM the other day,"
"""and I switched the $4.95 tag"
Well...
I get that.
It's an important case.
I gotta go.
"Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee."
"Hey, tell everyone I said hi, okay?"
"Yeah, you bet."
Bye.
Let's get back to work.
(siren wailing)
"The victim is Corporal Jared Connors, 28,"
Fourth Marine Division.
"Drove here regularly when he was on leave, he even raced in the amateur circuit a few times."
Experienced driver.
Apparently.
"Him and the girlfriend, Dana Wells, were the only drivers on the track when he crashed."
Lost control of his car?
"Yeah, except his father thinks he was murdered."
Russ Connors is a mechanic on one of the racing teams.
Told the sheriffs he's convinced the car was sabotaged.
Sabotage?
Why does he think that?
"Well, I didn't get to talk to him."
"He got cut pretty bad taking his son out of the wreck, so..."
Paramedics took and the girlfriend to the hospital.
Think that's case-related?
More like trouble in paradise.
I don't think he and Melody are getting along right now.
"Well, it can't be easy..."
"Woman pops into his life, surprises him with a baby."
At least Lasalle's trying to do the right thing.
"Just wish it didn't affect his work so much, undermanned as it is."
Well...
We'll think about it.
"Well, how about this:"
Whoever gets out of their beanbag first gets what they want?
"Everyone, you are now free to date people in the office."
"Our not very long, extremely local nightmare is over."
"Hey, you got the ban lifted?"
Yeah... isn't that what you wanted?
Only when it was never going to happen!
I lied before.
"I am scurred, I am..."
I'm just a big ol' scurredy cat.
"I just, I really don't want to mess this up with Emma."
"Look, I know more about women than anyone except Gloria Steinem and John Mayer."
"I've picked up women in nine languages, and I only know five."
"As Jack Gordon, colon, Man of Action... copyright pending..."
I'm going to help you ask out Emma.
"Okay, I will gladly accept your help."
And I'm going to start a binder right now
- with some subsections and...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
You are not going to overthink this.
"My plan has one step, and that's called ""taking action""..."
Emma!
Clark has something he'd like to ask you.
No.
"Hey, Emma, I was just wondering... [laughing]:"
"Hey, it's Clark, from work."
What's up?
"Pretty good, pretty good."
[muttering]
I just wanted to know if maybe you want to hung out sometime?
(music fades)
"You like that, Stewie?"
You like Anne Murray's music?
Do I?
I've never known such happiness.
This must be what it's like for you when you're buying potatoes or scraping your heels or smushing on makeup for a sad night out.
ANNOUNCER:
This portion of the Channel 5 News at 6:00 is brought to you buy condoms.
"Put us on backwards a little bit, then put us on the right way."
"Mom, Dad, I need to get new sneakers."
What?
I just bought you new sneakers.
"I know, but I need cooler ones."
"Shut up, and stop complaining."
"When I was your age, I didn't even have sneakers."
We wore stale hamburger buns.
"No, you didn't, Peter."
"Shh, he doesn't know that."
"He's just a dumb, fat loser."
Did you see his shoes?
"Look, Chris, I'm sorry, but money's tight right now."
"Yeah, I even had to take a second job as a door-to-door vacuum salesman."
This thing can pick up anything.
Here's a little demonstration.
"I'll pour some wine, rub in some feces, and, to top it off, some mustard mixed with feces."
"Tough stain, right?"
"Oh, crap, I forgot the vacuum."

I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved... not by you, Tim... or your God."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
[Sighs]
I do.
[Beeping]
Wow!
Chocolate bon-bons from L'atelier de Bonheur.
"To be honest, I've never had one of these before."
You can't find Bonheur chocolates in Japan.
My friend who went to Paris for vacation brought these back.
These are for you.
How is it?
It's very smooth.
"It's not too sweet, it has just the right amount of bitterness."
"With its rich chocolate aroma and wonderful texture, the overall impression it gives is amazing."
Yeah.
"- It's a tender taste, right?"
It gently unravels your heart.
To be able to eat Bonheur chocolates in Treluyer's shop is such a luxury.
"But this means we've brought in food from outside, right?"
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"But I, love Bonheur's chocolates the most in the whole world."
"Geez, I'm totally jealous of French people who can eat this every day."
Mmmm!
I want to make chocolates like this one day.
"I was only saying so to Marti Caine, before her last trip to South Africa."
"So keep your embittered, communistic treason to yourself during tonight's intercourse with Tarby and friends."
I am not having intercourse with Tarby and that's final.
What a surprise!
Four minutes into the episode and he delivers the most tortuous double entendre ever.
It was a great gag.
"- Social intercourse, Eddie, social."
"- Oh, phew."
We shall talk about subjects far above your head.
"Poetry, fine art, golf."
"That reminds me, I must bone up on Tarby's book of golfing anecdotes."
They are the greatest work of Eng lit since Dick.
- Oo-er.
"- Dick-ens, Eddie."
Dick-ens.
Oo-er.
There's only one thing I hate more than golfing anecdotes and it's this.
"It's a close run thing, though."
Ha ha ha ha ha!
"This is brilliant stuff, it's classic, classic, classic."
"Well done, Tarby."
Oh.
"Oh, listen to this one."
"Listen, listen, listen."
Shut up.
"""Lynchy and I had taken time off and flown to Spain"
"""with Greavsie and Parky and Tom O'Connory"
"- ""to play golf with Lesie. """
- Lesie?
- Yeah.
- Playing golf with lesbians.
Fantastic.
This has to be in a good mood
"As long as this is OK, everything will be OK"
"Go, get rid of your problems and you'll be fine"
"OK, Pasha"
"Move it out, driver"
"What is it, sergeant?"
Mr Hatem is due down now
"- Good morning, Nabil"
"- Good morning, Mr Hatem"
"Good day, Hajj"
- come in for a second
- How's the market?
"We're at the end of this month, it's OK"
- But in general
"- In general, we're number one"
- and we have the highest sales
- May God bless
I wish you'd come in for a couple of minutes
I'll come down and drink tea with you another time
- Good bye
- Good bye
"No, I won't be able to come down"
"Why, Hajj?"
You're a blessing to us
"- Anyway, how's work?"
- Excellent
"May God bless, Tell everyone I said hi"
"- I will, Hajj..."
Good bye
"- Drive on, driver"
- I hope he's a good man
- In what sense?
"Oh, no!"
Wilbur.
"Hello, Bob."
We'd better do something fast.
Gretchen thinks there's a man in here.
It's Willy.
Willy?
Willy!
Willy?
Hello.
"Oh, it's the kid!"
"You two know one another, huh?"
"Sure, I'm his part-time uncle."
I bought him his train ticket.
But what's he doin' here?
"He wasn't feeling well last night, so I let him sleep here."
And Gretchen doesn't know he's a little boy.
She was in too big a hurry to spread the word.
I'll bet you that board meeting's goin' on right this minute.
"Well, I felt it was my duty to come to you, the board, and... and give you an insight into the private life of Nancy Collins."
It's the most outrageous conduct I've ever heard of.
"Miss Brendan, you say you actually saw this man in her, uh... drawing room?"
"Oh, yes, Professor Okell."
"And when I confronted her with it, she hit me with a tray."
(MEMBERS EXCLAIMING) This is outrageous.
"No breath of scandal has ever touched the Brendan School for Girls, nor shall it now."
I move that we vote for the dismissal of... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, Mrs. Brendan, but I had a train to meet."
We were just taking a vote on the dismissal of Nancy Collins.
"Good, I'll vote, no."
You'll what?
Don't you think Nancy should be allowed to testify on her own behalf?
That's true.
Mike and I got a lot of:
"""So, the music's really a character."""
"Yeah, the music's a fifth character."
New York's a character.
Yugo's a character.
Gum is a character.
"Yeah, the gum is a character."
"The Yugo's a character, you know."
"I'm not gonna lie, I felt important while this was happening."
"I was going in front of the line, doing what I want."
So we're going into one of my favorite scenes in the film.
"Mike and Kat, you did an amazing job with this dancing."
And I was worried about how we were gonna do this.
"Yeah, this was one of the most tired days of the shoot."
- Remember?
- This was when we switched to days.
- This was our first day.
- That's right.
We had been on the night schedule so we had not enough sleep.
I love your dance because it's so you two.
And only the two of you would do that.
"And only, I think, after hours of..."
"I mean, not being able to sleep for days."
You can tell we were desperate for sleep.
"Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about."
What am I saying?
I have a stomach ache from fatigue at this point.
"But when this was written, it was like ""Norah and Nick get up on Beefy Guy and Dev's shoulders and do a dance."""
- It was so terrifying.
- I didn't trust Rafi to hold me at all.
I didn't trust anyone to hold me.
"Judy, Clarence saved your life."
"Don't you know Clarence, your old buddy?"
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, come in please."
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, can you hear me?"
"Yes, Paula, what is it?"
"Well, it's Judy, Dad, she was attacked by a leopard."
"- Well, was she hurt?"
"- Well, not really."
"Clarence chased the leopard away, but there's still something wrong with Judy."
"It's as if she's in shock, Dad."
I'm frightened.
She doesn't recognize me.
"Well, Paula, she's just probably playing games."
She doesn't even recognize Clarence.
"Dad, I think you better get back here and have a look at her."
"Paula, you know I can't do that."
We have to locate Sally.
Judy needs you more.
"Now, uh, Paula, I'm sure Judy will snap out of it."
"Right now, Sally holds the answers to a lot of information the space agency needs."
"Well, I don't care about Sally."
Judy's in terrible trouble and you're chasing some silly astro-chimp around the bush.
"Ah, now, listen, young lady, get a hold of yourself."
"You're not doing Judy, yourself or anyone any good by getting hysterical."
"Now listen, does--does Judy have any physical injuries?"
I'll check.
There's no visible wounds or broken bones.
"Well, does she have any muscle paralysis?"
"I'll tell you what, test her reflexes."
All right.
He is our Gyula's commander.
Wow!

"The last day Ágika an early morning started with a little game cart already and while the game cart filled with a borrowed thing,"
Ágika got into the centre of the interest and envy rather continually.
they made him relate the big event again and again.
They were offering everything good to it.
It was celebrated practically
"No, Mr. Scott."
Neither you nor I can be spared here.
"Mr. DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear."
"Mr.Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there."
Dr. McCoy will accompany.
"If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question."
Dismissed.
"[ Uhura ] No more messages from below, sir, but I've locked onto their original source."
Very good.
Transmit coordinates to Mr. Scott.
"Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately."

"Ready, Scott?"
"Ready, Mr. Spock."

"In the name of heaven, where are we?"
Look.
- You don't even belong here!
- Hey!
"I got a few hang-ups of my own, you know!"
"For example, what do you know about welfare?"
Anybody here ever been shafted by welfare?
[Neva] Are you jiving me?
I went through a trip with welfare last summer you wouldn't believe.
"My mother is 65, and she's sick in bed, right?"
"So they ask her to come down for an interview. ""Could you come down for an interview, please?"""
And they treated her like she...
"like she was stickin'her hand out, trying to steal their lousy money!"
"- Man, you got a problem with welfare?"
I'm with you.
"- Hey, wait a minute!"
"What is this welfare business, huh?"
The way you're dressed?
[Laughs] What do you think we're stupid or something?
We're-We're...
We're getting put on here!
[Seymour] You know something?
He might be right.
All right.
Who the hell here has a grudge against a chick by the name of Alice Fisher?
"Hey, who are you, mister?"
"And who in this group hates German cars, underground garages, advertising agencies?"
- And who hates welfare?
"- Please, Lieutenant."
- And who hates marine recruiting officers?
"- [Dr. Benton] No, Lieutenant."
Not here!
- [Panicked Whimpering] - [Woman Screaming]
"[Kojak] Hold it, Zucco!"
You look like a gangster.
They shot me.
Help!
"Henry, shut the door."
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here.
Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
"I remember feeling bad about the guy,"
But I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anyone dying in the building.
You're a real jerk.
You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.
I don't know what the hell's wrong with you.
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe decided to take on a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
"He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time, but he was already a legend."
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give a doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd shove hundreds in the pockets of the dealers and all the guys that ran the games.
"I mean, the bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold."
The Irishman is here to take all you Guineas' money.
-Want a drink?
-Give me a Seven and Seven.
Jimmy. I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Pleasure.
Thank you.
"If I wasn't, I should have kept my mouth shut."

"Yeah, I guess you're right."

There'll be no salvation
Is the hatred one a bad person?
A very evil person
Cruel one?
Very much

Yakup Efendi what do you think?
Is there any poison that would kill slowly and with pain?
"My Sultana, it is difficult"
"Well, what I meant was, well, you know how important this is to me."
"I think I told you, Mr. Norstaad, that I've been in South America for a good many years, and I've been out of the construction game."
This is my chance to get going again.
"And if you both like the plan, then maybe the Hospital Committee and the others--"
Of course they like it.
Of course you get job.
Just you watch how Edie pushes this through.
Nowhere in the world is another woman like--
"Please, Axel."
Oh.
Of course.
"It gets late, and we should take ourselves home."
"Oh, Miss Morrow, you might like to point out to the Committee that the design for the hospital conforms perfectly to the topography of the land."
"Oh, land."
"Yeah, Edie, you pay over deposit money already?"
"No, not yet."
"But Maigret, he says--"
Don't worry.
"I just thought it was better if Mr. Somers replaced his $50,000 personal check with a certified one, that's all."
"He said he'd have it for me tomorrow, and I'll see it goes directly into escrow."
Good.
"Fine, fine."
"Good night, Edie."
"Good night, Axel."
"Good night, Miss Morrow."
Much obliged for everything.
"I mean it, darling."
You've handled everything just perfectly.

You can go.
We'll be in touch.
What's going on?
HOLMES:
"Were you aware that when Tendu disappeared, he was in the company of a woman named Libena Havel?"
No.
"No, I wasn't."
BELL:
"Apparently, she's his girlfriend."
"When we heard her name, it struck us that we'd already met one Czech woman, Anezka."
Having two different Czechs wrapped up in the same case seemed like more than a coincidence.
HOLMES:
We wondered if she and Anezka knew each other.
"If they did, Anezka could help us find Libena, which, in turn, could help us find Tendu."
"Anezka gave us this, from a gaming convention a few months back."
"She identified this girl as Libena, another of your trade show models."
"She said Libena and Tendu met at a party last week, here at this house."
Yeah.
HOLMES:
She also told us that she and Libena were more than just models.
They're prostitutes.
BELL:
I don't think we get to see him enough.
There's a Iot of things said about the mom's spirit and feeling towards it.
"But dads do feel it as well, especially at 1 7."
You'd love to have that son around you.
Your watch!
could I have a look at that watch you got on?
AII I had to offer him was to take him drinking and playing snooker.
I didn't really have an awful lot to offer him but that's part of your establishment as a young man.
And that time went.
I've missed it.
I've missed it.
You popping back in tomorrow?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the only fellow in the family.
He's gone.
"AII right, Iet me get ready and then I'II be up, talk to you."
Got a....
Got a show today.
I'm exhausted.
Let's go!
"One Direction just released a new video  for their single ""One ay Or Another. """
he 1 D boys  flew to Africa as part of their inv olvement  with Comic Relief.
hey're donating the cash  they would have spent on a video  to a charity that strives to create a world free from poverty.
he success of the song was extraordinary.
hey raised well over a million pounds.
And the great thing is that  they saw when they were out in Africa just how many  individual lives that that will make a huge difference to.
pizza!
pizza!
pizza!
They've got Pentangeli.
"I didn't know it was going to be a hit, Mike."
I swear to God I didn't know.
Johnny Ola bumped into me in Beverly Hills.
He said that he wanted to talk.
He said that you and Roth were in on a big deal together.
And that there was something in it for me if I could help him out.
"He said that you were being tough on the negotiations but if they could get a little help and close the deal fast,"
it would be good for the family.
And you believed that story?
You believed that?
"He said there was something in it for me, on my own!"
"-I've always taken care of you, Fredo."
-Taken care of me?
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?
"""Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that!"""
"""Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere. """
"""Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"""
"I'm your older brother, but was stepped over!"
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!
"I can handle things, I'm smart!"
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb.
I'm smart and I want respect!
Is there anything you can tell me about this investigation?
Anything more?
"The Senate lawyer, Questadt."
He belongs to Roth.
"No, nothing I can think of, nothing specific."
"And this Mr. Samuels, the guy who made a pass at you, did you complain in front of Daniel Zucco?"
"Ye-Yes, Neva, last night, and-and he listened very carefully."
"- Yes, he did."
"- Where did this ""Samuel"" live?"
"Oh, come on!"
"Hey, look, young lady."
It's 10:30.
"In a couple of hours,"
Daniel Zucco is gonna reach out of the grave and kill somebody.
"Now, I don't know what this Samuels did to you, but do you think he deserves to die for it?"
No.
He's out in Rockville Center.
So's the place where I work.
"From there to Midtown Manhattan, could it be done in less than two and a half hours?"
"[Neva] Yeah, you could do it in that easy."
- Crocker!
- [Ticking]
Go talk to her.
"[Sighs] Well, what does that mean?"
"I mean, what am I supposed to tell her?"
That I feel a certain kind of love for her?
That I feel a certain responsibility toward her?
"Well, I don't want to be in charge of an outpatient anymore."
"Honey, you will never know how hard I've worked on that relationship."
- It's over.
"- Alex, for three years,"
I sat at a desk not 15 feet away from you... on the other side of a tiny wall that thick.
I paid your bills.
I balanced your checkbook.
I mixed your drink.
I apologized to your psychiatrist when you didn't wanna see him.
Peace)
What to do?
"God paired us off, did He?"
That's a colourful dress
You look like a movie hero
I wanted to wear a suit.
But little brotherJagadish forced me into this
We're three of us.
Jai is the other brother.
He's studying in America
Om-Jai-Jagadish!
It's like a prayer
Our photo
When we were kids
Have you ever fallen in love at first sight?
I have just chosen my mate for life!
And his name is Om
"What are you doing, Shanti?"
He promotes new singers
So I think I'll sing for him
"I tell you, I love you"
What have I landed myself in?
So horribly out of tune
Now I'd like to hear Om saying that to me in front of everyone
"If I must, I must"
How do you feel?
I feel like a scapegoat
I welcome students from all over the country... who are participating in this finale of...
Best of Best Generation Next
Two teams have made it to the finals
The girls' team from Bangalore.
And the boys from our college
~ Michael's not answering his phone.
~ What happened to your face?
Have you called the RVI?
What was Scottie doing exactly the last time you saw him?
"Getting a taxi, I think."
We were all stotious.
"Jo, maybe you should go back home and wait for him to turn up there."
~ (What?
") ~ Jo, if you think Scottie's done something stupid, you should be calling the police, not standing here staring at me after 36 hours."
Something stupid?
Like what?
My phone's still not working.
Can I use yours?
"Police, please."
"This way, please."
Sir?
~ Which one's the wife?
~ Er... it's the woman in the cream coat.
Who's the other two?
"The bloke is Peter Magath, the dead man's best mate, and that's his wife, Anita."
"Aye, look."
Have you seen the state of his face?
"They don't seem especially close, do they?"
She called in saying that she was worried about her missing husband and feared for his mental state.
Her description of her husband matches our man exactly.
I'll take them down.
"No, no."
"Rachel, you take her down."
Sit with her.
Watch her face and remember everything that she says.
"Afterwards, assuming it is her husband, bring her back here and if she wants to talk, let her talk, but don't tell her anything."
"And afterwards, you bring her back here and I'll come and find you."
"Thank you for calling, sir."
"Yes, we'll get out a bulletin right away."
"Glory be, commissioner."
What's wrong?
The just-opened Heritage First National Bank has just been robbed.
- By Batman and Robin.
-Saints preserve us.
"Yes, indeed, saints preserve us if the Caped Crusaders have gone crooked."
Which apparently they have.
Mr. Irving could hardly have dreamed that this happened.
"Chief O'Hara, I want an APB to all units for the arrest of Batman."
"Hopefully alive, but we'll take him the other way if we have to."
Attention all units.
Be on alert for Batman.
First name unknown.
Caucasian.
"Height: 6'2, wearing purple trunks, purple cape, purple cowl and a black bat insignia on his chest."
He has a masked accomplice whose alias is Robin.
Approach with caution.
They may be armed.
"I hate to do it, Caped Crusader, but I have to take you in."
You're on the wanted list.
"My gun's pointed at you, Caped Crusader."
Don't make me use it.
"Think Batman is afraid of you, Copper?"
Go on and shoot.
I dare you.
"What's happened to you, Boy Wonder?"
Even your voice has turned snarly.
"None of your business, Flatfoot."
"Now, go ahead and shoot, because you'll never take us alive."
"Batman, I'm giving you three to get out of the car with your hands up."
Thanks
Remember you can visit as often as you like.
"Its not that far, and i can come get you."
"No choice, We could sink the whole shit out on the coast!"
-Not according to the brits.
-I dont believe them.
-Well tell them
-Thats what you should do!
"I did, but it turned out this way"
With taking the lives of 50 innocent people.
You have to stop it.
The bomb is onboard.
The ferry left several minutes ago.
-You wanted the ferry plan all along.
-Thats not true.
"Off course, done with it all..."
So you finally can get back to Norway
"-Two coffes, what do you want?"
-Juice
-Good morning.
-39 barrels sunk.
-18 dead.
-Minus 4 germans
"Most of them under deck, likely captured in the dark, if the explotion didnt get them."
"One man got crushed on deck, by some rail carriages- 138 00:25:43.200 -- 00:25:46.299 - when he tried to get the lifeboat out."
"Most of them ended up in the sea, and drowned."
"Only the starboard lifeboat got used, And that one could only hold 8."
"Well, the main office is very pleased."
"They see ""heavy water"" operation as an success."
"""an example on warfare with few casualities"""
"""Such gives us great advanteges in battle"""
Churchill sends his congratulations.
- So we sit here and wait?
"- For once, she's right, Mike."
We gotta do somethin'.
"We're gonna hand him over to the U.S. Attorney, get him into Witness Protection."
- Won't she still come afteryou?
- We'll deal with that later.
"Sam, I need you to call the U.S. Attorney."
Tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
- I'm on it.
"- And, uh... somebodyneeds to go to mymom... see that she's safe, make her house secure."
- Think she's cooked dinneryet?
"- I'm sure she'll heat somethin' up foryou, Sam."
"Well, then I'm on that too."
Fi...
I need you to prep an armed escort.
Doug.
I need you... to stay away from the windows.
You say this is just a precaution?
"Oh, yeah."
It's nothin' to worry about.
"Um, say, um, this is a little embarrassing, but, uh... me and my lady friend, uh, had a falling out, and... well, Mike thought maybe itwould be okay ifl, uh, crashed here forthe night."
"Sam, I'm not an idiot."
You want to tell mewhat's goin' on?
"Well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats."
- Against me?
- Not specifically.
"Well, I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical type thing... so it's nothing to worry about, but Mike wanted me to stay here and giveyou some... you know, self-defense pointers in case I had to leave."
You gonna leave this here with me when you go?
Okay.
"Be careful, okay?"
'Cause that's loaded.
Yeah.
"""He tells me that he wishes to see you..."
"""his younger sister, before he dies."
"""please come and see my father."
"""sincerely yours, clark."""
It's touching!
It sure is.
"Say, Grandma, Iet's go to Hawaii."
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.
"But still, this is all so strange."
It could be some kind of mistake.
Cut it out now!
"Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire... it's possible it could be a swindler claiming to be your brother."
But I bet there is no one fool enough... to bother lying about being a brother of poor Grandma.
"In the first place, these people are rich!"
Suzujiro Haruno.
"surely, my maiden name is Haruno... but I can't remember the name Suzujiro."
"After all, I was born in a poor family that was blessed only with children."
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.
More than ten?
"Besides that, this man is an American, isn't he?"
-How could he be my big brother?
-It was written in the letter.
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant and became naturalized.
although he has American citizenship...
Grandma's brother is still Grandma's brother.
This guy Suzujiro must be Grandma's elder brother.
Right.
"Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?"
"I know... what you mean, but...."
Guess it's about the right time to eat some kidney beans.
real stubborn.
"Now, Joseph, we heard your testimony this morning."
-Was it true?
-It was all true.
And you claim that your sister killed your stepfather... because he grabbed her.
He was a strong man.
We were both afraid.
If Lucas was as strong as you and everybody else has said... how could your sister possibly overpower him?
She was madder than he was and scareder.
"Lucas was 195 lbs... your sister, 11O lbs."
Did she sneak up behind him... and hit him with that piece of firewood when he wasn't looking?
"No, sir."
Were you watching every second?
"Well, I might 've looked away once or twice."
Did you see Selena hit him the first blow?
I don't know.
is there any doubt in your mind as to how that 1st blow was struck?
I...
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
Joseph... you said that you told your sister to bury your stepfather.
-That's right.
She didn't want to.
-I see.
"And how old were you when you told her, when she did what you wanted?"
About 8.
In other words... a19 year-old girl didn't know what to do with the body... until an 8 year-old boy told her.
"-Yes, sir."
-I have no further questions.
No questions.
"You may step down, Joseph."
I wish to recall Selena Cross to the stand.
"Miss Cross, yesterday you told the jury that your stepfather... disappeared from home a year and a half before you killed him."
What else can we do?
If they fight we must fight with them.
"And does it matter, after all, who wins?"
Was that ever really the question?
Will almighty God ask that question in the end?
"Police Department, zone one."
Sergeant Roberts.
The Polish Hill Strangler has claimed a fourth victim.
The nude body of Arlene Dunn was recovered from the Ohio River.
"Police had been alerted to the crimes by the killer,   who taunts them by playing the song ""Little Red Riding Hood""."
The police brutality trial of Detective Jimmy Detillo is over.
Detillo was convicted for the beating of Leon Watson.
Watson remains in a coma.
The key to the conviction   was the testimony of Detillo's partner and cousin Thomas Hardy.
Hardy testified that his partner used unwarranted force.
"Come on, son, we're gonna be late for the policeman's ball."
- You've got to face him sometime.
- I feel like an asshole.
Maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.
- I had you as a role model.
- You got that from your mother.
- I see you got the boat fixed.
"- Yeah, we're going out tomorrow."
What's the latest on Little Red Riding Hood?
"We get close, he slips away."
"I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop."
Maybe an ex-cop.
"Uncle Nick thinks so, too."
- Did you talk to him about Jimmy?
- We talked around it.
Just try and understand.
Excuse me!
I'll just come.
I can't kill her.
And when she return Bhai's diamond then why?
"I think electricity has gone, Papa."
Shits!
"It's will be back tomorrow, Papa."
Don't you have Inverter?
What?
Don't you have Inverter?
"Papa, he's challenging you, I'll turn on the inverter."
"Papa, forget about electricity and kill him with bomb."
"I am not that Laxminarayan, It must some another Laxmi."
Have you gone mad?
That Laxminarayan lives in my hotel.
"I saw him, you leave me Sir."
It's about my job.
No.
Not at all.
"There's another Laxminarayan, May be he lives in Room No. 504"
"I am not that Laxminarayan, He must be that under garments dealer."
If you lied to me then...
You're saying like I'll say something and you will follow me.
"Sir, do what you want,"
"Marveles Idea,"
"Come, show me, where is that another Laxminarayan?"
"Papa, You take the tie, who will take the tie man?"
"Don't worry,"
"If you want stuff then you have to show your stuff, and business happens like this, I think you don't know about business."
"I am in business from 40 years,"
"I will stop if you show me the stuff, Yes or No."
I don't like to make things about me.
"You know, people think of me as a giving person."
"Oh, I can't take it."
I'm blowing the lid off this web of lies.
"I'm gonna ""Brady Bunch"" her."
You know I wasn't allowed to watch television as a child.
"Well, this man blamed Carol for injuring his neck in a car accident, and then Mike and the kids went to court, and then Mike dropped a briefcase, which caused the man with the fake neck brace"
"to whip his head around, proving that his neck wasn't hurt at all."
The whole family went to court for a traffic accident?
"The doctor was supposed to be examining my neck,"
- but his eyes were journeying.
- It's quite a journey.
"Mama, I can't find my ball."
Try to find anything else to squeeze.
"You know, I had him on a flight once to JFK."
No!
He kept on pressing the help button.
It was supposedly because he didn't know how to work the...
Damn it!
"I thought you said the ""Brady Bunch"" man dropped his briefcase, not his husband's spaghetti plate!"
Mom!
You okay?
"Oh, she's fine."

"Ok, Sally, then we'll get back to your tests."
"Well, excuse me, Doctor,"
Sally have you ever seen those two clowns before?
"So help me, Judy, you've seen the last banana in your life, you two-timing little rat!"
"When we get you back to Wameru, you'll get solitary confinement in a cage."
The second I get my hands free
I'm gonna wallop the daylights outta you.
(SCREECHING)
Sally!
"Captain, Sergeant, quick, before she gets lost."
"Hey, Captain, get these ropes off us."
We'll help you find her.
After what you threatened?
You'd probably kill her.
"Hey, there she is."
Judy.
Come here.
(CHATTERING)
- Come on.
"- Come on, Judy."
That's a good girl.
Now come on.
Untie these ropes.
"Come on, Judy, get these ropes off."
"No, Judy, you're not the world-famous astro-chimp."
"You're just plain, old-fashioned, smart-aleck Judy from Wameru."
"For Pete's sake, Judy, you're not Sally."
"Sally is obviously an intelligent, superior, well-behaved animal, and you're just a spoiled little brat."
"Jack, do you suppose something has happened to Judy and she really believes she's Sally?"
She could be suffering from some kind of nervous disorder.
The only thing she's suffering from is a sense of misplaced grandeur.
- Mr. President.
- How's the tour?
You see the basketball court?
"Mr. President, can I ask you a question for my YouTube channel?"
- That'd be all right.
What's your name?
- Emily Cale.
"Emily Cale, go ahead."
- Okay.
- How I look on that thing?
I wasn't ready for a press conference.
How do you expect 22 Arab nations with different regional and religious interests to agree on a single treaty especially given the newly erupting conflicts between the Shiites and the Sunnis in southern Pakistan?
Tough question.
"To be honest with you, I don't know."
"Whether they'll agree or not I'm not sure, but I gotta try."
The day we stop believing different people can come together is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.
What I am ready to do is give a little girl a shout-out on her YouTube blog.
"Hi, folks, my name is James W. Sawyer and I'm here with Emily Cale and her video blog."
Check it out.
- You have a good one.
- Wait.
"Mr. President, this is my dad John."
He's gonna be on your Secret Service detail.
Secret Service detail.
Is that right?
"You know, I take my protection detail very seriously."
"- Yes, sir."
- Stop lying to children.
"- Nice to meet you, Emily."
"- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President."
You guys have a good one.
Good.
Nigar Kalfa will be with her
She'd never leave her alone
I'm relieved.
I won't have to worry about her
I wonder whose idea it was to send her there
Our Valide Sultana agreed to it
Nigar Kalfa will be more beneficial there than she was here
I came here for...
His Majesty gave me this lucky charm when I got pregnant to Mehmet
What an elegant amulet
Yeah
I always carried it at the birth of my children
It supported me
I want to gift it to Hatice Sultana
Is that how you ask for forgiveness?
Good idea
That is a very valuable gift
Our Sultana will be happy
Let's visit her some time
Will you accompany me?
Of course
We'll visit her first thing tomorrow
Wow wow
Such great things
If you want we can place one infront of your house
No my Paşa.
I'm not a Paşa.

Because the ones who saw these at port were already gossiping
Moriarty's mechanical dragon attacks a speeding locomotive... and they steal a parrot that belongs to one of the passengers.
"Meanwhile, Holmes finds out that there's a relationship... between the parrot and Indian merchant who's gone missing."
What will the parrot tell us?
"If you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at Baker Street."
Game of Wits!

"Ladies and gentlemen, did you hear?"
"Get them, please, get off the plane."
Mrs. Dexter...
"Look, look, she's just had two very long flights."
If you would be patient-
"It's all right, Dex."
They're just doing their job.
King Galen will be coming off the plane any minute.
Could you please stand back and give a little room?
"How is he, Mrs. Dexter?"
And where's Prince Michael?
- Prince Michael is on the plane with His Majesty.
"Now, he's unconscious and he's still very sick."
- How did you get him out of Moldavia?
Did you pay the government?
We issued a press release when we changed planes in New York.
You should have that information within the hour.
"- Look, here they come."
Please stand back.
Clear the way.
Please stand back.
Alexis told me once when we were married:
"""Blake, there is nothing on this planet that I can't do, including the impossible."""
"I guess she proved that to the world, hasn't she?"
Darling.
I just need you to help me look pretty enough to capture a nobleman.
No problem.
This is gonna be harder than writing the book.
The Earl of Cleveland is going to be here any second.
I hope you memorized the names of the dignitaries.
"Oh, don't worry."
I made a cheat sheet.
"- Oh, no."
- What?
These are my football picks.
"Elka, what were you thinking?"
I know.
Ravens plus three?
Here they come.
"- Oh, I'm screwed."
- Don't panic.
The Earl has to introduce his people to you.
Just pay attention and repeat what he says.
"Councilwoman Ostrovsky, a pleasure."
The members of my party:
"Chief magistrate Martin Portreeve, lieutenant colonel Rodson Heathcote-Drummond, the honorable Martin Gled-heweson, bishop of Lichfield, lord keeper of the privy seal Lemonde Oswolf-sticket."
"Everyone, please welcome the Earl of Cleveland."
"And with him plaidsy, war man, churchie, and..."
Lemony snicket.
I believe we're going to have great fun doing business together.
"Gentlemen, please."
"You did it, Elka."
You're a hero.
"Oh, save it for the real heroes, the ravens, if they cover the spread."
"Oh, you look so beautiful."
Your eye patch matches your gown.
"Your gown covers the wheels on your orthopedic boot, and the super glue is holding perfectly on your dead tooth."
How about that carpenter?
He treats me well
"But he wants a son, and I want an id card"
"When he got a son, and I get my id card"
He won't force me to be with him
He might even give me some money then I can do whatever I want
What do you want to do anyway?
I want to go to Taiwan
Then what do you want to do in Hong Kong?
Me?
"I want to be rich I want to earn a lot of money, and enjoy myself"
Can't you be rich in Thailand?
If I could would I have come to Hong Kong?
Then are you rich yet?
Do you know how to become rich?
"I know Hung Fist, and have learnt Thai Boxing too lf l combine the 2 styles they are no match to me"
"Just wait and see, I will win"
Does it hurt?
Do you feel the pain?
"This is Ah Mut Sha, your opponent"
He's testing the power of his opponent
"Watch out for his elbow, he's quick"

My childhood was a nightmare!
I've spent the rest of my life trying to board up that haunted house.
"Francis, this is important."
"I really need to remember something, and I don't know what it is."
- But...
- Please.
You're the only one who can help me.
My earliest memories...
It's kind of vague.
I remember we had that apartment...
I remember it being really colorful.
"Come on, Francis, honey."
"Please, won't you eat anything?"
"We've tried the carrots, and the peaches, and the oatmeal, the apples, huh?"
Don't you like anything?
Lois!
Would you like to know what your son did to my director's cut of The Eyes of Laura Mars?
He also shaved a hole in the carpet with my new Norelco!
"I'm sorry, Hal."
"I asked him very nicely not to play with it, but he just wouldn't listen."
I can't get him to do anything.
"I've read Dr. Spock and Piaget and Eisenberg, and The Language of Hugs, all these books, nothing's helping."
What he needs is a little discipline.
I think he'd behave better if he just ate something.
Look at him.
He's just wasting away.
I'm going to give him another Hershey bar.
"Lois, no!"
You can't keep coddling him like this!
I am sick and tired of always having to be the bad cop because you're constantly giving in to him.
"Okay, Hal, I'll try."
"You keep saying that, and then you do it again!"
I got a text from my daughter last night.
Chivonne?
I guess her auntie finally told her I was out.
She wants to see me.
What'd you tell her?
I told her yes.
"Okay, Doc, you can say it."
"Look, I know that she's the reason why you're doing this, that you want to be someone that she can look up to."
But seeing her right now could be really dangerous for both of you.
"I know, but she asked to see me."
"After all this time, she came to me."
"If I turn her down, I might not get a second chance."
Just be careful.
Always.

You came to Marrakech in the same bus.
You had an aperitif with him in your hotel room.
You ate at the same restaurant last night.
"Yes, but at different tables."
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
I met him for the first time yesterday on a bus.
"And yet, out of 5,000 people in a great marketplace, he comes to you when he is about to die."
is that the action of a casual acquaintance?
I know absolutely nothing about Louis Bernard.

Why?
Because he placed complete confidence in you.

Time for Mr. Carrington to unleash his charm offensive.
"Why, hello, ladies."
"Good morning, sir."
"Mr. Carrington, is there anybody here that you are particularly fond of or have a preference for?"
"Yeah, there is very much somebody"
I'm specifically very close to and feel an enormous attachment to and that's Miss Hopkins.
"As Miss Hopkins' chaperone, it's Lady Devonport's job to keep impoverished playboys at arm's length."
"But having experienced the pitfalls of Regency propriety herself, she's in two minds."
"And as you know,"
I support your interest in her completely.
So next!
No.
How do you propose to support Miss Hopkins?
"Um, with my massive amounts of charm and talent and no money."
And so modest.
"As the chaperones debate the charms of Mr. Carrington,"
"Mr. Everett soldiers on with his maze, helped by old friend Miss Braund."
And then this one here...
So what's this rounded one here?
"When Mr. Everett comes in,"
I know that he's going to...
"Yeah, I agree."
"In fact, either of them are perfectly wonderful."
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, morning."
Do sit down.
Thank you so much.
"The first question is, is there a particular lady here that you like?"
I like Miss Hopkins.

You're a good worker.
I wish it could be more.
"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."

"Hey, how you doin', John, buddy?"

Boy Scouts.
Who knows?
He's a quiet guy.
No trouble at all.

Yeah.
Call the lieutenant.
Tell him to get in touch with a Dr. Irene Benton at this hospital.

"Danny first came here five months ago, Lieutenant."
- And the bombings started about a month later.
- But he's getting better in the group.
"In the beginning, the arguments, the violent emotions practically made him pass out."
"The others laughed at him, sympathized with him, attacked him."
"But they never excluded him, and that was the key."
Danny's not half as afraid of emotions anymore.
But he has got problems.
"Now, would you say that makes him a candidate for our bomber or not?"
"What do you think, Doctor?"
"I think you ought to question him on your own, Lieutenant."
I got a better idea.
- I think I'll join the group.
"Edie, you will help me?"
"You will tell them for me, yes?"
"Of course, Axel."
"This is my new and good friend Miss Morrow, from Beverly Hills."
"When I tell Edie what I want to do, she helps me."
What's happened is this:
Axel is selling his shop here and with it his highly honored trademark.
"The proceeds will go into a Hospital Fund, and I'm happy to tell you that the local church committee and others have pledged that they will match that amount dollar for dollar."
[Men grumbling]
"Boys, boys, what does this mean?"
You are afraid you lose your jobs?
You think Axel Norstaad would let this happen?
Of course not.
Now I will show you your new employer.
"Mr. Martin Somers of Long Beach, where he has big, big furniture factory."
"Mr. Somers, I introduce you around."
Tell your boss I just dropped in to--
Mr. Hadley.
We didn't expect to see you here.
I'm sure you didn't.
Losing bidders are supposed to go home and shut up.
"Hello, Hadley."
"Hello, Norstaad."
I gather it's all signed and delivered.
Sorry I gave you such a legitimate offer.
I don't know what you mean.
"It's nothing, Axel."
Everybody wanted your trademark.
"Mr. Hadley just needs a consolation drink, that's all."
It isn't me that needs the drink.
"Miss Morrow, you may be a very fine little promoter, but your knowledge of the furniture business--"
"You just say those things to me, Hadley."
THe difference by that time was that He was really determined to be an actor.
"Now, you edge over a little bit, ""Mr. Maverack."""
I don't want to get a bill for tbat mirror.
He did some Maverick episodes.
I don't know How many He did.
He did one or two.
You could just tell clint was going to be somebody.
He bad great stage presence.
We were both very young at the time.
He was offered Rawbide and I remember we were living across the street from each other.
"I was backing out of my driveway, be was backing out of bis and be said be needed to talk to me because be was offered tbls series."
"He said: ""Wbat sbouId I ask for?"""
"I said: ""I don't know, but I tell you wbat not to do."

"Ms. Thornton, the senior class has asked me to say a few words and on behalf of them, to present this gift to you."
"""Our names are inscribed inside the cover of that dictionary."

Some good Samaritans had to help her to get out of the vehicle because she was hurt.
Some gangsters were about to die at the hands of an enraged crowd in Guatemala.
The so-called criminals were whipped and had to walk naked on the streets as punishment.
The crowd thought them guilty of extortion and robberies.
Policemen and soldiers rescued them before they were killed.

And it's exciting and it pops and I get the sense that Dave likes it.
I'm going back to the bar.
I don't know what New Orleans music would be today if it wouldn't be for what the Meters created back in the day.
The Meters are like the Beatles here in New Orleans for us.
I think the Meters turned out to be is the embodiment of everything we're sitting here talking about.
They're just straight-up New Orleans funk.
Leo Nocentelli on guitar.
Zigaboo Modeliste on drums.
"And the bass player, George Porter."
The Neville Brothers were Art and Aaron.
They were like a part of the fiber of the early days of the Meters.
I discovered the Meters through Led Zeppelin.
I read somewhere that the Meters were...
"John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin..."
They were one of his favorite bands.
"And it only makes sense... when you listen to the ""pocket"""
and the groove the Meters had.
"I was fascinated with Zigaboo, the drummer."
"It's such a strange, unorthodox, different way of approaching rhythm."
I never heard it before.
He was very syncopated.
"He used the ""ands"" of ""one"""
way more than normal drummers would use.
"And when he makes them, I would read him."
You know?
"I'd know it's coming, so I would ""and"" with him, you know?"
"It wasn't ""correct,"" they way he played."
It was just how he felt.
He played how he felt.
It's just the artistic air around New Orleans.

"Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him"
So there's no one?
I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays
And you dream of someone you haven't even seen!
Quite mad
No Ma.
This is no dream

But he's there.

Why don't you two fellows see... if you can get your heads together for a few minutes?
Go ahead.
- Do you know who I am?
- No.
What you used to be in the southwest...
I used to be in the northwest.
How does that work?
"I know that you've been, as I've been, a man hunter."
I was a tracker.
Better still.
John Coble's put in a pretty fervent recommendation for you... to The Cattlemen's Association to help control the rustling.
I believe his point was... handling rustlers after your experience with the Apache wars... should be like shooting fish in a barrel.
"Now, you're talking about... the high side of shooting and the low side of the law."
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you... you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.
"From the standpoint of the Association, that's going to be entirely up to you."
Whether I bring them in or shoot?
Is your problem.
You're a U.S. Marshal.
"You tell me, what's the difference... between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?"
A Marshal's checks come in on time.
"Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you to be in his Wild West Show?"
"Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona, where we had a lot of people killed."
He offered me my own act.
"Like I said, we had a lot of people killed."
Joe.
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.
"Man of the West, Indian tracker, and scared to death of lobster."
It was my first time.
What do you...
I'm thrilled you'll have me.
Please toast to my beautiful bride   and her fantastic family who have welcomed me so kindly -
"- Jørgen, Helene, the twins..."
Cheers.
"Christian's lovely, don't you think?"
He's nice.
- He's so cute.
- Cute?
Maybe.
- I dated him before Anna.
- Was he your boyfriend?
But Anna gets whatever she wants.
It's not traditional for the bride to give a speech   but everything's gone so well so far.
I know Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong.
I'll do it now so that you can relax.
"My speech isn't for you, Christian."
I love you and you know it.
I couldn't be happier than I am today.
And don't worry.
I'll pay back the 1000 kroner.
But I'd like to thank Mom and Dad.
"Mom, I know we argue a lot now and then   but you are the best, the most loving   and the most loyal person I have ever met."
And Dad...
When I turned 18 a few years ago   you had to tell me that you weren't my real father... genetically.
You told me how Mom had known another man   and we didn't talk for almost six months.
It wasn't until I met Christian that I began to understand   why you did what you did.
"You did it to protect me, so I'd have a mother and father like everyone else."
I've had a dad.
You've been the best father anyone could ever wish for.
"And if I could have chosen, I would have chosen you, Dad   whether you're my father or not."
So I would like to say thank you.
Thank you for today and for everything.
I did find a breach on the same day the photos were downloaded.
I'm thinking someone could've pirated his signal.
Todd Fleming.
The alligator blood Stella found puts him on Nelson's roof.
Maybe that's what he was doing up there.
"Okay, so Fleming downloads the photos of the boy, and makes it looks like Coach Nelson sent them."
"I mean, it's possible, but why?"
"Clearly, Fleming wanted to discredit Nelson."
"Making a coach look like a pedophile, that'll do it."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nelson's apartment.
Stell and Lindsay found the alligator blood over here.
"Okay, maybe something."
"I'm getting a list of networks, but nothing strong enough to connect to."
It means we're in the vicinity.
"Okay, I've got several network choices now."
Signal looks like it's strongest in this direction.
"Got one Wi-Fi network that's fully unprotected, no password, nothing-- genius."
Look what it's called.
Vince N. Wireless Network.
"So all Fleming had to do from here was to release a prewritten script to Nelson's computer, turning it into a zombie."
Giving him complete control.
"The e-mail connects to the murder, I just can't figure out how."
"Yeah, well, we know Fleming didn't kill Nelson."
He had an alibi.
"Right, but Coach Nelson's wife said she saw two people up here."
He might've had some help.
There's sawdust over here.
Sid found sawdust on the victim.
But Stella and Lindsay would've found the sawdust when they were here.
Not necessarily.
"Guys, all I know is that we should really appreciate this... 'cause I don't think we're gonna be able to do this in college."

- Absolutely right.
Absolutely right.
Yes.
- (applause)
"Alan Smithee is the name used when directors disown a film, either because they've lost control of the final cut, or it's simply too awful to admit to."

And what can you tell me about the making of the film that's quite interesting?
(laughter)
"WHen He starts playing, you go¸:"
"""where does a person learn to play like that..."
"""...when nobody else is playing like that?"""
I was in tHe military during the Korean War.
Many younger actors bad been drafted in tbe service and tbey were tbere.
David Janssen was a little buddy of mine.
"So I thought¸: ""Well, I'll maybe try it. """
THe impression I Had was of a kid kind of really groping around for who He was.
"Even acting was something that, you know, kind of Happened to Him."
"Tbe tbree young men featured in tbis scene Rex Reason, Grant williams and clint Eastwood were discovered and developed right here on our lot."
"Just like all tbe otber people, be didn't know wbat be was talking about."
Tbat's funny.
You'd tbink be'd know sometbing.
He's as blind as you are.
"WHen I was signed at Universal, actually He was in tHe class."
The result tbat tbey wanted were stars then.
And tbey wanted to mold tbem into elegant women and He-men.
And Clint was a perfect subject for that because He was a phenomenal listener.
Was He interested in acting?
I think very much so.
"THey weren't exactly the HigH-grade pictures of the day, but they were experience."
Dropping napalm.
follow an order.
"Hey, I tbink I bear surf."
"Yeab, I feel a ground swell."
Tbe beach must be dead abead.
"Dr. bell's waiting for bim in surgery, sir."
"-Wbat is it, will?"
"-TeIepbone, Dr. Parker."
those contract players were just....
You were just journeymen.
You were there to be called upon.

Their is no phone network on this island
How can I contact others?
Via Satellite.
Kabir Malhotra has satellite phone

Mr. Malhotra has bought this island
And he took the responsibilty for all villagers
Malessa will bring you to your rooms
I have waited for 3 years for this moment
Its priceless
Only flower of the world whose flower grows after 8 years
You are a pimp
You are a murderer
He is saying rubbish
It was just a trailer
Movie will start now
This story begun 20 years ago
There was a baby.
Very innocent
Why you are telling this to us?
I was saying she became orphan by the age of 6
For rs 2000 she was sold to orphan house of Thailand
It was your orphan house
We never buy childrens.
We take them for care
A 6 year old girl was sent to Thailand
She was sent to a world which is worst than a nightmare
Only her body was left.
She became prostitute
"As much as money she earns, her owner gets more profit"
LAUGHTER
I see.
LAUGHTER
Let's see how many of our 100 people said jizz.
It's a correct answer.
And it gets you through.
APPLAUSE
"And that scores you seven, which takes your total up to 11."
Richard?
"Yeah, uh, jizz is of course, it's, uh..."
"Everybody knows, it's the characteristic first impression you get of a plant or animal."
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
"My mother gets confused between, like, certain words with Zs in them, like pizzazz."
"And so one time she met one of my friends, and he's not very entertaining."
"She was like ""I don't like him."
"He had no jizz in him, you know?"""
LAUGHTER
"I had to explain to her what jizz was and she was like,"
"""Yeah, I don't think he had any of that, either."""
"Got a bit of an issue with you, mate."
"I've done The Cube, I've done The Chase, never done Pointless."
"You did a comedian's special, I wasn't invited on."
"Yeah, it was a comedian special."
Oh.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
"OK, ""Most people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show."""
"David, what do you think?"
"There is the spectrum of quiz shows which has, we'll say Catchphrase, Family Fortunes at one end, and then say Only Connect, University Challenge at the other end."
"At one end, if you don't answer all of them correct, you can't sleep that night, and at the other end if you get one of them right in your life, you retire, so..."
LAUGHTER The irony is...
"The irony is the easier they are, the more money you earn."

Welcome to New York...
"It's split in a funny fucking way, the bone's chipped and..."
that's what poked the fingernail off.
Stabbed in the back of my Face...
He needed to stick a needle in the palm of my hand.
The needle has webs in it.
"So, his concern is:"
"a) I can play it all or b) what if I start playing, I don't know how to send, my finger is in a bloody mess,"
"I can't feel it, that's not gonna make a good show, so what do you think about it and what to do right now?"
"So I was thinking, you know... if it was one, Tracy or somebody can play."
Today at the soundcheck proved that Tracy doesn't know the stuff to play those parts.
"If you can't do, you can't do that, fuck it."
If I got my throat cut out we wouldn't play the show either.
So fuck it.
"Now welcome your host, Jimmy Carr!"
"Hello, and welcome to 8 Out of 10 Cats, a show about opinion polls, surveys, and statistics."
"Did you know, for example, 50% of people say they feel they're not living life to the full."
"Come on, how can you say that?"
"You're sitting on your own, watching E4, in your pants, eating a yoghurt."
It's pretty full-on.
Tinder has 10 million active daily users.
"Oh, yeah, it's got users all right."
"You could've called me, Carlos."
You could've called.
And 64% of teenagers think they have it harder than their parents.
"Well, I'd like to say to those teenagers, they're wrong."
No-one has ever had it harder than your mum.
"Right, let's get started!"
What Are You Talking About?
That's the name of our first round.
It's our panellists' job to guess the nation's top three most popular Brits.
"Aisling's team, who do you think are the most popular people in Britain?"
"Uh, JK Rowling."
"She's become incredibly successful, a global phenomenon."
Yeah.
Do you love her?
"Oh, I love her, I've read, have you read all the Harry Potter books?"
"No, I'm 32."
"But... ..I've read a lot of her work, on Twitter, which I think is genius."
Because she is...
"Sorry, sorry, actually..."
"Yeah, no, no, the books are stupid, they're childish, it's silly."
"I mean, she is a woman who basically has become a billionaire by taking children's pocket money."
She's a genius in my book.
"Did you see recently, speaking of Twitter, she's had this big Twitter spat with Joanna Trollope?"
It's actually really hard when someone's called a Trollope already to work out what to call them.
"Now scoot, huh?"
"Young lady, you are getting to be a pest."
"Now, look, you can't go with us."
"You'd only be in the way, understand?"
"Here, hold her."
(CHATTERING)
"Judy, shame on you."
"You know, today, there just happens to be a chimp far more important than you."
(CHATTERING)
(PAULA):
"You know, somewhere out in the bush there's a chimp just like you."
Only she's been on a long trip through outer space.
And now she's waiting for somebody to rescue her.
Poor thing.
"All alone, frightened, and lost."
(TRUMPETS)
(MAN OVER RADIO):
"This is Radio Nagoro interrupting again to give you the latest news on the fate of Sally, the missing American astro-chimp."
The space capsule which carried her on her epic round-trip to the moon has apparently landed somewhere deep in the confines of the Wameru game reserve.
"Natives at nearby Katanga village reported sighting a large, metal object floating from the sky under the canopy of a red, white, and blue parachute... (MARSH, OVER RADIO):"
Paula.
"Paula, do you read me?"
"Yes, Dad."
Have you found little Sally yet?
(MARSH):
Not yet.
"Look, Hedley and I are near Manduli, and Jack and Mike are headed for the river crossing."
"Look, honey, I hate to ask you this, but, um, do you feel up to walking over to the north waterhole?"
If Sally's wandering around she's probably pretty thirsty by now.
"Well, sure, Dad."
(MARSH):
"Why, and take Clarence and Judy."
I am proceeding to Salem Jail where is Arul?

"Sorry, we're closed."
Says who?
Write something.
We'll all sign.
"On this prank, I'm covering no one."
Let's wait for René!
Move your ass.
"So David, you've read the books, right?"
"Yeah, I mean, they're just, they're quite complicated."
You know?
"I will say that about them, it's just generally,"
"I feel I grew up in a more simple time, when a wizard had a pointy hat, you know?"
"It was a man, a woman that was a wizard was a witch, and had a cow, uh, or a cat."
A cow?
"Sorry, yeah..."
"It's quite complicated, people."
"They're quite complicated,"
David wasn't able to remember all the facts.
I love all the Harry Potter books.
"The only thing is, like, Hogwarts is not a great school."
"Every year, they have a rather large amount of accidents involving children, at least one of the staff members get murdered, like, Ofsted should be stepping in."
"""What is going on here?"
"There's a snake in the sewer."""
"I've not really read Harry Potter, I've not watched the films."
"It's, it just, it reinforces the fact that boarding schools are weird, innit?"
The reason you wouldn't enjoy it is because the kid with hair like yours is the baddie.
We're always the baddie!
"I heard the best, uh, Harry Potter chat-up line, was a guy saying, ""I'm Draco Malfoy, can I slither in?"""
Ohh!
"What I like about films is, um, you know, cos Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, it was so method, he's actually stayed a child."
Have you seen you?
What?
"Shall we have a look at, uh..."
"I mean, obviously JK Rowling has legions of fans."
This may be her biggest fan.
"Hello, I'm Harry Potter himself."
You're looking for America's biggest Harry Potter fan.
"But you're in luck, you found the world's biggest Harry Potter fan."
"In 2006, watch it, steady on."
"That's why in La Crosse, Wisconsin, we decided to"
"That's why in La Crosse, Wisconsin, we decided to approach all of our patients and"
"Wisconsin, we decided to approach all of our patients and offer them the opportunity to do approach all of our patients and offer them the opportunity to do this planning, that way families offer them the opportunity to do this planning, that way families have the confidence that"
"this planning, that way families have the confidence that they made the right decisions."

DR. SINGER:
The weather balloons around the world show no warming of the atmosphere in the last 25 years.
DR. MANN:
You have all of these organizations with lofty sounding names like Americans for Prosperity or The Heartland Institute.
These are front groups that are funded by corporate interests.
Americans for Prosperity is really a front group for the Koch brothers.
PHILIPS:
That's an organization founded by David and Charles
Koch and good morning to you Tim.
"‐Good to be here, Bill."
"‐Welcome here, what are you going to get for your money?"
We hope to see policies change.
DR. MANN:
Koch Industries is one of the largest privately held fossil fuel interests in the world.
And they are doing everything they can to protect that wealth.
NEWS REPORT:
"Would you give up all that industrialization, would you give up all the productivity that it's brought us, all the lives that it has saved over the last 100 years, so that the temperature wouldn't rise half a percent"
or a milli percent?
DR. MANN:
They've lobbied Congress.
INHOFE:
"We keep hearing 2014 has been the warmest year on record, oh here Mr. President catch this."
Mhmm.
DR. MANN:
James Inhofe is probably the most prominent congressional climate change denier.
INHOFE:
Global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.
DR. MANN:
He's the chair of the Senate Environment Committee.
INHOFE:
There are some people who are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful that they can change a climate.
Man can't change climate.
"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."
To me being a gangster was better than being president of the United States.
Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job I knew I wanted to be part of them.
It was there that I knew I belonged.
"To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies."
"They weren't like anybody else, I mean they did whatever they wanted."
They double parked in front of a hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket.
"In the summer, when they played cards all night nobody ever called the cops."
Tony Stacks.
How are you?
Tuddy Cicero.
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?
Tuddy.
"Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria and a few other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss over everybody in the neighborhood."
Paulie might have moved slow but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.
-lt's your fault.
-You started it!
I started it?
It's your fault.
At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.
"My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of 11."
He liked that I got myself a job.
He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.
Henry!
Watch how you cross!
Bring back milk!
And my mother was happy after she found out that the Ciceros came from the same part of Sicily as she did.
To my mother that was the answer to all her prayers.
I was the luckiest kid in the world.
"I could go anywhere, I could do anything."
"I knew everybody, and everybody knew me."
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would toss me their keys and let me park their Cadillacs.
But you will lose your life in this war
"""You are making my anger to rise."

Om Namah Shivaya
Your Shiv's Trishul could not effect me.
Your mind is corrupted.
This ineffectiveness of Shiv's Trishul is also his Leela.
Great scholars have not been able to understand Shiv's Leela.
What will a sinner like you understand
"""ln truth, death is hovering over you and now will come to you."""
Om Namah Shivaya
"""Lord Shiv, what is this Leela?"
"Husband is fighting with you..."""
...fiercely whereas his wife is praying to you with dedication
If that ignorant husband can come and see here he would understand why Shiv's Trishul's returned without killing
And also realize that Shiv has not killed him only due to his wife's worship.
Vrinda!
"""Salutations, Guru"""
I want to bless you to be Saubhagyavati (have a husband...
"""...always), but can't do that?"""
"""What is the difficulty in giving that blessing, Guruvar."""
Your husband Jalandhar's mind is corrupted.
He is going towards his destruction without thinking about you  himself
That is why I am praying to Lord Shiv.
Vrinda!
Jalandhar's sins have increased more than your sacredness  devotion.
Hence these will all go waste.
"""No, Guruvar-Jalandhar's wickedness  pride have..."""
...weakened your prayer  devotion.
"And America, 'cause we're good, we're gonna help him."
- Okay.
"- Okay, so we're all gonna vote for Trump because he's hurting, he's in pain?"
"We're actually gonna let him be our president to be nice, or kind or something?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
Like Batboy.
Remember Batboy?
We're all in on it.
- What was Batboy?
"- The kid with cancer and he wanted to be Batman, so the whole city was like, you're Batman!"
- I had this friend and she's ten years old.
"You know, she's--"
She's my neighbor.
"I mean, it's okay if I have a ten-year-old friend, right?"
"- Yeah, you can have one."
"- Anyway, I talk to her the other day and she said that she had a stomachache and so she-- she said to me, Big Boy--"
"Well, that's what she calls me, she calls me ""Big Boy."""
"She said, um, my stomach hurts so bad, I wanna--"
"I wanna pound my stomach, 'cause it-- 'cause it hurts."
"And I said, well, that's not how it works, Esmeralda."
"If your stomach hurts and you hurt it more, then you hurt more."
"I said, you have to, you know, find the place in you where it hurts and be kind to it, be good to it, give it milk and honey and medicine and it'll heal and you and it will be okay and..."
"Then I thought, if someone's part of you, how do you stop them from hurting you?"
And it's...
"It's by being good to them and being caring to them and giving them milk and honey, you know, and you need to take care of people to hurt you."
"- Yeah, we're all connected."
That hippie shit is true.
"That's not just Trump, that's our Trump, do you understand?"
"And he's in pain, and he's swollen, and we gotta get some ice on him quick and get him in the White House."
- Can't we just tell him he's the president?
"You know, can't we just pretend, so he'll be okay?"
- Like Batboy.
The blood of those two people...
You're going to have to clean it for a while now.
Please don't steal our subs and I hope you enjoy the rest of the episode!
"I, Seo Yong Hak..."
Now in front of the people.
In front of all the citizens...
To have to reveal the truth...
I do with my deepest apologies.
"However,"
"Because the citizens deserve to know, I have gathered up my courage and"
I now stand here.
The next person the City Hunter is after.
Is President Choi Eung Chan.
Because of the sweep mission 28 years ago.
"Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, Chairman Kim Jong Shik, Chairman Cheon Jeon Man and I, all of us, were scapegoats of revenge."
However!
"The person who directed the Sweep Mission 28 years ago... is now the current President, President Choi Eung Chan."
He personally planned it... and personally implemented it.
Director!
Seo Yong Hak said the President planed it!
The sweep mission involved 5 people but he still didn't disclose the details.
President Choi Eung Chan Emergency Press Conference.
Why was the sweep mission set up?
It's not something I know of (or familiar of)
Is it really true that in '83 November you did not direct this plan?
That's right.
"Former member of the supreme council, Seo Yong Hak said that... the City Hunter's last target was the President."
I don't know under what motivated him to say that.
"Today, the press conference will end with this."
Just one more question.
"A Seoul Special Investigation prosecutor was looking for the 1983 classified document and died while doing so, did you know that?"
The person who planned the Sweep Mission... is the current President...

"Fight yourself lt's right to fight like this, keep it this way"
You should pass out in the next round
Shut up
Remember what I've said
- Like the boogie-woogie beat
- Don't mean the blues
I love the boogie-woogie beat
- She loves the boogie-woogie beat
- Great
"Each year, hundreds of performers like me were brought to MGM, hoping to get a break in the movies."
"There were acting teachers, instructions in posture and grooming and everybody had to learn to sing and dance."
It was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that special something known as star quality.
"And if you had it, you got to take the next big step:"
The screen test.
"For instance, Kathryn Grayson had to wait two years at MGM before she was given her first screen test represented here in Anchors Aweigh."
But the wait paid off because she became one of MGM's leading sopranos in the 1940s and '50s.
To the thrill of the night
Shakin' the blues away

Shake off your cares and troubles
Ann Miller was only 14 when she got her first movie contract at RKO and was a seasoned pro when she came to MGM for Easter Parade.

NARRATOR:
"George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were both expert surveyors and mapmakers, and were hands on in the layout and design of the new capital."
BIRNES:
"George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who was an architect that built Monticello, laid out Washington"
"D.C. with the expectation that somehow, if there were extraterrestrials, they would see the image of the star at the center of the city, and know this was a sign that we respected extraterrestrial life."
NARRATOR:
Did the design and placement of the Washington
"Monument, Capitol Hill and the National Mall really reflect the"
Founding Fathers' belief in extraterrestrial forces?
Perhaps the answer can be found by a close examination of the
"Capitol Building itself, and the strange connection to other worlds that can be found inside."
"Washington D.C., 1791."
Jenkins Hill.
Pierre L'Enfant declares this location
"""a pedestal waiting for a monument."""
"For the next two years, he works closely with"
"George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, designing the building that will sit at the top of this hill and house the"
United States Congress.
"On September 18, 1793, the day of the Autumn Equinox,"
"Washington lays the cornerstone for the Capitol Building, and"
Jenkins Hill officially becomes
"Capitol Hill, the heart of the new democracy."
HENRY:
The concept of the ancient and sacred hill was deeply in the minds of the Founding Fathers.
In Boston we have high hills that were important.
"We have Monticello being built on a hill, we have Capitol Hill."
So the Founding Fathers clearly understood the importance of the
Temple Mount concept.
NARRATOR:
But was the design and placement of the Capitol
Building directly influenced by Washington and Jefferson's reported contact with alien beings?
"Ancient astronaut theorists point to evidence in the form of the statue that still sits atop the Capitol Dome,"

If you want to hear Applauding hands resound
You gotta have glorious Technicolor

Unless her lips are scarlet And her mouth is five feet wide
In glorious Technicolor Breathtaking Cinemascope
"Or Cinerama, VistaVision or"
Superscope or Todd-AO and Stereophonic sound
And Stereophonic sound
There was a time when dancing Was so intimate and sleek
A fella hugged his partner As they'd cuddle cheek to cheek
Now he doesn't even know If she's around
Because they're in glorious Technicolor Breathtaking Cinemascope and
Stereophonic sound
It's not enough today To see a dancer at his ease
He's got to throw his back out And come sliding on his knees
He's gotta have glorious Russian ballet Or modern ballet or English ballet or
Chinese ballet or Hindu ballet or Bali ballet or any ballet
And Stereophonic sound
And Stereophonic adds an extra tonic

"In 1955, the studio cleverly combined the new technologies with the old-fashioned backstage musical and starred Doris Day in the Oscar-winning hit Love Me or Leave Me."

Ah Mut Sha focuses and kicks Kong back
Kong blocks him with a straight punch
Ah Mut Sha ducks and hits him with a right hook
Kong delivers a right punch

Let's see if Kong can win unexpectedly
His stakes in the China towns of U.K  United States are one to five
A right punch
There will be 5 rounds in tonight's match
Each round will last for 2 minutes

Don't follow me!
Stop right there!
"Man, I'm dumb."
"I should have ran downhill. if you don't have the smarts, the body suffers."
"Dammit, look who it is?"
Dear hubby.
You bastard.
You put someone after me!
Where are you?
Tell me now!
I You're dead!
You crazy?
Tell you where I am?
You think I won't catch you?

We'll have it out there!
Are you in your right mind?
Making jokes?
I will not be scared?
Nothing is left with me.
I dont have watch or chain.
What will you do?
Bash me?

"Who are you, sir?"
He is Badris man.
Why are you giving me the money?
- Play.
"You please play, sir."
I dont know how to play?
You play.
We can settle terms later.
There is a bar nearby.
Come there after you finished the game.
When does it rain?
When black clouds appear.
When does the black clouds appear?
Just before the rain comes.
You idiot!
I can tell you when the petrol tanker will come.. ..but how could you expect me to know when it will rain.
"Not only me, nobody can tell you that."
I can tell.
- Tell what?
What is the program on TV at 7 p.m.?
A serial named Jeevanarogalu.
After that?
- We will get headache.
After that?
- News will come.
My legs. . .I cannot climb a mountain.
Can't my legs be cured?
"Ofcourse dear, your legs will get cured."
You have me.
Why do you think I drive the rickshaw?
I'll collect lots of money.
I'll get you treated by the best doctor in the world.
"You will walk, run, walk in step with the world."
Can't you see?
Are you blind?
Who did you call blind?
Me?
"You are blind, your father is blind. . . your whole family is blind."
Why are you looking there and talking?
I am here.
"Wherever you may be, for me, you are here."
I'll thrash you !
"I'm sorry sister, did I hurt you?"
"- That's a pole, not a lady."
"I know it is not a lady, it is a pole."
You mind your own business.
What's wrong with the municipality?
They put up poles everywhere.
It's quite a huge pole - Are you blind?
"I am not a pole, I am a woman."
Woman?
"I'm sorry sister, I made a mistake Forgive me."
I think he is mad too.
Someone help me cross the road.
- Who is this?
I am blind.
Help me cross the road.
Is it him?
I thought you guys split.
I sent him a message that I was in the hospital.
"You really like him, don't you?"
I don't know why I'm like this...
Wow this room is warm.
Wait.
I'm sorry about last time.
"Damn, look at your wounds."
"I told myself...that this is the last time so if you have something to say, please say it."
The last time?
Then why don't we do it for the last time before we go on our way?
Don't worry.
I can be careful so you won't get hurt.
Like this....
I went to an inn in the country and the woman next doorways screaming like crazy.
- I cracked the door to listen to her.
- Not interesting.
Not interesting?
Then I'll tell you another story.
Let's just do it once.
"A long time ago, I was going up the mountain..."
A woman...
Don't call me again.
"Fine, we don't have to see each other again."
Let's do it for the last time.
Come on!
Fine.
Do it.
Then do it.
Okay.
"A long time ago, I was going up this mountain..."
"""Pioneer's greetings to parents, mentors and elder friends!"""
"- Guys, come here!"

We're dead!
"- If Mitrofanova was back, then she saw everything!"
"- Enough moaning, let's go."
- Here will be parents and guests.
- Can they sit on the grass?
It's better in the shade.
- I'll think about it.
- Where do I put this?
- Not now.
- Crocodile.
- I can see that.
- Here we'll hold the games.
- Like sack racing?
- That's right.
From that spittoon to this lamp post.
You're in charge.
- How about we come up with something new?
"It's always the same: throwing balls, tossing rings, bobbing for apples..."
"Something new, you know."
I'm sure we can manage!
- I'll think about it.
- Where do I put this?
- Not now!
"- All right, so."
Here we throw the balls.
Here we toss the rings.
And here... we bob for apples.

I don't like any!
How boorish coming to a motel and talking about painters.
I went get drinks and even condoms.
You're angry.
I understand.
But you know what?
It'll be better to do it when we really want to do it.
I really want to do it
Then let's do it when we really really want to do it.
It wouldn't be hard doing it with you.
But the fantasy will be broken.
What fantasy?
Of a good friend!
A friend I can really talk to.
We talked for six months.
I don't think I've ever been happier.
Do you know what the worst kind of woman is?
Who acts like she's going to put out but doesn't.
Do you really want to do it?
Yes
"Then, do it with your mouth."
Maybe later.
When we want to do it.
Then.. do it with your hand.
Let's do it later.
I'll do it later for sure.
You can't even do it with your hand?
Oh my god.
Weren't you going to buy some mackerel?
No.
We have a lot of fish.
Have some.
What right do you have?
These trees are mine.
- Quiet.
"There's no need to get angry for just few branches, get that."
"""My tree, my groves."""
Even birds don't make their nests on these trees.
And by growing roses under the plum tree.. ..do you want to grow a new kind of plant?
You shouldn't be concerned with what I do with them.
This is my property.
And this bungalow that you've seized.. - What did you say?
That belongs to me as well.
Yes.
I will have you thrown out of this house.
I know Indira very well now.
I will get an emergency declared on you.
"That's going to be declared three months later, grandpa."
Grandpa?
Who are you?
"I have a wonderful idea to give them a fitting reply, father."
"Scoundrels, watch now."
Just watch.
What are you doing?
Now you'll know how my son is.
Oh.. no.
He and my dad.. so this is how he is.
You threw a balloon at my father.
"My delicate, innocent and.."
Stop praising me.
And give them a reply.
- Ok.
What was that?
Is that your fitting reply?
"- I will kill him! son.. son, go and inform the police immediately!"
"Don""t let the smugglers escape!"
"Don""t let Raman succeed in his plan."
You all risk your lives!
But.. but.. but the police..
Father! shekhar..
I will go and inform the police.
"You won""t be able to do this!"
Because you all know a lot! so as per our law.. you have no right to live!
You are right!
And you.. traitors have no right to live!
You all are not humans!
"You all are traitors! shut up! otherwise I won""t spare you!"
"Even God can""t stop a person from speaking the truth! shut up!"
No! scoundrels!
"Even if time and law spare you.. ..even if people forgive you.. but God will never spare you! kaka sir.. let""s kill all of them here only."
Why should we commit this sin?
"Why don""t we send all of them to Mr. shebiro""s boat? so that they all will drown."
"There can""t be any person more evil than you!"
Remember!
Your end too will be like this!
You too will drown. shut up!

Wow!
Nice deal!
I will make the remaining arrangement!
Now you all can leave!
Greetings!
- Greetings!
"Let""s leave! so shekhar has sent you both here?"
To hell with shekhar!
"Now he is not capable, kaka sir!"
He has started killing his men!
"His intentions have turned bad, kaka sir! so why should we help him?"
"Right! lt""s futile to give milk to the snake. - correct!"
Where is the gold?
"Gold is safe wherever it is, kaka sir!"
You help us and take your share!
Fine!
"But let""s form a plan."
You sail your ship s.s verona in the direction of.. ..West 20 East 32 and station it there.
We will reach there.
We have to deliver the goods at Lakhaidi island.
Good!
Good!
Done!
Done!
"This is betrayal! kaka sir, we might be smugglers!"
"But that doesn""t mean that we put our country at stake!"
We ruin our country!
"And sell our motherland! kaka sir, can we sell our motherland?"
They will even sell garden and air.
They will even sell garden and air.
lf they had their way they will sell God.
Come let us pray for our father soul.
You made him a permanent servant by calling him brother.
"Gun, How much?"
- One liter.
"Only single, why dont you take two liters."
I dont have money.
What is the need for money between us?
"Hey, prepare the bill for one liter."
If you give 2 liters I will prepare the bill for 2 liters.
Shall I give you two slaps?.
What we want is ladies.
Then fill the tank.
Anyway it is not your money.
If I fill the tank she will not come until next week.
If I fill 2 liters she will be back tomorrow morning.
What happened madam?
You are not coming so frequently.
Did you forget me?
I remembered you the day before yesterday.
What about yesterday?
I didnt go to zoo yesterday.
Personal.
"Hey venki, Venkat is here."
All of you come here.
Venkat arrived.
"Hey, move of the way."
Always blocking the way.
Why are you shouting at her?
This is a routine matter for us.
- First tell me why are you here?
What about your interview?
- Its gone.
"No, I don't."
I don't know.
What are you saying?
I...
I can't remember.
I drank and blacked out.
"That is why I told you to be careful, didn't I?"
There are always eyes everywhere.
Who the heck did something like this?
"President, who brought these photos?"
I will immediately just!
There is no need for that.
I already took care of it.
Indeed!
"Still, we can't be relieved."
We don't know when other photos will circulate.
That can't happen.
All my female fans will disappear.
These photos are completely embarrassing.
"So, go abroad for awhile and take a rest."
It is easier to take care of it when you aren't around.
What about the schedules?
"Do you know the saying, ""penny-wise and pound-foolish?"""
We can't incur a great loss by pursuing a small profit.
Go!
Go Dong will be waiting for you downstairs.
Hyungnim!
Over here!
What is this?
It's this car again?
The President said to be careful so that we aren't seen by others.
"Get in, Hyung."
How dare you stare at my brother?!
For this criminal?
Criminal?!
"Not he, you all are criminals... ...who are stopping him from being a good person."
You are forcing him to be evil.
Go and make him good as you want.
Go away... go... get lost.
You are dead for us. you are dead.
"Yes, go away with him."
No one will stop you.
"Yes, I'll go away."
Right now.
"Let's go, Kishna."
"No, Radha."
I'll not take you away in this way.
Mother!
"Mother, if I wanted to elope with Radha I'd have done that 2 years before."
But now I'll take her away with respect and self-esteem.
Self-esteem!
Cultured people are self-esteemed... ...not some dirty blood.
Because I recognize dirty blood as goons.
Father!
"I'm sorry, I respected you."
You are not even worth for this respect.
Because my parents were poor... ...but they were very rich by hearts.
They knew to respect their guest even if he's their enemy.
"Kishan, I beg of you."
"Please, go away."
Go away!
- I'm going.
But he has blamed my blood by accusing my parents.
I'll never step in this house again.
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.
Thomas will rip them to pieces.
"You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible."
You're gonna replace me on this case.
You've screwed it up beyond all repair.
But the archdiocese feels that replacing you now... ...would only draw more unnecessary attention to the trial.
"But just so we're clear, Bruner... ...if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you."
You've been crying.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?
He was killed.
There was an accident.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
"Without his testimony, it's over."
No.
"No, no, no, it isn't over."
We're telling Emily's story.
That's what matters.
- It can't be worth all this.
"- Yes, it is worth it."
Just let me go back on the stand and tell the rest of the story.
- I can't do that.
- You must!
You must.
"Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path."
Don't stray from that path.
"Here, take this."
- What is this?
- Just read it.
"That would work, as well."
Doctor?
How is Mustafa Bulut?
"He isn't very well, right now."
"But, it is still early."
- He will get better.
- How can he get better?
"Is the technology to make him well discovered in this world, yet?"
"For me, I think he has found the perfect place for himself!"
They should leave him alone.
"Really, it was because of you, Doctor!"
"Thanks, to you!"
"Really, thanks!"
You don't know what it is to live under those conditions.
We wanted him to go there for treatment.
"So, that he gets better and gets out."
We have no other agenda.
"Okay, my dear... drink this.."
Isn't it a hospital?
He is there to get well.
Your husband is going to get better and come home.
You can't carry on like this.
"But, Mom, what can I do?"
"How can I bear this, Mom?"
"Go to sleep, my daughter."
"Come, sleep."
Pray to God.. it will give you strength.
"Hey, Naciye... look for second.."
"Don't mess with me, Safiye..."
I will tear your hair out!
"You crazy idiot, aren't we from the same village?"
"I just called over to have you drink a soda, relax, tell me your trouble... come.."
OK you can stop.
Thank you.
OK for our next one we're going to dribble and we're going to switch hands every time we dribble the ball.
OK?
So you're going to dribble until I say stop.
"OK, try again."
"OK, that's good."
Thank you.
You're going to come around to the side and we're going to put our knees on the red pad.
You're going to keep your feet in the air like this.
OK?
And you're going to push up until I tell you to stop.
Try to keep your back nice and straight and we're going to push down and up.
Ready?
Begin.
OK keep that back nice and straight and try to bend your arms up and down.
There you go.
And stop.
OK.
For our last activity we're going to lay down on the carpet.
We're going to put our hands next to our side.
We're going to sit up and bring your hands up to your knees and back down.
Up and down.
OK?
So you're going to sit up until I tell you to stop.
Ready?
Begin.
Good and try to make sure you get your shoulders off the ground.
There you go.
And Stop.
OK Reagan that was our last activity.
Thank you so much for letting us work with you today!
My department also has the same opinion.
"You doubted him right, Damodar."
This is Jimmy's report.
I've brought it from intelligence department.
He's a smuggler.
He's connected with a smuggling gang from Singapore.
This is his file.
"The moment we get some evidence, we'll arrest him."
That's a lie.
Fine!
"I'm lying, Damodar is lying."
Even the ClD officers are lying.
Only my friend Shreekant is right.
But uncle.
How You better don't interrupt.
Just keep quiet.
If the son-in-law will be a smuggler... ...your house will be filled with smuggled goods.
We'll become a millionaire.
Our daughter will be happy.
Our family will get prestige.
- Mr. Bharat!
- Yes.
Did you understand?
My son-in-law can't be a criminal.
This marriage can't take place.
Never...
Jimmy!
A smuggler can never be my son-in-law.
"So, I'm canceling this marriage."
Had I not concerned about my prestige... ...I'd have punished you for this fraud.
Shreekant!
No!
Oh -- oh my G-d.
What does that even mean?
She's in stage four.
"Legally, they quarantine you at stage five."
"The doctor said she shouldn't be using public restrooms, eating with others, or in the proximity of the disabled."
(TWEET!)
They have it wrong.
Maybe she has partial brain damage?
A unique strain of Tourettes?
There is no way Mom is an Obnoxious Bitch.
"Wake up, Jenna!"
We have to face this now.
There's gotta be something they can do.
What are the options?
Can -- Can she get surgery?
The doctor said there's not a surgeon in the country that would take that risk.
The procedure would kill her?
"No, the surgeon would."
Doctors say she's the most Obnoxious Bitch they've ever seen.
Is she going to die?
Not soon enough.
Those two are my daughters right there.
The one on the right I almost aborted.
"The one on the left has got G-d-knows-what swimmin"" in there."
I -- I need to call Steve.
"Oh, no!"
You cannot call Steve.
Why?
It runs in families.
They say it skips a generation.
You could be carrying an Obnoxious Bitch right now.
Oh!
"Over here, continue there, continue there."
"So how many one, two, three, four, five."
Nine.
That's what it looks like.
So obvious. . No.
Okay.
"Now notice, what a pain this is."
Just so I can give you more headaches.
"By the way, you only have to build it once."
"We're going to have the code right here, right now."
So it's only you have to build it.
"It's just, we'll have the code right here, right now."
I ask you guys to put ones with an occasional zero down.
And then going to put zeros with an occasional ones down.
And then you're going to put some ones on the corners.
Okay.
"So, kinda problematic, cuz these guys and these guys are painful I got to figure out how to do that vector."
Okay.
"So, we'll do that."
But for right now let's do some easy things.
"Let's put down these ones, these ones, these ones, and these ones."
Notice where they go.
"This starts at n plus 1N,"
Right?
And this is a little N by N block.
"Or, in my notes, I think, that means it's a M by M block."
"It's N by N, these are M by Ns, M by Ms,"
Okay? you know what?
"If you say you said M I'd say no, you didn't hear me right."
You wouldn't know for sure if I said m or n.
They're so close.
I could lie.
"Kanji, people say you're doing this for publicity?"
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
- You?
- You will sit here.
"Sit, sit."
Hey insurance..
How's the Rolex?
Working fine.
Relax.
Relax.
He's the one who spread the rumour about God eating butter.
All rise.
"Kanji, get up."
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"- Yes, sir."
We've been informed that you'll defend your own case.
Yes..
"I don't have any other option, Your Honour."
The other lawyers are scared.
"So, I'll have to defend this case.."
"My lordship, this is a baseless appeal."
A publicity stunt.
There's no cause of action that can be proved in court.
"So I suggest, under order 7 rule no.11.. ..of the code of civil procedure."
This case be straightaway dismissed.. ..for out of cause action.
"Your Honour, my English isn't that good.. ..but I do understand that he's asking.. ..to shut down this case immediately."
Right?
You're right.
I don't want to get into this hassle in the first place.
"I'm a Gujarati, businessman."
Pictures come out incredibly well.
I want to use this for Jong Up's album cover.
This is the puppy from a little while ago.
The states sure do seem really good.
None
He's walking a dog bigger than himself.
Good.
The sunlight is definitely working it.
The sunlight is making me look 150% better.
"Right now, the sun is really high up."
I think I'll get to film when the sun's about to set.
I can tell you one thing.
My character's concept is to read a book while waiting for someone.
It doesn't really match my personality.
That's my concept for the shoot.
Let's go for it!
"Stand there, just stand there."
Stand!
Come this way a little bit.
That's not it.
I don't know how to use the camera.
This is just all picturesque.
I'm a celebrity but I don't like to get dressed up.
Usually...
I don't like wearing make-up I don't like putting on hairspray.
I don't like fancy clothing either...
I don't think I'm meant to be a celebrity.
None
I don't think dressing up is all that nice.
I'm not a foxy guy.
I'm more like a bear.
Nice.
Nah.
What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
"Okay, sure."
Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
Deal!
Look out below!
Sorry.
New trick.
Didn't quite work.
Idea!
"I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Outfit for the what now?
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
Oh!
And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.
"Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.
"Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business."
"Plus, fun!"
"Oh, I love fun things!"
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.
"So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original... ...amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies?"
And lickety split?
"Oh, Applejack."
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
"Thread by thread, stitching it together"
Twilight's dress Cutting out the pattern snip by snip
Making sure the fabric folds nicely
Bite its throat and suck up the blood.
"Suck up the blood, and you will be powerful."
"I heard that you've been wearing a veil, not letting anyone to see your face."
"If someone sees you, you'll either kill him or marry him;"
Is that true?
Yes.
Great.
"Now, remove the veil, and let me have a look."
"Hurry, if you don't,"
I'll strip you naked.
You're the first man who has seen my face.
"I could only marry you, since I won't kill you."
You're my husband.
So pretty.
"After I've killed him, and you can be a merry widow."
You saw that?
"If you dare to touch me, he'll kill you."
Who cares!
The Red Python is dead
Who killed it and sucked up all its blood?
I did.
Great.
The Red Python lives in the hills.
"It feeds on ginseng, and the deer antlers."
"After thousands of years, its colour has turned red."
"Whoever drinks its blood, exercises internally, and he will acquire ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
This is good news.
I know martial arts.
What are you laughing at?
"The ""Red Dragon Soul"" won't hurt me."
All I have to do is suck up your blood.
Then I'll be invincible.
I wasn't embarrassed.
Now that's when you're mad you're not a phony.
I still resent that.
I'm not a phony when I'm nervous.
Again!
I want to get mad at you!
I...I...you know what -- [mocking]
I...I...I...
I want you on my level so I can pick on you just as much as you're picking on me.
"Okay, pick on me."
I have to wait until you say something that I can pick on.
What does this mean?
Can you develop this movement?
It's a...I can't find words.
I want to...
Develop this.
But since you've been dancing...
I want to start all over again with you.
"Okay, let's start over."
I know a corner I'd like to put you in.
"I'd like to ask you a question and because I have a feeling you don't like me right off the bat, and I want to know if you do."
Can you not play [indiscernible]
What would he say?
"He'd say that she's a phony, for one."
"So, you are a phony."
"You're a phony, and you're a flip little girl, and you're a show off..."
What would [indiscernible] have said to that?
"I know what I'd answer,"
"I'd say, ""I think you are too."""
"Well then, tell this to me."
Tell me what a phony I am.
[laughing]
"But, you said some people choose to have sex this way some people choose not to have sex that way some people compromise."
"So, is it an orientation or is it a choice to be asexual?"
David:
How you feel internally is an orientation.
Star:
Okay.
David:
"What you do - so, an asexual person who does not feel desire to have sex. can choose to have sex if they're in a situation."
Star:
So that's more in your socializing?
David:
There is no desire.
Star:
Gotcha
Joy:
But how does that work?
[laughter]
Joy:
I can see for a woman.
"You know, she can just lie there."
"But you, you have to do something."
[laughter]
David:
There are gay guys who have sex with women before they realize they're gay.
It's the same.
Joy:
"Gay men who have sex with women, yes."
But they're fantasizing about a man.
Star:
You're right.
Chandra:
"And then you said that married couples and that, you know, they can make a choice to have sex"
"You can""t see all this!"
"You can""t see all this!"
- Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave!
Leave my mother!
Leave her!
Leave my sister!
Leave her!
"lf you raised chaos, I will shoot you!"
Leave me!
Leave me!
You save yourself and leave!
"lf you too died with me, then who will.. ..take revenge for this family?"
"I don""t want to live! shekhar, why don""t you understand?"
"Look, one bullet is still left."
You are under my oath!
You have to take our revenge!
You become Tiger!
Tiger!
A wounded tiger always takes his revenge!
Go and jump in the water!
Go!
Go!
"My sister killed herself to save the family""s honour."
And I jumped in the ocean!
A captain sailing a ship saved me!
"I finished my education with Rajesh""s help."
"I can hear my mother and sister""s screams all the time!"
While dying my sister had said.. ..to take revenge from these scoundrels!
"And that desire of revenge has made me Tiger! seema.. till the time I don""t take revenge from them.. ..l won""t rest in peace."
"I won""t rest in peace! crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook."

"So the first column is over two and down one, right?"
So there's the first column.
The first column.
Column one.
It's the vector two minus one.
The second column is --
minus one is the first component and up two.
It's here.
There's column two.
"So this, again, you see what its"
components are.
"Its components are minus one,"
two.
Good.
That's this guy.
Now I have to take a combination.
What combination shall I take?
"Why not the right combination, what"
the hell?
Okay.
So the combination I'm going
to take is the right one to produce zero three and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.
So the right combination is to take
x as one of those and two of these.
It's because we already know that
"that's the right x and y, so why not take the correct"
combination here and see it happen?
"Okay, so how do I picture this"
linear combination?
So I start with this vector that's
Shailu is mine.
Dont play with love.
You will be ruined.
I will kill you if you obstruct my daughters path.
I prayed to God that they should be united.
God granted my wish.
That is all I want.
He piers my heart with the spear of love
He is the real man
Look how handsome my life partner is
She resembles the dancing waterfall
His sharp eyes pierce my heart
She has a body like a flower filled with honey
I will arrest you in my embrace
I will guard you against all odds
"O beautiful swan, you gave me a sweet pain"
I have a lot of belief in you
I felt the heat of your love
I owe my entire life to you
What is it?
Nothing.
Where did son in law go?
Wait here.
I will search for him.
Venkat!
You scoundrel!
Why do you stab from behind like that?
"If you are a man who took a mothers milk, fight from the front."
Let us decide the winner.
"Hey, what do you think?"
Do you think that he was brought up on donkeys milk?
Do you think that he cannot fight you?
I have no idea.
Finch showers with his bathing suit on.
"I mean, uh--"
"As a matter of fact, it is true."
The guy's huge !
- Does he have a date for the prom yet ?
"- No, definitely not."
All right.
Thanks.
"Oh, man !"
"So I was thinking maybe you could give me some advice, brother to brother."
I thought you might know a trick or somethin' to make her--
- Orgasm ?
- Yeah.
- What's good here ?
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What ?
- How do you do that ?
"- Hey, never mind that."
"Listen, pay attention."
"Is that all that you're interested in, tryin' to get your girl into bed ?"
"No, it'd be good to be able to, you know, return the favor."
Be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
See that ?
That's good.
That's what I wanted to hear.
"Now, you qualify."
- Qualify for what ?
"- My man, you've just inherited the Bible."
"It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam."
And each year it got passed on to one East student who was worthy.
"Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff that guys have added over the years."
- Who is Münir?- Don't play dumb!
You did it just to keep me away from that trial.
- Gather yourself !- I wrecked my home for you!
- God damn you.
"- Stop it, you will wake everyone up!"
Get your hands off me!You sold out jerk!
Damn you!
"- Shut up or I will --- Go on, hit me!"
- Damned bootlicker of the rapists.- What?!
God damn you.
You killed meto save the lives of three rapists !
"Wait, wait..."
What?Who the hell am I saving?
Explain it to me.
"Hay Allah, ya...Those bastards tricked me."
Motherf*ers!
Are you any different than them?
How could you do this to me?
I swear on anything you want me to.
I didn't know about it.
I asked him many times.He said it was a land lawsuit.
He didn't tell me the truth.
That pimp!
I would spit on his faceif I knew the truth.
And would this take away the guilt from you?
Whether you knew the truth or not... ... makes you less guilty?
But the stupidity is on me.
"I let you trick me again,although I knew what you were."
Despite what you put me throughI fell for you again.
I apologize so much.
You shot me down really bad this time.
I don't remember feeling more humiliated in my life.
We gave people material for 5 years of gossip.
Does it hurt?
Slowly...
"Easy, easy..."
Slowly...
I can go on my own..
Okay.
I don't have a white horse but I saved you with my white car.
I am ready to help you whenever you want.- Thanks again!
"Use your mind, don't be stupid as me."
"It doesn't matter if he is handsome, tall..."
The important thing for one man is to have so much money that it would not end because of his stupidity.
This is my number.
Don't lose it please!
Let me know how you are.I will be worried...
"Okay, Thank you."
"Otherwise your life will pass decreasing, you look and you see that youth belongs to the past..."
Are you better sweetie?- I am very well.
I elicited to the girl.
"I told her she two faced hypocrite and so on... she took care of her friend all night, my flower."
She called me unbalanced...
"""Unbalanced"" ."
My sweetie.
"She is very beautiful ,even when she gets angry..."
Don't!
Open it!
Don't close it!
I'll lick the window and you will have to clean it again.
Don't do it man!
Eylül calling.
Yes.- I came to the building today but you took flights.
I got your phone number from the foreman.
Your blood must be coursing the opposite way!
This interest business really kills you!
Look at how much weight you've lost!
"Since the ship has not yet set sail, that Yi Nok must still be free."
Yes.
He is furious about his ship not setting sail.
"If there are complications, it will make things difficult for us too."
- Who is doing this?
- I think they're going underwater.
"If the river freezes, we cannot leave!"
Why can't we stop them?
They are attacking our guards.
This cannot be just the parents of the girls.
So who can it be...?
It couldn't be...?
It must be the parents who are preventing the Choi Chul Joo's ship from setting sail.
Someone must be helping them.
I heard that Choi Chul Joo is planning on seizing them tonight.
Will he kill the girls?
Can she not see me?
Or does she think I cannot see her?
She may be involved with the girls' parents.
"If I don't do anything, she may fall into danger."
Did you just drop my merchandise?
It's dented here!
Pay me for it!
How much is it?
"Don't, Young Master!"
Weren't you looking at it because you wanted to buy it?
"Well, not really..."
Then?
Were you trying to avoid me?
- And I gave all my money to the taxi.
- Why are you doing dangerous stuff like that?
You're seeking trouble.
They could have seen you.
I can't bear the longing for my child.What can I do?
"Okay, this pregnancy really made you nervy.You better do something about it quickly."
I will.
Don't worry.
"I can come with you, to the doctor if you want."
"- Okay.- This week, I'll be a bit busy with work though."
"We can go next Thursday, okay?I'll be busy till then."
Which day of month is next Thursday?
Let me see...It's 8th today.
16th it will be.
16th...
"Don't waste time, if you ask me.Let us go and take care of it next week."
"Neither before you, nor after you."
"Fatmagül, shall we dance?Let us dance."
How sweet of you.
#Oh the separation.
Stronger than even death.
#Time stops flowing.
"#Neither my loved ones, nor the sweet memories are enough anymore."
"Abla, shall we dance?In honor of Fatmagül's birthday."
# I'm caught up in your love.
# I stole from my own life.
"- Let us dance as well.- No, baby."
You know this is not my type of song.
"# Travelling around the seven worlds,"
# I have yet to find a remedy.
Tonight is doing good for all of us.
- It made Fatmagül so happy.- I wish her to be always happy.
What aunty?
You are praising me a lot?
The state is facing a drought.
People have stopped giving loans.
And they are unjustly asking me to repay their money too.
Since there was no one else I came back thinking that.. ..my mother in law is my only refuge.
Am I wrong?
You will always do this.
Do you know that you have a marriageable daughter?
First address that issue.
Ha!
Ha!
My daughter is a princess.
Some prince will definitely come for her.
He will give me half of his kingdom as dowry to marry her.
This is ancient tradition and is not wrong.
"My dear, I know that you made fish curry."
Serve it to me.
What happened?
"Boss, the girl is here, in Warangal."
"Hey, cant you see what is happening?"
Cant you wait?
You continue speaking.
Her father is a useless man.
Throughout the day he indulges in drink.. ..playing cards and spends all his time at the club.
There is no habit he doesnt have.
It will be very easy to manage him.
"Uncle, for the first time in my life"
I had the desire for marriage.
And that was after seeing her.
Handle this case carefully.
Give the money.
So you won't stray again.
What you have to understand is that the church and the state are the parents of the motherland.
That requires a sense of responsibility... and deserves respect.
You people don't respect anything so we have to take a hard line.
Nobody cares that you're here.
Your family and friends don't give a shit about you.
You won't get out of here alive.
I won't let you.
"And even if you did, I'd come find you."
I'd come find you.
You're cracking really fast.
This isn't happening!
You can't hurt me!
I can't hurt you?
No!
"What I just did, didn't that hurt?"
"Dad, please..."
It's me...
Malena.
I know you remember.
Please.
Don't hurt me anymore.
You know what?
Maybe you're right.
Remember the story of Abraham?
"No, you wouldn't."
"God told Abraham to kill his son, lsaac, and Abraham didn't hesitate for a second."
He looked at his son and saw an enemy he had to wipe out.
"He took him to the mountain top, drew a knife to cut his throat... and just when he was going to do it.."
God told him to stop.
"If I'm your father as you say, then God should tell me to stop."
Shall I tell you a secret?
This doesn't change anything.
What are you doing?
Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
"If he had more than a drop of tritium, he could have destroyed the city."
I'm ruined.
"I have nothing left, except Spider-Man."
"He saved your life, sir."
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity... ...and fused the vertebrae at multiple points... ...including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of the damage until we get in there.
"I suggest we cut off these mechanical arms, slice up the harness... ...and, if need be, consider a laminectomy... ...with posterior spinal fusion from C7-T1 to T1 2."
"We're ready, doctor."
Anybody here take shop class?
Help me!
Help me!
No!
"Is all over town, Robbie."
Gossip.
Rumors.
"Panic in the streets, if we're lucky."
Crazy scientist turns himself into some kind of a monster.
Four mechanical arms welded right onto his body.
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs.
What are the odds?
Hoffman!
Hoity-Toity?
He's coming here?
To see THESE dresses?
Yep!
Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
There he is!
Okay.
"Relax, Rarity."
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.
What's wrong with the lights?!
"Oh, yes."
That means the show's starting.
Good.
Since the beginning of time the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions... ...that that truly expressed the essence of their very souls.
"Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries! ...for the perfect pony gown."
"Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!"
Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own...
Rarity!
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Oh dear.
You think we overdid it?
Nah.
"Okay, maybe a little."
Those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!
"It's a travesty, it's what it is."
"Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame."
Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors?
Not to mention wasting my valuable time.
Hide me.
"Come on out and take a bow, Rarity."
You worked really hard for this.
Yes!
Where is my umbrella?
What do I know?
You forget things!
And you ask me where your umbrella is!
Here is your umbrella!
Take it!
But how did it come here?
"- By plane! shekhar.. why do you always get so angry? seema, I am not angry."
You just feel so.
I am not angry. come.
According to you shekhar had 4 suitcases.. ..when he disembarked from the boat?
- Yes!
But I saw only 2 suitcases in his house. shekhar had disappeared for sometime.
"When he returned, he got frightened when he saw me."
"I think the matter is serious. sir.. if you permit, shall we raid his place?"
"Now it""s too late!"
"We don""t have any evidence."
Listen..
"I want tight security around shekhar""s house."
And remember.. no officer should sleep on duty!
"Got it? sir, I won""t let anybody sleep! okay! - spread out! keep a close watch. stay awake."
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake. keep a close watch. stay awake."
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
There's this great building nearby that the city is just gonna demolish and turn into a parking lot.
- But if we get enough signatures... - Signatures?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
I was saying...
Maybe we could get the city to donate the building to our cause.
"We would be able to pry 250 new beds, get people off the streets and into job training so they could buy rocket packs and go to the Moon and become florists."
"You're not really interested in the homeless, are you?"
"No, I am."
But they're a symptom.
"You're treating a symptom and the disease rages on, consumes the human race."
The fish rots from the head as they say.
So my thinking is why not cut off the head.
Of the human race?
It's not a perfect metaphor but I'm talking about an overhaul of the system.
Putting the power in different hands.
I'm all for that!
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.
Thank you!
"Sorry, I come on strong."
But you signed!
I don't wanna turn my back on a fellow laundering person.
"Well, if we can't stick together, I don't..."
I'll probably see you there.
"No, I will."
I...
She talked to me.
Why did she talk to me now?
Maybe I should...
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
"Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would."
Sorry...
"But the work out seems to have had an effect, seeing how you managed to keep up so well."
"But, you knew?"
That we were following you?
It would be weird if I didn't know.
You're obvious.
I didn't have a choice.
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...
Without knowing...
"But if you happen to like Hae Ra,"
That is something...
I can do nothing about.
Do you want to go somewhere?
What?
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a dream... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Me being with Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With Seung Jo.
It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day.
I'm happy now
"But, it looks like only families are here."
We are the only ones who look like a couple.
Of course.
"There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months."
You didn't know?
What?
You didn't know?
It's well known.
"After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating."
You know what?
Let's just get out of here!
What to do?!
Wear it until your clothes dry.
"It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes."
I have received the reward that I deserved.
"Now I won""t live in this house even for a moment!"
"This is too bad, boss! she shouldn""t have come here."
"lt""s very dangerous. she saw everything with her own eyes."
"And now.. as per syndicate""s rule.. she has no right to live! kaka sir.. beware if you uttered a single word against seema."
"lf there is even a scratch on her body.. ..then I won""t spare you all!"
Pinto!
Quickly hide the goods!
"lnspector, what evidence do you have against me?"
"lf we had any evidence then you.. ..wouldn""t have been free like this."
Then why are you guys harassing me?
Tell me.
Why did you set your house ablaze?
I should be asking you this question.
"When you people were there, then who set my house ablaze?"
Thank God I was not at home at that time!
Fine!
But can you tell us what forced.. ..seema to leave her house at midnight?
"Mr. Diwan, this is my and seema""s personal matter."
"You don""t interfere."
"You don""t worry."
"I won""t let my wife be a burden on you. stop! stop! stop! stop!"
No!
"I don""t want to be a burden on anybody!"
"What burden, dear?"
We are poor.
"But we have a big heart. only a human come to a human""s aid."
"lt""s a sin to commit suicide. come, dear. come."
Mr. Rajesh.
"You couldn""t seize the gold."
And that gold is going to be smuggled tonight.. ..in the form of silver from Alibagh beach.
"But why don""t you reveal yourself?"
I accept this beautiful death.
"Don""t say that, Mr. Rajesh."
You still have to achieve a lot.
A police officer has to play with life and death.
All that is fine.
First finish your dinner.
"lt""s enough!"
"I have to do some work too. shall we, Mr. Diwan? of course."
"Let""s go!"
David!
"- Yes, sir. okay, sir."
Mr. Rajesh.. this is the area.. where smuggling takes place.
Police and custom have raided this place many times.
But no clue was found. one thing is definite.
The smugglers dwell here only.
Yes.
"I entirely agree with you, Mr. Diwan."
These people have ruined the economy of the country.
They smuggle gold.. and shake.. ..the foundation of the government.
But who are these people?
They belong to this country only.
"They dance on other""s tunes."
"And they are leading to our country""s downfall."
This is some big international gang. such people should be shot!
They are not lndians!
They are traitors!
They have no nationality and no community!
Why are you worried?
"As we sow, so shall we reap."
"You don""t know, mother. lt""s about our country""s honour."
lf I had my way I would force all lndian mothers.. ..to first explain national character to their children!
To teach him to lay down their lives for their country!
Let me try to take this one step further.
(Laughter)
I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
You can all take your time on this;
"I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right."
"To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,"
"let's say, one, two, three, four."
"If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square."
Nine.
Seven.
Five.
Eight.

(Applause)
(Applause ends)
"Now, I would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately, most calculators cannot."
(Laughter)
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?
"So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that?"
Does yours go higher?
Volunteer:
I don't know.
AB:
"Oh, yours does?"
Volunteer:
I can probably do it.
Pinto!
"- Yes, boss!"
The goods should be cleared from underwater tunnel.
Underwater tunnel ready!
- Go ahead!
Beware!
Hands up!
"Boss, our link with Jamal Pasha""s boat.. ..has got disconnected."
"And boss, we have received the red signal too."
Red signal?
What about the goods?
God!
I knew it!
That I will be ruined!
"Tiger singh.. what was the need.. ..to bring such a big consignment? shut up! congratulations, boss!"
The consignment is here!
Quickly open this! otherwise he will get a heart attack. very good! very good! very good! open it!
"That""s better!"
Tiger singh.. only gold! kaka sir!
Real gold!
I knew it!
"Tiger singh.. as long as you are there.. ..no harm can befall on these gold. seema has come. so this is your business, shekhar!"
How dare you! - seeing your illegal activities!
This is my business!
"lf this is your business, then shame on this business! shame on this luxurious life! seema, you have made a mistake by coming here!"
"Now don""t cross your limits!"
"When you have crossed your limits of humanity.. ..then why do I have to stay in my limits? shekhar, I could have never imagined that you will be like this!"
Now I know your true form.
Now I know why strange people come to meet you.
Because you do smuggling! - seema!
lf you had to be a traitor.. it would.. ..have been better if you had died!
Thanks a lot for this favour!
"""He was stupid."""
"""He was cruel and ruined others."""
"""Kill him cruelly."""
"""What a terrible blunder."""
"""Marriage turned into a nightmare."""
"""What a terrible blunder."""
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I know!
"- Mom, dad!"
I would've never married you if mother hadn't pressurised me.
You've always been the biggest geek in the world.
"You don't have any style of speaking, no personality and.. ..your outfits.. - Don't say anything about the outfits, Mala."
You dare not say anything about them.
No one washes clothes like I do in entire Lokhandwala.
I am talking about wearing and not cleaning.
"And that's what will say even after I die, isn't it?"
That buy a plain cloth to cover her body.
"Oh no, I know you will stand up, throw a tantrum."
"""Couldn't you get Kanjivaram?"""
"Exactly, you didn't give me anything during my lifetime."
I will definitely ask for something after I die.
I didn't give you anything as long as you were alive?
What did you give me?
Did you even buy me a dog?
All our neighbours have dogs.
But we don't.
- I am there.
"Then why do you need a dog to secure the house, madam?"
At least the dog will keep me company.
It will go along with me.
equation.
Do you know what that bunch of points will be?
It's a plane.
"If we have a linear equation, then,"
"fortunately, the graph of the thing, the plot of all the points that"
solve it are a plane.
These three points determine a
"plane, but your lecturer is not Rembrandt and the art is going to be"
the weak point here.
"So I'm just going to draw a plane,"
right?
There's a plane somewhere.
That's my plane.
That plane is all the points that solves this guy.
"Then, what about this one?"
Two x minus y plus zero z.
So z actually can be anything.
"Again, it's going to be another"
plane.
Each row in a three by three problem
gives us a plane in three dimensions.
So this one is going to be some
other plane -- maybe I'll try to draw it like this.
And those two planes meet in a line.
"So if I have two equations,"
"just the first two equations in three dimensions,"
those give me a line.
The line where those two planes
meet.
"And now, the third guy is a third plane."
And it goes somewhere.
"Okay, those three things meet in a point."
"You could have dropped me by the subway, you didn't listen to me and got stuck in this traffic down the drain."
"Oh , don't prolong it.-You 'il miss your lesson."
I still have time.
I will take you to your neighborhood... and I will also see the place where you lived.
There is nothing to see...
"I mean, you can't look at things there as you look to an aquarium. .."
what sort of a man are you?
You take out your spines right away..
Do I want to look at your life as one looks an aquarium?
Is that the way you see me?
No... of course not..
Last night I told you my secrets.
"I put my head on your shoulder, I trusted your sincerity."
"Should I think "" I wonder if..."""
Okay i am sorry... - But you are are doing it always. .
"Whenever I want to come close to you, you push me away.."
Last night it happened the same way...
"Why do you hide yourself so much, I don't understand."
I mean what are you afraid of?
You put on your armor right away!
Why are you afraid?
What harm can I do to you?
Get out of the car then!
"Get out, if you don't want my friendship, don't look at my face from now on."
What's all this now?
"Ok, come on, let's go, I will show you every place, but you won't insist saying:"
"""I will see your home"""
Why can't I see your home?
Because I want to forget the way to it too!
Don't you miss your mom?
I will get out! &amp;gt; Okay!
There left..
Gossip magazine:
Mister ASK left a broken heart behind him again.
Go straight on from here!
"We came until here but you didn't see anyone, if you want to meet any friend or something like that, I can wait or I can go..."
No thanks!
-Don't you have a friend or you don't want to meet with anyone?
I don't have friends.
To the left!
The guy from the meatballs place?
He is my brother's friend.
"Come on, jump out here!- Papa, at least you could drop me by the shop.."
Tell the master I will be back late from the test.
"I understood, you're going away again!"
"Man, get out, I am in a hurry.- Come on, go on, quick, quick.!"
Why did that boy upset you today?
He talked a bit rudely.
I don't like him that much.
Did he say something bad?&amp;gt; No.
Do you do it intentionally?&amp;gt; What?
"You say a thing, then you keep mum for a while.As if I make you talk by force."
You tell everything half...
It's because I have nothing to tell.
You saw my life... there is nothing else good except the meatballs.
You're doing an injustice.
"Err... you're not late for your lesson, are you?"
I still have time.
We fell again here...
"It's okay, no problem..."
Do you have lessons every weekday-Two days in a week.
There was a school you mentioned the other day... did you get an answer from it?
No Word from there.
But even if they don't accept me I won't be so surprised.
"Okay, I'll sort of start it the"
"same way, say maybe 2x-y and maybe I'll take"
no zs as a zero and maybe a -x+2y and maybe a -z as a --
"oh, let me make that a minus one and, just for variety let me take,"
"-3z, -3ys, I should keep the ys in that line, and 4zs is, say, 4."
Okay.
That's three equations.
"I'm in three dimensions, x, y,"
z.
"And, I don't have a solution yet."
So I want to understand the
equations and then solve them.
Okay.
So how do I you understand
them?
The row picture one way.
The column picture is another very
important way.
"Just let's remember the matrix form,"
"here, because that's easy."
The matrix form -- what's our matrix A?
"Our matrix A is this right-hand side, the two and the minus one and"
"the zero from the first row, the minus one and the two and the"
"minus one from the second row, the zero, the minus three and the"
four from the third row.
So it's a three by three matrix.
"Three equations, three unknowns."
And what's our right-hand side?
"Of course, it's the vector, zero minus one, four."
Okay.
"So that's the way, well, that's the short-hand to write"
out the three equations.
"- I went to meet him, he didn't show."
"I called his office, I called his house."
Okay.
"Go to the hospital, ask around."
Somebody's gotta know where he is.
What the hell happened?
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.
Tell him I know the demons are real and I admire his courage... ...for standing and speaking against them.
Tell him I know what they can do.
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.
Are you drunk?
"- Not yet, but I'm working on it."
- Have you seen this?
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...
You told me you'd talk him out of testifying.
"Instead, you put on a freak show with taped demons... ...and a dead girl speaking in tongues... ...and your client testifies that the archbishop sanctioned the exorcism."
We'll be lucky if the archdiocese isn't named...
I had a doctor who was gonna corroborate.
"Besides that, Father Moore's testimony's crucial to his defense."
Did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
The archdiocese isn't on trial.
I swore an oath to do what's best for my client.
"Spare me the law school pieties, Bruner."
You cashed in your conscience at the door.
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?
It's not over.
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand... ...to corroborate Father Moore about the exorcism.
And there are the girls.
"Her sister Alice, she saw part of it."
"Keep in mind how many times he threw up and then, tell the doctor."
Hold on.
Then call the ambulance.
"This is 119, right? after that.."
Bring him to Parang University Hospital.
He's an elementary school student.
I'll get there as soon as possible.
Oh Ha Ni..
Take care of Eun Jo.
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.
An intussusception?
"It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope."
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.
Surgery?
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.
But....
What to do?
"It's not a serious surgery. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo."
I understand.
Begin the surgery.
You came?
Yes.
Eun Jo is having surgery.
I heard about it.
How did it go?
It was as I had thought.
His intestine was folded into itself.
Did the surgery end?
"Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry."
"A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,"
And returned it to normal.
What okay?
"It's not , far from it."
What's all this hurry to achieve your interests from every opportunity?
What does that mean madam?
We didn't do anything yet.- Sequestration officers are here.
How do you know?&amp;gt; I know.
What's happening Selim?
Can something like this happen?
You brought the officers to our door without notifying us.
"Just a minute, I am the representative of the claimant, Mr. Umit didn't demand me for something like this."
"The claimer is Safet Orhun, not Mr. Umit."
"Mert, you go, I will come after."
Can I take a look to the documents?
:
"I am saying there is a mistake in this issue, why don't you listen?"
Is there any news from your brother?
"Don't worry,"
This issue will be solved today.
It's not my trouble.
If there is no money there won't be a sick certificate either.
Then you will be moved to prison way.
OK...
I said I would find it.
It will come today.
We will see.
Did he enter inside?-Yes he did.
Why did you choose this school?
Because I want to have a good education.
"Can you define ""Good"" to us?"
"How, in the lexical meaning? &amp;gt; No, no..."
"What do you mean when you say ""Good education"", I am curious about that."
Good.... promising in every way.
That's what linear dependency means.
That one of them can be represented as a scalar multiple of the other.
"Well if this is true, then I can just substitute this back in for vi."
And what do I get?
I get c times vj-- which is just another way of writing vi because I assumed linear dependence.
That dot vj has got to be equal to 0.
This guy was vi.
This is vj.
They are orthogonal to each other.
But this right here is just equal to c times vj dot vj which is just equal to c times the length of vj squared.
And that has to equal 0.
They are orthogonal so that has to equal 0.
Which implies that the length of vj has to be equal to 0.
"If we assume that this is some non-zero multiple, and this has to be some non-zero multiple-- I should have written it there-- c does not equal 0."
Why does this have to be a non-zero multiple?
Because these were both non-zero vectors.
This is a non-zero vector.
So this guy can't be 0.
This guy has length 1.
"So if this is a non-zero vector, there's no way that I can just put a 0 here."
Because if I put a 0 then I would get a 0 vector.
So c can't be 0.
"So if c isn't 0, then this guy right here has to be 0."
And so we get that the length of vj is 0.
Which we know is false.
The length of vj is 1.
This is an orthonormal set.
The length of all of the members of B are 1.
So we reach a contradiction.
This is our contradiction.
Vj is not the 0 vector.
It has length 1.
Would you like something to drink?
No thanks.
And the reason you wanted to see me...?
We found something while investigating this accident.
I thought I'd better show you.
And these were found in Mr. Lee Jin-woo's clothes.
Soo-jeong.
Me too.
I love you too.
Sad Movie
They say that I'm an optical illusion.
They say that I'm just a social construct.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
The same people who say that it's fine for black and brown people to organize themselves for their own benefit say it's evil if my people do the same.
Why?
Who makes these unfair rules?
Asia is Asian.
Africa is African.
Where are the white countries?
They say that white countries don't exist.
They tell me to be loyal to humans but they all step on me.
People are saving endangered species like the whales and the spotted owl
What about my sub-species?
Would you call me a Nazi if want a happy future for people like myself?
Does Israel need diversity?
Whites are 8 percent of the world population and decreasing.
If they are against racism why don't they fight for me?
Why don't they fight for me?
What about a future for me?
What about a future for me?
What about a future for me?
I have 1kg of sugar?
I'm going to use 100g of vanilla.
The ideal is using refined sugar or caster sugar.
Moustache:
"And what about the ""brownd"" sugar, can't it?"
"You can, actually you can use any sugar."
But we use more...
"The brown sugar has more flavour, right?"
So it'll mask the vanilla's flavour.
It's easier a sugar that doesn't have much flavour.
"It's better with the refined or with the caster sugar, because they are more thin."
"The caster sugar isn't the Icing sugar ok, guys?"
The Icing sugar has starch.
"It's not this, ok?"
"So, or the caster sugar or the refined sugar."
"But I don't have any of them here, so I'm using granulated sugar."
"I've never seen, really, anywhere, this unique support for cancer research."
"And so I want to thank you for your participation, your collaboration and most of all, for your confidence in our ideas."
(Applause)
Lookie here.
Now I'm f&amp;amp; excited if I've left something more than just ... the usual rations.
See if there is anything else that could be eaten.
Just think if I left some candy.
That would be great.
IS THERE ANY CANDY HERE?
"I don't think there is any, but one can always hope."
"Matches, even more Vaseline I don't really have use for."
Zinc ointment.
"Very much in here, apparently good."
YEAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAA -
You don't even see -
"After suppertime would hit, Jule would put out a set of sawhorses up by the church and up by the museum and the road gets in the winter - packed down."
We'd slide down hill until 10 o'clock at night.
"Kids don't even know what a sleigh looks like, you know."
Sliding down like where the...
"Actually, there was a tennis court where the church is."
But you'd be sliding down like where the rectory is and where the medical center.
"Hell, you're kids, and that was a big hill then."
And we'd go up to where the tower is.
But that's when you're older.
Go down there in a homemade toboggan and kill yourself.
What was Old Patrick Bonner like?
"Nice, pleasant fellow."
A little brogue.
He had one eye.
Accent and everything.
A lot of the guys did.
I don't know what's going on over there.
The seagulls are swarming all over.
Must be some [?] coming in or something.
"But, yeah, he was nice."
"Regular, pleasant guy."
Had the farm up there.
Otherwise...
Was he the only fiddler at that time?
Yeah.
Guy ...
King Strang might have done a little fiddling.
I can't think of...
He pretty much - and Jule played the guitar and he played the steel to the ... he played that really good...
"And Walter McCauley, he was just out of school."
Maybe sailing a little bit.
"The kind of artists . ,, ."
I said I know they're on here somewhere cuz I watched a really good one.
"Cuz I, I only got to it through the newsletter that's why, I, I saw I clicked and went to that, you know greatest artists or something like that."
But then that's why I'm actually going to find him.
"Like what do, what do they have that under?"
"The documentary to me is uh, is kind of more like the."
Plus something for me to learn how to do a documentary.
"Uh, right."
Yeah.
"Which is, it actually being an inspiration story."
"Huh, that makes sense."
"Right, of artists."
And a featured artist or something like that would be a great place for a start.
Okay.
This is so helpful.
"You know, sometimes we just get so insular in how we loko at information that it's so helpful to hear how other people."
Consume.
Right.
"Well like I said if I meet with engineering teams, and we always get to see it then."
"It's a terrible job on your, on your back."
"Um, people like to go hiking and stuff and there's , too."
"Oh. ,, , so even we, we don't a very good job on stuff. ."
Yeah.
"We all do the best we can, and then we re-evaluate and start again."
Right.
"Yeah, but you had some good stuff too.'Cause my Dad said I'm, I'm creative on the outside ."
"I do children's illustrations, and things like that."
"So you have, like, some children's book illustrator."
Mm hm.
Programs.
The illustrating stuff is good.
I don't think .
I beg at you.
But... - Otherwise...
"Otherwise, I'll become widow before marriage."
"Don't say that, Radha."
We're with you.
I'll speak truth and none other than the truth.
Inspector Damodar... ...don't you think you should have come in your uniform... ...for giving your statement?
"Your Honour, actually we become little tough in uniform."
While giving our statement we forget the human emotions.
I'd just repeat few lines of this Geeta.
It says... if a sinner confesses his sin... ...and is ready to go through it's punishment... ...he is no more considered a sinner.
"Your Honour, we, the police officers tried our best to arrest Jackie."
And finally what did we get?
Nothing.
Total flop.
Order... order...
"Your Honour, isn't this evidence enough... ...that Jackie has surrendered."
Your Honour.
He was a criminal.
But now he is not.
There's a lot of difference between both the tenses.
We must forget the past.
And think about his present and future.
"If he wants to mend his ways, I'd request the court... ...that the law should show mercy upon him."
"So that he can be a good man, a good citizen... ...why..."
"Your Honour, I think I've said too much."
"Sorry, I became little emotional."
"But whatever I said had some weight, right?"
Yes.
Under the IPC section 362. court orders... ...2 years imprisonment to Jackie alias Jaikishan.
Jackie!
Jackie!
"They are a little cold but, I thought it will serve."
"Oh, thank you..."
"Okay then, tomorrow in your last exam,no?"
"I have the interview and exam too, they come in package."
"Interviews are very important, you know."
You have to show them you have sufficiently capacity to study in that school.
"I would say something for their capacities but...anyways..,"
From tomorrow you will be a university student.
With God's willing!
What?- I will say something... but don't get angry right away.. don't say:
"""Don't interfere"", okay?"
"Call your mom too, talk to her."
Tell her that your exam is tomorrow.
Let her be happy too.
"Okay, i'll call her."
Of course I won't call her.
"Mira we'll talk properly about this in a suitable time but let's not talk about it at the last night before my exam,OK?"
Good!
I am sorry.
Good luck !&amp;gt; Thank you.
Success!
I will ask something...You will be angry with me too...
Ask..
"Last night, why did that blighter make you cry?- Are you spying on us?"
He alarmed the whole street with the voice of his burned plastic.( applying breaks on tires)
Do... you really love that man?
Good night.
Kenan calling...
What's up Dwarf ? &amp;gt; Brother!
- It means you remembered you have a brother.
"Brother, where are you calling from?"
"Don't make a show man, as if you don't know I am at the hospital."
"Go bring the instruments now, hurry."
"Yes, sir."
Is he not being able to breath?
"Don't just look, please try something."
This is a lethal location.
"Your Majesty, please let us know of your successor."
Please make your decision.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty ...
The king has passed.
The king has passed.
The king has passed.
You've done well.
You've been most helpful.
"But the queen and the young prince survive, as well as the queen's father who has many follower and is from a warrior clan..."
Don't you think I can take care of a woman and a child?
"With her father and left minister (war minister) gone, she won't have a chance."
"Your Highness, we need to do something before the Queen Mother does something."
The Queen Mother has the right to choose the successor.
Do you think they're that easy to persuade?
"Your Highness, if we retreat from here you and the young prince's life could be in danger."
"Also, this is the chef's record."
There were no records for the day His Majesty became ill.
You mean ..?
That's right.
Even the person who writes the record is missing as well.
There hasn't been enough time for them to take the recorder  out of the palace.
"That means, she is hidden somewhere inside of palace."
Inside of palace?
"Yes, Your Highness."
I can't see another explanation.
Luminus Devastatus is a spell that priests unlock at the level 100.
"Yes but with the update version, it can set up a new deal."
"No, no, no, I have checked twice."
"No, wait, it's better to :"
Bandaid !
"Come here my boy, come !"
"What's going on dudes, are we going to do a new quest ?"
"No, no ,no."
We just want to know where did you got that beautiful staff.
The staff ?
"But I already told you, on Dardane."
"No, that cannot be Bandaid."
Dardane doesn't loot this kind of item.
"Yes he does, and it's Golgotha who killed him right in front of me."
"And when she left, she said she didn't need this kind of item, so I took it for myself."
"- Yeah, me, I think he is lying."
- Why would he lie ?
"I don't know, perhaps he bought the staff from Ash the chinese farmer."
And he doesn't dare to say it.
I am not Chinese !
You really think behind his blank stare there's enough grey cells to bamboozle us ?
Yes. good point.
"However, nothing can explain how the worse priest from Horizon 1.0 is able to cast level 100 spells."
"And me, I think you're jealous Omega Zell."
"What !? m-me jea, but he's insane, never ever, it's you who is jealous !"
- Why do you say that Bandaid ?
"- Yes, why do you say that ?"
"Well, because I reached level 100 before you !"
And even Tenshirock the hacker has said that I was super whacking of the dead.
He also said that I was the Chosen one !
"Wait, when did you see Tenshirock the hacker ?"
I can't believe what an awkward position I've put you in.
"But believe me, I never planned for this to happen"
"I know, I made your schedule."
This was not on it.
"Stacey, I've been looking high and low### for you"
"Well, maybe you should try getting out of the chair"
That'll increase your odds
"Stacey, I need you to testify for me at the people's court."
"Listen, I can't possibly take off walk."
I'm sorry.
It's a definite no
"Alright, I'll go on### TV myself, fine."
National TV?
Millions of cute guys watching?
"Alright, I'll do it"
"Here, I want you to look at these books."
I highlighted some of the cases that are similar to mine
And I've made some notes on some questions that they are likely to ask.
You know what to do.
"Call up the law library, see if they can dig up some legal precedence that we can cite"
"I'm on it, Paulie."
"Hey, Ma."
I'll be on TV.
I don't know.
Some stupid thing
"We just got together to talk like old friends, and the next thing you know, we wind up in my hotel room"
"If this conversation goes any further, I might be forced to go on a tri-state killing spree."
I don't blame you.
You're embarrassed.
"Nah, look, it's all right."
"I mean, growing up together, we had embarrassing moments all the time."
We did not.
"Just basically, you know, so how do they make their marriage work?"
You're just trying to take the concentration off of the sex end.
You're like where is the relationship?
"Where is our, where is the rest of our intimacy?"
David:
Yeah.
The point is love and sex are different things.
Chandra:
Correct.
David:
"And for a lot of people, they are very lined up and when they think about their relationships, sex is kind of really at the center of where it is."
"But if you set up a relationship and from the get go,"
"I mean, everyone has really close friendships, right?"
Star:
Yes.
David:
"Which are different, but you can form a really close relationship where sex isn't at the center of it."
"And so it's...it's abstract, but it's thinking about how do you form a relationship that's closer, that's more committed than, you know, can be the basis for a family?"
Joy:
But what about kissing and cuddling with a girl and having a little of that stuff?
David:
"Oh, I personally like that."
Joy:
"Oh, you do like that?"
"So, what if the girl gets aroused?"
What are you going to do?
[laughter]
David:
"I mean, she's going to know from the get go."
Joy:
She might change her mind once you embrace her.
[laughter]
What's a joke now?
"No, I'm afraid you're going to notice everything I do."
Gee!
I don't --
Do you want me to?
"I want you to help me become more relaxed, yes, but I don't want to be so defensive with you."
I don't like to feel so defensive.
"Uh...you're acting like -- you're treating me as if I'm stronger than I am, and I want you to... protect me more, and be nicer to me."
Are you aware of your smile?
You don't believe a word you're saying.
[laughs]
"I do too, and I know you're going to pick on me for it!"
"Sure, you're bluffing, a phony."
Do you believe -- you mean that seriously?
"Yeah, if you say you're afraid and you laugh and you giggle and you squirm...that's phony."
You put on a performance for me.
"Oh, I...I resent that very much."
Can you express this?
"Yes, sir."
I most certainly am not being phony.
I will admit this.
"It's hard for me to show my embarrassment, and I hate to be embarrassed, but, boy, I resent you calling me a phony."
Just because I smile when I'm embarrassed or
"I'm put in the corner, does not mean I'm being a phony."
Wonderful.
Thank you.
You did this work for the last minute.
"Well, I'm really mad at you."
That's right.
You didn't have to cover up your anger with your smile.
"Now in that moment, in that minute, you had not a not a [indiscernible]"
"Well, at that minute I was mad at you though,"
Motherfucker.
"Oh, hey."
"Just the same 12-year-old little boy-man-girl, except I'm not wearing a sports bra."
[MlMING HEAD EXPLODlNG]
You see?
"And a lot of people on the Internet can rant and rave about how much this guy's a fucking idiot, but I think you really need to go back in your mind, mostly guys, and think about all of the girls that you thought were really manly and gross and, like, athletic-looking, because they had their tits squished down."
Probably a little bit more than you'd like to admit.
Sun just went behind the clouds.
"So while you're watching the rest of the Olympics, and the rest of life, if you see a girl with some flat titties while she's working out or competing for a gold medal, it's not her titties."
It's her fucking bra!
"Sorry that you don't understand sports bras, because us girls have since the day we started growing fucking boobs."
"Right, Marbles?"
Where are your boobs?
In your shirt.
"Kermit, look at your ears, buddy."
You look like Princess Leia.
Yes you do.
Ohh!
"All right, make sure you subscribe to our channel."
We put out new videos every Wednesday!
And we hide our boobs sometimes when we work out so that they don't hit us in the face!
"Right, Kermit?"
"Yeah, you love boobs."
We'll see you next week.
Bye!
[DEEP VOlCE]
Bye —
[NORMAL VOlCE]
"Oh, there's the sun."
Fucking thanks for showing up.
Asshole.
Thank you all for coming tonight.
"Just close your ears (don't listen), no other way."
What are they saying?- I didn't see any of them since the evening.
How am i to look in their faces?!..
"Don't be like this Mira, please!"
"It's all because of uncle Umit's stupidity,"
He did a very shameful thing.
"Whatever it is, was there the place to settle accounts."
Can one attack like savage in that way.
That was definitely barbaric...Inhuman...
"No one cares about what he did, dear Eylul."
Every body will talk about my father.
About our disgrace..- What disgrace ?
"This is business life, one can sing and get out..."
"Uncle Faruk was a good person when he earned money for them, when he lost it he became a bad one?"
Empty words!
Mom..
"Where?- To fix our reputation (honor), which is licking the dust."
Any news from dad?
"No, his phones are switched off."
I will have to find a solution on my own.
Good morning. &amp;gt; Good morning.
"Wow, my dad did the omelet, I knew it from the smell."
"Sit down, it will get cold.."
What is it? &amp;gt; Nothing.
There is something...
"Everybody is tensed because of what happened last night Mert, don't force it if you want."
If I get anything I will be Darth Vader
"Yaman, you have to take care of the official documents for the school.."
Birth and citizenship certificate and so on.
"Don't neglect it, Friday is the last day."
"Ok, I will prepare them someday."
"-This is important, get it done today!"
"I, I think, I like how, that you guys are ."
"The teacher organizes nice, and bookmarks things and stuff."
"I think that's a great idea, so I can always go back to."
"It is, and also I, I haven't had a smart phone for very long."
Um-hm.
And I was surprised.
I went on there and that was really good.
"And it actually had the, uh."
"And then actually be able to watch it um, ."
Oh cool.
Yeah.
At first it had a mobile version on it.
Yep.
Beta something.
I. Yep.
So the first time I had ever looked at it and actually that worked really nicely so the mobile when .
And we have to.
"That's the way the world is going. ,, ."
"I wanna let, I mean I haven't installed, I haven't used it very frequently for that kind of purpose."
I still have my old .
"I, I'm like, wow."
"We always having to do that stiff, stuff as well, and uh you guys did that pretty nicely, the way it sits on it, ?"
"Are you, as you're looking at the USGS."
"Uh, we."
Redo.
Mm hm.
Are you talking about responsive design and the need for mobile compatibilit y?
That's come up.
I know that the directive of the White House wants the government to start making mobile devices stuff and there is a plan in place.
"It's a matter of how you take all that content because there is a lot of it, there is a large bit of it."
"It's really, it's very hard to design for it because they do every science in the world, right?"
Every type of science?
"I was hanging out with my sister the other day and I was, I was sitting in this chair, and my sister told me to stop fidgeting."
"To which I was like, A, rude, and B, I'm not fidgeting."
"I just, I really like sitting in different ways."
And I do.
"You know, if you know something about me, you know that."
So I thought I'd just quickly show you guys my favorite ways to sit on a chair.
"So to do this, I just need like, I need a chair, this one, this will do."
"I'll use this one, this will be fine."
"Basically, I mean, we can start with just a simple, a classic cheeks on the seat maneuver."
I really like to center myself.
"So I'm like, in position to sit down."
"Then I just, then I go from right here just to plopping down."
"And it, you know, like, it takes a little settling in on the sit bones to like, really find the comfort spot."
Some people find it right away.
"I have to search for it a little bit, and then you're"
"like, this is it."
And then that's it.
And you stay there.
Second move is just a little-- you guys know it.
It's the leg cross.
Knee over knee.
"I like to sit, I like to cross to the left."
"It's nice way to get, like a bit of a stretch in the glutes, as well as generally air out the situation."
There's nothing worse than a sweaty sit butt during a long meeting.
That's the worst.
"So I just, those are two."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Hi, Beth."
BETH HOYT:
Julie.
"Julie Klauser, everybody."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, to the - We searched all the islands."
"We spent that first day just flying around the island, looking."
"So, we're coming in to land."
"Of course, it was slushy"
He touches the brakes - his right brake is froze up.
No brake.
"So, he's doing this with the 180."
You can see he's going to - didn't want to do something.
"So he said, ""Okay, hang on Brian."""
We're getting from here to the water or whatever it is.
"And he hit the rudder the other way, goosed it and shut the one brake flipped it around and goosed it."
We literally backed up to stop like that.
That was some pretty cool flying.
But I used to fly all the time with Joe.
We'd run over to the other island and we'd check and see if -
We hold all the mail on the freights from the airplane so he'd have two loads to do.
I'd jump in with him and
I'd handle the plane when I was twelve years old on the way back to Charlevoix sometimes.
I did get interested in the Air Force with stuff like that.
You actually handled a plane at twelve years?
"Oh yeah, he just flipped it over onto 195 to cross over."
I took a run at it.
"Not good, I'm sure."
But then the next day we'd help Johnny at a Model A pickup.
We all had
Model As.
"Not all of us, but 6, 7 of us had Model As."
So we went over to... the bodies at the Coast Guard station.
So we went over and picked up a map
And Kenny went with us.
"Kenny McDonough, the guy that died in Texas."
We jumped in Donegal Bay and went up to Iron Ore
"And they gave them to 1,500 people."
It's in a book called Break Point and Beyond.
"And on the protocol of the test, if you scored  above a certain level, you'd be considered to be a genius at divergent thinking."
Okay?
"So, my question to you is, what percentage of the people tested, of the 1500, scored at genius level for divergent thinking?"
You need to know one more thing about them.
These were kindergarten children.
"So, what you think?"
What percentage at genius level?
(Audience member) 80.
"(Ken Robinson) You think 80, okay."
98%.
"Now, the thing about this was, it was a longitudinal study."
"So, they retested the same children five years later."
Age of eight to ten.
What do you think?
50?
"They retested them again, five years later,  ages 13 to 15."
"You can see a trend here, can't you"
[laughter]?
"Now, this tells an interesting story."
"Because you could have imagined it going the other way, couldn't you."
"You start off not being very good, but you get better  as you get older."
But this shows two things.
"One is, we all have this capacity."
"And two, it mostly deteriorates."
"Now, a lot of things have happened to these kids as they've grown up, a lot."
"But one of the most important things that happened to them,"
"I am convinced, is that by now, they've become educated."
"They know, they spent 10 years at school being told there's one answer."
It's at the back and don't look.
"And don't copy, because that's cheating."
You have to do 3 minus i over 3 minus i.
"I'm doing that because when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you end up actually with a real number."
Then you're going to end up with a complex number up here.
"A conjugate, all it means is you keep the real part the same, and you change the sign on the imaginary part."
That's all that word means.
"All right, now let's figure out what this is equal to."
"2 times 3, just same distributive properties as always."
Let me do it in green.
2 times 3 is 6.
"2 times minus i is minus 2i, all of that over 3 times 3 is 9."
3 times minus i is minus 3i. i times 3 is plus 3i.
"Then i times minus i, you can view that as minus i squared."
Let's think about what this is equal to.
"Well, this plus 3i and the minus 3i cancel out."
What's i squared?
"Well, this is equal to negative 1."
So you end up with a minus of a negative 1.
Minus a negative 1 is a plus 1.
So you're left with 6 minus 2i over 9 plus 1 over 10.
"Actually, we can reduce this some."
We can divide the top and the bottom by 2.
So that becomes 3 minus i over 5.
We just divided both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
That is choice B.
"Problem 29, these go fast."
No systems of equations and all that.
What is the product of the complex numbers 3 plus i and 3 minus i?
They just asked us that.
That was in the last problem.
"When we multiplied 3 plus i times 3 minus i, what did we get?"
We got 10.
We did this whole thing.
It's not because of that...&amp;gt; get in..
"By the way I am sorry,yesterday your night was destroyed because of us."
It wasn't my night.- Your date with Eylul was left incomplete.
"It was not for me, Mert and Eylul had a date."
Mert didn't want to be alone as it was the first time and I had to do it.
I understood.
Ehh?...
What are we doing now?
"In fact this is the whole bazaar but there are two more places i can show, or we can go... if you want"
Then show me ...
I will be pleased... !
I wish I could see your home too.
"Okay, you're a very stubborn!"
Are you hungry?
"In fact, I didn't eat properly since yesterday."
"Let's go then, I will take you to eat the best meatballs you can ever eat in your life.&amp;gt; Okay."
It's superb..
"There is no one,who doesn't enter if this smell gets on his nose,if there is money in the pocket,can't escape this place"
Excuse me!
"- Tell me , what do you need?"
"Please , sister."
Can we have some red pepper flakes - Of course- And from those little pickle peppers if you have.
I'll bring it right away.
Shall I ask for one more portion from the grill?
"In fact my stomach is full , but my eye not."
I will share it together.
"Master, can you prepare another one in the grill please?"
"The engine is ruined , master."
"it can't be repaired, it has to be changed."
"You talk with that man, if he agrees we will get it done."
"No, impossible, it can't be done before a week."
We also had a place where we ate meatballs in the way Bodrum.
"I start at the beginning of each list, and I say is one less than three?"
Sure.
So that says one should be the first element in my merge list.
"Now, compare the first element in each of these lists."
"Two is less than three, so two ought to be the next element of the list."
And you get the idea.
What am I going to do next?
I'm going to compare three against four.
"Three is the smallest one, and I'm going to compare four games twelve, which is going to give me four."
And then what do?
"I have to do twelve against thirty, twelve is smaller, take that out."
"Seventeen against thirty, twenty-four against thirty And by this stage I've got nothing left in this element, so I just add the rest of that list in."
"Wow I can sort two lists, so I can merge two lists."
I said it poorly.
What's the point?
How many operations did it take me to do this?
"Seven comparisons, right?"
I've got eight elements.
"It took me seven comparisons, because I can take advantage of the fact I know I only ever have to look at the first element of each sub-list."
"Those are the only things I need to compare, and when I run out of one list, I just add the rest of the list in."
What's the order of complexity of merging?
I heard it somewhere very quietly.
STUDENT: n.
PROFESSOR:
"Sorry, and thank you."
"Linear, absolutely right?"
And what's n by the way here?
What's it measuring?
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"In both lists, right."
Because it is one of the best music schools of the world.
They accept very few students.

Go Mira!
- Don't Yaman!
"Your mom saw you, it's a shame...!"
"Mira, I said go .please!- Don't do this Yaman, it's a pity for the woman..."
While that man is by her side I won't take a step to her again.
Go for the sake of your mom..
"Mira please, can you continue?"
Let's go to the other side before traffic starts or you will miss your lessons.
"You also go as soon as possible, I will send these to a reeve..."
"Look here, don't act like this!"
"See, he is in a good mood."
He came to see you from a distance.
"He is in beautiful cars,with beautiful girls.What do you want more?"
He has a real job!
I won't tell your brother you are here.
He has an opportunity to save his life.
He will take exams for a scholarship at university .. and I don't want anything to distract Yaman until then.
"Lawyer, you tell Yaman I want to see him,"
let him decide whether he will come.
You can see him only at the end of the month.
Then find a way so they keep me here until the end of the month.
"Mr. Selim, please."
"Soon I will be in front of the committee, they will send me back to jail."
"I think they should send you there, because you're more intelligent than me..."
Stay in jail like a man for 11 months.
Don't involve your brother too.
"Just this morning you were ranting man, what changed now?"
"I came back from a big mistake, Yaman."
Eylul didn't betray Mira.
Which is good today and good tomorrow.
Dr:
"Yes, it lowers heart disease and cancer down the road."
S:
I had no clue.
I thought the flu shot was just a nice thing to avoid a week of the sneezing.
But flu shot can actually reduce your cancer...
Dr: ...and heart disease down the road.
And we have to think long-term as a society.
S:
What about statins?
"I mean, it seems things like Lipitor, etc.--"
"no one should take medical advice based on a thing in a video-- but, are taking it, just for heart disease?"
Or are people taking it more broadly now?
Dr:
Listen:
"I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound affect on cancer, heart disease, stroke, potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases."
"And again, giving no recommendations, but what I say is, you and parents should talk to your doctor and say,"
"""Why shouldn't I be on this drug?	"""
S:
And there are some side effects?
Are they easy to test for?
Dr:
"They test for them, and they're reversible."
You have to do a risk-benefit analysis.
"Have to look at you and say, are you at high risk for XYZ?"
"If you are, what can prevent it or delay it?"
"The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease."
S:
This is fascinating.
"But no advice here, everyone should talk to their doctor."
Dr:
Come...
What's this?
Another temple of death?
"It's my tomb, Antony"
"When I die, it will be sealed tight"
"Here is where I'll lie, but not be confined"
"Beyond flesh, I will journey to the next life and back at will"
"And there, my sweet, noble king,"
I have reserved a place for you to travel with me
"I will lie anywhere with you, Cleopatra, but I'm not ready to accept death, not, not yet"
"Tonight, I had a dream"
I was winning a great battle!
ln the desert!
Even the ground was in my favor
"Octavius' army was marching on impossible terrain no place to deploy, nowhere to maneuver his army"
"lf I strike him, and I strike him hard and fast,"
I can stop his momentum...
And finish him in the desert!
That's right!
"So we may finally realise your vision... of uniting the east and west in a new Golden Age of light, of love, and dominion"
Antony!
Let me and my men come with you
"No, I need someone here I can trust"
You'll see that the Queen is safe?
On my life
These are just ornaments
"Still, Octavius will not have them"
"Your Majesty, this is the whole list?"
You must complete this side
Yes
Where is Caesarian?
I haven't seen him of late
"40 would be for the average female adult, 50 would be for the average male adult."
"But it's funny, we don't tell that to kids."
"I only learned this recently myself, too."
"Going through my whole life, and never really bothering to find out."
And nobody ever bothered to tell me.
"It's like saying,"
"""Here, have the keys to my car, go pick up some stuff for me, go get my groceries."" But I didn't teach you how to drive the car."
"Teaching kids, ""You got to eat it"", but not teaching them how, or how much."
"Now, again, let me show you how easy it is to get protein."
Especially here in the United States.
"Your standard American diet for breakfast, you got your bacon, you got your cow's milk, and you got your hen periods."
How many slices of bacon would you want?
"I know you might not eat bacon now, but how many slices do you remember as a kid, maybe?"
"Maybe 2, OK?"
Each slice is 5 grams.
Two times five.
How many eggs would you want?
2?
Each egg has 6 grams.
So what are we at?
10 + 12 is 22.
How many glass of milk?
One glass.
Each glass has 8 grams.
So you are at what?
30.
"We are not even done with breakfast, this is not including the toast with cow's butter you might put on it."
"So, you are not even done with breakfast, and you are almost at the limit."
"The average American does not need to worry about getting enough protein, they need to worry about getting too much protein."
That's why the U.S. has the highest rates obesity in the entire world.
"And people always tell me, ""Jesus."
What?
People are dying because they drink their neighbor's waste.
The water is so unclean that it contains your neighbor's waste.
This is hard for many environmental enthusiasts to grasp.
Climate change overwhelms them so much that they forget reality.
They forget that two million kids die of diarrhea due to unclean water.
It's horrible that we don't have clean drinking water in the world.
And that we have air pollution because houses don't have chimneys.
That contributes to childhood pneumonia.
It's a major environmental problem.
"At the same time, I say the climate is the biggest environmental threat."
But not the biggest environmental problem - it's a future problem.
You have to think several thoughts at once.

"This year, 32 public libraries are scheduled to open in Seoul."
"The city announced it as part of a plan to introduce 48 libraries,"
"First, let's have a meeting regarding the design."
I think I can be a better man.
"Young Master, have you fallen in love with me?"
"Well, I mean..."
"You did all this today, ... and I'm a bit dumb about stuff like that."
Really?
"If you've realized that you're too dumb to realize something like this,"
I must have...
Think about it carefully.
So am I too dumb to realize it or not?
What did he mean by that?
Chang Hui.
So his name was Chang Hui!
She may not be worthy enough to marry into Yongmun.
Lady!
Lady!
My Yi Nok... my Yi Nok...!
She must have been a noblewoman from a great family.
"I hid the truth because I worried about the danger, but now I think I should find her real name."
"If I find her real name, will we find her enemy as well?"
"We found an explosives dealer, but he died before he could be questioned."
"A noble prince of royal blood, and a criminal who sells women to China..."
How could they make a deal together?
"If he wants to do something in secret, he will have no choice but to deal with men like him."
He is spraying filthy blood in order to dethrone me!
"The child of a queen of noble blood, ...or a child of a filthy palace maid..."
We both act exactly the same!
"Your Majesty, you must listen to the woes of the people before the prince appears."
You must bring them to your side!
"If you continue to neglect your duties and dally in women and alcohol, the people's anger towards you will turn into a welcome for the prince."
People can be so stupid!
The prince is a monster just like me!
Why do they want him?
I sat up till after midnight studying *The Roman Ritual*... ...thinking about what lay ahead.
You mean *The Roman Ritual* *of Exorcism*.
A text used by Catholic priests... ...as a guide to performing the exorcism rite.
"Yes, I think I actually fell asleep with the book in my hand."
What happened next?
"*I woke up, freezing. *"
*It was exactly 3 a. m.*
Three a. m. is the demonic witching hour.
It's a way for demons to mock the Holy Trinity.
"It's an inversion of 3 p. m., the miracle hour... ...which is traditionally accepted as the hour of Christ's death."
I thought I smelled something burning.

My name is Autumn Moon.
I quit school after junior high.
I was no good in my study.
But the education system was no better.
It not only excludes me from further study... ...but produces juveniles like me.
"I've got nothing to do but hang around public playgrounds... ...playing basketball, talking part in brawls... being recruited as or recruiting triad members."
Stop!
No way!
Can I have a shoot?
This half-witted jerk is Sylvester.
I never found out his last name.
But I'm sure he's no Stallone.
"I ""recruited"" him from the street."
He was being bullied by a group of students and I came to help him.
"Well, at least he was smart enough now... ...that I could provide protection for him."
"That's how he became my ""junior""."
One brags about being a Big Brother. ...but one doesn't boast oneself of having a retard like sylvester as junior.
If anyone of you will never bully him again... ...I'll make sure you pay for it.
"Well, you may think I'm worth nothing because"
I'm jobless and hang around all day... ...but that's not exactly true.
My job is to help Big Brother Wing collect debts.
"I'm lone wolf type of person, doing whatever I like to do."
"To me, freedom counts first."
I'm not like the rest of them because I have brains.

But you know - consumer resistance against factory farming is steadily growing due to the increasing awareness of the animal suffering that it entails.
And sometimes you come across people from an entirely different background who surprise you.
It was in America that I met a man who is known as the Mad Cowboy.
He was a factory farmer who got out of the livestock industry and went vegetarian around the time of the Mad Cow Disease crisis in Europe.
"Hi, nice to finally meet you."
Nice to see you're un-lost again.
"- Yeah, finally, we made it."
Welcome to my humble abode.
- Thank you.
It's nice and warm here.
This is on the farm.
"And this is one of the dogs we had, which was Sam."
Good critter.
That's the farm ...
"I'm a fourth generation farmer, rancher, feedlot operator from Montana."
"At one time I had 7000 head of cattle, 12,000 acres of crops and 30 employees."
I spent 45 years of my life in production agriculture.
Not something I learned from a book.
I learned it by doing it.
I was a factory farmer.
The worst of all.
"Not a family farmer, but a factory farmer."
Never met a chemical I didn't like.
We'd actually grind up animals and feed them back to our animals.

- Absolutely.

Do you remember I had told you that... ... a day would come when your son would call you mother?
Come.
"Perhaps you haven't recognised her, sir."
Do you recollect that she had come with Arun for your birthday party?
"Yes, I have recognised her."
But I don't understand how...
Before marrying according to custom he...
And that is why she was unable to accept her son until today.
She bore her troubles alone... ... so that I could become a pilot in the Indian Air Force.
Because she had made a promise to my father.
There are some things that are greater than the limits of society.
You are one of them.
And I think that you should give your son his medal.
I?
A woman who despite losing her husband in an air crash... ... has the courage to make her only son a pilot.
I believe that her son should receive the medal from her.
"Vandana, your years of penance has borne fruit."
Take this.
Mother!
My son!
Today I can hold my head up with pride and say... ... that I do not know how much penance I must have done... ... in order to become the son of a great mother like you.
Your devotion will bear fruit
Do not weep...
Hello!
"Let's take a look at Chapter 6, Consumer Purchasing Strategies and Wise Buying of Motor Vehicles."
"Um, when should you buy?"
And when should you not buy?
"One of the first things I want you to consider when looking at this chapter, when is it better to have the cash and when is it better to go ahead and buy the item now?"
The first thing you need to look at is what is the difference in the cost?
Okay?
Star Wars!
That's a great one.
What else?
Student:
Rand al'Thor.
Brandon:
"Ok, Rand."
"Or basically anyone on a ""Hero's Journey."""
Student:
Frodo.
Brandon:
"You know, I honestly don't think Frodo counts."
"I think Frodo stays as an everyman, and I think that's perfectly plausible."
Frodo stays as an everyman.
Aragorn stays as a superman.
In the movie they move Aragorn from here to here.
But in the books he basically starts here and stays there.
And it's fine to do that.
Any three of these archetypes can work.
I like to put up spiderman here.
"Because he basically fits the perfect archetype of the everyman who becomes superman, right?"
And that's why his story is so compelling.
That's why it works.
But there are plenty of stories that work with the superman straight off.
"And we're talking... in this we talk about power level, which is not always the same way it is."
"There are plenty of books that are about, you know, the young woman who is not socially adept who becomes super socially adept."
And this is the same sort of archetype.
Or stories that start off with somebody being perfectly socially adept.
"I mean, Oscar Wilde's characters are all basically social supermen, right?"
"And we like reading about them because we're like ""Wow, I wish I could come up with rhetoric that quickly in the middle of a conversation."
"I love this character."""
They're still going to have a growth arc.
"Now, I should just draw the"
"line, right, connecting those two points at -- that will give me the"
whole line.
"And if I've done this reasonably well,"
"I think it's going to happen to go through -- well,"
not happen -- it was arranged to go through that point.
"So I think that the second line is this one, and this is the"
all-important point that lies on both lines.
Shall we just check
"that that point which is the point x equal one and y was two,"
right?
"That's the point there and that, I believe, solves"
both equations.
Let's just check this.
"If x is one, I have a minus one plus four equals three,"
okay.
Apologies for drawing this picture that you've seen before.
"But this -- seeing the row picture -- first of all, for n equal 2,"
"two equations and two unknowns, it's the right place to start."
Okay.
So we've got the solution.
The point that lies on both lines.
Now can I come to the column picture?
"Pay attention,"
this is the key point.
So the column picture.
I'm now going to look at the columns of the matrix.
I'm going to look at this part and this part.
I'm going to say that
"the x part is really x times -- you see, I'm putting the two -- I'm"
kind of getting the two equations at once --
that part and then I have a y and in the first equation it's multiplying
When I stack another mass on here-- so let me redraw it actually down here.
Because it's a different case.
"And I apply the same force, and now I have this new mass on here."
I'll do it in red.
This is m1.
The problem tells us that my new acceleration is 1/5 of the original acceleration.
So it's 1/5 of whatever this was.
So it's 1/5 a sub 0.
"So the question is, what is the ratio of m sub 0 to m sub 1?"
So m sub 0 to m sub 1 is equal to what?
And I'm going to keep it in abstract variables just to confuse you.
And then I'll show you that you can actually substitute numbers and the problem becomes a little easier.
And you might want to pause it and try it for yourself.
So let's work it through.
So we know we have this relationship to start off with.
"And just for simplicity, let's write what m sub 0 is in terms of F and a."
So we just divide both sides by a sub 0 and you get F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is equal to m sub 0.
Good.
So let's just put that aside for a second.
And let's do that same relationship here with this.
"So here, this relationship tells us that F sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0 times this new acceleration, which is 1/5 a sub 0."
"And so, if we divide both sides by this term right here, we get-- dividing by 1/5 is the same thing as multiplying by 5."
So you get 5 F sub 0 over a sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
I just divided both sides by this term right here.
"Well, what's F sub 0?"
What's this?
Let me switch colors again.
What's F sub 0 divided by a sub 0?
Well it's here's.
It's what we solved for in the beginning.
We just got it from this relationship.
So we could substitute.

"These theories are called resource dependence theory, network organization, and new institutional theory."
"Since you bought me this washbasin, I'll pay for our meal."
"Go ahead and eat it, Young Master."
I bought one for you too.
Come and eat.
I'll wait outside for you.
I guess I have to eat this then.
Have you stopped going to the government offices and filing reports?
I stopped it because it was useless.
Then do you think stopping Choi Chul Joo's ship will be useful?
You can never tell a lie.
"Young Master, are you... ...going to stop them?"
They can't regain their daughters by stopping the ship.
The parents are doing something foolish because of their own guilt.
They're trying to protect their daughters!
Protect?
They were the ones that sold their daughters off.
"Choi Chul Joo took them, but their parents were the ones that sold them."
They do not know how to protect.
"It's not that they don't know how, it's just that they're powerless."
"I know, because I lost someone too."
I was too powerless to protect that person.
I couldn't go with that person either.
Do you know how painful that is?
You can say that because you're powerful and you've never lost anyone like that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
"When I was young and imprisoned in the Queen's palace with my mother,"
I was fearful that I would lose her.
"I pretended to be calm and comforted my mother, ... but I knew."
I knew that I wouldn't be able to protect her in the end.
"I knew I would lose her, because I was too young and powerless."
I was desperate to protect her.
But now...
What is the solution of negative two-fifths X equals ten?
"Once again we have to keep equality, so we're going to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation."
"So, we're going to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of negative two-fifths, which is negative five-halves."
"Remember, when I multiply  negative five-halves times negative two-fifths, those numbers don't cancel out, they become one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to negative fifty-halves, or X is equal to negative twenty-five."
"This looks like it's the solution for our equation, but we're not going to be positive until we check it."
"So, negative two-fifths X equals ten."
I'm going to substitute negative twenty five in for X and I get fifty over five equals ten.
"So, ten equals ten."
That makes negative twenty five the solution for this equation.
In this lesson you have learned that you can solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.

What burden?
His Majesty is very happy to see you.
I took away too much time as you already have a weary heart.
His body was blue all over...this mean that  there must be someone who's harming him purposely.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.

He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
"If there is a problem with the food, we need  to investigate the royal chef and find out the truth."
That's right.
We should...
You are wrong.
It won't be too late to investigate  after His Majesty gains back some energy.
What are you talking about?
We need to find out  the truth in order to prescribe the right treatment to him.
"Your Highness, he is extremely ill so please come back at a later time."
What do you mean?
I'm his mother.
Move a side.
Your Highness!
What's your intention for preventing me from seeing him?
I need to see his condition with my own eyes.
Please tell the Queen Mother that His Majesty  is not in a condition to see her right now.
Are you saying that I am harming him now?

I'm Ray William Johnson and I approve this message.
"So tell me forum, why are you here?"
Yes it is.
"And what is exciting about it is, because this grant involves students and research, the students get to be involved in, sort of, cutting-edge research."
No other institution in the country is looking at pennycress.
Or looking at this sort of approach at off-season seed production.
And so part of my job is to breed new varieties of pennycress.
And the big part of that is trying to produce more oil on these seeds.
"They are about 36 percent, right at the moment."
"And we're trying to get that, up to say, 40 to 45 percent."
And so a big part of this trying to look into these seeds and finding out how much oil is in there.
Beth Seaton:
How do you do that?
Win Phippen:
"Well, we've hired a chemist, and we have, it's called an ""automated GC"" or a gas chromatograph."
And it allows us to look inside these seeds to find out how much oil is in them.
"I actually have one next door, if you want to go over and take a look."
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, let's take a look."
Win Phippen:
All right.
Beth Seaton:
Let's go.
Win Phippen:
So come on in.
This is the research lab.
And this is where we actually extract the oil right out of the seeds.
"Another grant that I wrote with the USDA allowed us purchase an automated gas chromatograph, and that allows us to actually look at the oils inside in the seed."
And so the first thing we have to do is we have to actually count these seeds.
Beth Seaton:
"So you count these little, tiny seeds?"
Win Phippen:
These tiny little seeds.
Beth Seaton:
When I lost my virginity
You walked in mid-lose
That was an honest mistake.

She seemed a bit confused.
"So, you swear I didn't cause you any big problems here at work?"

"In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier."
"Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649."
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
"And instead of squaring it this time,"
"I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number."
So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.
"How many digits do you have, six or seven?"
"Seven, and yours?"
Seven?
Seven?
"And, uncertain."
Seven.
Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have?
"Say ""No."""
(Laughter)
"Good, then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable."
"What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits, any six of them, in any order you'd like."
(Laughter)
"One digit at a time,"
I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.
"Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2."
AB:
Did you leave out the number 6?
"Good, OK, that's one."
"You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"4, 4, 8, 7, 5."
I think I only heard five numbers.
"Come all the way down to n, which is the"
"last line, come back up."
Drop it down.
There.
So now we have to drop some matrices in here or vectors in here with one and 1's with occasional 0's and 0's with occasional 1's okay.
So how do we do that.
"So, let's, let's come here and let's build zero vector, E0 is 0's end by one."
This is a vector of 0's.
Okay what we're going to do is do the following.
First of all let's take the let's make a vector of e2 which is just e1.
So I'm going to copy the one vectors.
"And what I'm gonna to do with e2 is I am going to, to occasionally put in zero."
How often do I put in a zero?
Well every nth point.
"Remember M, M is the small, is the small matrices in there."
"And, by the way, part of your homework three is going to be all about convincing yourself about this stuff."
"Because you're just going to be, your gonna emmese, immerse yourself in building matrices."
"That's all homework three is because you gotta build a derivative matrix and X derivative and Y and then, this."
"So, we're going to do, is for J equals one to M cuz that's how many, M blocks I have, remember, n by n, and I have these n by n blocks and there's m of them."
Now I am going to go down for each block and what I am gonna do is the following.
"For E2,"
Put an occasional zero.
Alright.
"So, Jay is going to one second."
Jay's going to go one.
"So, the first thing he is going to do is say y is five."
"So, he's going to go down to the fifth component."
Put a zero.
"And then Jay is going to be two, it's going to be the tenth component."
Put a zero.
"So, it's a bunch of ones, fifth component, tenth component."
All the way down.
"It's good, but not great."
People say things that aren't true.

They demand:
"""You who have knowledge, power and money"""
"""you must give all children a fighting chance!"""
"They fall down, stare into space and think:"
"""It will just get worse for the children."""
But raise your eyes and you'll see the statistics.
That's the world up there.
The world in 1959.
The ring corresponds to the bubble.
In London I lectured to hedge fund managers.
They're the worst kind of capitalists.
They wanted to know the exact condi- tions in every West African country.
"They know if there is sun, ore, oil, forest..."
They invest in Africa and want to know what country is most stable.
But the aid organizations have the same policy for everyone.
"The organization has an environmental, school or gender policy."
Then they pursue it in all countries.
To me it was horrific that businesspeople had a more fact-based worldview than young activists and university professors.
Dad was a coffee roaster at Lindvalls Coffee.
"Here, look..."
This is great...
"In this cigar box I have Dad's old club badge and five cents from East Africa, a coin Dad found in the coffee bags."
The raw coffee beans pass under magnets so all metal is removed.
They bring in huge amounts and inspect them carefully.
Here are coins from Colombia and Guatemala...
"Dad brought the coins home, sat me in his lap and got out the atlas."
He told me that the Africans didn't own their coffee plantations.

So we want Nakiye to our son Shewket for marriage to Allah and His Messenger
What would you say Nakiye?
Do you need something Mr. Ethem?
"No he means, do you want to marry Shewket?"
I want to of course ..
I agree
"Then, it's done .. congratulations congratulations"
I kiss you congratulation my daughter
Let me do it again.
"The Laplace transform of sine of at is equal to a over s squared, plus a squared."
And that's a significant entry.
"And maybe a good exercise for you, just to see how fun it is to do these integration by parts problems twice, is to figure out the Laplace transform of cosine of at."
And I'll give you a hint.
It's s over s squared over s squared plus a squared.
And it's nice that there's that symmetry there.
"Anyway, I'm almost at my time limit."
And I'm very tired working on this video.
So I'll leave it there and I'll see you in the next one.
I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before:
What is possible with the human voice?
What is possible with the human voice?
(Beatboxing)
♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing) (Dog barking)
Yeah.
(Applause) (Boomerang noises)
It was coming straight for me.
I had to.
"It was, yeah."
"As you can probably well imagine,"
I was a strange child.
(Laughter)
"Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be."
I was constantly experimenting with these noises.
And I'm still on that mission.
I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make.
"And the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises"
"I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do."
And there's things that no one's voice can do.
"For example, no one can do two notes at the same time."
"You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... (Two-tone singing)"
We could write 3 plus 2 is equal to 5.
Term three is minus 5.
And that's because minus 1 times this 5-- let me draw these arrows-- is equal to minus 5.
And then we add again-- I'm going to switch colors just to keep it interesting.
"So term four is going to be minus 5 plus 2, which equals minus 3."
"Then term five is going to be minus 3 times minus 1, which equals 3 again."
Right?
And I think you see how we're getting these patterns.
You just keep switching between adding 2 and multiplying by negative 1.
And then so term six is going to be what?
"It's going to be this plus 2, which is 5."
I think you're seeing the pattern again.
Let me do a bunch more and I'll do it outside of the scope of this chart.
The term seven is going to be what?
"It's going to be minus 1 times that, so minus 5."
And you see the pattern now.
Term eight is going to be minus 3.
Term nine is going to be what?
"Minus 3, minus 3."
So here we added 2 so we multiply it by negative 1.
So it's going to be 3 again.
And you could just experiment with yourself.
"Once you understand how soon. the sequence works, do a bunch of terms until you see a cycle."
And that's the key thing.
"In any SAT problem, when they ask you like what is the 100th term?"
It's going to have a cycle because they don't expect you to sit and write out 100 terms because you would run out of time.
"So if they ask you the 100th term, the pattern probably repeats every three or four or five or, at most, six terms."
And then you can use that to figure out what the 100th term is.
"So here we see that the pattern repeats-- let's see, 3, 5, negative 5, negative 3."
"3, 5, negative 5, negative 3, 3."
"So we see it repeats every fourth term, right?"
"This is kind of one cycle, then 3, 5, negative 3, and this is another cycle."
The quad is what I really like.
"For about ten minutes a day, every hour, people come together."
We're very diverse.
Absolutely beautiful.
"Fresh air, and the weather here's pretty awesome."
"The seasons, they're all awesome."
"It's a big University, but they still give you a sense of community."
Small but big at the same time.
You feel connected to all the students.
It has a small feel in a big place.
Hands down the best school.
Any interests that you have can be accommodated somewhere.
What I like about U.R.I. is they have alot of clubs that are specific to your major.
We have over a hundred different clubs here.
Making alot of good friends is fun.

"Everyone gets together, they do what they have to do."
"Merlo Pont, Jacques Lacan, Raymon Queneau, and its said that Jean Paul Sartre got the notes"
The Master-Slave dialectic sets out the origen of history.
How did history begin?
Perhaps no one ever asked himself this but the beginning of history is the beginning of human relations
"For Hegel, history began when two wills clashed, two desiring wills"
First let's differentiate between the human will and the animal will
The human will seeks other wills.
To wit: the will of one man seeks the will of another
That is: he desires that the other recognize him ...that he recognize him as the superior. ..that he submits.
So that I seek the will of the other.
I want the other to recognize me and submit to me.
And I'm going to constitute myself when this happens
The relationship that is going to be established between the other and myself
But at first the man seeks wills.
The animal seeks things and the things that it seeks it usually eats.
It desires natural things.
But man doesn't seek natural things
The consciousness is desire.

"Ah, then should we try the ""yawning method?"""
Yawning method?
"So, now the word ""concluded"" is basically the same as ""to finish"" something."
"You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded."
"Now, the second sentence we're going to look at"
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.
"In this particular sentence, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yawning is somewhat contagious."

It's ruined.
I haven't suffered from anything so far.
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably.
"Yeah, You and Me..."
I just lived off my greatness.
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.
What do we do??
It seems we belong together more and more.
"That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house."
Looking at her...
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.
"And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong."
It was quite surprising
So I should experience the world more...
"I think about it often, lately."
"Anyways, thank you He Ra."
That I could talk to someone about this ...
It's a relief
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-"
"Hey, Ha Ni ah!"
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world
That picture of everything I ever dreamed
Now the picture's crashing down around on me
Calls are coming in and we're looking at our friends
Wondering who's it gonna be
It was so good once upon a time
It was a simple time
It was a good time
Now we got the perks and all the crème
And it's tearing us apart at the seams
But I remember
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world
Once upon a time it was real
Once upon a time I was thrilled to get yo call
Then I could get yo all
Then I could get your heart
Now ain't the same
Seem like now it's a game
Once was reckless but now it's tame

"Hey, look at this one."
This one's my project.
"You decrease it to 0, then that'll-- and you could list them all out, 0 through 10-- and then the median number will shift to 5, so that will change it."
"E, increasing the largest number only."
"I can tell you that's the answer from deductive reasoning, but if we just take this 11 and we make it one billion does that change the fact that they're five numbers"
larger than 6 and five numbers less than 6?
Ignore the 0.
Five numbers less than 6?
No.
I can make it into a trillion.
"I can change it to any number, but the fact remains that I have the same amount of numbers larger than 6 as I do below 6."
So choice E cannot affect the value of the median.
E.
Next problem.
"OK, something for me to draw."
"Let's see, they have a 1/4 circle, so I'll just draw a big circle, and I'll just focus on a 1/4 of it."
Close enough.
That looks like a 1/4 of a circle.
"They say that-- oh, and there's a rectangle there too fascinating."
"So this rectangle in this 1/4 circle, so this rectangle could look like this."
"I know theirs looks taller, but I think this will do."
And then I think I'm almost done.
"I think I'm there, I think I can."
"And then they shade in some stuff, so if they shaded it, I will shade it."
A suitably tasteful color.
"OK, so I have shaded what they have shaded."
"And now, what are they saying?"
"They're saying that this is R, C, T, B, S, A."
And then they tell us that is a 90 degree angle.
"And then they tell us that this distance, from here to here, from all the way to the top-- so it's essentially the radius of the circle-- is 6."
The radius of the circle is 6.
"In the figure above, arc SBT is 1/4 of a circle with center R and radius 6"
Fair enough.
"If the length plus the width of rectangle ABCR is 8-- so the length plus the width, so ABCR."
"I'll find a way, don't worry."
And...
I love people who keep secrets... who are silent until his death or be silenced by death!
You have a sister named Nurten!...
Ayten-Nurten ..
"She goes to high school, she's a very beautiful young woman..."
It is good to be careful because you never know that samething bad could happen but...
I'm sure you'll be protected!
yeah... but is Nedždet there?
I do not know.
"Is everything all right, young man?"
I'm looking for Necdet.
Me too. but he is not here.
ok
"My daughter, it was a lower class, but I wanted to set it to a higher level to fit accommodation in our society."
"For your sake, I chose not to respect your love for him."
I said to myself I will accept it for Feridie well to see a smile on your pretty face.
"But there have been other things, and the man was lying in the face manipulated you..."
"Now tell me, dear Feride will you accept the man who cheated and lied to you?"
"Maybe you're still confused that's why you went to see him in the hospital, but do not do it anymore, Feride.,"
You're not like that you are a person with dignity and pride even if it was love.
Can a person put their pride and dignity to a compromise?
This man does not deserve all your pain.
All these tears like that from you flowing drop by drop.
Is that what is broken.
"Him I can not never forgive, never!"
"Listen Feride, whatever is done I can not live without you, but please do not use this paternal feelings."
Whatever happened left behind in the past bury love and feelings in the heartand considers them dead.

100 billion 68 thousand miles.
"2.6 trillion, two-thirds of the way to the moon."
Spendin g that every year on your health care.
Just an outstanding amount of money and here's my last comparison.
"If you look at our health care spending in the context of the world GDPs, France is the fifth largest GDP in the world after the United States, China, Japan, Germany,"
"France, okay?"
They've got 66 million people.
This is their spending on everything.
"Vacations, education, the good French food, housing."
"Defense, cars."
They spend roughly what we spend at everything for 66 million people what we spent for 300 million people just on healthcare.
"In other words, if the US Healthcare System, with world economy, it's the fifth largest economy in the world, the sixth largest world economy."
Just an amazing amount.
If you look at China.
You know we're spending about 40 percent of the Chinese GDP.
Just on health care.
We're worried about them taking us over.
"You know, we should be worried about our healthcare system."
"Now, it's not just the level we need to worry about."
That's very high but if it weren't moving.
We can handle it.
It's also how fast it's growing.
"So, get your audience response clickers out."
"If health care inflation continues at the current rate which is the rate that's been going for about 30 years, when will one-third of the"
"GDP, that's one out of $three in your wallet go to health care?"
"We need music, we got to do the music."
The answer is.
Twenty to 30 or you guys are even more pessimistic than reality.
Alright.
"It's twenty, 40 round about."
"It's actually twenty, 37 and it obviously depends upon healthcare inflation but that's an outstanding number."
One of every $three.
"Why don't you jump in the right seat."" So he put her in the right seat of a couple trips."
"And you handle the gear, you handle radio communications, do some switching."

"He said, ""Hey, Kathy, you stick with me, you'll have your 4-engine commercial in a year."""
But this... she's married to - they took the motorcycles and shipped them to Anchorage - from Anchorage down to Seattle.
Rode down through California with him and over through Vegas.
"Ran into a sleet storm in northern Arizona and I told her when she got to Seattle,"
"""Put your bikes in there."""
"""Oh, no, Dad, this will be nice."" ... what the hell, young, you know."
But when they run into bad weather they rented a van and put their bikes in there and drove it to North
Carolina.
"For some reason or other, he wanted to go there."
So she did good - she worked at IBM for a little while and then she got this job and she wanted the mechanic but now she's got her instrument rating.
She's got her
IA.
She can sign off any airplane made.
Or grounded.
And right now she's picking up her commercial license.
She's flying a brand new diamond.
"About $280,000 airplane, getting her instrument readings."
"Got the new flatscreens, instrument type stuff."
"It was funny, she called here last year."
She had to run in the middle of the night and - instrument time.
She went over to Myrtle Beach and over to South Carolina.
"But she was coming to Columbia the controller - it's nasty weather - it was real instrument time, it wasn't under the hood."
"So, he calls - a 737 is coming in behind her so -"
Whatever outfit it was - delta such and such or whatever.
"He says, ""Slow down a little bit."
I got a girl with a diamond up ahead of you.
"She's not quite your speed."""
"Kathy said, ""I damn near told him I could go that fast."""
She was coming in with this instrument.
Here is another example
For example they want to insult you and calling you gay
Most probably you will be called gay in a rude manner
"Now then, You know you're not gay"
So it's not true
"Second, if in your value system there is nothing wrong with being Gay"
So there is no insult
"If however gay, is evil for you"
So you see only the first point.
You're not gay....
So who ever is insulting is lying
Now take the stormtrooper Come over here
"Yes, my dear"
"As you accidentally have learned from the episode ""vulgarization of the senses"""
Stormtrooper is gay
And now try to insult him
"Hey glasseyes, you Gay!"
Hope I've insulted
Want to hurt me?
Call me Natural
From this we reach the conclusion
The offender in this case is quite homophobic
"And he will not name the Stormtrooper,Natural"
Because in his value system it is normal
"When insulting,the offender just telling us from what he afraid of..."
Whomever he would not want to be
And He simply LYlNG.LYlNG and LYlNG
Only projecting his complex on us
"Ideally,in order not to disclose information about yourself"
Should insult so
"Hi Kostya,All II want is for yout to feel bad."
LOL I'm so evil ...
Unfortunately there are no such churches in Taiwan.
And then Bee went to Hamburg.
To the musical.
"When we planned our journey to Somalia, the media reported about a humanitarian catastrophe."
Back then 20 000 people starved to death.

I would like to stage a play in the National Theatre of Somalia.
It should be like this.
"So good, that the whole audience would be so enthusiastic, that suddenly there would be peace in the whole country."
Then I made one more attempt.
On the rehearsal stage I focused all the lightning on one place.
I lay down there.
"I wanted to see, how long it takes that I get really thursty, and how long I could endure it."
I made a performance as well.
I wanted to feel the earthquake of tsunami 2005 in my body.
I fell to the floor.
I slipped over the stage with tap-dance-shoes.
There were ugly scratches on the stage and it sounded ugly.
And then much more text.
Bee is still in Hamburg at the musical.
I went to drink some water first and turned on the radio.
In the National Theatre in Mogadishu a suicide-bomber blew herself up at an anniversary.
"Mogadishu doesn't need beautiful arts, but hard life."

"Then I took of my costume, and looked exotic enough for a part in Lion King."
And his Enigma machine is exactly the same as the first one.
So there's something I have to do.
I now need to set these rotors to the correct position.
"So we've got this code over here, Y-T-H-M-Y and whatever."
Let's type that into the machine this time and see what happens.
"OK, so we start with Y. Y becomes N. T becomes U. H becomes M. M, in the code, is a B. Y. I. F. And W, finally, is E. So each rotor has 26 starting places."
"In fact, these rotors come out and swap over."
"In fact, again, they had five rotors to pick from."
They had a box of five rotors.
You would pick three from a box of five.
"And already, we've got thousands of settings."
And each one will produce a different code.
So we're going to work out those combinations.
"So the first thing I said was, we pick three rotors from a box of five."
"In the first slot, you would have five rotors to pick from."
"Once you've picked that, in the second place, you would have four rotors to pick from."
"And in the final place, the third place, you would have three rotors left."
And you multiply those numbers together.
So it's 5 times 4 times 3.
So there are 60 ways that you can put in three rotors from a choice of five.
We have 26 starting positions for each rotor.
"So we have 26 choices for the first one, 26 choices for the second one, and 26 choices for the third one."
"And if you do that, you get 26 cubed, which is 17,576."
"It gets worse, because the military, the Army, Air Force,"
Navy had something extra.
"The commercial machines-- if you were a bank or a business, you could buy an"
Enigma machine to use yourself to send your own secrets.
But the military had an extra bit.
They had this thing at the front of the machine.
"Now, this is called a plugboard."
"And it's like an old-fashioned telephone switchboard, like an old patchboard."
We have 10 of these wires.
"So, let's say that you have some data now from the, from the sets of families I mentioned."
And this is what the family unit looks
like.
"Now again, we have the genotypes, just for"
"A and B. We don't know anything about C except, by virtue of disease status."
Okay?
"So, [inaudible] are Aa, ."
"So, you know, they're heterozygous for both the A and B markers."
"416 of them were healthy, and one was diseased."
'Kay?
So most of them tend to be healthy if you're heterozygous for both.
"Those are little a, little a, little b, little b."
"Most of'em, or actually all of'em in this case, are diseased."
"If you're big A, little A, little B, little B."
"So you're homozygous for little B, but you're heterozygous A marker."
"So, you're mostly healthy, there's a couple of diseased individuals."
"And this case, little A, little A, big B, little B, most of them are diseased."
"So, look at this just a minute, and speculate whether you think marker A is closer to the disease-causing mutation or marker B is."
"Again, remember mapping is looking for an association between genotype and phenotype, okay?"
"So what you wanna do, and looking at this right now, this is just like the problem we did in a previous video."
Look and see.
Does your genotype just at A predict the disease?
Does your genotype just at B predict the disease?
"All right, let's take a look now."
"So at A, just looking at A. Well, actually let's start with B, let's start with B. Just at B, big B, little B."
"So this one is big B, little B. Most, almost all of them are healthy."
"This one down here is also big B, little B."
Almost all of them are diseased.
"This one's little b, little b."
Almost all of'em are diseased.
"This one is little b, little b and almost all of them are healthy."
So b really doesn't predict the genotype very well at all.

If you have no idea what a viola is it actually doesn't matter....

That's why I am here making a mini series  about music knowledges that you may not know.
[ The E Symphony ]
The 1st episode of the E Symphony will be about the viola
The English name of the viola is viola.
(nice translation)
"Some people pronounce as ""viola"""
Viola with other string instruments are all evolved  from a Baroque instrument called the Viol
"You may have now notice that, compare to the violin, cello or double bass, you have less opportunity to hear the word ""viola"""

Now I don't know what that penguin was thinking or why that sea lion needed to be so melodramatic about the whole thing.
"-Oh, no he didn't."
-But I do know that that penguin is brave as hell.
"Apparently, Happy Feet plus gigantic balls equals a penguin."
"No but this video got a half million views in two weeks but it just goes to show you that even in the animal kingdom, everyone picks on the fat kid."
-Fatty fatty 2x4.
"Wake up, fatass."
-Oh!
-Now I'm honestly not sure why he didn't snatch that penguin up and eat him with a side of Nutella.
"But no, his lazy ass goes right back to sleep."
-[snores]
"-Look at him there, lazy ass."
"""Just five more minutes Mom."""
"Listen if you're a sea lion and you're way too lazy get up and eat a penguin, that's like a whole other level of lazy."
"All right, if you're a straight male, then you probably don't know much about Liza Minnelli."
"All right so here we got some footage of her in an interview and I don't know much about her,"
"I know that she sings, I know that she acts and I also know that I am like in love with her now"
'cause she did this hour-long interview and someone clipped a two-second soundbite from that interview.
It's really fast.
It's really easy.
"And in fact, voice search has become an incredibly popular application."
"Just to give you an idea, out of every four searches that we receive from Android devices in the USA, one comes from voice."
"That's 25%, which is pretty amazing."
So what I wanted to do today is actually show you how we're taking the voice UI to an entirely new level; through Cloud computing innovation.
Let me ask you a question.
"Have you found yourself, say, rushing at an airport?"
"You've got one bag in one hand, you've got a jacket or maybe, you know, a baby on the other hand and you need to send a quick text message but it's just too hard."
Wouldn't it be great if you could do it with just one single click?
Let me show you how you're going to be sending your text messages very soon.
Send text to Robert Hamilton: let's meet outside terminal
five in 10 minutes.
So this is going to process on the Cloud for a couple of seconds and then it's going to come back.
"So, let's see, perfect recognition."
Just nailed it.
And... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"By the way, Hugo, the important thing is the computer was in the back room somewhere, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
The computer was in the back room somewhere. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
The computer--the computer was somewhere... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Not this back room. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Not this back room.
The computer there was in the data centers.
You shipped it all the way somewhere.
"It did all that work, all the thousands of computers and it came back and boom. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Yes.
That's exactly right.
"So, all"
"I have to do here, of course, is just press send and I'm done."
What you saw is called a voice action and there's a bunch of them in the new Android Voice Search application.
Let me show you another one.
Call Grand Hyatt Hotel in Berlin.
"So if you take the dot product with itself, you get 1."
If you take a dot product with some other guy in your set you're going to get 0.
Maybe I can write it this way. vi dot vj for all the members of the set is going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j.
And then if these guys are the same vector-- I'm dotting with myself-- I'm going to have length 1.
So it would equal length 1 for i is equal to j.
So I've got a special set.
All of these guys have length 1 and they're all orthogonal with each other.
They're normalized and they're all orthogonal.
And we have a special word for this.
This is called an orthonormal set.
So B is an orthonormal set.
Normal for normalized.
Everything is orthogonal.
They're all orthogonal relative to each other.
And everything has been normalized.
Everything has length 1.
"Now, the first interesting thing about an orthonormal set is that it's also going to be a linearly independent set."
"So if B is orthonormal, B is also going to be linearly independent."
And how can I show that to you?
Well let's assume that it isn't linearly independent.
"Let me take vi, let me take vj that are members of my set."
And let's assume that i does not equal j.
"Now, we already know that it's an orthonormal set."
So vi dot vj is going to be equal to 0.
They are orthogonal.
These are two vectors in my set.
"Now, let's assume that they are linearly dependent."
I want to prove that they are linearly independent and the way I'm going to prove that is by assuming they are linearly dependent and then arriving at a contradiction.
So let's assume that vi and vj are linearly dependent.
Well then that means that I can represent one of these guys as a scalar multiple the other.
And I can pick either way.
"So let's just say, for the sake of argument, that I can represent vi-- let's say that vi is equal to sum scalar c times vj."
"So let's see, this is time 0, this is 5 seconds."
"So if we look at the hare's position after 5 seconds, so after time equals 5 seconds, it does indeed look like the hare's position-- the hare is just sitting there at the 90-foot marker line and is not moving at all."
The rate of change of position with respect to time for the hare at that point is 0.
"So this does seem true, it just doesn't apply to the question."
It's not the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on this interval.
This is applying to H of t.
The hare runs at a speed of 18 feet per second for the first 5 seconds.
So let's see if this is true.
"For the first 5 seconds, so this is 5 seconds going by, the hare is able to cover a distance of 90 feet."
"So the hare is able to go 90 feet in 5 seconds, so for the first 5 seconds, the hare is-- hare's rate is 90 feet."
You could say average rate of change is 90 feet in 5 seconds.
And 90 divided by 5 is indeed 18 feet per second.
"So once again, this third statement is true, it just doesn't apply to T of t."
It's not addressing the question.
Now this fourth choice is that the hare wins the race.
"Now, winning the race, they have to get to 100 feet in the shortest amount of time."
This is 100 feet right over here.
So let's see.
So it looks like only the tortoise even gets to that point.
"At 20 seconds, the tortoise gets to the 100-foot mark."
The hare is still hanging around taking a nap or something at 90 feet.
So this is actually outright false.
The tortoise wins the race.
So we will definitely go with our first choice.
"Fred:Hey, it's Fred, and today's May Day."
"Yay, May Day!"
"So, yeah I'm gonna deliver everyone in my whole entire neighborhood May baskets."
Full of love and happiness.
"I don't know if you already realised this, but, my mom got me a ""Fred"" shirt."
"She said that we can't afford to get a lot of shirts, so, I'm just gonna wear this shirt for the rest of my life."
"No offense to you guys who have a ton of shirts, but, it's more cool just to have one shirt."
I hope I didn't offend anybody.
We will all die... all will die!
No!!
What do we do!?!!?

let's lead this war to victory it's better if the one that's going to die anyways die right?
I will go!
Injured Jun officer volunteered to take the captain's place in the plan.

Hi!
Today I am going to talk about how to create this effect; this infinite white background.
If you saw the Apple commercials;
"If you are at 40 and you are imagined you are at 40, point number 40, the last PMT or C is $10,000, so at time 40, it's exactly ten, but when you look back if you were to, you have to carry past money amounts you've invested as earning money, which is good news for you, right?"
And it's earning how much?
"Eight percent and let me, let me tell you, that's not bad at all, aleight."
And we'll talk about that when we talk about risk and return in a second.
"So, do you understand the nature of the beast?"
The beast is not easy.
"It's not easy, it's like doing 39 future values and adding them up, right?"
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to now shift to using a calculator.
"Okay, Okay, so, if you notice I am on the top panel and I am going to use the formula of PMT."
"Remember, whatever you don't know, you type in here."
"So, that's yeah, PMT, alright."
"And the one thing, you have to do before you do PMT and not get excited like PM, Mr. Hyper, you have to put equal sign so that, otherwise, you will get all kinds of garbage."
"Okay, you open it up."
What is the first number that shows up?
The first number that shows up is the rate of return and we know how much are we earning.
We earning 0.08.
"Again, emphasizing this."
The only reason I'm using Excel right now is what?
"Simply, because the calculation is very difficult."
But I've explained to you what's going on.
"You're doing 40 going forwards, but actually only 39."
Because the first one is zero and the last one is just itself.
"So, so that's why, that's it, okay?"
"So, you put a comma, and what's the next one?"
40.
"Number of periods, right?"
"And, actually let me just back track a"
little bit.
"The thing that we want to figure out is FV, so put an FV and now I want rate 0.08."
You see what I was doing we will do next time.
"So, the number of periods is 40 and in this case, I know my PMT and my PMT is $ten, 000, right?"
"And what is PV, don't worry about it, it's not in there and just hit, okay?"
They can't be p.
They only get as high as p minus 1.
This is not an option.
"So the only possibility, if a is equal to 0, for the determinant of capital A to still be divisible by p, is for bc to be equal to 0."
So let's think about how many possibilities there are over here.
So let's think about all of the combinations.
"So there's the one situation, where b and c are equal to 0. b and c is equal to 0."
Now let's think about the other ones.
There's one where b is equal to 0 and c isn't. bc will still equal 0 in this situation.
So how many possibilities are there?
How many possibilities are there for this?
"Well, b is equal to 0."
"C over here can be any value, although we've already considered the case where c is equal to 0."
"So it could be any value so that we don't double count, any value where c does not equal 0."
So it could be 1 through p minus 1.
"Or another way to think about it, there's p minus 1 possibilities."
Now let's think about c is equal to 0 and b isn't.
"Well, exact same logic."
"Once again, we don't want to double count that they're both being equal to 0."
So let me write it.
"And c isn't-- well, we're saying it isn't 0, so we are actually already putting that constraint there."
So it has p minus 1 possibilities.
So how many total possibilities do we have where the determinant of A is equal to 0 and a is equal to 0?
So we have one here.
"We have one possibility here, then p minus 1 and p minus 1."
"So our total possibilities are p minus 1 plus p minus 1 plus 1, which is 2p minus 2 plus 1, which is 2p minus 1."
2p minus 1 incremental possibilities when a is equal to 0 for the determinant of A to be divisible by p.
So that's what we just got in this video.
"In the last video, we had p minus 1 squared possibility when a does not equal 0."
"So if we want the total number of A's, where the determinant of A is divisible by 0, we can add the number that we got in the last video to the number we just got."
So let's do that.
"So if I were to rewrite this over here, this is equal to p squared minus 2p plus 1."
I stand before you with all the might of Rome
"And I hereby declare that Queen Cleopatra, widow of Gaius Julius Caesar, was his once true and legal wife!"
"And that their child, Ptolemy Caesar, is the true,"
legitimate and only son of great Caesar!
"Come forth, young Caesar!"
Let your people see you!
"Let it be known throughout the world that I, Marcus Antonius, have renounced my false Roman marriage... and have taken as my wife Queen Cleopatra..."
and as a token of this great union...
"I hereby bequeath, to the throne of Ptolemy, the land of Syria, to the limits of its borders!"
"Not only does he proclaim an Egyptian bastard as heir to Rome, he secedes the wealth of Syria to a foreign power!"
Shame!
Shame!
"Now, far be it for me to say that Marc Antony is not an honorable man"
"Yet there he remains, in the east, wallowing in the mud with the whore of the Nile, caught by the same hook as Caesar"
"I submit to you, fellow Romans, that Marc Antony has broken the pact between us"
He has!
He has!
"For the good of the empire l, as co-consul, must do as Roman justice commands me"
I hereby declare a just and righteous war against Antony and Cleopatra!
Generals!
Come quickly!
Octavius!
"Ah, Generals Grattius, Cornelius"
Try one of these cakes
They're hard to come by in Gaul
What are you doing here?
I've come to take command
These are Antony's men
You have a letter from Antony?
Antony is no longer relevant to Roman affairs
His thoughts are only of Egypt and Cleopatra
"I will not surrender the Gallic legions, unless Antony personally instructs me to do so"
They sat by my mum's hospital bed  when my mum was in coma.
They came and get me out of jail when I get busted for stupid stuff over the weekend.
Nobody ever did that for me before.
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, that thing that Thay says  'goes in in order to go out'."
"It comes in from the staff of caring  teachers, people like yourself first, unrelentingly, fiercely,constantly pouring that love and attention and going beyond their expectations to care about them."
To care about them.
"Here is a poem,"
"(Bell) by Travis Daniels, a Youth Build student."
"He was at a conference and saw all people like you caring and talking about the program,  and how they want to help it."
"""His Hero, from being lonely and getting blunted to seeing concern and feeling wanted."
"From hating you because you stared, to loving you because you cared."
"In the pain, I am in a struggle, I need to talk, I need to hug you."
I hope that you feel my heart and its words.
"Now, picture the youth that stand on the curbs."
"They have no hope, they see no change."
They try to live but stuck in their ways.
"16 years old and suicidal,  you may not relate but trust me, I do."
"I reminisce about my cries for help,  no one noticed that I hit myself."
"As time went on, a lost soul grew and was welcomed by those who care for the youth."
I know there is more that  you want me to be.
"I am still in the dark  but the light, I can see."
"Let it be known, I love what you do,  from now till forever, I'll pray for you."""
"So, everything that everyone has said  is part of the picture, right?"
"Taking care of ourselves,  appreciating each other, knowing that we can't do it all in one step."
"Taking the step, step-by-step."
Pouring out the love.
"Mother Teresa, I want to quote her."
"She says,""Love until it hurts  and then love some more."""
"I think that's what we're called to do and the more that we take care of ourselves, the more of our natural love we have available to share with our students."
Thank you very much.

She was that powerful.
One day she had a question for the class.
I'm sitting there.
Let's go back to the 1970's.
"I'm wearing bell-bottom pants (Horrible, never again!!)."
"But there I am, she had a question."
I raised my hand hoping that she wouldn't call on me.
She called on me.
"Remember, she's a larger-than-life woman with a lot of energy."
"""Stephen, that's right!!"""
"Wow, because of Mrs. Jordan, she changed my life at that moment."
Announcer:
"""That's right, Stephen,"" became a personal mantra as a reminder of the power and impact one person can have on another."
"Ivan Noble of Boston University writes,"
"""I have read over 400 student evaluations of your presentation, [with comments like]"
"'Bring him back, please!' 'The Best!' 'Truly inspiring!'"
"[and] 'he made me feel like I could achieve anything I want.' You capture the hearts and attention of every single audience member."""
Ray Hexamer:
"Most times you hire a speaker, it's the same speech that they've done 50 times in the last four months."
"Stephen's was not that way, he was different in the respect that he took the time to actually get to know what First Communications was and what they represented and tailored his presentations to fit what we were looking for."
Stephen:
"You have dreams, like me, you have ambitions, like me."
I'm just like you.
I didn't really do anything more than what you're capable of doing.
The only thing to be able to embrace change.

"We had a lot of benefits in the United States, because of George Bush."
George Bush was great for us.
Right now we have so many creative people which we could hear here because we had George Bush.
"In November, 2007,"
"I was in Australia, in Sydney."
"So was George Bush, and he said, ""I'm so glad to be in Austria""."
(Laughter)
"Because, after seven years in power, he didn't know the difference between Austria and Australia."
"Then, he was opening a conference."
"He thought, ""Vienna, Austria"", opening this OPEC Conference."
"But it was not the OPEC Conference, it was the APEC Conference,"
The Asian-Pacific Conference.
"When this is your president,"
- we have some potential as well - we don't wait for the government anymore.
That's why we have seen huge innovations in the United States.
"Now, with Mr. Obama, everybody sits back and relaxes, and waits for what the president is doing."
"But before that, we had George Bush, and so we knew it is up to us."
We didn't wait for the government anymore.
"So, in a certain way, George Bush was beneficial."
"But only in certain ways, definitely."
We need to reinvent our products.
Everything we see in front of us is not designed.
"We talk about colors in Brazil, but all the colors that you see are hazardous waste. even the flip-flops that we saw are hazardous waste."
35 million flip-flops go into the ocean every year; 35 million.
"There's more seals, more whales, more turtles, more dolphins, killed by flip-flops, than by anything else,"
Because the animals eat the plastic.
There are 12 million tons of plastic going into the oceans.
Nothing is designed to go into biological systems; nothing is designed to go into the biosphere.
We feel so bad that we are here that we are romanticizing nature.

- He used to memorize 2-4 pages a day..
"- but in the last portion of the Quran, he started memorizing.."
- .. 8pages a day!
-Masha'Allah
- and obviously he doesn't leave this institute?  - yes ofcourse.
"MashAllah Tabarak AlRahaman, Who encouraged him to memorize the Quran?"
"- No one encouraged him, he had personal desire to memorize the Quran."
"-MashAllah, as we know the one who memorizes the Quran must always be reviewing what he has memorized."
- How many pages does he review a day?
- He reviews 4 Chapters a day!
-MashAllah!
I ask Allah to bless him.

I have a small request..
Now that you have planned to memorize the Quran and started working on it...
Make sure you Do not Despair!
I know with this great Quran journey.. you will be facing many hardship and obstacles..
These obstacles should never let you stop what you are doing
"It should not let you say ""that's it.."
"Im going to stop memorizing the Quran"""
I have honestly met many people who have memorized upto 3 chapters and as soon as they faced a small obstacle.. they decided to stop memorizing the Quran!
Trust me when I say:
This is indeed from the Shaytaan.
"the honey, we know its sweet but we also know it was produced by the sharp needle on the bee! and just like the Quran, it is so great!"
Believe me..
"I have met many disabled people, they face so much hardship while memorizing the Quran but.."
They knew the great blessings behind memorizing the Quran.. so they did complete Memorizing the Quran with all these hardships and obstacles that you don't even face or will face [Since you are in good health] and if you have sincerely focused on this..Allah will ease every step you take because you want to memorize the book of Allah
Allah says:
"""And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways."""
Allah will make it easy way for you but make sure you do not despair!
The Old Grozny Institute - Chechnya
We had an ultimate visit to one the special institute here in Russia
On my left hand I had an old tape recorder.
"In it, Jimmy hendrix played his e-guitar against the Vietnam war."
Then she wanted me to imrpovise with my voice.
She wanted me to see pictures from wars with my inner eye.
She wanted me to apologise for mankind.
It goes like this.
In my hand I was holding a gong and I hit it during singing.
In the end a long broad red cloth came down.
"When Ahmed brought the myrrh to Germany, the next steps are the following."

"I put some of the myrrh into this fountain, turn it on, and the essence is generated."
This product is made in Taiwan.
"And it reminds me of my homeland, because the rocks in our landscapes look similar."
"And the sound from the water is really convenient, because in the hot summer, you only want to flee to the mountains to cool down."

"When you have time, go there, make a biking tour."
"It is very nice, noone around, you hear the waves."

I wanted to try and answer some questions with this project.
The first was: what are the difficulties with the product myrrh?
"I did my last performance together with a japaneese DJ, Hito, and a composer from Hongkong, Kimho."
It was about things that only we understand.
My second question was:
"When a person grows up away from his homeland, and later goes back there, how is this?"
"Hito dee-yays with her orange kimono, Berlin-style minimal."
Forth question:
"When I work with Somalis as a German, what should I know?"
"I danced a taiwaneese dance hit, that everybody dances there."
"Primary school children, housewives, workers at the chinese new year party,"
Even the gods with their big masks dance it at festivals on the streets.

"In the summer of 1995 under my grandfather's favorite reading chair, I found a tattered"
Webster's International Dictionary.
In the back were ganged together and printed all the wonderful images from the book; a little universe of 19th century America.
"Little did I know I was about to devote the next 10 years of my life to organizing and printing 4,000 of these little blocks."
The Merriam Webster Company gifted these engravings to Yale University in 1977.
They now live in the press room of the Arts of the Book Collection.
I was enthralled when I first had a chance to see the engravings themselves.
I was fascinated by the numbers stamped and written onto their sides.
I spent much of 1997 identifying and organizing the collection into categories.
"I estimate there are about 13,000 of these little blocks."
Here are carriages and footware.
I used photocopies from the dictionaries to identify the blocks.
I then culled the images I was to print and organized them alphabetically.
Each engraving was logged out as part of a special loan agreement.
"At Quercus Press engravings were cleaned, often revealing amazing manuscript."
Most engravings were not type-high.
"Using various bits of paper, the engravings could be made"
level and raised so they could be printed properly.
Each engraving was then measured for labeling.
The latin names were added for flora and fauna.
The labels were then cast on my 1938 Model 8 linotype machine.
The linotype is really 3 machines at once.
"It composes a line of type, passes it, then redistributes it."
It's all done used these little brass mats.

"This demonstration was organised by the Humane Society of the United States,"
America's largest animal welfare organisation with 10 million members.
"30 minutes later I have an appointment on Capitol Hill with Wayne Pacelle, the president of the Humane Society."
Hi.
- Welcome to the United States.
"Welcome to Washington, our nation's capital."
- Thank you.
We are so proud of what you've accomplished in Holland with your election.
We all took note last November of how you were elected and you're the first Party for the Animals in the world to achieve this.
"- Yes, that's true."
So thank you and we look forward to learning about what you have done.
"Oh, OK."
So nice to meet you finally.
You are the biggest organisation on animal welfare?
"Yes, we are."
"We have ten million supporters here in the United States in terms of paying supporters, and then of course we have millions more who believe in what we are doing, and we are here to organise that sentiment to achieve political reforms for animals, among doing other things."
"We try to pressure corporations to do the right thing and we educate the public, and we do hands-on care of animals as well."
But the political work here in Congress is very important.
Why aren't they talking now?
Why don't they take Agi's side now and support her?
"I don't understand Why aren't all psychologists, psychiatrists why aren't all doctors protesting and demanding not only that Agi Gereb be let go, but also that she receive a Nobel prize for her work?"

NARRATOR:
Are you a survivor?
In the world's harshest environments... we're wimps compared to the toughest creatures on the planet.
We're counting down the ultimate top ten survivors in the natural world to find the animal with the most extraordinary endurance.
"When the going gets tough, the tough really get going on the Ultimate Animal Countdown."
[engine sputtering]
MAN:
"Mayday, mayday!"
[alarm beeping]
NARRATOR:
"Could you cope with nature's worst crashes, cataclysms, and catastrophes?"
We're counting down the world's toughest animals--
Surviving against the odds for days... months... or years.
"A hurricane unleashes the energy of 10,000 nuclear bombs."
"In Florida, it wreaks havoc on land... and sea..."
The storm surge sweeps fish onto shore--
leaving them stranded.
Including the animal swimming into number 10:
Reef sharks.
Shallow water is their nursery.
But sharks are survivors.
They avoid bad weather... tipped off by their super-sensitive ears.
The shark's inner ear is similar to ours and can detect changes in pressure.
Useful when it dives deep... or when a hurricane approaches-- but we only discovered by accident.
(R. Brady) Thank you.
(Woman in the audience) You mentioned that singing about flowers may not necessarily reach teens effectively.
"So, I was wondering if one of you can express what might be the best way to mindfully communicate with teenagers."
(K. Weare) I was not trying to say that nobody should sing songs about flowers with kids.
"But again, just taking the Mindfulness  in Schools Program from the UK, which is a Teens Program, it basically does things that are quite edgy, and exciting."
"For example, tasting."
It's chocolate but it's also hot chili which excites some of the kids.
"The next workshop, we use a shock ball, which gives an amount of electric shock to illustrate aversion."
(Laughter)
"It's very mild, I would say."
(Laughter)
We haven't lost too many yet.
(Laughter)
"But things like using clips, some films, some current pop music, and so on."
"And using language,  so you won't use mindfulness."
"We use MindLab or Emotional Warrior, or something of that sort."
"You talk about sports, you talk  about surviving life in a club."
You basically stop where they are.
It comes down to knowing your teens and working how you talk to them about anything really.
Translating the work of mindfulness  into the examples and language that you would use.
"There is a lot of stuff in pop music  that you could choose to play if you want to talk about being  in the moment, and ethics and so on."
"There is just a lot out there, you just need to get the head on, which is seeing the world  from the teen's point of view."
And use the teen themselves to tell you  what works with that group.
"So there is a lot, it's really  about the spectacles you put on before you start teaching more than sort of specifics."
(Woman) I am speaking from a parent's perspective rather than a teacher's.
"I would get someone else to teach, then."
(Laughter)
"(J. Miller) Just bringing the mindfulness to boys,"
I think one of the things is sports.
There are lots of people  in the sport world using this.
"The classic book is Phil Jackson's, who was coach of Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers."
He brought mindfulness right into a working coaching.
"Coleen knows that I'm giving a message to her, and she can open that message and know that it goes to Alice."
It doesn't require the first one.
"If Bob see me talking with Coleen, presumably that's not a problem."
It doesn't require the second if Bob sees Coleen talking with Alice.
That's also not a problem.
"If Bob sees both of those and sees them in quick succession, especially if he sees the envelopes being handed on, then he's got a good reason to suspect that I'm talking with Alice."
So we need both of these properties.
"We need to know that Coleen can be trusted, and we need to know that Bob can't see both of these transactions."
Those are pretty high security assumptions.
"We don't want to have to trust Coleen completely, and we don't want to rely on the fact that Bob can't see these two conversations."
The way to make it more secure is to add a third person--
let's say we know Edgar as well.
"Now instead of giving the message directly to Coleen, what I'm going to do is take the envelope for Coleen, put that inside an envelope for Edgar."
We need to fold things a little to make them fit.
Now I'm going to seal this envelope with a very secure seal that only Edgar can open.
Now I'll give this to envelope to Edgar.
"Edgar will open it, see that it has an message for Coleen."
Edgar will give the message to Coleen.
"Coleen will open that, see that it has a message for Alice, give the message to Alice."
Alice will open the message and see that she shouldn't eat the onion.
This has more protection.
Now Coleen doesn't know that I'm communicating with Alice.
Because the message is going like this:
"It's going first to Edgar, then to Coleen, then to Alice."
"Neither Edgar, nor Coleen knows that I'm communicating with Alice."
Edgar knows that I'm sending a message through him that goes to Coleen.
"Coleen knows that she's receiving a message from Edgar, and it's going to Alice."
Neither one knows both endpoints.
"If we add enough hops, this can start to be quite secure."
This is actually called onion routing.
That's why the message is to not eat the onion.
The name comes from the idea that an onion has all these layers.
And this is why chocolate  is associated with longevity.
"If you recall, there was a great book written years ago, which we're gonna look at"
"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
"And the Oompa Loompa's had brilliant pearly white strong teeth, because chocolate is great for your teeth."
Chocolate toothpaste is coming.
"This is what the cacao bean looks like  when you break it open, when you break it  into the different pieces."
"And those are called nibs, and these products are available  here in Finland now."
And all over the world.
Raw chocolate products --  in fact this industry is now over a hundred million dollar industry.
And it all came from one moment when I bit into raw cacao bean.
"And for the last 8.5 years,"
I've been proselytizing  about the power of chocolate all over the place.
In fact it never stops.
Some people complain about that.
"Anyway, iconically chocolate is associated with wonder and magic."
"And if you see that giant head back there, that's an Olmec head."
They're the ones who originated the word cacao.
"And you can see the bird in this image as well, indicating that connection between birds  in that realm and chocolate."
"Chocolate, as I discovered when I was studying in Oaxaca Mexico, is added to guacamole, but not process chocolate, raw chocolate."
They take the crushed up nibs  and they put it in their guacamole.
Try it at home.
"I was fortunate I grew up in California with Mexican people, and I was in love with guacamole  from an early time."
What an amazing thing  to have your cuisine expanded.
And that's what we're doing with chocolate.
"I got so into chocolate, I started growing chocolate."
This is my chocolate nursery in Hawaii.
"I have a farm in Canada,  I have a farm in Hawaii."
And the purpose of that farm in Hawaii  is to grow chocolate and explore the mystery and magic  of this great plant.
I grew that chocolate tree from seed.
Such an amazing amount of learning  can come from growing plants.
You can learn more from a garden  many times then you can from a book.
"I was very, very excited to explore."
"Our porch served as a place to relax, for meals, nargilla, the dining room"
"Here are the stairs, here was the dormitory, two rooms, 30 guys- our first class."
This is where the Mechina began.
"We were told, ""There's a kindergarten about to be abandoned, not far away, just as the municipality promised us."
It wasn't clear if we were suppossed to get both classrooms or just one.
"In the end, the kindergarten emptied and we added caravans."
Here were the sports area and a mini obstacle course
Here was the climbing rope
"Everyone who came to the Mechina knew that by the end of the year, he'll reach the top of the rope."
"In the end, after 5 amazing years in Kiryat Malachi, the Mechina had to move on."
"We came here, to the Shafir area."
We had study partners at the local school.
They told me all the time to check out the Mechina program.
"I came thinking I'd be here for a week or two, and then move on to the army.."
I had no intention to stay..
I wanted to just go straight into the army without thinking too much.
"I didn't even think for a moment about life processes, yeshiva."
Not even for a moment.
"My thinking at the beginning of the year was to come to the Mechina, do my psychometric tests, and then immediately apply for the Atuda program, without any thoughts of staying"
I came to the Mechina
And I see great guys great Rabbis who love us for who we are.
You see the warmth here.
I saw that this Mechina is more special than the other Mechinot I saw.
Gili was a Platoon Commander in the Tank Corp.
They were called to go to Ramallah.
They asked Gili and his platoon to enter the junction in order to attract the gunfire away from the infantry.
This is what saved them.
They told him it was enough but he insisted on going in again.
One bullet penetrated the earpiece on his helmet and killed him.
"About a year after Gil was killed, a major donor of the Mechina, Sandy Kolb asked us if we would agree that the Beit Midrash be named after Gili."
This is how we got to know Rav Boaz and Naftali Kendler.
Their self-sacrifice is close in my heart to the self-sacrifice exhibited by Gil to his soldiers.
"And I would ask her, I would say,"
"""Man, why are you saying this?"
There are people that are listening in.
"I mean, I got 30, 40 thousand peopel listening to me at one time."
"You mean to tell me that there's nobody listening to the ideas I'm trying to convey and you know, things I'm trying to do,"" and, no."
"No, she said."
So...
"I mean, and now that all this--"
"It's not the first time this kind of shit has happened, so I kind of gotten closer to mywife because of that man."
"Even though she didn't believe what I was doing, she still stood by me."
"She still, you know, accepted the fact that I was in another room while she was attending to whatever she was attending to and it just puts life into perspective that I don't want to end up like"
"Bright Bart and all these other people that, they made small dents in an attempt to... to try to..."
"I guess, make some kind of change or expose some sort of contradiction or expose hypocracy, but I just want to live life, baby."
You know aht I mean?
"I just wanted to live life, that's all there is to it, man."
So... anyway.
"Open mic, not in my office."
I'm talking about when I was outside my office work.
"I'm talking about when I spent time in here, you know what I mean?"
"I've been spending a lot of time in the chatroom here outside of the show, you knwo what I'm saying?"
"So, I mean that's time away from my wife."
"I mean, look, you know, my traditional office hourse are my traditional office hours, but when I'm at home at, you know, 8, 9 PM, 3 AM, early in the morning,"
"I mean, you know... she's here, she's here now."
You know what I mean and you know she's...
"I just feel bad that I sat here and neglected her unconditional companionship and instead, being politcally, but not really political, but I guess romantic in another direction, you know aht I mean?"
"So, I think I'm gonna spend a lot more time with her, man, and not only that, my family, my family that I've discussed, you know what I mean?"
"So, in my personal opinion, it's over man."
There's nothing I can do.
"There's nothing I can do, I've done everything."
The world is the way it is.
"I've got a few years left, a few good years left,"
"I've got some pretty good years left in me, so might as well-- like I said,"
(Music) (Music)
"Oo, I've got wine coolers!"
"Over here, baby."
Oh!
I want a Zima!
Make sure everybody has Zimas!
"don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease"
I be in my house trying to think about what I'm gonna eat because I'm fuckin' starving and somebody knocks on my fucking door with his little dawg
"looking like ducks man they pissing me off cuz they knocking hard waking up my mother waking up my daughter now they got my exploding why the f*ck they knocking 8 o'clock in the morning that sh*t ain't funny so i walk to the door carrying a potato on the left hand carrying a potato nigga I'm trying to make burrito i know that's what you thinking get your mind right not your mind left don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease"
"As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion."
"And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century."
It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage.
"Now, I won't use mirrors, but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater."
So let the story begin.
"On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856."
"Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born."
"His name was Nikola,"
Nikola Tesla.
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
Let me show you.
"Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?"
Nikola Tesla:
"The result is 118,236."
Marco Tempest:
Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.
"When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind."
Tree.
Chair.
Girl.
"They were hallucinations, which vanished the moment he touched them."
Probably a form of synesthesia.
But it was something he later turned to his advantage.
Seo Jen (Jean) Lee:
I really enjoyed to be Support Leader.
It was great to have responsibility of taking care of Year 7s and be as a leader.
I loved it.
[Mitt Romney]
I'm not gonna let this battle be dictated by facts
I'm rich!
I've got fat stacks and super PACs
We all know what went down in that 2008 election
You're a decent politician with a winning complexion
"You're all Barack and no bite, been no change and we're all still hoping"
"That you'll shut your mouth, but like Guantanamo Bay they're both open"
"You're from the windy city, where you're looking pretty with your blowhards"
"But come January, you'll be left evicted and with no job"
Raw rhymes stronger than my jawline when I spit a phrase
Knocking you harder than front doors in my old mission days
"You see this silver spoon, this dug Mass out of debt"
It took you four years to drop unemployment down below 8%
You feel that Barry?
"You're old news, everyone's having doubts"
And your rhymes are as weak as this economy that you've done nothing about
Call me a vicious business man cause Romney's stealing this race
"I'll go Bain Capital on your donkey ass, restructure your face!"
[Barack Obama]
"They say your father was a great man, you must be what's left"
"Need to stop hatin' on gays, let 'em teach you how to dress"
"You've got the momma jeans, and a Mister Fantastic face"
So rich and white it's like I'm running against a cheesecake!
Republicans need a puppet and you fit
"Got their hands so far up your rear, call you Mitt!"
"I'm the head of state, you're like a head of cabbage"
'Bout to get smacked by my stimulus package

"Hi, I'm Robbie Shoepepper, and I am a student assistant here at the Alden Library Learning Commons."
"I provide services such as renting out laptops, renting out peripherals for your computer, and giving you you're key for your study room."
This is also a great place for your technology questions and troubleshooting.
I hope you come to the desk and have a nice day.
So far i have made a number of videos discussing Jehovah's Witnesses and their anti-blood doctrine.
And inevitably whenever i make one of these videos about blood Jehovah's Witness will challenge me and say something along the lines of
"Look Brian, we're just doing what the Bible plainly and clearly teaches."
It plainly says don't take blood.
"And if the Bible says don't take blood, we're not going to take blood."
It's as simple as that.
Now... what i like to do to challenge this overly simplistic reading of the scriptures.
"And i would like to start in Matthew chapter 5, starting in verse 27."
"We're Jesus says ""you have heard it said, do not commit adultery,"
"but i'll tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfuly has already committed adultery with her in his heart."""
"Jesus goes on and say ""if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and trow it away."""
So do you apply that overly simplistic reading of the scriptures to this verse in Mathew chapter 25?
if you would look at a woman lustfuly would you gauge your eye out and then you throw away? well i'm guessing that you as a Jehovah's Witness wouldn't do that because
i know a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses and i never met a single one who has only one eye.
"Now, it's interestant to me that you properly apply the rules of scripture interpretation"
"to this in Matthew chapter 5, but you offer this overly simplistic view"
"Our first speaker is Jack Miller from OlSE,"
"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, who has been involved for many years teaching holistic education and more recently,  mindfulness in particular."
"But let me just say, more complete  biographies of each our speakers, you will find it in your booklet."
"So, you can read that in your leisure time."
Here are some interesting things about them that are not necessarily  in their biographies.
Jack.
"(Jack Miller) Thank you Richard,  it is an honor to be here."
I believe this retreat  could have tremendous influence on education in North America.
"And I have worked in Ontario  for 40 years and this could also have huge impact  on this province, the education."
"So, thank you for coming."
We were asked to share a little bit  about personal story.
I am a child of the 1960s.
"As a young American, I was facing the dilemma of the Vietnam war."
"The more I read about that war, I felt  it was wrong for America to be involved."
So I had the choice when I was drafted that I went to Canada.
"The stress of that time, was when I began my spiritual practice."
"So, in 1969, I started doing yoga and I could feel the effects immediately."
"So I got interested in the philosophy  behind the yoga, and I started reading on Eastern thought."
"Then in 1974, I started  doing Vipassana meditation."
I have been doing those things since those years.
"When I was doing the meditation, one of the things about the experience of meditation is that you begin to experience interconnectedness which Thay calls interbeing."
You experience it at deeper level  than just intellectually.
So this is what eventually lead me to holistic education.
Because holistic education  is about interconnectedness.
"And unfortunately, our education system is very fragmented."
"We break things into courses, into pieces, into little bits of information."
"This basically causes suffering, this fragmentation."
"So, holistic education is an attempt  to have a curriculum that is connected."
So I wrote a book called The Holistic Curriculum which is about that.
"There is a school in Toronto, it is originally called Whole Child School now called the Equinox Holistic School."
We have some teachers here from that school.
I was delighted to run into Kyle.
So it's an open invitation.
"And, you know, when we—Cuba is accused of harboring terrorists."
"And when we look at the role of the United States and the United States government vis-à-vis Cuba, the United States government and the ClA have encouraged, trained, sent individuals to not only disrupt the Cuban economy by killing tourists, placing bombs in restaurants and hotels, but to assassinate Fidel Castro, and individuals who admitted that they were involved in the downing of a Cuban airliner in 1973."
I'm talking about Posada Carriles.
"Here was a man who made the open admission, trained by the ClA, harbored by the United States."
"When he was found in the United States, did the United States prosecute him for those crimes?"
No.
"They, on a pretext, prosecuted him for lying to the FBl, all right? and acquitted him of that."
AG:
"I wanted to go back to Assata Shakur when she was here, when she was imprisoned."
"This is a clip of a documentary, Eyes On the Rainbow:"
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"In this, Assata Shakur talks about her experience in prison."
AS:
"*Prisons are big business in the United States,*"
"*and the building, running and supplying of prisons has become the fastest-growing industry in the country.*"
"*Factories are moving into the prisons, and prisoners are forced to work for slave wages.*"
*This super-exploitation of human beings has meant the institutionalization of a new form of slavery.*
"*Those who cannot find work on the streets are forced to work in prison.*"""
AG:
That was Assata Shakur in the film Eyes On the Rainbow:
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"Lennox Hinds, you went to court to change the prison conditions that Assata Shakur was in after she was arrested."
Describe what happened to her after she was arrested.
"I mean, she was near death."
LH:
She was near death.
She was chained to her hospital bed.
"After she recovered, she was placed in an all-male prison."
She was under 24-hour surveillance by male prison guards who were watching and monitoring her very personal needs during that time period.
"We went into federal court and challenged the conditions of her confinement, where she was kept in solitary confinement for two years."
We won that case.
If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
Because why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules
That's somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
"I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford"
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
"If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead"
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
"Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall"
"Written on my tombstone should say ""Women, Weed, and Alcohol"""
That's somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
"I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford"
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life

Mini-Mobile Concerts project entails musicians who play on the streets
"We play not in a cafe or a certain space but on a street corner, next to a bus station, a train station..."
"The musicians in Egypt, or in Alexandria, are very talented and people would like to listen to them"
"However, the market does not give them the opportunity, people do not have access to them"
At the end there is a miss-communication happening
"What is happening on our streets is that they are full of noise full of headache, and full of harmful sights this makes us all agitated and impatient with each other we get angry at each other too we think we need music on the streets good music that can really reach our hearts to calm us"
"The project's idea began in 2011, and the first concert was hosted in April 2012"
"And we had 15 concerts during three months and we started again since January 2013 and the first concert was at the end of March and here we are now, and we plan to host 50 concerts"
"Independent musicians, or the musicians presenting an art that is not necessarily targeted but is unique and original to be known more because people like them and the idea is not that people don't like them but it is that people do not know this art exists we made a website www.eventsrun.com so that when people on the streets like this music they have a way to reach those musicians again because they don't know where these concerts take place or when they are hosted the idea from this website is to present the different events happening in each city so you can go on the site and see what is happening in Cairo on any giving day as an example and you can know the different spaces that have music so you can attend something similar to what you saw on the streets"
Hi guys!
Hi everyone!
I'm Jana
I'm Ju!
Jana:
So the time has come for us to talk about our favorites of the month!
August!
I tell it every time
"Now you're all here for eternity which I hardly need to tell you is a heck of a long time, so you'll all know each other pretty well by the end"
"But for now I'll have to split you up into groups, will you stop screaming? thank you"
"Now murderers? murderers over here please, thank you"
"Looters and pillagers over here, thieves if you could join them, and lawyers, you're in that one"
"Fornecators, if you step forward, by god there are a lot of you"
Can I just split you up into adulterers and the rest male adulterers if you could just form a line in front of that small gillotine in the corner
"The french, are you here?"
If you'd just like to come here with the germans
I'm sure you'll have plenty to talk about
Ateists
"Ateists over here please, you must be feeling a right bunch of nitwits"
And finally Christians
I'm afraid the jews were right
"Are there any questions? yes? no, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets"
"If you've read your Bible, you'I notice it was damnation without relief so if you didn't go before you came, I don't belive you'll enjoy yourself very much"
But I believe that's the idea
"OK, so it's over to you, Adolf, and I'll catch you all later at the BBQ, bye"
well this is a plane is this a UFO?
"This is my uncle, Charlie Rodriguez and that's his horse, Lucky."
My Uncle Charlie has won all-around cowboy at the Fortuna Rodeo more times than he can remember.
"In fact, he won three consecutive years in the 1990s."
"Charlie's won buckles for calf roping, calf branding, team roping, team penning, wild cow milking, and steer wrestling."
(music)
"Charlie was born into the vaquero tradition in Fort Davis, Texas."
This is a style of horsemanship based on respect and communication between horse and rider.
Now everyone knows that cattle were not indigenous to America.
"It is rumored that in 1521, a Spanish sea captain, Gregorio Villa Lobos, set sail for"
"Vera Cruz, Mexico, with six cows and a bull."
"Along with the introduction of the cow the Spanish also introduced Vaquero working skills, which were further developed in Mexico and became the foundation for the cattle ranching culture in Texas, which brings us to the place where Charlie got his start: the Kokernot 06 Ranch."
My grandfather worked for the 06 for 45 years.
He was the main boss.
This institute is made for special needs people
They teach them Quran and the Deen.
we are now in chechnya in one of the ultimate Quran institute
This institute was built in 1904 - very old institute but it was renovated recently [in the past few years]
The strange thing about this institute is that there's 100 student- from them are normal students who memorize theQuran and from them [around 25 students] are special needs
"Those who are deaf, unable to speak and unable to see. and from one of the beautiful examples in this institute is a young man who's Russian"
"He converted to Islam, and he has this great keenness in wanting to learn the Quran, Keep in mind he's blind yet he wants to learn the Quran, ofcourse through braille and wants to memorize it as well."
MashaAllah i heard that he learned how to read braille in a small period of time and learned how to read the Quran very well.. how long did it take him to learn it?
"To be honest, to learn the correct way so that you can prefect the reading.. it takes a long period of time"
But i learned the basic of braille [connecting the letters and words together] in 2 days.
"This is due to that fact that I already knew how to read braille in Russian language and English, so I didnt find difficulty in learning the Arabic one."
Okay but why do care so much about leanring
Why does he want to learn this fast and is trying to seek nearness to Allah?
I have always had a desire to learn the Language of the Quran so that I can read it
This is why I left university of Moscow and came here.
I Ask Allah to ease my way in seeking this knowledge for his sake.
Does he enjoy it?
"- Ofcourse, with no doubt."
- This is concidered his Jannah on Earth
- He has found the Jannah of This dunyah by learning this language for the sake of learning the Speech of Allah.
"Allahu Akbar, this is beautiful!"
"- As you've heard, he left his studies and family to come and learn the Quran"
I asked him do you enjoy what you do? he said:
"Indeed I found the Heaven of This Dunyah by Learning the Quran. by Allah, this is a beautiful answer."
I heard that this young man is a soccer player in the National Team of Russia?
Yes I do play soccer with the National team of Russia that's made especially for blind people and we won the European cup just recently in Portugal
"So not only is he focusing on learning how to read braille in arabic, but he's also working on Quran memorization and he still active in other ways, the likes of his favorite sports and such"
He has many goals mashaAllah.
But our request is for him to Read to us
Surat An'baa:
"""About what are they asking one another?"
About the great news..That over which they are in disagreement
I stared at white ceilings for good  eight years before the fMRI was developed.
"In the process of that, there was  no pain management in Toronto area."
And there was tremendous suffering in my body.
That one body could produce so much suffering was an amazing thing to me.
"You have a choice in that kind of suffering about whether you are going to stay alive, go mad or do something different with it."
So I decided that what I do  is to study about suffering.
I were a case of one and  I had lots of academic work that I could do every single minute of every day.
"So, rather than the fight-flight-faint kind of approach that people often have to stress,"
"I, in fact, step in with the stress,  held it as one that holds a child  or a brand new puppy. and started to look how it changed me and made me."
I appreciated every moment.
I was like a snail walking on a razor's edge.
Every single move hurt.
"When it finally got to the point that  scientists developed enough knowledge to know what is going on with me,  they asked me how I was injured, how I not going mad,  and I was able to say,"
"I am in the process of it,  studying suffering."
I took my pain and I tried  to shift it around a little bit.
"I use my mind inside myself to try and see whether there was a place  where there was no pain, whether there was an empty spot."
So I have to say that the practice of mindful meditation  came to me through a drunk driver.
And I am deeply appreciative for him  and all he has done.
"When I started walking again,  in my mid 30s, they asked me what is it  I wanted to do."
All I had was a tremendous degree in suffering.
(Laughter)
So I took that and  I went into Palliative Care.
There are some people here today  who remember my work in Palliative Care.
"I would speak about how the kind  of work that we do with the dying, which was pharma care, grief and  bereavement, was wholly inadequate."
That this is an experience in life that is so profound that we need to be able to work  with it differently.
So I started using mindfulness meditation in Palliative Care and got results that  are absolutely remarkable.
I became a teacher in Palliative Care.
"I am a theologian and a social worker but I work in Faculty of Medicine  and Faculty of Social Work, also Bio-Ethics in the Dalai Lama's  School of Public Health."
And I tried very hard to start  to bring changes in the system and we succeeded for a while.
"Then finally I left at the age of 55 and at about 6 weeks' mark into my retirement, the University of Toronto phoned and said, ""Would you come and teach mindfulness meditation course, just one or two courses?"""
"I thought I was kind of smart, I said, ""Yeah, I can do that with my eyes closed."""
"And he didn't get the joke, but I thought  I was being brilliant."
That's been mainly the kind of things that I've been able to see since having children.
"I love to go to carnival, because I'm really involved in that"
I love going to the pictures and I like to go and watch plays
"I have two grandsons and my daughter makes us go everywhere we go to the farm, we go everywhere that's cheap to the Science Museum, wherever we can get in for free."
"Because, she sits down and searches the internet like anthing to find events that are going on in London for free."
"As long as I can be entertained, I'm not really fussed."
I don't go to the pictures as much but I do prefer to watch a play especially young people that are not famous
"I like to go and watch things that I know other people's children are going to be in it, just to see how it is."
"I love sports, so anything to do with sports is for me so I spend most of my time trying to find out where the next football action is on or who is doing what in the parks, in cycling and so on."
"Hackney's great, in the summer time there's no borough in London I believe that can beat them"
"They have old fairs, book fairs, craft fairs, charity do's they're very organic, they have recycling stuff and so on."
"I'm looking forward to Spring, Summer coming on."
"That is one of the main things, free events,"
I went to the Science Museum the other day
I'm going to back through and try and look back at the stuff I went to.
"I did go out of Hackney recently to the fun fairs the old fashioned kind of Gerry Cottle circus, so that's what I've done with the little guy."
SARAH LEE:
"Our next speaker now, which is Jim Tucker."
"Jim is Head of Journalism down at Whitireia Journalism School, down in Wellington, and I had the pleasure of catching up with Jim"
"last week, and being shown around, and it's a very impressive, modern campus."
"So yes, without further ado, welcome, Jim."
[applause]
JlM TUCKER:
"Thanks very much, Sarah."
I've had to put the pencil through some of what I've written after hearing some of the things that Jane has said.
"For instance, I had this very well-founded theory that if you could reenact a suicide on a soap opera on television that that would have much more potential for harm than, my words here are, the second- and third-hand accounts of officials and those known to a suicide victim."
"But she's just proven that wrong, so that's been excised."
"Tēnā koe, George."
Thank you for your welcome.
I now acknowledge some of my colleagues from the media:
"John Roughan from the Herald down here,"
"Jonathan Marshall from Sunday News,"
"G can get to F in two steps, and that's an improvement because before the best we could get to F was 11 steps."
"Now, we can get to F in ten."
Can we get anywhere else new?
"No, cause the only nodes that are complete now are B and F, and they're already in the picture, and in fact, now we see that the fastest way to get to F is going to be in ten steps cause the only other way to get to F that we haven't considered is getting there through B, and that's going to be longer."
We can lock this down.
Alright!
"So, let's look at F."
"What edges are coming at F to uncompleted nodes, just this one to B."
That would have been F is ten steps plus one more would be 11 to get to B.
"That's an improvement over what we had before, and that's it for F."
"Now, the only node that we've got left to think about is B."
There's no way to get to be any faster than 11 cause there's no other place that we can go and then get to B.
"We can lock it down, and that finishes the picture."
We now know what the shortest distance is from A to === in the graph.
The distance to B is 11.
"Now, we've kind of lost a little bit of information of how we get to B in 11?"
"But, we'll deal with that in a little bit."
Good morning to everyone and above all to our guests.
"A warm "" thank you"" to Mrs Di Ture who represents the General Direction of our Education Department."
"I myself thank you because I don't have any merit for this event, I am only doing my work according to the general political and administrative lines of our Institute , which I consider more useful for our students."
"This activity was led by Mrs Calò and a starting group of Section A classes infact I think that this first step was made by our V A and to them, to these students our thanks must be given for what they have made and for what other students will be able to do on their example"
Let's look at multiplying binomials.
"For example, if we want to multiply (2x+5y) (3x-y), we could take this entire binomial here and distribute it to each of these two terms, which would give us (2x+5y) (3x) + (2x+5y) (-y)."
"And again, we can distribute this 3x to these two terms, as well as the -y to these two terms, which gives us (2x) (3x) + (5y) (3x) + (2x) (-y) + (5y) (-y) = 6x^2 + 15yx - 2xy - 5y^2."
"And now, 15yx and -2xy are like terms because yx and xy are equal by commutativity."
"So we can combine them, which gives us our answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"Now, this type of multiplication comes up often and there is an acronym used to describe it."
And the acronym is FOlL.
"The F in FOlL stands for First, which means we multiply the first terms in each binomial."
"So, a * c."
"The O stands for Outer, which means we multiply the outer terms in the two binomials, so a * d."
"The I stands for Inner, which means we multiply the inner terms of the two binomials, so b * c."
"And died a week after,  because of a respiratory arrest."
"You can imagine that  the TEDx event, last year, was like a limbo to me."
I went on autopilot.
"I have mental images of that day, but actually I have no emotional  recollection of what happened."
There was one person in charge of filming  everything that went on that day and creating a video with  the highlights of the event.
"For some reason, it took him a whole  year to deliver this video and... as we were getting close  to the first anniversary my idea was to dedicate  this video to my Mom."
But the video was no good.
It did not convey any message.
"It had been done in a hurry -- it felt like a mere mix  of random scenes from that day, and -- did nothing to communicate what  the event was really all about."
"It wasn't that the person who did it  lacked the talent,"
-- he had plenty --  The thing was that he didn't put enough effort  in the making.
It hadn't been done the way
"I like things to be done,  wholeheartedly."
"And so, I could not dedicate  the video to my Mom."
"And what really caught  my attention from all this, was that the editor  took offense for my remarks."
Which got me thinking:
"What is to get offended if not a way to hide from  our own vulnerabilities, to avoid what we  don't want to hear?"
And do so to avoid what  we do not want to hear and to find excuses not to do  things the way we should.
So that's why I'm here  today talking to you:
Because I could not dedicate  that video to her.
And I decided to dedicate  this talk to her.
But it' turns out that this talk  was close to never happen.
"Three weeks ago, an oil spill in General Paz Avenue, almost got me to meet  my Mom right away -- (Laughter)"
"But thanks to a guardrail  that decided not to give in and spared me a twenty meter fall y a que por una enorme casualidad en la General Paz and the unlikely miracle  of finding no other car in 100 meter radius [330 feet], at the time of the crash, is that I'm now standing  here with you."
This talk that might have been about a great idea of a project I intended  to develop in Rosario became what it is right now.
Because I realized that I could've left  this world with a lot of unsaid stuff.
"For instance,  I wanted to tell that this year I was visited  by three women."
"Firstly, to remind me  that everything I do has to be done wholeheartedly."
"Secondly, to show me  the importance of being vulnerable  in front of other people, and the intimate relation  between vulnerability and doing things wholeheartedly."
"The third person, who apart  from all of you now, was the only one on Earth  who had heard me speak about my feelings, taught me that in order to do things right  I must learn to trust."
Trust in my own sensitivity.
"Trust others, who are dealing  with issues and fears of their own."
You are not alone.
I will be with you.
"Then, Jesus's commandment is:"
"""Go and make disciples."""
"So, Jesus has disciples."
Jesus wants christians.
"And so, the confusion in this verse,"
"I can't talk about the whole book, but at least in this verse, the confusion is there."
"""I do not wish to make you christians."""
Because Jesus WANTS people to become christians.
"A christian, a disciple, a disciple of Jesus."
"""Polak's Question:"
"Round 3"""
Earlier at the UN COmmission on Narcotic Drugs
"In 2008 Vlenna, Frederick Polak, a Dutch psychiatrist asked Antonio Maria Costa, HEAD of UNODC a simple question:"
"How does Costa explain the fact that the cannabis consumption levels are not higher in the Netherlands than in the neighboring countries, although in the Netherlands cannabis is available for consumption by adults?"
"Costa silenced his ""NGO Partner."""
"Embarrassed by our video, he decided to make his first official visit . . ."
"Mr. Polak asked Mr. Costa again at the International Harm Reduction Conference in Barcelona on May 15, 2008."
Good morning.
"Fredrick Polak, psychiatrist from Amsterdam, well, this is a continuation on the question I already posed, which I will very shortly repeat, the relationship between the availability of cannabis in the Netherlands, and the relatively low or average level of use, which in my view is contrary to the theory of prohibition."
"But now I would like to ask Mr. Costa, we heard that you made a visit to Holland and you visited a coffee shop and a consumer room, and I would like to ask you, what did you learn in Holland, and what are your impressions?"
Regarding Mr. Polak's sort of a continuing of questioning on the relationship between availability in Holland and high Availability of what? level of use.
"Availability of drugs, and the level, availability of alcohol and the level, availability of tobacco and the level."
I'm surprised Mr. Polak there is no focus as well on tobacco and alcohol.
"Here is the thing, for a number of reasons"
I am getting close to the Netherlands emotionally and culturally and many other reasons a country that I respect
"I decided in order to address the errors as scientifically as we could possibly do,"
"I decided to travel in a study mission to Amsterdam, the core if you wish of initiatives which are obviously quite problematic,"
"like the coffee shops, or for that matter the sex windows, where women are exposed in big windows at street level."
I decided to go there.
"It was a very interesting session, a couple of weeks ago,"
Okay.
"So the war is a real presence, even on the college campus: drilling students, fighting men, guns stored in the Yale library, people having a hard time getting food and supplies."
1779 is when things become much worse because that is the peak year of violence in New Haven; that is the year when the
British invaded New Haven.
"And Ezra Stiles, who was President of Yale at the time, noted in his diary the events as they unfolded-- and again, it's really interesting to see his diary entries."
"He later wrote another account that had full sentences, but to me what was more interesting-- and I'll read some of them here--were some of his diary entries because they're really immediate, and he's kind of recording his reaction to events as they're happening."
"So on July 4,1779, he says he heard news that there was a British fleet of ships that had been seen near"
"Bridgeport, and supposedly rumor said it was heading to New Haven."
"So again, being the responsible president of Yale, he asks for militia to be sent."
"In case this is actually true, they're going to need some real soldiers, but he writes in his diary:"
"""Would not believe the enemy intended landing."""
Okay.
He hears the rumor and he takes action but he actually literally cannot believe that the British are actually going to get off the ships and attack.
That can't be real; can't be really happening.
"The next day, July 5, Stiles, using a telescope, says that he ""saw the ships distinctly from the steeple of College Chapel"" and, he continues,"
"""Began to remove all property...."
Militia meeting.
Tories calm.
"With telescope from the tower or steeple clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little after sunrise."""
"He sees the smaller boats going off of these ships, with soldiers, to land on the shore."
"""Immediately, I sent off College records and papers ... and a bag of my own things,"" sent his family away."
"The next day, July 6, Stiles writes:"
"""Enemy paraded."
"Sailors came on shore and took their turn at plunder."""
"I'm going to continue a couple days here and then go back to the actual invasion, just because the series of things he writes here are interesting and they become weirdly personal, which again reminds me that this is a real person's experience."
He says:
"July 7,11 o'clock p.m., ""enemy landed and burnt Fairfield."""
"July 8, ""Removing my furniture""-- (he's now moving his furniture out of Yale) --"
"""Removing my furniture broke my Fahrenheit Thermometer which I have had since 1762."""
[laughter]
"I was like: oh, okay, I feel sorry you're moving your furniture and he broke his thermometer."
"July 12, ""the whole town moving,"" and then July 23 this little, tiny reminder that Yale is still an institution that exists."
"Những vụ trụ nảy lại sinh ra những vũ trụ khác nơi mà có thể có 1 bản copy chính xác của hệ mặt trời ,trái đất ,hay thậm chí của mỗi người trong chúng ta nơi mọi thứ cực kỳ giống nhau hoặc có 1 chút khác biệt nhưng những vũ trụ khác ở đâu vậy ? tại sao chúng ta không thể nhìn thấy chúng ?"
Bởi vì chúng ta ở 1 chiều không gian khác
Liệu đó có phải là sự thật ? nếu có các chiều không gian khác về hình dạng và kích thước cuộc thử nghiệm này sẽ tìm ra chúng câu hỏi không phải liệu chúng có tồn tại hay không mà là chúng có 1 2 3 hay 4 kiểu khác nhau
This sensationally means the universe sits in a sea of parallel universes.
"Imagine another world, a whole other universe... with a solar system and a planet exactly like ours."
"On this parallel Earth, there lives an exact copy of you."
You could be leading exactly the same life... but in another universe.
"Now, imagine an entirely separate universe... where you could be living a slightly different life... at the same time as you live this life."
"It may seem fantastic, incredible, and impossible... but there could be many other universes out there."
And now some of the world's leading physicists... believe that they have evidence to prove it.
We are experiencing an existential shock.
"Our worldview has been shattered... with the realization that, yes, there could be parallel universes."
"I mean, it's just a mind-boggling idea... that there may be, essentially... exact replicas of us out there in the vastness of space."
The idea of a parallel universe is part of our popular culture.
People all around us think of it every day... but usually in terms of fiction.
One of the real exciting things... is that scientists today are trying to see... whether parallel universes are a physical reality.
Amazing new discoveries about the true size of the universe... seem to indicate that all that we see... is not all that there is.
We humans have assumed...
"like ostriches with our heads in the sand... that just because we can't see something, it ain't there."
"When my grandma was a little girl, for instance... they still didn't know that there were other galaxies."
Now we know that there are... billions and billions of other galaxies out there.
"Remarkably, there may be four types of parallel universe out there."
"One kind could exist in the same exact space we're in... but it is so far away, we cannot see it or reach it."
"In another scenario, multiple other universes... could be in giant cosmic soap bubbles... adrift in a cosmic sea of giant bubbles."
Revolutionary developments have changed the entire landscape.
Data from outer space have given us a new look at cosmology... and satellite data indicates there could be parallel universes.
"In yet another scenario, many parallel universes... occupy the same space and time as our universe... but because they are in different dimensions... they are invisible."
"In yet another, all the laws of physics are different... so everything looks completely different."
New theories called string theories... are giving us worlds of higher dimensions.
Quantum physics at the microscopic scale... is also revealing to us the fact there could be parallel universes.
"To keep things simple, physicists have divided parallel universes... into different levels."
Meet the level-one parallel universe.
5 times F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is the same thing as 5 times m0.
Draw a line here.
So we have a new relationship.
5m0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
"All I did is I substituted this for this, or this for that."
"And I used this relationship, which we got in the beginning to do that."
And now what do we have?
We have 5 m sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
We could subtract m0 from both sides.
You get 4 m0 is equal to m1.
You could divide both sides by m0 and you got 4 is equal to m1 over m0.
And you could invert this relationship and you can get m0 over m sub 1 is equal to 1/4.
So what we learned is the ratio of the old mass to the new mass is 1 to 4.
And that's a problem.
"And actually, I will leave it for you as an exercise to figure out-- to just do the same problem using the numbers."
"I will do that actually, in the next video just to show you that that actually would've been a simpler way to do it."
But it's good to get used to this just so you can solve things in general terms.
I'll see you in the next video.
Brad Penney:
More on Steve and the Race to The Top Initiative that he will be talking about when Steve formally joins the Webinar and is introduced.
"And I'm also very pleased that my colleagues Arley Johnson, Director of Government Relations here at NASCSP, and Mark Schmeissing, who is the acting"
"Research Director for CSBG, will be giving presentations, and we are also going to be hearing from Bob Scott and others who are on the line as resources."
Bob is the Energy Services Director and a great resource on all things weatherization.
"So, with that we'll get into the content of the webinar, and as everyone knows, the President did submit the $3.8 Trillion budget last week for FY ""14."
"That represents about a 1% cut adjusted for inflation over the preceding year budget, and it was submitted two months late because of all of the difficulties which we will get into later in the webinar with the Continuing Resolution, the personnel changes at OMB, uncertainty over the debt ceiling and how other changes would factor in, that's the reason that it was two months late."
"The good thing from the standpoint of the Department of Energy, just to begin to deal with weatherization issues first, is the DOE did receive a very healthy increase of 8% over the Fiscal Year ""12 ask, and the increase, if it's enacted, will bring the Department of Energy Budget up to $28.4 billion."
"So that would be a reflection of the President's commitment to clean energy, and we regard that as a very, very positive sign in terms of the President's priorities."
Please go to the next slide.
"So hopefully you're looking at a slide that says ""What Do the Numbers Mean for the Weatherization Program""."
"And as I said there is an 8% increase in the Department of Energy Budget in the 2014 ask and for the energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is where weatherization resides in the budget."
"A 62% proposed increase taking the EERE budget up to $2.8 billion if this is enacted for Fiscal Year ""14, which will start on October 1 of this year."
"Among the big winners: building technologies, advanced manufacturing, and clean vehicles."

"Antiphon was an Ancient Greek philosopher, who lived in the 5th century BC. He is also known as Antiphon of Athens or Antiphon the Sophist, in English. His identity is not known. At the end of the 5th century, there were many people named ""Antiphon"" in Athens: There was a person that was writer, orator, and politician,called Antiphon the Orator. People do not agree if this was the same person as the philosopher. There was also a poet writing tragedies, a fortune-teller, and a person helping people make sense of their dreams. All of them were called Antiphon."
Three works are attributed to Antiphon the Sophist
Antiphon was also a mathematician: By inscribing polygons on a circle he was able to give an upper and lower limit for the value of Pi.This was later used when people tried to square the circle.

...Baby One More Time (song)
"""...Baby One More Time"" is the first single for Britney Spears released off her first album as its first single. It went to number one on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. The video was memorable for Spears being dressed in a schoolgirl uniform."

Gimme More
"""Gimme More"" is a song from Britney Spears' album ""Blackout"". The song was released in late 2007. It was her comeback single after a few years out of the music business because of her personal problems. It hit the top 10 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100.

The song was first performed at the 2007 VMA awards; a performance heavily criticized by the media comparing it to Spears' standards in previous ceremonies. It was also performed during the Femme Fatale tour in an Egypt-style remix in 2011 as well as in Vegas Residency in 2013.

Dimensional analysis
"Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis."
"Any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide ""miles"" by ""gallons"", which gives the unit ""miles/gallon"" or ""miles per gallon"". The final answer is ""25 miles per gallon""."
"Looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters, use the equation ""1609.34 meters equals one mile"" or 1609.34 meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles × meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters."

Battle of Ortona
"The Battle of Ortona was a small, very violent battle fought between German and Canadian troops. It was fought on December 20–28, 1943. It was part of World War II."
"The battalion of German paratroops were from the German 1st Parachute Division under ""Generalleutnant"" Richard Heidrich. The Canadian forces were from the 1st Canadian Infantry Division under Major General Chris Vokes."
"It was part of the fighting on the Adriatic area in Italy. The battle has been called ""Little Stalingrad"" because of the violent, close fighting. The battle took place in the Adriatic Sea town of Ortona, with a population of 10,000."
Background.
"The Eighth Army's attack on the Winter Line defences started on 23 November. By the end of the month, Allied troops broke through the Gustav Line defences. The Allied troops were fighting towards the Moro river, near Ortona."
Ortona was one of Italy's few deep water ports on the east coast. The Allies wanted to capture the port. The Germans had constructed a series of defensive positions in the town.
The battle.
The Canadians had to battle the German 1st Parachute Division. These soldiers were experienced after many years of war. Adolf Hitler ordered them to defend Ortona.
The Canadian attack on the town was on December 20. The Germans had hidden machine guns and anti-tank guns in the town. This made it hard for Canadian tanks and infantry to move. The fighting was very violent. The soldiers fought for every house.
"After six days fighting, 2nd Brigade's third battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, joined the battle. Tanks from 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade also joined the battle."
"On 28 December, after eight days of fighting, the Germans withdrew from the town. The Canadians had 1,375 dead."
Battle of Anzio
"The Battle of Anzio, which is also called Operation Shingle (January 22, 1944) was an Allied sea landing in the Italian Campaign against German forces of Anzio and Nettuno, Italy."
The attack was commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas. He wanted to get around German forces on the Winter Line. Then he wanted to attack Rome. Making a sea landing in a marshland needed to be done quickly.
The landing surprised the Germans. The Allies even got near Rome. The Allies got their men ready on the beach. The German commander in the Put his guns around the beach. The Germans also flooded the marsh with salt water.
"After a month of heavy fighting,"
the Allies finally got past the beaches in May. The Allies went north-west to Rome which was captured on 4 June.
The German Tenth Army at Cassino were able to go north of Rome. Then they got ready to defend the Gothic Line.
Background.
"At the end of 1943, following the Allied invasion of Italy, Allied forces were stuck at the Gustav Line. Thid was defensive line across Italy. The land of central Italy helped the defence."
Operation Shingle was planned by Winston Churchill in December 1943. He planned to land two divisions at Anzio and capture Rome.
"General Harold Alexander had thought of a plan using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have enough troops or a way to transport them."
"The Anzio and Nettuno beaches are on marshland. When Truscott's 3rd Division was selected for the attack, he said everyone would die. Lucas was told lead the Fifth Army's U.S. VI Corps in a landing in the Anzio/Nettuno area."
Plan.
"Planners thought that if German forces left the Gustav Line to defend against the Allied attack, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line. If troops were left on the Gustav Line, then the Allies could try to capture Rome."
"The Allies planned to attack from the south. They wanted to capture a beach near Anzio, move forward, and be ready to go to Rome."
Availability of naval forces.
One of the problems with the plan was there was mot enough landing ships.
"Only enough tank landing ships (LSTs) to land a single division were available. Later, Churchill made sure enough were available to land two divisions."
Order of battle.
"Australasia's region is Oceania. It includes Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean."

Nevertheless before the Second World War the SAK 1914 was the most successful football club in Salzburg. 1934, 1935 and 1937 they reached the final of the Austrian amateur championship but could not win. Edi Kainberger, Karl Kainberger, Ernst Bacher and Adolf Laudon, players of SAK, were part of the 1936 Olympic squad, where Austria reached the second place. At all they reached 3o Championships in Salzburg."
After the war other clubs like SV Austria Salzburg ( now Red Bull Salzburg) or SK Bischofshofen were more successful but the SAK was the first team from Salzburg which reached the highest class (1952-Staatsliga A). Also in the 1961/62 and 1980/81 season they played in the highest division. All together the SAK played nine seasons in the professional leagues. But 1988 they were relegated from the 2.Division and playing ever since that time in amateur leagues.
"The 2007/08 season was the last in their venue, the SAK Sportanlage Nonntal. It was renovated and was now called Sportzentrum Mitte. The SAK must play together with the UFC Salzburg at this pitch."

In the 16th and 17th centuries, they began to trade with the Baltic Countries. Dysart got two nicknames: ""Salt Burgh"" and ""Little Holland""."
"When the coal mine, the Lady Blanche Pit, closed suddenly use of the harbour almost stopped. The town was joined with the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1930. Large parts of the historic town were pulled down in the 1950s and 1960's for new housing. People living in the town were able to protect some areas, most notably the 16th century and the 18th century houses of Pan Ha' opposite the harbour. These have been repaired and preserved for future generations. Today, Dysart retains an individual character within the boundary borders of neighbouring Kirkcaldy."

History.
Early history.
Mandalay was started by King Mindon. He started the city on 13 February 1857. He built Mandalay as the new capital city of the Kingdom of Burma.
Mindon's city was in size. There were rivers on each side. It had 144 square blocks in a grid. In the middle was a palace that was 16 square blocks in size.
The palace had four walls that were each long. Around the walls was a moat that was wide and deep. Each wall had turrets (towers) for watchmen. These turrets were placed every . Each turret had a spire made of gold. Each side had three gates and five bridges across the moat.
"The king also built some other buildings in the city. These buildings were the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the ""Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein"" upasampada hall, the ""Thudamma"" ""Good Dharma"" zayats (), and a library for the Pāli Canon. A ""zayat"" is a building where Buddhism is taught."
"In June 1857, the king moved the royal palace to Mandalay. The palace had been in Amarapura. The building was taken apart. Each piece was moved by elephants to Mandalay. The palace was put back together and finished on 23 May 1859. The palace is now at the bottom of Mandalay Hill."
"Mandalay was the capital for 26 years. It was the last royal capital of the Konbaung Dynasty. (The Konbaung Dynasty were the last rulers of the Kingdom of Burma before it was taken over by the British Empire.) On 28 November 1885, the British conquered Burma. This ended the Third Anglo-Burmese War. King Thibaw Min and Queen Supayalat were sent into exile."
Mandalay in British Burma (1885-1948).
Mandalay was still an important city in British Burma. The city of Rangoon became the capital of Burma.
"The British wanted to make Mandalay an important commercial city. They did not want it to be important for politics, education, or other reasons. Mandalay was connected to Yangon by railroad in 1889. The first college in Mandalay wasn't built until 1925."
The royal palace was looted by the British. All of the treasures were stolen. Some treasures can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The British changed the name of the palace to Fort Dufferin. British soldiers used the palace as a barracks (a place to camp.)
"Mandalay was the most important city for Burmese culture during the time the British were in charge. It was also the most important place for Buddhist learning. The Burmese people saw Mandalay as a symbol. Between World War I and World War II, there were many protests in Mandalay against the British."
"During the time the British were in charge, many people moved to Mandalay from India. (India was also a British colony.) From 1904 to 1905, a plague happened. About one third of the people of Mandalay left to get away from the disease."
"During World War II, Mandalay was bombed by the Japanese. The British moved all of their airplanes to India. Mandalay had no defenses against the Japanese air raids. On 3 April 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed the city. Three-fifths (3/5) of the houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 civilians (people who are not military) were killed."
The Japanese soon invaded Burma. The Imperial Japanese Army took over the city of Mandalay. They were in charge from May 1942 until March 1945. The palace citadel was made into a supply depot. (A supply depot is a building that stores supplies like food and machines.)
The Allied forces bombed the city after the Japanese took it over. Much of the palace was destroyed. Only the royal mint and watch tower were not destroyed. The palace was rebuild in the 1990s.
Mandalay today (1948 - now).
"In 1948, the British left Burma. Mandalay was still the most important city for culture, education, and commerce in Upper Burma."
"Until the 1990s, most students went to university in Mandalay. Until 1991, there were only three universities in Upper Burma: Mandalay University, The University of Medicine, Mandalay, and the Defense Services Academy. All of these universities are in Mandalay. Only some other cities had schools called ""Degree Colleges."" These were small schools that were part of Mandalay University. These colleges had classes in a small number of subjects."
"From 1962 to 1988, Ne Win was in charge of the government. He was very isolationist. This means that he did not want Myanmar to be part of global trade or tourism. In the 1980s, Mandalay was the second biggest city in Myanmar. It looked like a town with low buildings, dusty streets, and more bicycles than cars."
"During the 1980s, there were two big fires. In May 1981, a fire destroyed more than 6,000 buildings. 36,000 people were left homeless. On 24 March 1984, there was another fire. This fire destroyed 2,700 buildings. 23,000 more people were made homeless."
"Fires are still a big problem. In February 2008, there was another big fire in Mandalay. It destroyed the Yadanabon Market. This was the second-biggest market in the city. In February 2009, a fire destroyed 320 houses. More than 1,600 people were made homeless."
"The fires during the 1980s destroyed a lot of buildings. This made a lot of land empty. Many Chinese people in Burma bought this land. A lot of these people had come from Yunnan in China. Many Chinese people came to Upper Burma and Mandalay from Yunnan and Sichuan in the 1990s. 250,000 to 350,000 people from Yunnan came to Mandalay in the 1990s. Today, about 30% to 40% of the people of Mandalay are Chinese. The native Burmese people complain that Mandalay is now like a part of China."
"The Chinese have rebuilt the parts of the city that burned down. They built apartment buildings, hotels, and shopping centers. They helped make Mandalay again an important city for trade and commerce. It now connects trade for Upper Burma, Lower Burma, China, and India."
Mandalay has grown much bigger over time. It now includes what used to be Amarapura. (Amarapura was where King Mindon's capital city used to be before he moved it to Mandalay.) Mandalay celebrated its 150th birthday on 15 May 2009 at 4:31:36 am.
Important places.

Areas.
"Magic Kingdom is divided into six areas. Most of them are called ""lands"". The lands are Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. The other areas are Main Street, U.S.A. and Liberty Square."
"Main Street, U.S.A.."
"Main Sreet, U.S.A. is the first area guests enter after going through the gates. It was built to look like a typical street in the United States. The buildings use forced perspective to make the street look longer than it really is and Cinderella Castle look taller. That means the buildings closer to the viewer are taller than the buildings farther away."
The street is lined with shops and restaurants. The windows of the buildings have the names of people who worked for the Walt Disney Company on them.
Adventureland.
"Adventureland is themed around exploring unknown lands, like jungles and islands. Rides and shows in this area are the Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management), the Jungle Cruise, and Pirates of the Caribbean, among others."

"Archaeothyris was the earliest definite synapsid. It lived in the late Carboniferous period, 306 million years ago."
"It was found in Nova Scotia, at the same locality as ""Hylonomus"", and ""Petrolacosaurus"", which are similar to ""Archaeothyris"", but probably sauropsids."
"""Protoclepsydrops"" is slightly older, but its status as a synapsid is unclear as the remains are more fragmentary."
Systematics.
"""Archaeothyris"" belonged to a group of early pelycosaurs that evolved early in the Pennsylvanian. It is thus seen as the precursor of all synapsids (which include mammals)."
Appearance and lifestyle.
"American bombers dropped 1,400 tons of bombs onto the Cassino Abbey."
"German paratroopers went into the abbey's ruins. Between 17 January and 18 May, Monte Cassino and the Gustav defences were attacked four times by Allied troops. The German defenders were finally driven from their positions, but with many losses for the Allies."
Background.
The Allied landings in Italy in September 1943 were followed by an advance north in two parts. An advance was made on each side of the mountain range in the middle of Italy.
"On the western side, U.S. Fifth Army moved from Naples. In the east General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army moved up the Adriatic coast."
The Fifth Army made slow progress because of difficult land and German defences. The Germans were protected in positions. The original plans that Rome would be captured by October 1943 did not occur.
"Although in the east the Ortona was captured, the advance stopped in December because of snow. Going to Rome from the east was not possible. Highway 6 ran through the Liri valley. The south entrance to this valley was Cassino. It was an important part of Gustav Line, the strongest defensive positions in the Winter Line."
"Because the old Benedictine Abbey was important to history, German units did not put defensive positions in the Abbey."
Some Allied aircraft saw German troops in the Abbey. The Abbey looked over the valley. This made it a good place for German artillery observers. This made Allied commanders want to bomb the Abbey.
First battle.
Plans and preparation.
"The plan of U.S. Fifth Army commander General Clark was for British X Corps to attack on January 17, 1944. The British 46th Infantry Division was to attack on January 19. This would support the main attack by U.S. II Corps on their right."
The main central attack by U.S. II Corps would start on January 20. The 36th (Texas) U.S. Infantry Division would cross a river five miles from Cassino. The French Expeditionary Corps would move towards Monte Cairo.
"Fifth Army had only reached the Gustav line on January 15, having taken six weeks and getting 16,000 casualties."
Attack.
"The first attack was made on January 17. Near the coast, British X Corps crossed the Garigliano. General von Senger, commander of German XIV Panzer Corps did not think he could stop the attack. He asked for more troops. The 29th and 90th Panzer Grenadier Divisions were sent to him. X Corps had 4,000 casualties during the first battle."
"The central attack by U.S. started on January 20. They were attacked by General Eberhard Rodt's 15th Panzer Grenadier Division. The attack was a failure, with 36th Division losing 2,100 men killed, wounded and missing in 48 hours."
The next attack was on January 24. The U.S. II Corps attacked across the
Rapido valley north of Cassino. The 34th Division pushed back General Franek's 44th Infantry Division.
"On the right, the Moroccan-French troops made good initial progress against the Germans. The two Moroccan-French divisions had 2,500 casualties in their battles around Monte Belvedere."
"The U.S. 34th Division had to fight southward. By early February, American infantry had captured point less than a mile from the abbey. By February 7 a battalion had reached a hill below the Abbey. Attempts to capture Monte Cassino were stopped by machine gun fire from the slopes."
Afterwards.
"On February 11, after a 3-day attack on Monastery Hill and Cassino town, the Americans pulled back. U.S. II Corps was tired after two and a half weeks of fighting. They lost 80% in the Infantry battalions, about 2,200 casualties."
Second battle.
"This was called Operation Avenger. With U.S. VI Corps under threat at Anzio, Freyberg asked to help at Cassini. Freyberg thought there was only a 50% chance of success for the attack."
Destruction of the abbey.
"Allied officers started to think the Germans were using the abbey of Monte Cassino as an artillery observation point. The Allies thought of bombing with ""blockbuster"" bombs."
"The bombing in the morning of February 15, 1944 involved 142 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses heavy bombers followed by 47 North American B-25 Mitchell and 40 Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. They dropped 1,150 tons of bombs on the abbey. This turned it into rubble. II Corps artillery shelled the mountain. The German positions above and behind the monastery were untouched."
After the bombing.
Pope Pius XII said nothing after the bombing. Cardinal Secretary of State called the bombing “stupidity.”
It is now known that the Germans had agreed not to use the Abbey for military purposes.
"Following its destruction, paratroopers of the German 1st Parachute Division occupied the ruins of the abbey. They turned it into a fortress and observation post."

History.
"According to Klimt's website, Bloch-Bauer was his mistress. She is also the only woman he ever painted twice. Adele's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, hired Klimt to paint both paintings. Klimt painted ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II"" in 1912. Some artists also think Adele Bloch-Bauer might be the woman in ""The Kiss"" and ""Judith and the Head of Holofernes""."
"Before Adele Bloch-Bauer died, she said she wanted the painting to go to the Belvedere Gallery. But, at the time, the painting belonged to her husband and not to her."
"During World War II, the Nazis stole the painting from Bloch-Bauer's family. It did end up in the Belvedere Gallery."
"One of the reasons this painting is famous is that it was in a United States Supreme Court case, ""Republic of Austria v. Altmann"", in 2004. Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann, tried to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. The Supreme Court said the painting was Altmann's. Because Aultmann could not pay for insurance and storage, she sold the painting to Ronald Lauder to put in the Neue Gallery in New York City."
In popular culture.
"The 2015 movie ""Woman in Gold"" is about Maria Altmann trying to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery."

User Datagram Protocol
"The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a core member of the Internet Protocol Suite, the set of network protocols used for the Internet. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, known as ""datagrams"", to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in ."
Ports.
"UDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response."
"Ports 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named ""well-known"" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access."
"Ports 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports."
"Ports 49,152 through 65,535 (0xFFFF) are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers."
Uses.
"There are many uses for UDP, for example BitTorrent optionally uses it for peer-to-peer file sharing. The Teredo tunneling protocol uses UDP."

History.
"Hamilton Hume and William Hovell were the first Europeans in to visit the area on their way back to Sydney in 1825. They described it as ""rough and difficult country."""
Gold rush.
Adelong was settled between 1840 and 1850. Gold was discovered at Adelong by a William Williams in 1857. The gold was on the top of Victoria Hill and was part of the Old Hill Reef. Alluvial gold was found in both Adelong Creek and Golden Gully in the same year. Adelong quickly became an important goldfield. Adelong Post Office opened on 1 January 1859.
"By 1859 a number of gold reefs were being mined, including the Old Reef and the Great Victoria Mine. Between 1859 and 1876, 3,798 kilograms of gold was mined. During the gold rush the population grew to more than 30,000 people. Over 25 tonnes of gold was mined from 1857 to the close of the mines in 1914. The National Trust of Australia has listed the main street of Adelong and a number of buildings as being important historical places."
A number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area. Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways.
"During the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines. Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery. The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s. One or two old Chinese and Indian people still lived in Adelong in the 1950s. A small town, Cornishtown, was about a mile west of Adelong till the 1940s."

Homology (mathematics)
"In mathematics, homology is a certain procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules with a mathematical object, such as a topological space or a group. The word homology has the Ancient Greek root ""homos"", which means ""identical""."
"For a topological space, the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups, and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces."
"The original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their ""holes"". Since a ""hole"" is defined by something that is ""not there"", this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is, and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes. Homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape. As it turns out, there are some kinds of holes that homology cannot ""see"" — in which case homotopy groups may be what is needed."

The incarnation is the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second person of the triune God; took on a human body and everything that is human and became both man and God.

The Holy Spirit is described in many situations, but the most commonly known one is the tongues of fire that rest upon Jesus' 12 disciples' heads and it empowers them to speak different languages and preach the good news of Jesus the Christ. His teachings and way of life allow us to find peace and harmony and help others in need. By doing as he taught us, we can become better people and show God's love through us mortal beings."
"In the Incarnation, normally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus Christ, who was both ""truly God and truly man"".

History.
"""Hanji""’s history goes back to 4th century. Koreans started making it after papermaking technique came to Korea from China with Buddhism. After since, Korean paper came to be known as the highest quality paper available in East Asia. During Goryeo period, ""hanji"" flourished with the development of printing technique in Korea.

More people are interested in arts and crafts of ""hanji"", and there it has become the part of the tourism for foreigners, too."
Characteristic.
"""Hanji"" is made out of inner bark of mulberry, a tree native to Korea. The inner bark of the mulberry is so strong and durable that it does not decay in water up to a year. Korean paper’s durability comes from this tree. The life span of Korean paper is 1,000 years. For example, ""Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong,"" the world's oldest woodblock print was created in 751. Also, thanks to its durability, Koreans even used it as body armor in war. 1 year old trees are used to make the high-quality ""hanji"", and older trees are used for cheaper modern papers."
Usage.
"There are several kinds of mulberry trees in Korea. They grow in different climate conditions. Each kind of mulberry tree produces different kinds of hanji, and they are all used in a different way. There are various kinds of Korean paper, and they are named after their usage. ""Changhoji"", for instance, is a kind of Korean paper. ""Changhoji"" means window paper. Koreans used to glue ""changhoji"" on a door because it allows both air and light through it, thanks to its wide fiber. There are other kinds of ""hanji"" as well. When Korean paper is used as a copy paper, it is called ""bogsaji"". It is used as paper for family registry book or Buddhist scriptures. When the Four Gracious Plants (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum and bamboo) or birds are drawn on ""hanji"", it's called ""hwasunji"", the drawing paper. Nowadays, Korean paper is used for arts and crafts."

Due to its independent minded stance on the socialist state, ""Doctor Zhivago"" was refused publication in the USSR. The typescript of ""Doctor Zhivago"" was smuggled out of the country to Milan and published in 1957."
"Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature the following year, an event which humiliated and enraged the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the midst of a massive campaign against him by the CPSU and the Union of Soviet Writers, Pasternak reluctantly agreed to decline the prize. In his letter to the Nobel Committee, Pasternak stated the reaction of the Soviet State was the only reason for his decision. He is still listed as the winner for that year."
"By the time of his death from lung cancer in 1960, the campaign against Pasternak had damaged the international credibility of the U.S.S.R. He is still a major figure in Russian literature.

The club was founded on 19 May 2009 by the Red Bull Company. It was formed out of the SSV Markranstädt. Due to the regulations of the DFB the name Red Bull Leipzig for marketing reasons was forbidden so they were called RB (short for RasenBallsport). Also the logo was forbidden.
"The company was sure that there is a great chance to form a new club, because with the Zentralstadion (now Red Bull Arena) there was a good stadium and there is no club in professional football in the area. The club is now in the Bundesliga. Like in Salzburg many fans protested against this deal because they had the fear that the fanculture will vanish and football will be only a business. So they wanted a ""normal"" football club."
"They started in the Oberliga Nordost-Süd(5th level) and became 1st in the 2009/10 season. But the next season they failed to gain promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. So the coach was changed, the new one is the Austrian Peter Pacult. The first match under the new coach was a 3:2 win in the German Cup (1st round) versus VfL Wolfsburg from the Bundesliga."

Breath sounds
Breath sounds are the sounds made by air as it moves through the respiratory system. Breath sounds are also called lung sounds or respiratory sounds. Sometimes they can be heard by anyone; other times they can be heard only by listening to the lungs and airways with a stethoscope.
"To describe and identify breath sounds, medical professionals usually use auscultation (they listen with a stethoscope). They listen while the patient is breathing in, and while they are breathing out. They listen to both lungs, at both the chest and the back, starting at the bottom and working their way up. They listen to whether the pitch of the breath sounds is low, medium or high. They also listen to whether the sounds are soft, medium, loud, or very loud)."

Third Punic War
"The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage, and the Roman Republic."
"The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars, and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage. The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city and tore down the buildings. They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them, and didn't want to fight another, so they totally destroyed them."
Punic Wars
"The Punic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC. They were probably the largest wars in the ancient world. The term ""Punic"" comes from the Latin word ""Punicus"" (or ""Poenicus""). This was the word the Romans used for the Carthaginians, due to their Phoenician ancestry."
The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic. What was at stake was control of the trading around the Mediterranean sea. Carthage lost the three wars.
Context.
"Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians. It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean. It was a maritime empire, in contrast to the land-based Roman empire. The Romans decided they needed Sicily, which was then in Carthaginian hands. The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years, and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage."

She married him on 12 July 1543, and outlived him by one year. She was also the most-married English queen, with four husbands. She was also the first woman to be queen of both England and Ireland."
"Catherine had a close relationship with Henry's three children. She personally helped teach school for Elizabeth and Edward, both of whom became English monarchs. She helped get the Third Succession Act in 1543 passed. This placed Mary I and Elizabeth I, back into the line of succession to the British throne."
"Henry died on 28 January 1547. Six months after Henry's death, she married her fourth and final husband, Thomas Seymour, the Baron of Sudeley."
"Catherine gave birth to her only child — a daughter, Mary Seymour. She was named after Catherine's stepdaughter Mary – on 30 August 1548. She died only six days later, on 5 September 1548, at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, from what was probably childbed fever (sepsis). This was common at that time, because births did not happen in clean conditions."
"Many years later, in 1782, the coffin of Queen Catherine was found in the ruins of the Sudeley Castle chapel."

Formation.
"With his friend Tim Staffell, Brian May started a band called 1984 in the mid-1960s. The band broke up after a little bit and then May decided to make another band and teamed up with two other college students named Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves ""Smile"" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They did a few hits such as ""April Lady"". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of Smile and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left Smile to join Humpy Bongs and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano in 1970. Then Farrokh came up with the name Queen, so they changed it from ""Smile"" to ""Queen"". They then started auditions for a new bassist. They were going through several bassists during this time and none of them stuck, only lasting for about a few minutes. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called ""Queen"" with songs such as ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" and ""Liar"". Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics ""Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me"" in ""My Fairy King"". Brian May has a degree in astrophysics."

Tamamo-no-Mae
"Tamamo-no-Mae (玉藻前) is a legendary figure in Japanese mythology and folklore. In the Otogizoshi, a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period, Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe. She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan. Tamamo-no-Mae's body mysteriously always smelled wonderful, and her clothes never became dirty. Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful, but she was very wise in all subjects. Although she appeared to be only twenty years old, there was no question that she could not answer. She answered every question posed to her, whether about music, religion, or astronomy. Because of her beauty and intelligence, everyone in the Imperial Court adored her, and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her."
"After some time had passed, the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill. He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers, but they had none to offer. Finally, an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness. The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails (kitsune), who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne. Following this, Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court."
"The Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke, the most powerful warriors of the day, to hunt and kill the fox. After escaping from the hunters for some time, the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream. Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae, the fox told Miura-nosuke would kill it the next day, and begged for its life. Miura-no-suke refused."
"Early the next day, the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu, and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow. The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki, or Killing Stone, which kills anyone that comes in contact with it. Tamamo-no-Mae's spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone."
"Hoji is said to have haunted this stone until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji. Genno did a certain spiritual ritual, and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation, until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again."
"In Matsuo Bashō's famous book, ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"" (Oku no Hosomichi), Bashō tells of visiting the stone."
"The stone split on March 5, 2022. While some have humorously said that Tamamo-no-Mae is now free, there is a far more general belief that the split is an omen of impending tragedy."
"Tamamo-no-Mae's legend served as base for the noh drama ""Sesshō-seki"" (""The Killing Stone"") and the kabuki play ""Tamamo-no-Mae"" (or ""The Beautiful Fox Witch"")."

Linear-feedback shift register
"A linear-feedback shift register is a shift register which will produce a sequence of numbers. The next value of the sequence depends on the current value. Thie first value is usually called seed. Usually, the function XOR is used to link two consecutive values. Commonly, the function XOR is used on a bit-level. With n bits, it is possible to represent 2n numbers, so after 2n-1 values the sequence will repat. In computing, linear-feedback shift registers are commonly used to compute pseudorandom numbers."

Jaguar Racing
Jaguar Racing was a Formula One team which raced from 2000 to 2004. It comes from Stewart Grand Prix. Ford bought the team in June 1999 and was to be renamed to Jaguar Racing to promote their Jaguar brand.
"For their first season in 2000, the team hired former Stewart GP driver Johnny Herbert and the 1999 Championship runner-up (second place) Eddie Irvine. However, the team only finished in the points twice during the season. In 2001, Herbert was replaced by Luciano Burti, who was replaced four races in the season by Pedro de la Rosa. Although the team got double the amount of points finishes in 2001, including a podium (top three) in Monaco, this did not help the fact that the team did not have the same success as Stewart GP got in 1999."
"In 2002 the team got worse, with three points finishes (but a podium in Italy), and a lot of financial (money) issues. Cutbacks were announced for the 2003 season, which included money savings, and a layoff (mass sackings of employees). In 2003, with a improved points system which allowed eight drivers to finish in the points, Jaguar Racing benefitted from this as they finished in the points eight times, with drivers Mark Webber, Antônio Pizzonia, and Justin Wilson replacing Pizzonia for the last five races. 2004 was to be the last season for Jaguar, keeping Webber, and hiring Christian Klien for the whole season. Five points finishes would follow, though financial difficulties would result in the team being bought out by Red Bull, then the team was renamed to Red Bull Racing."

Organolithium reagent
"Organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom. They are an important class of organometallic compound. The bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms, which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile. These compounds are similar to Grignard reagents, but are much more reactive. Organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available. Due to their highly reactive nature, they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air."

Period 8 element
"A period 8 element would be an element in the eighth period (row) of the periodic table. No period 8 elements have been proven to exist. These elements are almost certainly too big to exist in nature, so they would be synthetic elements. They would probably decay very quickly, because of radioactivity, so they would have very short half-lives. However, some scientists believe that an island of stability may exist in this range, which would be more stable and have longer half-lives. Some of these elements would be part of a new category of elements, called superactinides."

The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper ""San Francisco Chronicle"" on March 31, 2020."
"COVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship.

Journalism sourcing

Sources can be official records, books or other printed works, broadcasts, people who work for governments or businesses, organizations and corporations, people who saw and heard crimes, accidents, or other news, and people to whom a news event or issue is important."
"According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), many things can make a source bona fide, or good, or bad. Reporters should build good relationships with sources so that they trust each other, especially if they write about the same kind of thing often. These reporters are called ""beat reporters."" Beat reporters should also not become close friends with their sources. Journalists should also be skeptical. That means they should wonder whether the source is telling the truth or whether they are lying or wrong. For example, the City News Bureau of Chicago wrote ""If your mother says she loves you, check it out."" Journalists should not use only one source. Instead, they should find many sources that agree with each other, especially when they are writing about a controversy, or something people might disagree or fight about."

Commerzbank Tower
"Commerzbank Tower is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, Germany. At 259 meters, or 850 feet (300 meters with antenna included), it is Germany's tallest skyscraper and the third tallest building in Europe. It was completed and opened in 1997."
"Commerzbank Tower is located in Frankfurt's district ""Innenstadt"" in the centre of the city. It is home to the headquarters of the second largest German bank, Commerzbank."
History.
"From 1970 onwards, the previous head offices were centralised in Frankfurt am Main, where the legal seat has also been located since 1990. In the early 1990s, Commerzbank sought to build a new skyscraper in the center of Frankfurt am Main. The aim was to consolidate a large part of the rented locations in the city. The extraordinary skyscraper was designed by Lord Norman Foster. Since 1997, the tower has been a prominent feature of the Frankfurt skyline and is regarded as a model for environmentally friendly and energy-saving architecture."
Architecture.
"The floor plan forms a triangle with slightly outwardly curved sides. The tower appears open and transparent due to the atrium, also triangular. A double-skin facade encloses the building. The stepped top of the tower creates a striking building termination and sets an expressive sign for the banking district. The building was constructed from 1994 to 1997 and cost 600 million DM. It has 56 floors and an area of 109,200 square metres. The architect who designed the building is Norman Foster. The skyscraper weighs about 200,000 tonnes and contains 18,800 tonnes of steel - twice as much as the Eiffel Tower in Paris."
Green Building.
"The architect and his client worked together to make the Commerzbank tower innovatively environmentally- and climate-friendly. Natural ventilation and environmentally-friendly air conditioning create a long-term contribution to climate protection. The tower has been supplied entirely with ""green"" electricity since the beginning of 2008 and - like all Commerzbank buildings - is cleaned exclusively with biodegradable cleaning products. In 2009 the city of Frankfurt awarded the Commerzbank tower the ""Green Building Frankfurt"" award."

"MesseTurm is located in Frankfurt's district ""Westend"". This is near the same named Trade Fair-Area in the centre of the city. It is home to the German headquarters of Reuters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse."
"The construction began in 1988. It was finished in 1991. It was the tallest building in Europe, between 1991 and 1997. In 1997, Commerzbank Tower became the tallest building in Germany. It was only two metres higher than MesseTurm. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record. The world record was for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours. They poured it into the deep foundation."
"There is a pyramid on the very top of MesseTurm. It is tall. This makes it very different from other skyscrapers. Because of this shape, people in Germany often call it ""The Pencil."""

Nitro compound
A nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro group. The nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms (-NO2). The nitrogen is also bonded to the rest of the molecule.
"Nitrogen normally has only three bonds. In a nitro group, the bond is considered positively charged. Then one bond of the oxygen is negatively charged, and the other has a double bond. In reality, the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalized electrons. Then all three atoms are sp2 hybridised."
Reaction.
"Nitro compounds are very explosive. This is because, at high temperature, nitro compounds can decompose and release nitrogen gas. This reaction is very exothermic (gives out a lot of energy). Many explosives have nitro groups, for example trinitrotoluene (TNT)."

He was held there unless he paid DM 75,000 (more than US$35,000 or £23,000). Germany sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. He was released after many weeks of negotiation. Roy Bates claimed that the diplomat's visit meant that Germany had ""de facto"" recognized Sealand."

Authorities say the fire was caused by an electric fire and that the remains were cremated in the fire. The Sodders believed the Sicilian Mafia or someone else kidnapped the children due to George's anti-Benito Mussolini views."

"The Carolina Coralbead is a deciduous, woody vine that can twines along the trunks of several trees or along the ground. It occurs in timberline areas, rocky woods, glades, fence rows and ponds. Carolina Coralbead can grow 10–12 ft (3–3.6 m) and usually spaced within 3–4 ft (90–120 cm) of one another. If ingested in large amounts, the berry on Cocculus carolinus can be poisonous, but the overall toxicity of its berries do not prove to be fatal. In areas in Little Rock, Arkansas, the Carolina Coralbead is referred to as an invasive weed system which seedlings have been spread by birds. Once a root system has been established, it is hard to remove the plant, so planting in new areas has been a point of concern for this plant. The best ornamental features of the plant are its foliage and its attractive red berries in fall. ""Cocculus carolinus"" can grow in temperatures between from -3.8 °C (25 °F) to -28.8 °C (-20 °F). Its leaves are covered in short hairs and should not be confused with the species ""Smilax bona-nox"",which has tendrils and prickles."

Water treatment
Water treatment is treating water to make it suitable to be used. Providing drinking water is one of the main uses of water treatment.
Many factories also need very clean water to make steam or to make high quality products. Some of this water has to be made very pure with almost no other chemicals dissolved in it.
Treating sewage so that it does not cause harm to the environment is another use of water treatment.
Which type of water is generally used in the treatment of water?
"Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, reverse osmosis or distillation. Both methods require more energy than water treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas or where water such as groundwater has high salinity."

How is water treated to make it drinkable?
"Filtration - The clear water on top passes through filters composed of sand, gravel and charcoal to remove dissolved particles such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses and chemicals. Disinfection - Chlorine or chloramine is added to kill parasites, bacteria, viruses and germs.Apr 14, 2016"
What is the difference between water treatment and water purification?
"Also known as water purification, water treatment is the process of removing potentially harmful impurities from drinking water. Unlike water filtration, water treatment systems can get rid of all unseen materials by chemically treating the water with iodine or chlorine. ...Nov 4, 2019"

2017 Atlantic hurricane season
"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active since 2012. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. It was an extremely active and tragic season. With a damage total of at least $282.16 billion (USD), it was the costliest season on record. With over 3,300 deaths, 2017 was the deadliest season since 2005. More than 99.7% of the season's damage was due to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Nate, was the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history. Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate had their names retired due to their high damage costs and loss of life. Featuring 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, the 2017 season is the fifth active season."
"Tropical Storm Arlene in April was the first storm of the season that formed on April 19. This was the third consecutive season in which storms form before the official start of the hurricane season. In late August, Hurricane Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the first Category 4 hurricane since Charley in 2004. It also tied the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record along with the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the United States. In early September, Hurricane Irma became the first Category 5 hurricane to impact the northern Leeward Islands on record. It later hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane. Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. In late September, Hurricane Maria became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island of Dominica on record; and later it made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. Most of the deaths from this season occurred from Maria, and caused a human crisis in Puerto Rico. In early October, Hurricane Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico while also becoming the fourth hurricane of the year to make landfall in the contiguous United States. Slightly over a week later, Hurricane Ophelia became the easternmost major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, and later impacted most of Northern Europe as an extratropical cyclone. The season ended with Tropical Storm Rina, which became post-tropical on November 9."

"Vancouver, Washington"
"Vancouver, Washington is a United States city, just north of the Columbia River in the state of Washington. It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. The city of Vancouver includes Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington State."
History.
"The Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area ""land of the mud turtles"" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820s. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver."
"Americans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway."
"Columbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon."
Geography and Climate.
"Vancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011)."
"Vancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge. Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean, which gives it rain. Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains, there are clouds in winter. When it is clear one can see Mount Hood, the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver."
"Vancouver is north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate: wet from November through June and dry from July through October. Vancouver has snow once or twice a year, on average. Vancouver has a total area of . Abuout 7% is water, including Vancouver Lake to the west."

"Fort Vancouver National Historic Site also has many structures, rebuilt as they were in the 1830s."
Radiant heating
"Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas."
History of Radiant Heating.
"The Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the rich could afford them."
"In Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means ""warm stone,"" involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems."
Types of Radiant Heating.
Underfloor heating.
"The most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems."
"On 2 February 2017, Malaysia applied to the ICJ pursuant to Article 61 of the Statute of the ICJ for the revision of the 2008 judgment on the basis of three documents it had obtained from The National Archives of the UK between August 2016 and January 2017.

John Carver
"John Carver ( 1584 1621) Carver was a passenger on the ""Mayflower"". He was a leader during the ""Mayflower"" voyage and signed the Mayflower Compact. He was also the first Governor of Plymouth Colony."
It is believed that Carver was from Doncaster in Yorkshire England. Carver was a Separatist who did not believe in the teachings of the Church of England.
"Carver and his first wife Mary were members of the French Walloon church in Leiden, Netherlands. Their religion was also not allowed where they lived. ""Mayflower"" passenger Francis Cooke and his wife were also members of the French church in Leiden. So was Philip Delano. Delano would arrive in Plymouth in 1621 on the ship ""Fortune"". Carver was a deacon in Leiden about 1609 at about age 25, and was born sometime before 1584. Leiden church records show that Carver lost his first wife Mary and their child in 1609"
"Carver then married Katherine White. She was a member of the Separatist church and was originally from Nottinghamshire. Carver became very involved in the Leiden church. He made close friendships with the leaders of the church, especially the pastor John Robinson. He also became friends with Robert Cushman who would play an important part in the plans for the ""Mayflower"" voyage."
"The church members decided to travel to Virginia Colony, a place where they would be allowed to practice their religion."
William Brewster was in hiding from King James I. John Carver and Robert Cushman were chosen to make plans for the voyage. In 1617 Carver and Robert Cushman began talking to officials of the Virginia Company.
"These were London businessmen interested in making a profit from the New World. By June 1620, John Carver was in Southampton purchasing supplies for the ""Mayflower"" voyage, along with Christopher Martin. They agreed to pay for the ""Mayflower"" voyage."
"Carver was very rich and provided much of his money to the church members, and for the Mayflower voyage."
Voyage.
"The ""Mayflower"" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"Carver was very educated and was fair with everyone so the passengers chose him to be their leader on the ""Mayflower"". When they landed the people chose him to be their first governor."
In Plymouth Colony.
"Carver left the ship and went to the land to find a safe place where they all could live. William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty also went. Hopkins was very helpful. He had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. On one trip Bradford said they set off in below freezing weather. Many of the men were ill, and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats. They saw Native Americans. They were cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men coming toward them, the Indians ran. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians."
Carver worked very hard with the other men to build houses to keep the people warm. He hunted and fished and helped to plant food.
"During that time, a Native American called Samoset paid a visit to Plymouth Colony and then the chief Massasoit also arrived. Governor Carver worked out a peace treaty with them. On March 23, 1621, John Carver was again chosen to be Plymouth governor. The people said that John Carver was a man they well approved of."
"In early April 1621, after working in the field on a hot day, Governor Carver complained of a pain in his head. He returned to his house to lie down. Within a few days he died. William Bradford stated that Carver, although a wealthy man had worked hard alongside everyone."
"Thomas Weston was one of the men who helped to pay for the Pilgrims trip. He had criticism of the pilgrims for not loading up the returning ""Mayflower"" with furs and other goods to pay them back. Govenor William Bradford sent a letter telling them of all the troubles they had. He blamed Thomas Weston, and stated that Governor John Carver ""had worked himself to death that spring and the loss of him and other industrious men lives cannot be valued at any price""."
"Carver is buried at Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymoth, Massachusetts."

"Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt distinguished himself by acts of bravery on 1 July 1898, near Santiago de Cuba, Republic of Cuba, while leading a daring charge up San Juan Hill. Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt, in total disregard for his personal safety, and accompanied by only four or five men, led a desperate and gallant charge up San Juan Hill, encouraging his troops to continue the assault through withering enemy fire over open countryside. Facing the enemy's heavy fire, he displayed extraordinary bravery throughout the charge, and was the first to reach the enemy trenches, where he quickly killed one of the enemy with his pistol, allowing his men to continue the assault. His leadership and valor turned the tide in the Battle for San Juan Hill. Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army."
Presidency.
Motion of no confidence
"A motion of no confidence, is a vote on whether a group of people still has confidence in a government or leader. This is mainly a statement or vote which states that a person in a superior position, be it government, managerial, etc., is no longer deemed fit to hold that position."
"The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782 when, following news of the British defeat at Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War the previous October, the Parliament of Great Britain voted that they ""can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers"". In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is relatively rare in two-party democracies. Party discipline is usually enough to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence."
"There are variations of this in different countries. For example, in Germany, Spain, and Israel, a vote of no confidence requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the respective head of state. A motion of no confidence in some countries can be proposed in the government collectively or by any individual member, including the Prime Minister. In Spain it is presented by the Prime Minister after consultation."
Sometimes a party proposes a confidence vote even though it is not likely to pass. The no confidence vote may pressure the government. Or when the government proposes the vote it can embarrass critics who do not vote against the government.

The island is on a tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
History.
Early history (1502–1658).
"The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese admiral João da Nova, and he named it ""Santa Helena"" after Helena of Constantinople. The traditional date of this discovery was long thought to be 21 May, but the results of an investigation into the discovery published in 2015 concluded this date is probably wrong, the 3 May seeming to be historically more valid. Another theory holds that the island found by De Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships under the command of Estêvão da Gama on 30 July 1503."
"The Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island was, for ships travelling from Asia to Europe, an important place to stop to get food and water, and frequently sick sailors were left on the island to recover. After 1588, the island was visited also by Dutch and English ships."
"The Dutch Republic formally made claim to St Helena in 1633, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied, colonised or fortified it. By 1651, the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony at the Cape of Good Hope."
East India Company (1658–1815).
"In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, got there in 1659, and made St Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named ""James Fort"" and the town ""Jamestown"", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England."
"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792 and Chinese workers were brought to work in the farms. Many were allowed to stay, and their descendents became integrated into the population."
British rule (1815–1821) and Napoleon's exile.
"In 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St Helena."
"In 1858, the French emperor Napoleon III got the possession, in the name of the French government, of Longwood House and the lands around it, last residence of Napoleon I (who died there in 1821). It is still French property."
Crown colony (1834–1981).

"The Bengali people are the main ethnic group in the region of Bengal (now divided between Bangladesh and the Republic of India) in South Asia. They speak Bengali (বাংলা Bangla), a language of the eastern branch of the Indo-Aryan languages."
"They are natively concentrated in the nation of Bangladesh and in the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura. Some of the most well established Bengali communities are in the Middle East, Japan, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States."
"Remnants of civilisation in the greater Bengal region date back 4,000 years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic peoples. The origin of the word ""Bangla ~ Bengal"" is unknown, but it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ""Bang"" that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC."
"After the arrival of Indo-Aryans, the kingdoms around Bengal were first described in the ""Atharvaveda"" about 1000 BC. From the 6th century BC, Magadha expanded to include most of the Bihar and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of Buddha. Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of Persia and Afghanistan, reaching its greatest extent under the Buddhist emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named Gangaridai by the Greeks around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from ""Gangahrd"" (Land with the Ganges in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal. Later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire."

"The President made this comment in 1990, shortly after a journalist from the U.S. News &amp; World Report broke the story that Bush banned the vegetable from Air Force One. George S. Dunlop, President of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, gave First Lady Barbara Bush a bouquet of the vegetable an additional 10 tons in trucks."
"A few days afterwards, Bush hosted a state dinner to honor Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland, and journalists noted there was no broccoli on the menu, as most of the 10 tons of broccoli given to the President's family by the farmers had been donated to the Capital Area Food Bank."

"Ohio is important in elections because it is a swing state. Candidates often campaign a lot there and prior to 2020, the last time they voted for the losing candidate was 1960. Also, no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying this state. Ohio has both farmland and cities, and there is a lot of discrimination against black people. It is a part of the Midwest. Ohio is the 7th most populated state in the United States of America."

Southern and Southeastern Ohio is near the Appalachian Mountains, and is the most mountainous part of the state. Most of this area is covered by forests. This part of Ohio is home to the Ohio River, the Wayne National Forest, and the Hocking Hills, which has waterfalls and canyons."
"Central Ohio is mostly rolling hills, and is home to Columbus. Northeast Ohio is dominated by the Lake Erie coast and has a mix of cities and countryside."
Economy.
"For many years, industry and manufacturing was the biggest part of Ohio's economy. Youngstown was a big steel producer, as was Cleveland. Other manufacturing - including the car industry - was a major factor across the state. Since the 1970s, industry has shrank in Ohio, but it is still a big part of the local economy. Today, other businesses are more prominent. Cleveland is one of the biggest hubs for Healthcare, and its main hospital, the famous Cleveland Clinic, is the largest employer in the region. Banking is also a major business, and foods and retail are too. Cincinnati plays host to the headquarters of Fifth Third Bank, Cintas, Kroger, Luxottica, Procter &amp; Gamble and Macy's, whereas, Columbus hosts the headquarters of LBrands, JPMorgan Chase, Huntington Bank, Rogue Fitness, Wendy's, Big Lots, Cardinal Health and Nationwide Insurance.

She served five terms as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, for over fourteen years between 1991 and 2016. From 1989 she was the general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam , a Dravidian party. She was praised and called by the party members as ""Amma""(meaning: mother), ""Thanga Tharagai"" (meaning: Golden Maiden) and ""Puratchi Thalaivi"" (the woman revolutionary leader)."

North East MRT line
The North East MRT Line (NEL) is the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour. This line is coloured purple in the rail map.
"The line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations."
"This line is the first MRT line in Singapore to be completely underground (running in a tunnel all the way between HarbourFront and Punggol). It is also the first (and so far, the only) line where trains get their power from overhead wires above the track, instead of a third rail beside the track."
All the trains on the North East Line are automated (computer-controlled) and do not have an operator driving the train at the front. It is one of the world's first rapid transit lines that does not need drivers and is one of three such lines in the MRT network today. The others are the Circle Line and the Downtown Line.
Stations.
"The Land Transport Authority has announced that it will extend the North East Line from its current northern terminal at Punggol to a new station called Punggol Coast. Construction will begin in 2018, and it is expected to open in 2023."
List of Singapore MRT stations
"The following lists all rail stations of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in Singapore, with underground stations listed in ""italics"". There are 151 stations in operation. Many more are in various stages of planning and construction (as shown in the latest system map)."
At bat
"In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is used for certain statistics. These statistics include batting average, on base percentage, and slugging percentage. It is a more narrow definition of a plate appearance. A batter starts with an at bat every time he faces a pitcher; however, the batter gets ""no time at bat"" in the following cases:"
Section 10.02.a.1 of the official rules of Major League Baseball defines an at bat as:
"""Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction..."""

Cal Ripken Jr.
"Calvin Edwin ""Cal"" Ripken, Jr. (born August 24, 1960), nicknamed ""Iron Man"", is a former Major League Baseball shortstop and third baseman. He played his whole 21-year baseball career for the Baltimore Orioles (1981–2001)."
"Ripken is perhaps best known for breaking New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played. The record had been called too hard to break. He beat the 56-year-old record when he played in his 2,131st straight game on September 6, 1995 between the Orioles and the California Angels in front of a sold-out crowd at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Ripken hit a home run in the game the night before that tied Gehrig's record and another home run in his 2,131st game. Fans later voted this game as Major League Baseball's ""Most Memorable Moment"" in MLB history. Ripken played in an 501 more straight games over the next three years. His streak ended at 2,632 games when he removed his name from the lineup for the final Orioles home game of the 1998 season. His record 2,632 straight games lasted over seventeen seasons, from May 30, 1982 to September 20, 1998."
"A 19-time All-Star and member of the 3000 hit club, Ripken is considered one of the best shortstops and third basemen to ever play the game. At 6' 4"" (1.93 m), 225 lbs. (102.27 kg), he led the way for taller, larger shortstops to be successful in that position. When voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007, he was a first ballot inductee with the third highest voting percentage (98.53%) in Hall of Fame history, behind Tom Seaver (98.84%) and Nolan Ryan (98.79%)."
"He is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc. The company's goal is to grow the love of baseball from a more grassroots level. Established in 2001, Ripken Baseball represents Cal and his brother Bill's business and philanthropy dealings and focuses on several subsidiaries: Ripken Management and Design, Youth Camps and Clinics, Cal Ripken, Sr. foundation, Ripken Professional Baseball, with three minor-league teams—the Aberdeen IronBirds (affiliated with the Orioles); the Augusta GreenJackets (affiliated with the San Francisco Giants); and the Charlotte Stone Crabs (affiliated with the Tampa Bay Rays)—and Ironclad Authentics."

Football at the Summer Olympics
Football (soccer) has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932 as a men's competition sport. Women's football was added to the official program at the 1996 Atlanta edition.
History.
"Football was not in the original modern Olympic Games program as international football was not that popular in 1896. However an unofficial football tournament was organised during the first competition. Complete records have been lost and may not even be true but it seems that only two games may have been played. An Athens XI lost to a team representing Smyrna (Izmir), then part of the Ottoman Empire. Smyrna went on to be beaten 15-0 by a team from Denmark. Demonstration tournaments were played at the 1900 and 1904 games and the ""Intercalated Games"" of 1906, but these were contested by various clubs and scratch teams, and are not considered to be official Olympic events. Neither FIFA nor the IOC recognize the Intercalated Games. The first proper tournament is said to be in the 1908 Olympics, organized by the Football Association. It had 6 teams. The next tournament was organized by the Swedish Football Association in 1912. However, the tournament was very unbalanced, with some high scoring games such as 10-0 and 12-0, and all of the players were amateurs. The tournaments of 1924 and 1928 are the two only editions officially recognised by FIFA as championships of the world."
"For the 1984 Olympics, the IOC admitted professional players."
"Since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, all teams have to be under-23 years old. Since 1996, three over 23 players are allowed."
"A women's edition was added in 1996. The women's tournament has no age restrictions, unlike the men's tournament."
1976 Winter Olympics
"The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria. The games were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado, United States in May 1970, but a 300 percent rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to voters' rejection of a $5 million bond issue to finance the games in 1972. As a result, the IOC offered the games to Whistler, British Columbia (Canada), who had bid on the games, but they also declined due to a change of government there. (Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.) The IOC finally called on Innsbruck, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Games just twelve years earlier, to also host the 1976 games. Salt Lake City, Utah, which would eventually host in 2002, offered itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of Denver. The IOC declined."
Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics
"Gymnastics has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. For thirty years, only men were allowed to compete. Women's events were introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The competition was held in artistic gymnastics discipline until 1984, when rhythmic gymnastics discipline was added to the program of the Olympics. Since 2000, trampolining discipline has also been competed."
Suryavanshi
Suryavanshi refers to a person belonging to the Solar Dynasty of the Rajputs .
The Suryavanshi clans are:
Some other castes are also Suryavanshi like:-
Chandravanshi
"Chandravanshi or Candravaṃśa is a legendary principal house of the Kshatriyas varna, or warrior–ruling caste mentioned in the ancient Indian texts. This legendary dynasty was said to be descended from moon-related deities (Soma or Lunar). The Hindu deity Krishna is believed to be born in the Yaduvanshi Ahir branch of the Lunar dynasty."
"According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas."
"According to the Mahabharata, the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. The son of Ila and Budha was Pururavas who became the first Chandravanshi emperor of the planet. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas"
"In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that forms the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses."
By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna &amp; later becomes the King of Mathura.
"As the only surviving grandson of Krishna, all branches claiming descent from Krishna (Krishnaut Yadavas) descend from him."

Prytaneion
"The Prytaneion was a building at Olympia, Greece. It was here that feasts in honor of the Olympic victors and official guests were held in ancient times. The Prytaneion was built towards the end of the 6th century BC. It was located northwest of the Temple of Hera at Olympia. During Roman times (as evidenced by the many bricks), it was reconstructed and extended many times. The Altar of Hestia (the Greek virgin goddess of the hearth) was in the building. It was on this altar that the Olympic eternal flame burned day and night. Every year, Olympian priests would daub the Great Altar of Zeus with a mixture made from the ashes of the Altar of Hestia and the water of the River Alpheios. The Altar of Hestia was in a square room on the southern side of the building. The rooms on the west side and the peristyle court on the north side were used for feasting and cooking."
Elizabeth Arden
"Florence Nightingale Graham (31 December 1884 – 18 October 1966), better known as Elizabeth Arden, was a Canadian–American business woman who founded what is now known as Elizabeth Arden, Incorporated. She built a cosmetics network in the United States. At the peak of her career, she became one of the richest women in the world. She was born near to Woodbridge in the Province of Ontario."
"This Milanese residential building takes its name from the three characteristic columns of the tower façade that make up the frontispiece, which make up a chessboard with the loggias, alternating full and empty spaces, which communicate with each other through the glass."
Features.
"The Palazzo di Tre Torri has a particular architectural, artistic, historical and cultural interest."

Palace Perogalli
"The The Palace Perogalli also known as Palazzo Perogalli is a residential building designed in 1952 by Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani in Viale Beatrice d'Este 26, in the historic center of Milan inside the Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties."
"The Palace offers a view of via Anelli and Palazzo Galmanini Portaluppi at the corner of Via Anelli, considered the most important design masterpiece in the area."
Description.
Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani also built the adjacent design building in Viale Beatrice d'Este 24 known as The Abstract House.
"The Palazzo is like the adjacent building, in support, of La Casa Astratta, an expression of the theories of the MAC-Movimento d'Arte Concreta with a facade that recalls ""a rhythmic score based on the alternation of brown and Havana clinker panels, separated from each other by the empty windows and the glossy white of the roller shutter boxes."""
"Palazzo Perogalli was built a few years after the Abstract House, in which the main element this time is the color which, on the side façade, gives a dynamic effect and breaks the static nature of the wall box through staggered clinker panels of different sizes and alternating colors, orange and brown."
"The Palazzo is the first example of Clinker cladding, which will later become one of the ""means of expression most used by the Milanese design culture"" and will be the inspiration for works by Gio Ponti, Caccia Dominioni, Franco Albini, and Ignazio Gardella ""who reflect on the theme of architectural skin composed of flakes of the most varied shapes and shades of color""."

Series overview.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
"and I was just like, we've got to quit this."
And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
"Oh, shoot."
"My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything."
Eat this or <laughter>.
That's right.
"So, I can see the concerns on what different people want."
Yeah.
"Because some,"
"I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
"I think,"
"yeah,"
"I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement."
Uh-huh.
"And just have like at the most, like ten kids."
And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
No.
Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
That's true.
"I, I'd love to do it."
But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.
Yeah.
"I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ..."
More than what it's worth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would scare me.
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"
"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much."
"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."
Oh.
"All right,"
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"
"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy."
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"
but I just use those little cans of chicken.
Uh-huh.
"And it makes it so much easier,"
"and so you dump the rice,"
you dump the chicken
"and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,"
It probably comes from where you are.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
that it probably does.
Most
"I, I'm not sure"
"but,"
"When I drive through that area, that's all I see is  pressure treated, pressure treated lumber yards."
Yeah.
"It's nothing but woods up here, down here."
Yeah.
"I don't, I haven't, I mean, I haven't,"
"I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington, actually."
"And, but that was just when I was a kid"
so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore.
"But it's, I don't know, we're a college town"
so that doesn't help us out any.
Right.
East Texas.
"We have,"
"gas is a dollar dollar twelve a gallon,"
so that's probably about what you're paying
Huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, uh, pavers on top of that"
so.
Yeah.
That's a lot easier.
You've got something going all the time.
"Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?"
"Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,"
I like to watch those skins games.
Uh-huh.
"Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain you know,"
for each hole they win they get the money for it.
Uh-huh.
I think those are pretty exciting.
"Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf."
"You hit a little ball,"
"you chase it,"
"you go find it,"
and then you hit it again and lose it again.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,"
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.
Oh really
I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well.
"Oh, I know."
"Oh, yeah."
My husband and his buddies are not very good.
They play like maybe once a month or less
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"and so they all hit like in the low nineties,"
and they think they're having a really good game
"Oh, yeah."
So.
"Well, my husband's average ran in the mid seventies"
Wow.
so he wasn't bad.
"Yeah,"
that is good.
"Oh, the wood chuck song"
And I still can to this date.
"And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song"
Yeah.
"Yep,"
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
"Oh, bless your heart."
"Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all."
"Oh, yeah,"
any time I got bored
"Oh, okay,"
"but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?"
No.
No.
"And Jaws,"
but I think everybody can.
Okay.
"I I, I can still read music if I'm lucky"
"because I,"
"if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,"
"but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school,"
Yeah.
so
Yeah.
"I played uh, concertos and other stuff"
"but,"
"I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,"
"so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,"
"but anyway,"
Yeah.
"but I enjoy it, though."
Right.
"And I would much rather own my own home than, than be renting it like we're doing."
"I mean, we're basically, you know, kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
We're renting a house.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, right now with the way our credit card situation is, there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house."
"Right,"
right.
"But, but, once I suppose you, you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's, it's going to, it's going to take quite a while."
Uh-huh.
Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home.
Uh-huh.
"But, um, I'm not really counting on it real soon."
Okay
You want to get a start?
Certainly.
"Uh, the weather here is warm."
Uh-huh.
And it has been sort of raining on and off.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I am an avid gardener"
"so I measure the rain in our rain gauge on a, on a regular basis."
"So I can, can avoid wasting money on watering."
"Oh, great,"
great.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days,"
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.
"So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them."
Right.
"And I don't know all the details on that,"
"but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the the students coming into the jury."
Yeah.
And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.
Uh-huh.
Do you have any?
"Yes,"
we do have a pet.
"We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh,"
"well, we call it the S P C A."
"It's the, uh, from an animal shelter."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, he'd come in there as a stray."
All right.
"Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross."
Yeah.
"Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him."
"Uh, he's,"
"Oh, that's good."
"You don't often find that,"
I don't think.
"No, uh,"
"we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him."
Sure.
"There's a,"
"okay, uh,"
"and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,"
so.
"Oh, yeah."
What part of California are you from?
"San Jose, California."
"Oh, really?"
I have a good friend there.
"Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs."
Yeah .
"A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole,"
we've only been here a couple of years.
"Uh, before that we lived in Colorado"
"but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable."
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense,"
"I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's
You know.
"And it, it's that kind of thing"
"and, uh,"
"That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,"
Yeah.
"We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things  of that sort."
Sure.
Do you have that where you live
"or,"
"Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,"
I'm an intern
and then I go  back down in May.
"but since it's just the two of us, it's"
"Yeah,"
yeah
Well that happens to us sometimes too.
Yeah.
"But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,"
but we eat in the kitchen
and their heads are always poking past the door.
"Uh-huh,"
to see what's happening.
Yeah.
"Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing"
and some people don't like to do this
"but I like to uh, cook with my kids."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help."
"And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,"
"I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it."
"Oh, I've seen those in the magazines."
"Yeah,"
they're so simple.
Uh-huh.
And the kids love to do that.
"Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them."
Yeah.
"And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that"
and it's just really hard
"and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that."
Yeah.
"So, that's, uh,"
"they like to eat it,"
"but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I know my friend is, uh, really into guns"
"and, uh, uh, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, you know, that  come through town and everything"
Uh-huh.
"and, I mean, they just have, I mean they have anything you'd want,"
I mean
Uh-huh.
"you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's, I mean, there's nothing."
You can just go buy one and take it home
"and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at, you know, a video store."
"I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago"
"and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"You just go and, uh, buy the gun"
"and, uh,"
There's no restriction though.
You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?
No.
"Well, except for the, the pistols and"
I'm not sure how they do that.
"I know they,"
"Yeah,"
"I was just curious, you know, because, uh"
Uh-huh.
"I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop that you, that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple  of weeks"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and then they check you out,"
then they call you up
and you go pick it up.
"I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid"
but there are really only so many things you can do.
"You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do."
Yeah.
One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
Yeah.
"even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,"
Uh-huh.
"it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know."
"They could basically, uh,"
"when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors  um, things like that like"
Uh-huh.
"That's,"
Uh-huh.
they did in Miami that time.
"But it's not, uh,"
"if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though."
That's not always true.
It isn't?
No.
"There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed"
Uh-huh.
"and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home."
Uh-huh.
Huh.
The guy came in while he was home
"and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned."
"He didn't die,"
but he was severely burned
"well, I think,"
"I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time."
"So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in."
"Yes,"
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast.
Uh-huh.
We'll catch our news that way.
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?
"Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I can't remember the last time I saw it."
It's been a while.
"Yeah,"
"well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not"
"I don't know,"
"sometimes they come on and, and say."
"Oh, that's right."
"Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words."
"Um, yeah."
It was really interesting.
It is interesting.
"So,"
Do you work for Texas Instruments?
"No,"
"no,"
"just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church."
"Oh, that's nice."
Yes.
"Yes,"
yes.
"So,"
Which I think is a good thing.
It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It, uh,"
"plus, uh, you know the safety factor and stuff."
"Well, we enjoy having pets."
"We, uh, you know, I think they're a lot of company,"
"and, and when my mother lived with us, uh, the cat was really hers"
"and, and he was kind of wild."
"Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us,"
"and, uh, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap."
Oh.
"And she was the only one at first that, you know, could really hold him, you know, because he was really skittish."
"But it was like he knew you know,"
uh-huh.
"and he would sleep with her,"
"and so he was a lot of company to her. You know, and, and just love her."
Yeah.
"And he's, cats are usually so independent"
"but this one you know, he comes up"
"and he crawls up next to my husband now, you know."
"He's,"
"you know, before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side,"
"and the cat would sleep on my husband's side, you know"
And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row
My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us.
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake."
"Oh, my gosh."
So we really had a lot of rain.
"Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,"
"there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano"
Right.
"and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,"
"and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,"
"but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess."
It just
"Yeah,"
we had a lot of flash floods in the area.
"We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few."
Uh-huh.
Not more than ten
"but,"
"That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much."
"Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,"
"it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy"
"Yeah,"
"well, it's, uh, interesting,"
"uh,"
I'm going down to El Paso next week
"and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,"
"but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,"
"Well, El Paso won't be cold."
"It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?"
"No,"
"it's, it's, quite southern"
"and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso."
Uh-huh.
"The, uh, you'll be flying in there?"
"Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men."
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved"
"but, uh, they really were helpful, I know, to our house."
"It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it"
Yeah
Yes
That's awful.
"Um, Howard and I were talking about home repair the other night and, uh, in connection with scouting."
We've got a scout coming up
"and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing faucets, dripping faucets,  and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that."
Huh-uh.
"As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son"
"and one thing we did, was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall way of our house, rather,"
"and we were repainting the, the front room in the hall there,"
and we took down that paneling
and he helped me
"and, and, uh, he was, it was fun to work with him. And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,  like that."
Huh-uh.
"How does the paneling,"
"it looks lots better than,"
do you like it better?
"Oh, I like it so much better."
It makes it so much lighter.
Yeah.
"You know, it really does."
"You know, and people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked,  much better, too."
Huh-uh.
That's nice.
It's been fun.
"Nice to have it come out positive and look,  look good."
Yeah.
"Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,"
"my first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful."
"And then, I wondered if people were unwilling"
"but, but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long."
"Um, but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
that's probably true  You know
"But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number could,"
"but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?"
"No,"
"um, not since, um, not as much as I remember growing up."
"And that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um, seemed more common in the last two decades."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think that's probably true.
"But,"
"I think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Where, uh, where abouts do you live?"
What part of the country?
"Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,"
"Oh, okay."
We're in Plano
so we're not far apart.
Right.
"Yeah,"
okay.
"One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin"
"and, and I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest"
so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, there, I know, you know, John Wylie Price,"
"I don't know if you kept up,"
"but he's been protesting,"
Yes
I have
"and, uh, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get,"
"Yeah,"
and I think he has legitimate argument.
"I mean you can, uh,"
"I, I, I grew up in Alabama"
"and so I, I have some prejudices."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs"
"but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing"
Yeah.
"and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good,"
I occasionally go to Saint Louis.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news."
"I think channel eight is the number one, uh, A B C affiliate in the U S."
"I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he,"
"Oh, really?"
Course he pumping his own
"Well, we, you know,"
"like all of the stations seem to be pretty good,"
it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into.
Where'd you move from?
Houston.
"So we had a, a favorite,"
uh-huh.
and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole.
Uh-huh.
"But I think this, they way the whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt."
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"that, I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people I guess because I never experienced it."
Uh-huh.
"And it's not, because you know, I'm rich or anything,"
"it's just, a mental concept that I have. Yeah,"
Yeah.
that I just.
"Well, when you, when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle, and if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul,"
"and it was scary, because I was so good at it."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And I thought, this is not right."
"I mean, this has got to stop, because eventually it'd end up catching up at, catching up with me"
and it hit me in the face.
"Right,"
right.
Um.
"But it sounds like, you know, you, you learned from it"
and you're coming out of it all right.
"I, yeah,"
"I have,"
I've learned a lot from it.
Uh-huh.
"I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too, because he's, he's the same way I am."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
I want to move up quick.
I want to make money quick.
I want to retire quick.
Yeah.
"And so anything,"
"when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty-three and twenty-four,  I'm thinking my time is running out. You know,"
Uh-huh.
"but I'm actually very, very young."
"Yeah,"
"you are, because what I was going to say is, what you will find is, my background is in journalism and corporate communications,"
Uh-huh.
"and what you'll find is,"
"I mean, I'm just now finally to a point where,"
"I mean I don't know why I didn't, didn't do it sooner,"
Uh-huh.
"but this is probably typical of the women's movement too,  is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school."
Uh-huh.
"I'm seriously considering going back to school for law.  Um, which is a complete, I wouldn't say career change, it's, it's a subway ,"
Um.
Uh-huh.
but it's still is a different application.
"And I mean, if you think about it, you know, I I still can have another career."
I mean I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And I mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine,  is thinking that, um, they have to do you know, sort of,  I call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome."
Uh-huh.
Right.
They have to eat real fast
"they have,  they have to, rapidity of speech,"
"Uh-huh,"
Oh.
"even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use."
"And I don't think it was my fault because I, you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it"
"but, uh, it was really, uh, it was,"
"I had to send it back after like, you know, the third week because I realized it was like, it was not,"
"something was very, very wrong with the blade."
"Uh, what about you?"
"Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service."
Uh-huh.
I don't feel like that's as big a problem.
I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly.
Uh-huh.
And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time."
Uh-huh.
But that's it.
"But that's, that's probably the worst."
"My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh, James Avery."
I don't know if you have that up there
"but it, it's a very good company. That  sells sterling silver things"
Uh-huh.
"and uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
"and when she stood up, it caught and broke"
and we took it back
"and they said oh, this was just obviously yanked."
Uh-huh.
This was yanked.
"I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean."
Yeah.
"I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,"
"but I, I, uh, you know,"
"Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,"
"but, you know, up here we have Kodak"
Right.
and that's the worst polluter.
"They put, uh, uh,"
you can smell ether in the air sometimes
It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.
I guess so.
"Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras"
"and they, they make film here"
and they're the worst offender
"but it's, you know, it's under so much control."
"You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them"
but that's really getting under control now.
Right.
"I, you know, I don't know in air what they do."
"Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about."
"Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,"
"my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas"
"and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there"
"and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air."
"I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,"
"there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad."
"Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,"
uh-huh
"And, uh, it, if, uh, no matter what they do in the, the classroom, if they go home at night and, you know, it's all totally undone, uh."
Uh-huh.
"The, the thing that, uh, uh, that Karen, my wife, has, has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what, no matter how bad their teachers are, no matter what a lousy system they're in, or anything else,"
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"these people somehow manage to, uh, you know, push on through and are successful."
"Progress,"
uh-huh.
"It's, uh, unfortunately probably what, maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that."
"Yeah,"
"not, not even that much probably."
"Well, that would be, be at the absolute most."
Yeah
uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know, those, those that, you know, come out, you know, fall out of the system, that are, are real trouble,"
Uh-huh.
"I, I wonder whether that's just a, uh, uh, a part of the system, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"if, you know, in a democracy where, you know, people have kind of, uh, a freedom to sort of do what they want, you know, there, there's an inefficiency there,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and you've got to let those, you know, those,"
"And speaking, speaking of doing what you want, uh, just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one, um, a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do, as far as, you know, even, even something as simple as staying up late, um, watching television late, um, going out late, start dating,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, oh yeah."
Uh-huh.
"you start dating too early, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"just little things like that, that do start in the home,"
Yeah.
"The memorial consists of a single rough-hewn, grey granite boulder approximately wide, across, and high. At the top of the memorial in solid granite is a Maltese cross, the insignia of the Order of the Spanish–American War Nurses. The insignia is on both the front and rear of the memorial."
"On the front of the memorial are carved in bas-relief several palm branches, which lean to the left and shade the panel below. A laurel wreath lies atop the palm branches. The wreath has a bow at its base. One of the long, trailing ribbons of stone appears to be loosely draped over the right side of the panel, where it wraps around the base of the palm fronds. The other trailing ribbon appears to be loosely draped to the left of the panel. The wreath, fronds, and ribbon partially obscured the top, upper left corner, and upper right corner of the panel. Below the wreath and fronds is a sunk panel with inscription ""To Our Comrades""."
"On the rear of the monument, the Maltese cross insignia is at the top. A third of the way up from the ground, a bronze plaque is set into the rough-hewn grey granite. It reads: ""In Memory of the Women Who Gave Their Lives As Army Nurses In 1898. Erected by the Society of Spanish American War Nurses."""
"The memorial was dedicated to 13 nurses who died in the Spanish–American War. It is one of three Spanish–American War memorials at the cemetery. The other two are the Spanish–American War Memorial and the Rough Riders Memorial. A fourth memorial, a copy of the statue ""The Hiker"", stands on Memorial Drive outside the cemetery's boundaries."

"Mohammed Ijaz Butt (born 10 March 1938, Sialkot, Punjab, British India) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in eight Tests from 1959 to 1962. A wicket keeper and right-handed opening batsman, he scored 279 runs from his brief Test career at a modest batting average of 19.92, however he was a capable wicket keeper with a first-class cricket career for Lahore, Multan, Punjab and Rawalpindi where he scored 3,842 runs at 34.30 with a best of 161. For the next few decades, he worked as the director new projects at Service Industries Pakistan, expanding it to one of the largest manufacturer of footwear and motor cycle / cycle tyres and tubes. It is listed on the stock exchanges of Pakistan and has annual sales of Rs. 6 billion. he is a director on the board of Servis Tyres."
"On 6 October 2008 President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari, patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) appointed Butt as chairman of the PCB. He has been involved in several controversies during his career, presiding over Pakistan during a time when security concerns—including a shooting incident involving the Sri Lankan tour bus—stripped the country of several international fixtures. He has made several attacks on current and former PCB officials and the Senate of Pakistan."
"Butt was born in Sialkot, Punjab in 1938. He began his first-class career against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club squad on 16 January 1956 while playing for Pakistan Universities. Batting at number three, he scored 35 and 97, falling three short of a debut century thanks to the bowling of Billy Sutcliffe and the catching hands of Ken Barrington. The match ended in a draw. A month later he faced the MCC once more, this time for Punjab: he scored 43 and 18 as the MCC triumphed by an innings and 29 runs. Butt went on to make several successful appearances in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy over the winter of 1956/57, scoring 225 runs at 56.25 including a maiden century of 147 runs. He promptly toured the West Indies but only featured in one first-class match before returning to the 1958/59 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy where he had a less successful second season: 73 runs from three matches at 24.33, failing to pass 50. He nevertheless went straight into the Test team for the home series against the West Indies."
"Butt played Test cricket between 1959 and 1962. He made his Test debut at Karachi on 20 February 1959. The tourists, bowled out cheaply for 146 in the first innings, conceded a 10-wicket defeat with Butt scoring 14 and 41 not out as a specialist opener. He scored two, 21, 47* and two in the rest of the series. Between 26 March and 4 December he played two more Tests against Australia, scoring a career-best 58 in the second Test. He was then left out of the team until 1962, where he toured England for three Test matches. He struggled, scoring 10, 33, one, six, 10 and six before being dropped."
NRLM will be implemented in a mission mode. This enables:
"(a) shift from the present allocation based strategy to a demand driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans."
"(b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound delivery."
"(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector."
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
"As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."
"The second dimension of demand driven strategy implies that the ultimate objective is that the poor will drive the agenda, through participatory planning at grassroots level, implementation of their own plans, reviewing and generating further plans based on their experiences.

The Easter Island butterflyfish is native to the waters around Easter Island and is found nowhere else. Its preferred habitat is on reefs and among volcanic boulders heavily clad in brown algae at depths down to about . Juvenile fish are sometimes found among corals in rock pools.
"Juvenile Easter Island butterflyfish have been observed to act as cleaner fish, picking parasites off the skin of larger fish. During the breeding season, male and female adult fish form pair bonds."
"The Easter Island butterflyfish is a bottom feeding fish. Examination of its stomach contents have shown that it feeds on polycheaete worms, shrimps, fish eggs and barnacles, and fragments of the black sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. were also found. This was unexpected as butterfly fish are not known to feed on sponges, however the explanation may be that the sponge was ingested in error when the fish was feeding on the barnacles which had become entangled in the sponge."
"At one time this fish was listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their Red List of Threatened Species but in 2010, this was changed to being of ""Least Concern"". The reason given for this change was that, although its range was very limited, this fish was quite common within that range and did not face any significant threats. A small number of fish were collected for the reef aquarium trade but the number was not believed to reduce the population to any great extent."

"The 8-demicubic honeycomb, or demiocteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets ."
"The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""8-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice. The best known is 240, from the E lattice and the 5 honeycomb."
formula_1 contains formula_2 as a subgroup of index 270. Both formula_1 and formula_2 can be seen as affine extensions of formula_5 from different nodes:
"The D lattice (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8). It is identical to the E8 lattice. At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 2=128 from lower dimension contact progression (2), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1))."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four ""D8 lattices"": It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 16 (""2n"" for n≥5). and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb, , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex Voronoi cell, ."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 256 8-demicube facets around each vertex.

"St. Catharine High School is an all-girls, private, Roman Catholic high school in the Bronx, New York. It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York."
"The Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, opened an academy in the Washington Heights section of New York City in September 1889. The classes included were grades 1 through 12. At that time, the first academy resembled the large estates which surrounded it. Toward the end of the 19th century as registration increased, the Sisters erected a new building across the street at 539 West 152nd Street. In 1900 the University of the State of New York granted a Regents charter to the school."
The rapid growth of the area and the great increase in enrollment showed the inadequacy of the accommodations. The elementary grades in the academy were discontinued and these classrooms were used for high school students.

"Bellanger was a favourite model of the sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, who represented her as an allegory of spring in an elegant terracotta bust in which is today in the Musée Carnavalet in Paris."
"In a painting by Édouard Manet in 1863, Olympia, the artist endeavoured to evoke an odalisque, who receives a bouquet of flowers brought by her maid. According to Phyllis A. Floyd's study, ""The Puzzle of Olympia"", he gave the painting the features of Marguerite Bellanger."
"In June 1863, while on a carriage ride in Saint-Cloud Park, Emperor Napoleon III spotted Bellanger sheltering from the rain beneath a tree. Napoleon was bewitched by his new encounter."
"Marguerite Bellanger become the mistress of the Emperor. Soon, with the knowledge of all including the Empress Eugénie, she followed him on private and official trips."
"Amongst his numerous presents, the Emperor gave her two houses, one at 57 rue des Vignes, Passy, the other at Saint-Cloud, in the park of Montretout, which had a back door to the gardens of the castle."
"In February 1864, Marguerite Bellanger gave birth to a son; whom she named Charles Jules Auguste François Marie Leboeuf."
"After the birth, Bellanger retired for a while to rue de Launay in Villebernier and received a pension. In November 1864, the Emperor offered ""Margot"" the castle of Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin, near Meaux. The Emperor also gave the child a boarding house and the castle of Mouchy, in the Oise, which he had bought very discreetly some time before. Bellanger became usufructuary of the property."
"Always seductive, Bellanger still attracted men when she settled in Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin at the end of 1864. Among her lovers were General de Lignières and, according to some sources, Léon Gambetta."
"She was the subject of caricatures and gossip. Paul Hadol, in his series of caricatures on the ""Imperial Menagerie"", portrayed her as a cat."
"Her affair with the emperor continued during the Franco-Prussian War, and even during his captivity in Westphalia. In 1873, when the emperor died in exile in England, she travelled to England to mourn her 'dear lord'."
"At the fall of the Empire, she again traveled to England and married William Louis Kulbach, a British army officer. The presence of the couple William Kulbach and Marguerite Bellanger is recorded in Monchy-Saint-Éloi (Oise), France in the census of 1872. Bellanger gave her age as 30 years, whereas according to the data in her biography, she was 33 or 34."
"She lived the rest of her life as a member of the upper class, devoting herself to charity and good works."
"Marguerite Bellanger died at the age of 48 on 23 November 1886 after contracting a cold during a walk in the park of the castle at Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin. According to the declaration of death, her husband lived in Pau. The religious ceremony took place on 27 November at the church of Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot and she was interred in Montparnasse Cemetery."
"Her brother Jules, who served as a gardener, benefited from her estate. He built a beautiful house in Brain-sur-Allonnes, which is now the town hall."
"Her only son, Charles Leboeuf, made a career as an officer and died without issue on 11 December 1941. He was buried with his mother."
"Bellanger's character appears in Christian-Jaque's film Nana (1955), in which her character is performed by Nicole Riche."
"Marguerite Bellanger has been associated with a chocolate specialty: a praline was created to honour her. A chocolatier from Saumur designed, with the help of archivists of the city of Saumur, a specialty ""The Marguerite""."
"The coat of arms of Marguerite Bellanger is reproduced on the chocolates: a daisy with a heart of silver and gold petals. The praline ""with four spices"" (cloves, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg) echos the qualities that the second Empire sought to give her: a varnish of heart, a spicy charm and an imperial dress."

Jurby () is one of the seventeen parishes of the Isle of Man.
"It is located in the north-west of the island (part of the traditional ""North Side"" division) in the sheading of Michael."
"For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners."
The Captain of the Parish (since 1999) is John James Quayle.
"Jurby parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency."
"The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 776, a decrease of 2.7% from the figure of 797 in 2011."
"The parish of Jurby, which lies on the north-western coast of the island, borders those of Andreas to the east, Lezayre to the south-east, and Ballaugh to the south. It is low-lying overall: the highest elevations are some coastal dunes with a height of up to 39 metres."
"There is an industrial park on the old RAF Jurby Airfield, but otherwise the district is almost entirely agricultural. Apart from the Jurby airfield buildings, there are no significant settlements in the parish."
Jurby Airfield was originally used as a Royal Air Force training base in World War II. During the 1950s it was used as a training camp for Officer cadets on short term commissions in the RAF. The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."

"""The Guns of Brixton"" was the Clash's first song to be composed and sung by Paul Simonon. By the time of ""London Calling"", Simonon had learned to play guitar and started contributing more to the songwriting."
"The band, separated from manager Bernard Rhodes, had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location. They began work on ""London Calling"" during the summer of 1979 at the Vanilla Studios in Pimlico. The band quickly wrote and recorded demos, and in August 1979 entered Wessex Studios to begin recording the album. Produced by Guy Stevens, who at the time had alcohol and drug problems and whose production methods were unconventional, it was recorded within a matter of weeks, with many songs, including ""The Guns of Brixton"", recorded in one or two takes. It was also revealed that while recording the lead vocals for the song, Simonon sang while staring directly at a CBS executive who had visited the studio during the sessions, giving Simonon the desired amount of emotion in his voice."
"A section of the song is sung by a very young Maria Gallagher, accompanied by her father Mick Gallagher on the keyboard, as a reprise at the end of the song ""Broadway"" on the 1980 Clash album ""Sandinista!"""
"""The Guns of Brixton"" predates the riots that took place in the 1980s in Brixton, but the lyrics depict the feelings of discontent in the area because of the heavy-handedness of the police, the recession and other problems at the time. The lyrics refer to a Brixton-born son of Jamaican immigrants who ""feel[s] like Ivan...at the end of ""The Harder they Come"""", referring to Ivanhoe Martin's death in the 1972 film ""The Harder They Come"". Simonon was originally doubtful about the song's lyrics, which discuss an individual's paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged to continue working on it by Joe Strummer."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was not initially released as a single, but a version of the song, taken from the remastered version of ""London Calling"" and remixed by Jeremy Healy, was released by CBS as a CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl entitled ""Return to Brixton"" in July 1990 (catalog number 656072-2). It reached #57 on the UK Singles Chart."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was a mainstay in the Clash's live set. When performing the song live, Simonon would switch instruments with Strummer because he was unable to play the bass line whilst singing lead vocals at the same time."
"A somewhat heavier, faster version than the one found on ""London Calling"" appeared on the 1999 live compilation """"."
"Norman Cook (also known as Fatboy Slim) sampled the bass line for Beats International's 1990 song ""Dub Be Good to Me"", which became a #1 hit in the UK. Simonon, interviewed by Scott Rowley in October 1999 for ""Bassist Magazine"", said that he ""was surprised that it became number one that was quite shocking. And the fact that it was my performance that they had lifted. The smart thing would've been to copy it and change it slightly, but they just lifted it straight off. So, really, I have done ""Top of the Pops"", but I met up with Norman [Cook] and we came to an arrangement which was much needed at the time. But I thought it was a really good idea and it was quite reassuring for that to happen to my first song."""

= = = Reflective subcategory = = =
"In mathematics, a full subcategory ""A"" of a category ""B"" is said to be reflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor from ""A"" to ""B"" has a left adjoint. This adjoint is sometimes called a ""reflector"", or ""localization"". Dually, ""A"" is said to be coreflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint."
"Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any ""missing"" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect."
"A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B-object ""B"" there exists an A-object formula_1 and a B-morphism formula_2 such that for each B-morphism formula_3 to an A-object formula_4 there exists a unique A-morphism formula_5 with formula_6."
"The pair formula_7 is called the A-reflection of ""B"". The morphism formula_8 is called the A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about formula_1 only as being the A-reflection of ""B"")."
This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor formula_10 is a right adjoint. The left adjoint functor formula_11 is called the reflector. The map formula_8 is the unit of this adjunction.
The reflector assigns to formula_13 the A-object formula_1 and formula_15 for a B-morphism formula_16 is determined by
the commuting diagram
"If all A-reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms, then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective. Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms."
"All these notions are special case of the common generalization—formula_17-reflective subcategory, where formula_17 is a class of morphisms."
"The formula_17-reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest formula_17-reflective subcategory containing A. Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc."
An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A-reflection arrow are those that are already in A.
"Dual notions to the above-mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory."

"Cosmos atrosanguineus, the chocolate cosmos, is a species of ""Cosmos"", native to Mexico. It has often been claimed that it is extinct in the wild; however it is ""quite abundant"" in Mexico. The species was introduced into cultivation in 1885, when the British seed company Thompson & Morgan first listed it in their seed catalogue. Its dark red to brownish red flowers have a scent resembling chocolate, which is one reason for its popularity as a cultivated plant."
"""Cosmos atrosanguineus"" is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with a fleshy tuberous root. The leaves are 7–15 cm long, pinnate, with leaflets 2–5 cm long. The flowers are produced in a capitulum 3-4.5 cm diameter, dark red to maroon-dark brown, with a ring of six to ten (usually eight) broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; they have a light vanillin fragrance (like many chocolates), which becomes more noticeable towards the end of the day."
"The species was first described in 1861 by William Hooker, as ""Cosmos diversifolia"" var. ""atrosanguineus"". Eduard Ortgies later elevated it to a full species, placing it in the genus ""Bidens"". Andreas Voss transferred it back to ""Cosmos"", retaining its status as an independent species. It is one of eight species of ""Cosmos"" placed in section ""Discopoda"". ""Cosmos"" belongs to subtribe Coreopsidinae."
"In 2008, Oku, T.; Takahashi, H.; Yagi, F.; et al. analyzed the Chocolate Cosmos flower using PSID (plastid subtype identity) sequences in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of this plant. They determined that this species did indeed have closer relations to ""Cosmos"" than to the genus of ""Bidens"" or ""Dahlia."""

"Priory Meadow Shopping Centre is a shopping centre in Hastings, East Sussex, England. The centre was opened in 1997 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The local radio station Arrow FM, which was founded in 1998, broadcasts from the centre."
"The building was built on the site of the Central Recreation Ground, which had originally opened in 1864 and had since remained the main cricket venue in the town. This history is reflected by the statue in Queens Square of a batsman holding a pose having played a shot (""The Spirit of Cricket"" by Allan Sly). The observant shopper will be able to spot the ball that this batsman has hit (it can be seen in the wall above F. Hinds jewellers)."
"The land on which the shopping centre now stands had been underwater before the 13th century, and was the original harbour for Hastings. A series of severe storms, silting and sea erosion forced the town to move to where the current old town is. The Priory Valley eventually silted up completely and the area became known as Priory Meadow and turned into farmland in 1536."
"In 1864 the Priory Marshes were levelled and drained and opened as a Cricket Ground, by 1932 one corner of the ground was leased by the Maidstone and District bus company to use as a coach station, then in 1958 a row of shops was built on one side of the ground with seating above."
"In 1982 Hastings Council voted for a shopping centre to be built on the cricket ground and to move cricket to Summerfields, now Horntye Park. In 1987, planning permission for 420,000sq.ft of space for shops was granted. Due to the onset of recession, developer Speyhawk pulled out.

"Grahame Park, located on the site of the old Hendon Aerodrome in North West London, is a north London housing estate in the London Borough of Barnet, including 1,777 council homes built in the 1970s."
"The estate is named in honour of Claude Grahame-White, the pioneer of aviation who established the original aerodrome and aviation school on the site."
"The building of the estate was a joint project between the Greater London Council and Barnet Council. The plan was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1964, and the first family moved in on 23 October 1971. Sir Roger Walters was the Chief Architect and Gordon Wigglesworth was the Housing Architect."
"A typical characteristic of the estate was the plain, square, brick terraced houses and long winding low-rise flats, with flat roofs, also known as ""Brick Brutalist"" style. Most building names, walkways and roads on the estate have names linked to the aviation history of the site."
Not all of the old aerodrome was sold off for development; the Royal Air Force Museum is situated immediately to the south-east of the estate (with free entrance).
"A secondary road called Grahame Park Way, a typical 1970s-style collector road, runs along the eastern margin of the estate, parallelling the Midland Main Line (Thameslink) railway, and beyond that, the M1 Motorway."
The estate became the sole site of St. James Catholic High School in 1996.
"London Underground Colindale station, on the Northern line Edgware branch, is within comfortable walking distance of at least the south-east corner of the estate. The next tube station north, Burnt Oak is also accessible. Mill Hill Broadway Thameslink station lies to the north, a bus ride away. Several bus routes run into or near the estate."
"In the late 1980s, the estate went through its first regeneration process, which split the blocks of flats into smaller blocks, by removing connecting walkways, and added pitched roofs to many of the buildings."
"In 2003, residents voted in favour of a full regeneration of the estate. The Housing Corporation earmarked £15 million for the redevelopment."
"The redevelopment is managed by Choices For Grahame Park, a subsidiary of Genesis Housing Association, with new houses being built by Countryside Properties."

"Baldwin 60000 is an experimental steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in 1926, during the height of the railroading industry. It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin."
"It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is ."
"60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks."
"This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more. In 1933, it was purchased by the Franklin Institute Science Museum for $1 and remains there today."
"After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons."
"Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades."
"In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption."
"On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q, the AT&SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad."
"In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal."
"Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute."

"Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. (, known in English as the Pilsner Urquell Brewery, is a Czech brewery founded in 1842 and headquartered in Plzeň, Czech Republic. It was the first brewery to produce pale lager, branded as Pilsner Urquell; the popularity of Pilsner Urquell resulting in it being much copied so that more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today is pale lager, sometimes named ""pils"", ""pilsner"" and ""pilsener"" after Pilsner Urquell. The brewery name, ""Pilsner Urquell"", which can be roughly translated into English as ""the original source at Pilsen"", was adopted as a trademark in 1898. Pilsner Urquell is the largest beer producer in the Czech Republic and is also the largest exporter of beer abroad."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in October 2016, Pilsner Urquell (excluding certain geographical areas) was sold to Japan based Asahi Breweries in March 2017."
"The brewery was founded in 1839 by both local Czech-speaking and German-speaking citizens in Bohemian city of Plzeň as (citizens' brewery, later translated to ""Měšťanský pivovar"" in Czech). The first beer was brewed here in 1842 by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll. In 1859, “Pilsner Bier” was registered as a brand name at the local Chamber of Commerce and Trade. In 1869, a competitor was founded as a joint stock company, later known as Gambrinus. In 1898 the German trademark ""Urquell"" and Czech trademark ""Prazdroj"" were created, to underline the claim of being the older, original source of Pilsner beer. In 1932 ""Měšťanský pivovar"" merged with ""Plzeňské aciové pivovary"". In 1946, the brewery was nationalized under the name ""Plzeňské pivovary"" (Pilsen breweries)."
"After the fall of communism in late 1989, the brewery was turned into a public share company, then renamed in 1994 after the Czech name of their famous beer, ""Plzeňský Prazdroj"". In 1999, they started to merge with "" Pivovar Radegast a.s."" and ""Pivovar Velké Popovice a. s.""."

Wickham was the World Champion for the 400 m and 800 m freestyle in 1978, and won gold in both events at the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. She is a former world record holder for the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle. Despite her success in the pool, Wickham has battled hardship and personal tragedy throughout her life."
"Wickham began swimming at the age of eight at John Rigby’s pool in Brisbane and mastered her technique under the guidance of Peter Diamond. At the age of thirteen, she was selected to be on the Australian team for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games but failed to reach the finals at that meet."
"In 1977, Wickham’s family moved to California, where she trained for six months with coaching legend Mark Schubert. She returned to Brisbane at the end of 1977 and she came under the guidance of coach Bill Sweetenham at the Commercial Swimming Club. On 8 February 1978, Wickham broke her first world record, the 1500 m freestyle, in a solo swim at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, clocking 16:14.93."

Wickham maintains that she withdrew from the team because of illness, as she was suffering glandular fever at the time, not because of the boycott. The 800 m freestyle was won by fellow Australian Michelle Ford at that meet."
"Wickham retired at the end of 1979 due to financial problems. The policy of amateurism was upheld by the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia during this period, meaning Wickham could neither earn money from the sport nor receive any prizes."
"Wickham returned to swimming in the early 1980s under coach Laurie Lawrence. She won gold in the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she took the Athletes Oath at the Opening Ceremony. Her gold medal for the 400 m was presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II and Wickham retired from swimming immediately afterwards."
"Following the birth of her daughter, Wickham dived back into the water in May 1990, again with Lawrence as her coach. She competed in the 7.6 km open water race from Magnetic Island to Townsville, placing first in the female division. She also won the female division of the Lake Trasimeno 20 km marathon race. She retired for good following the birth of her son in January 1992."
"She was educated at the All Hallows' School, in Brisbane along with her sisters Julie and Kelly. Wickham married in 1986 and had two children, Daniel and Hannah. She divorced her husband in the mid-1990s."

= = = Tarr = = =
"Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 1909–11, revised and expanded in 1914–15 and first serialized in the magazine ""The Egoist"" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards—especially in its English form—as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there ""is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter"". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis' own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler."
"The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier ""Egoist"" version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: ""Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?"" (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them."
"Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010."

"Albelin has, over the course of a 24-year professional career, played a total of 952 games for three NHL teams: the Quebec Nordiques, the New Jersey Devils, and the Calgary Flames. Albelin was drafted 152nd overall by Quebec in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft. Before joining the club he played five seasons for Djurgårdens IF in the Swedish Elitserien, winning the Swedish championship in his first year (1982–83). Albelin left for Quebec upon the conclusion of the 1986-87 season. He played a year and a half for the Nordiques before being traded to New Jersey. It would be with the Devils that he would play 10 seasons for and win two Stanley Cups, in 1995 and 2003. In 1996, he was traded to Calgary, but he signed to play with New Jersey again in 2001.

Albelin announced his retirement from hockey on 29 July 2004, however the Devils re-signed him in December 2005 (abbreviating his retirement after he had practiced with the team as an unsigned player for nearly half the season). He finished out his final year in 2006 playing for the Devils."
"On 25 July 2007, Albelin was hired by the New Jersey Devils as an assistant coach to head coach Brent Sutter. It was his first NHL coaching job."
"On 10 August 2010, Albelin was named assistant coach of the Albany Devils, the AHL affiliate of the New Jersey Devils. On 9 September 2014, following Scott Stevens' decision to step down from a coaching position in New Jersey, Albelin was promoted to be an assistant coach under Peter DeBoer in the 2014-15 season."

= = = Witteric = = =
"Witteric (; Portuguese and Galician: ""Viterico""; 565 – April 610) was the Visigoth King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia. He ruled from 603 to 610."
"The first mention of Witteric in history was as a conspirator with Sunna, the Arian bishop of Mérida, to reestablish Arianism in 589. While Sunna was sent into exile, it is unknown what happened to Witteric. In the spring of 602, Witteric was given command of the army with the job of expelling the Byzantines. However, when it came time to do so in the Spring of 603, Witteric instead led his troops against King Liuva II, counting on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. He invaded the royal palace and deposed the young king. Witteric cut off the king's right hand, and then had him condemned and executed in the Summer of 603."
"During his reign, the Visigoths fought the Byzantines. However, Isidore of Seville is dismissive of Witteric's accomplishments, writing that ""although he frequently fought battles against the Roman soldiers, he did not win any adequate glory except for capturing some soldiers at Sagunto with the help of his generals."" The campaign against Sagunto probably took place in 605. It was probably during his reign, as well, that Bigastrum (near Cartago Nova) was taken, as its bishop appears in a council of Toledo in 610."
"In the twelfth year of his reign, king Theodoric II sent for bishop Aridius of Lyons and the constable Eborin to ask Witteric for his daughter Ermenburga's hand in marriage. Although the envoys gave their word that she would not be disowned by Theodoric, and she was received by Theodoric in Chalon-sur-Saône (606), his grandmother, the regent Brunhilda and Theodoric's sister Teudila (or Teudilana) did not provide a welcoming reception. Theodoric then disgraced Ermenberga by sending her back without her dowry. Incensed, Witteric entered into a quadruple alliance with Theodobert II of Austrasia, Clotaire II of Neustria, and Agilulf of the Lombards to effect his deposition and death. Despite their mutual fear of Theodoric, their alliance did not accomplish anything; according to Fredegar, ""Theodoric got wind of it [the alliance] but treated it with utter contempt.""."
"In April 610, a faction of Catholic nobles conspired against Witteric and assassinated him during a banquet. His body was dragged ignominiously through the streets and he was later buried without the honors corresponding to his status. The nobles then proclaimed Gundemar, Duke of Narbonne, king."

= = = Proteus (2003 film) = = =
"Proteus is a film by Canadian director John Greyson. Although the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003, it did not have a general theatrical release until 2005."
The film is based on an early 18th century court record from Cape Town.
"The film also attempts to explore unanswered questions, such as why prison officials tolerated the relationship for a full decade before Blank and Jacobsz were executed. (In an interview packaged with the DVD release, John Greyson notes the real Blank and Jacobsz began their relationship when they were very young - Blank having been imprisoned on Robben Island at age 16 - and were actually known to be a couple for twenty years before they were charged with sodomy and executed, when they were both nearly 40.) Intentional anachronisms - such as transistor radios, electric typewriters and jeeps - are also used in the film to illustrate Greyson's larger theme that homophobia and racism of the type that led to Blank's and Jacobsz' executions are still very much present in today's world. These twentieth-century objects, including modern (c. 1964) dress on many occasions, are invariably presented in juxtaposition with eighteenth-century items. The eighteenth-century prison commandant, for example, is replaced by a former subordinate, who wears a twentieth-century guard's uniform and is often accompanied by a fierce-looking Alsatian on a short lead. A 'wetbag' is seen, as it was used as a torture devise in Apartheid South Africa."
"An extract from the speech Nelson Mandela made at his sentencing hearing in 1964, before he was imprisoned on Robben Island, is displayed at the end of the film."
= = = Garth Fagan = = =
"Gawain Garth Fagan, CD (born 3 May 1940) is a Jamaican modern dance choreographer. He is the founder and artistic director of Garth Fagan Dance, a modern dance company based in Rochester, New York."
"Fagan was born in Kingston, Jamaica to Oxford educated S.W. Fagan, former Chief Education Officer of Jamaica, and Louise I. Walker. It was a gymnastics class that initially drew his attention to dance early on. While attending Excelsior High school, he studied with Ivy Baxter at the Jamaica National Dance Company and performed at the inauguration of Cuban President Fidel Castro in 1959. Fagan was educated at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with sights on becoming a psychologist."
"Fagan worked at several dance companies in Detroit, and moved to Rochester New York in 1970, and there established his dance company originally named the ""Bottom of the Bucket BUT ... Dance Theatre"" in 1970. He was a Professor, at State University of New York, Brockport starting in 1970. Fagan choreographed for the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and the Limón Dance Company in the 1970s. He has studied the works of Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Pearl Primus, Alvin Ailey, José Limón, and Katherine Dunham. He is also influenced by Caribbean and West African dances."
"Fagan's choreography incorporates elements of modern dance, ballet, Afro-Caribbean dance, and social dance. Many of his works are autobiographical or include themes of personal relevance. His untitled 1977 work chronicles the dissolution of his marriage, showing a couple beginning a relationship with affection and passion but eventually drifting apart due to inevitable obstacles. ""Griot New York,"" which premiered in 1991 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is about the experiences of the underprivileged living in New York City. The piece juxtaposes linear balletic movement with sharp angular gestures, twitching, and erotic partnering to represent the diversity and contrast found in big cities as well as conflict in his own life. In ""Moth Dreams,"" choreographed in 1992, Fagan celebrates his childhood, adolescence, and relationship with his mother."
"Fagan resides in Rochester, New York, is now divorced, and has two children."
"Fagan is a Distinguished University Professor at the State University of New York at Brockport. He has a Bachelor of Arts from Wayne State University, and earned a Doctor of Fine Arts from the University of Rochester in 1986, and holds ""honoris causa"" Doctors degrees from Juilliard School, Hobart College, William Smith College, and Nazareth College."
"Fagan received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1998, and a three-year Choreography Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. He was made Commander in the Order of Distinction of Jamaica in August 2001, and was presented the Prime Minister's Award by Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson ."
In 2005 he received the Artist of the Year Award from the Arts & Cultural Council for Greater Rochester.
"In 2012, Fagan was named one of America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures by the Dance Heritage Coalition."

It stands in of parkland which includes one of the two privately owned deer parks to remain in Shropshire and is notable for its population of red kites.
"The estate is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The core of the present house dates from the 17th century, though significant remodelling was carried out throughout the 19th century. The ruins of an earlier castle, built in 1340, survive in the grounds."
"The north front was built in 1712 by Sir Edward Leighton, 2nd Baronet, who moved his family seat here from Wattlesborough Castle, and was High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1727. In 1805, the 5th Baronet entertained the Prince Regent and the Duke of Clarence at Loton. Sir Baldwin Leighton, 6th Baronet was wounded in the American War of Independence, was a Brigadier in Portugal and Governor of Carrickfergus Castle."
"The house is currently the home of Sir Michael Leighton, 11th Baronet."
The estate is also prominent in motorsport as the location of the Loton Park Hill Climb.
"Loton Hall is a Grade II*-listed building, dated c.1670. A country house, originally with a U-shaped plan, a large wing was added to the southeast in 1872–73. The house is built in red brick with dressings in red and grey sandstone and a tile roof. The earlier part has a plinth, quoins, chamfered, coped and parapeted gables with finials. There are two storeys, a basement and attics, and a front of five bays, the outer bays projecting and gabled. In the centre is a three-bay loggia-porch that has arches with imposts, Tuscan columns, an entablature, and a balustrade. Above, the central window has Corinthian columns and a broken triangular pediment containing a cartouche, and above that is a gabled half-dormer. The later wing to the right has one storey with attics, and nine bays, and contains gables, mullioned and transomed windows, and a full-height canted bay window."

The alt attribute is the HTML attribute used in HTML and XHTML documents to specify alternative text (alt text) that is to be rendered when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered.
"The alt attribute is used by ""screen reader"" software so that a person who is listening to the content of a webpage (for instance, a person who is blind) can interact with this element. Every image should have an alt attribute to be accessible, but it need not contain text. It can be an empty or null attribute: codice_1."
The attribute was introduced in HTML 2 and in HTML 4.01 was required for the codice_2 and codice_3 tags. It is optional for the codice_4 tag and the deprecated codice_5 tag.
"Here is an image for which the alt attribute is ""In the sky flies a red flag with a white cross whose vertical bar is shifted toward the flagpole."""
The HTML for this image might be something like the following:
"A visually impaired reader using a screen reader such as Orca will hear the alt text in place of the image. A text browser such as Lynx will display the alt text instead of the image. A graphical browser typically will display only the image, and will display the alt text only if the user asks it to show the image's properties or has configured the browser not to display images, or if the browser was unable to retrieve or to decode the image."
"An alternative alt attribute value would be ""The Danish flag""."
"Morphisms in monoidal categories can also be drawn as string diagrams since a strict monoidal category can be seen as a 2-category with only one object (there will therefore be only one type of planar region) and Mac Lane's strictification theorem states that any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. The graphical language of string diagrams for monoidal categories may be extended to represent expressions in categories with other structure, such as braided monoidal categories, dagger categories, etc. and is related to geometric presentations for braided monoidal categories and ribbon categories. In quantum computing, there are several diagrammatic languages based on string diagrams for reasoning about linear maps between qubits, the most well-known of which is the ZX-calculus."

"Lewis Archer Boswell (May 9, 1834 – November 26, 1909) was an early aviation pioneer who some believe made the first powered heavier-than-air flight, before the Wright Brothers."
"Born May 9, 1834 in Lunenburg County, Virginia, Boswell went to study at Thomas Jefferson University and later Johns Hopkins University, earning his medical degree. During the Civil War, he worked as a Confederate surgeon in Richmond, Virginia."
"In 1868 Boswell began experimenting in aeronautics, but supposedly threw his small model into the Yazoo River that same year. It is unknown why he did this, although speculation points to the purpose of hiding his plans or ending local ridicule. He moved to Eastaboga, Alabama in 1869 with his new wife, where he was granted a patent for an in 1874."
"While he continued his study until his death on November 26, 1909, it is unknown if he ever built a full-scale model and attempted flight. In 1900, he wrote a letter to the Secretary of War, asking for funding and promising results, but it was rejected. Locals in his area have made claims that he actually did fly in November 1902, beating the Wright Brothers by a year. In fact, at the time of his death, Boswell was pursuing lawsuit against them, but this action was never carried through by his estate. Other stories tell that he made a short flight after being rolled off a barn roof back in the mid-1890s. However, no conclusive proof has surfaced to support these claims."
"In 2002, the local airport in Talladega, Alabama was renamed Boswell Field in honor of the local aviator, and according to the Airport Board Chairman, if Boswell made the first heavier than air flight, that would make Boswell Field the first airport."

In an early scene, Sam passes Andrew a headset which is playing the song ""New Slang"" by the Shins as she says ""You gotta hear this one song — it’ll change your life; I swear."" A second Shins song, ""Caring Is Creepy"", is also featured on the soundtrack. The presence of Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" on the soundtrack has been cited by some as evidence of a connection to ""The Graduate""."
"The song ""Orange Sky"" by Alexi Murdoch was also featured in the movie, but did not appear on the soundtrack, as the rights to the song were owned by Fox's ""The O.C."" It was played between ""New Slang"" and ""I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You"" in the film.

"Early lenses suffered from flare and low contrast, worsening as the number of lens-air interfaces increased. The introduction of and improvements in anti-reflective coatings vastly reduced flare; some many-element lens designs which had been abandoned due to low contrast in spite of otherwise excellent performance became practical."
"Lenses designed for use with monochromatic film, first orthochromatic, then panchromatic, had less exacting requirements regarding chromatic aberrations than when colour film is used. When using older lenses today one should check that chromatic aberrations and flare are acceptable for the application."

"Becky Lourey (born September 24, 1943) is an American politician, a former Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) state senator and state representative, and a former Minnesota gubernatorial candidate. Her son, Matt, served in the U.S. Army and was killed on May 27, 2005, as a result of injuries received in combat over Buhriz, Iraq, where he was serving in his second tour of duty."
"Lourey was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1990, running against a long-time incumbent Republican, and became the first woman to represent her rural district. She was re-elected in 1992 and 1994. She ran for and was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1996, again defeating a veteran incumbent, later becoming chair of the Senate Health and Family Security Committee and earning a reputation as an expert on health care."
"Lourey did not run for re-election in 2006. Her son, Tony, held her former seat until 2018, after which he was appointed to Governor Tim Walz's cabinet."
"Lourey announced her candidacy for Governor in November 2005. She lost the DFL Party endorsement to Attorney General Mike Hatch, gaining the support of 31% of the delegates on the first ballot, with 38% voting for Hatch and 29% voting for Steve Kelley. She withdrew from the endorsement process after the third ballot after falling behind Kelley, with Hatch's vote total increasing. She subsequently ran an opposition campaign against Hatch in the September primary, losing with 24% of the popular vote."
"Lourey's gubernatorial campaign health care platform was the Health Care Security Plan, which included the details to put a universal health coverage system in place in Minnesota by 2010. That system would have been voluntary, not mandatory as was the Massachusetts health program that was enacted into law in Spring 2006. The platform also included other state-level health reform proposals, including the current Minnesota Medical Association's proposal."
"At the heart of the Lourey health care plan was an expanded and reformed ""MinnesotaCare"", a state program providing health insurance coverage for low-income Minnesotans that she, along with several others, had authored in the state legislature in 1993. Under her Health Care Security Plan, all Minnesotans would have been eligible to join the new MinnesotaCare by 2010. Employers could participate by offering their employer plan via the new BusinessCare program to be created as part of the revised MinnesotaCare. There were several cost containment measures in Lourey's Health Care Security Plan, including a requirement that any HMOs, private health insurers or Third Party Administrators receiving contracts to administer state-funded health plans spend no more than 5% on administrative expenses."

"I am a defeated and ruined war captive, that's it! The former emperor [Taizong] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury at me. In the past I have heard that Han law stipulates that executions of men be carried out in the city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [the tomb of the previous Tang emperor Taizong] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire."
"Gaozong received Helu's plea and agreed to his request, despite a Tang law ordering the execution of captured rebel generals and kings. In accordance with Confucian rituals, he was sent to Taizong's tomb where Gaozong spared his life, and then to the capital's Ancestral Temple where the captive was presented again, mirroring ancient rituals celebrating victorious armies. Helu felt disgraced by Taizong and committed suicide a year later while still in captivity. He was buried in a mound decorated with a stele outside the emperor's park. The tomb served as a military trophy, visible to the emperor's visitors entering the park, symbolizing the loyalty of the qaghan to the emperor and the Tang military victories against the Western Turks."
"The conquest strengthened Tang rule over modern Xinjiang, administered by the Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously under the control of the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the Altai Mountain region under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman Bridle Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control."
"Su continued his career as military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized like many of the other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought in a wave of Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor."
"The sheer size of the newly conquered lands made it difficult to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued for the remainder of the Tang Dynasty."
"At its maximum extent, Tang expansion brought China into direct contact with the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Aksu in 717 and the Battle of Talas in 751. Though victorious in 717, the Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world."
"The Tang emperor Gaozong installed two puppet qaghans, the cousins Ashina Buzhen and Ashina Mishe, and controlled the region by proxy. Buzhen and Mishe were enemies of Helu who had aided Su Dingfang during his campaign against Helu and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Gaozong divided the ten tribes of the area among the two cousins. Buzhen governed half of the tribes located in the west, while Mishe governed the other half located in the east."
"The son of Buzhen, Khusrau, and the son of Mishe, Yuanqing, resided in Chang'an, the capital of Tang, while their fathers administered the former khaganate as qaghans. Empress Wu Zetian sent Yuanqing and Kusrau westward in 685 to succeed their fathers as proxy rulers."
"Neither of the qaghans were able to successfully exert control. Turkic tribes resisted Yuanqing's rule, defeating the qaghan and forcing Yuanqing to return to Chang'an. Kusrau was able to bring the western tribes temporarily under his rule, but was defeated in 690 during an invasion by the Second Turkic Khaganate, and he too was forced to escape the region with his loyalists. Later attempts to install puppet qaghans failed, and the title was reduced to a symbolic position in the Tang court."

"Saint Mark's English Church is an Anglican church in Florence, Italy."
"The church forms part of the chaplaincy of St Mark's Florence with St Peter's Siena, which also includes a congregation in Bologna, in the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England."
"The chaplain is Father William Lister. The average congregation is about 150. The church ministers to the homeless in Florence. It is also used for classical music concerts and opera, with a resident opera company."
"St Mark's was founded by the Reverend Charles Tooth as a centre of worship for Anglo-Catholic members of the Anglican Church in Florence. He started a house church at 1 Via dei Serragli in 1877 to teach Anglo-Catholic principles and celebrate the Holy Eucharist daily during the week. In 1880, Tooth purchased a 15th-century palazzo to meet the new congregation's needs. John Roddam Spencer Stanhope designed and created the wall and ceiling decorations at his own expense. The first Holy Eucharist was celebrated there on 1 May 1881, although chaplain and church were not licensed for service by the bishop until 1884. The premises were extended by the purchase of 16 Via Maggio in 1906."
"The church was damaged by the 1966 Flood of the Arno River, resulting in the loss of George Frederick Bodley's 19th-century stencil work on the lower walls, although some survived behind a display cabinet."
"St. Mark's was the second Anglican church to be built in Florence. The British community in Florence has a long history and the chaplaincy began in the late 1820s. The first church, Holy Trinity, opened in the 1840s. Rebuilt in the 1890s, Trinity Church on the Via Lamarmara, is today a Waldensian Church."
"The white marble statue in the niche over the main door is ""Apotheosis of Saint Mark"" (2007–8) by Jason Arkles. This is the first work by an American sculptor to have a permanent public location in Florence."
"The building was altered by Tooth, who turned the ground floor into a church with nave, aisles, transept and chancel, about long and seating 400. The interior is decorated in the Pre-Raphaelite style and the upper reaches of the church have floral motifs with, as described by art historian Berenice Schreiner, ""a wonderful sense of naturalism""."

= = = Imperial Monumental Halls and Tower = = =
"The Imperial Monumental Halls and Tower was a proposed Gothic complex designed for a site in London adjacent to Westminster Abbey. The plans, exhibited at the Royal Academy in March 1904, included a tower that would have dominated the Clock Tower and Victoria Tower of the nearby Houses of Parliament. It was never built."
"The design by John Pollard Seddon – then diocesan architect for London – and Edward Beckitt Lamb (son of Edward Buckton Lamb) was based on earlier schemes that each had proposed separately, and was one of many extensions proposed for Westminster Abbey in late 19th and early 20th centuries by architects such as George Gilbert Scott, George John Shaw Lefevre, James Fergusson, and Henry Travis. In particular, the clergy at Westminster Abbey were concerned that the church was becoming crowded with monuments, and more space was needed. Some of the proposed designs were considered by a Royal Commission in 1891. The issue was given added impetus after the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902 by a desire for Westminster Abbey to become a fitting Imperial monument, to compete with the baroque St Paul's Cathedral where Queen Victoria had commemorated her Diamond Jubilee in 1897."
"The architects aspired to create a grand and expensive monument to ""form a worthy centre to the metropolis of the Empire 'upon which the sun never sets' "" ."
"The complex was planned to be joined to the Great Cloister of Westminster Abbey, leading to a reception hall beneath the tower, with the main body of the building - the Great Monumental Hall - stretching along Great College Street, incorporating smaller side halls. The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, wide and deep."
"The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells. It was intended to hold monuments and imperial trophies in galleries on the lower floors, with archives on the upper floors."
"It would have been the tallest building in the UK, significantly higher than the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey itself, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament close by."
"The scheme of work would have included the completion of the tower over the crossing at Westminster Abbey. ""The Builder"" magazine criticised the scheme as exhibiting a degree of megalomania ."

"Gilbert Jesse Brown (born February 22, 1971) is a former American football player. A nose tackle who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (1993–99, 2001–03), Brown played 125 Packers games (103 starts) recording 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. Nicknamed ""The Gravedigger,"" in honor of his celebratory dance following a thunderous tackle, Brown played in 15 Packers playoff games. He was a major contributor on strong defenses during the mid-1990s. His best season was 1996, when Green Bay won Super Bowl XXXI. He was also part of the Kansas team that won the 1992 Aloha Bowl, and was selected for the All-Academic Big Eight team in 1991."
"Gilbert grew up in Detroit, Michigan with parents Leroy and Ann Brown, older brother Wes, and younger siblings, Sheri, Tommy and Anna (all of whom went to college and became athletes). Like Leroy, Gilbert was athletic and fast. Even his brothers could not run home before Gilbert if he was craving a biscuit."
"During his career at Mackenzie High School, he recorded 189 tackles and 19 sacks. His senior year culminated in all-state honors. Brown also lettered in track, competing in the shot put. He graduated from high school in 1989."
"Back in high school, Gilbert never looked at big-time football factories such as Michigan. He wanted to get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, ""The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other."""
"With the Jayhawks, Brown helped build a winning program along with fellow defensive lineman and future NFL first round pick Dana Stubblefield (Kansas went to the Aloha Bowl in '92). But Brown went through more difficult times during his college years: a friend Brown had just met on campus died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis, and Brown's father died of congestive heart failure during Brown's senior year."
"He started all but 2 games in four seasons at the University of Kansas (1989–92), and was tied for sixth in school history in tackles by a defensive lineman with 168, fifth in career tackles for loss with 30, and had 7½ career sacks. He finished second on the team in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles recovered in 1991 while helping the Jayhawks hold opponents to an average of 150.9 yards per game on the ground, which was the best run defense at Kansas since 1968 at the time. A year earlier, as a sophomore, was named as the Jayhawks’ ‘Co-Defensive Most Valuable Player’ and earned second team All-Big Eight Conference recognition. Brown started nine games at nose guard as a freshman...An All-Academic Big Eight selection in 1991."
"He came up with the ""Gravedigger"" move at Kansas—after a big defensive hit, he would dig an imaginary grave, which became his trademark and nickname."
He majored in human development.
"Brown was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first training camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, picked him up on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament. Again in 1995, he played, but an elbow injury cut that season short. In 1996, he started all 16 games next to Santana Dotson, Sean Jones and Reggie White, a defensive unit that allowed a league record low 19 touchdowns. Brown had a career-high 51 tackles, and his first complete 16 game season."
"Brown became a fan favorite, partly because he was easy to spot, and partly because of his eccentric gravedigger dance. During the 1996 season, it became known that Brown would regularly order the ""Gilbertburger"" — a Double Whopper with extra everything, cut in half with extra cheese, no pickles — always obtained from the Oneida Street Burger King in Green Bay. Burger King even made it available for a short time as a promotion in Wisconsin Burger King restaurants."
"Brown was a highly sought after free agent after the 1996 season, but he elected to take a pay cut to stay with the Packers. On February 18, 1997, he signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract, which was 10 times his 1996 salary, but was about $1 million less than the offer he received from Jacksonville. He said that he would rather stay with the team and fans that he knew and loved."
"Many people thought that he started getting bigger around that time, and thought that he was as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. ""That was outrageous, I never got that big,"" said Brown. ""The biggest I ever got up to was maybe 350, something like that."" But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994."
"After playing all 16 games during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he spent the 2000 season out of football after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, ""If I didn’t think I could do this anymore, I wouldn't be here""."
"Brown had two good years after his return to football. However, he ruptured a biceps during the 2003 pre-season, but played on without having surgery. He recorded 14 tackles, one fumble recovery (the first of his career) and one pass defensed. In a victory over Chicago (Dec. 7), Brown posted a season-high four stops, along with a pass breakup."
"On March 2, 2004, the Packers released Brown. He had played 125 Packers games (103 starts) with 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. He also played in 15 Packers playoff games. In franchise history, only Brett Favre (22), Mason Crosby (18) and Aaron Rodgers (16) have more."
"Gilbert was featured in the ""Sports Illustrated"" special, ""Where Are They Now?"", featuring former professional athletes and what they are up to. Brown is currently a co-owner of the Milwaukee Mile, a racetrack that is often used for NASCAR races and at one time was the Packers' part-time home field. Gilbert even claims that he will occasionally fit his massive frame inside a race car and take a few laps."
"Gilbert, with the strong influence of his mother and family, felt that he wanted to give something back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish. In 2002, he combined his love for cars with his desire to give back when he organized a car show, Gilbert Brown and Friends, in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, which benefited the Make-a-Wish Foundation."
"Galesville, Wisconsin establishment Champions Sports Bar and Grill has a burger named in Brown's honor: the Gravedigger burger, which weighs in at 93 ounces (just over 5¾ lbs). The weight of the burger is a callback to Brown's jersey number, which was 93."

"Vokrug sveta (, literally: ""Around the World"") is a Russian geographic magazine. It is the longest running magazine in the Russian language. The first issue was printed in Saint Petersburg, in December 1861, almost thirty years before the establishment of the ""National Geographic Magazine"". Thus, it is one of the oldest popular science magazines in the world. Release of ""Vokrug sveta"" was suspended twice: from 1918 to 1927, during the Russian Revolution, and from 1941 to 1945, during World War II. Nevertheless, the magazine always resumed and continues to be published to this day."
"The magazine was conceived by a Warsaw-born entrepreneur, Boleslaw Wolf, who defined ""Vokrug Sveta"" as a lavishly illustrated yearly publication, dedicated to ""physical geography, natural sciences, the most recent discoveries, inventions and observations"". Its roster of authors included: Alfred Brehm, Camille Flammarion, Nikolai Przhevalsky and Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai."
"The Wolf edition was discontinued after 1868 for unclear reasons, but the project of a popular geographical journal was revived in 1885 by Ivan Sytin, a printer who directed his periodicals toward a wider audience. Sytin's ""Vokrug sveta"" was issued monthly and featured original translations of popular adventure fiction from such authors as Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle."
"The Russian Revolution brought this period of the magazine's history to an abrupt termination. Like many other periodicals of Imperial Russia, ""Vokrug sveta"" suspended publication for ten years. It was back in print under the auspices of the Young Communist League, specifically targeted toward the youth audience. Contributing editors included some of the finest Soviet science fiction authors, including Alexander Belayev, Vladimir Obruchev and Ivan Yefremov. In 1938, the magazine's headquarters relocated, from Leningrad to Moscow and its publication was altogether suspended during World War II."
"For Soviet readers, ""Vokrug sveta"" represented a rare source of authentic, fully illustrated information about foreign cultural attractions. This is despite the insistence of Soviet officials that the magazine should cover domestic tourist attractions, rather than those situated outside the USSR. In the 1960s and 1970s, the magazine continued to grow in popularity and increased the circulation to 2,300,000 copies by 1971. A television subsidiary was also popular, particularly in the early 1990s. As of 2007, ""Vokrug sveta"" ranks third among Russia's popular monthlies, with a circulation hovering around 250,000.

From 2006-02-06 to 2007-07-17, Claman was joined in the 10-11am hour by Mark Haines (who reported from the New York Stock Exchange), and in the 11am-noon hour by various anchors, including Dylan Ratigan (see anchor roster below)."
"On July 20, 2007, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded ""Squawk on the Street"", due in part to Claman's departure from the network (which she joined Fox News Channel's sister network financial unit three months later). Dylan Ratigan and Trish Regan served as interim anchors for the program, which was completely revamped on 2007-07-23. In addition to the aforementioned 2007-07-23 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to ""Squawk Box""."
"On August 8, 2007, the show was renamed—and replaced—by ""The Call"". The name change to ""The Call"" with Dylan Ratigan (who left the show in late 2008 and was replaced by Larry Kudlow), Melissa Francis, and Trish Regan on that date was due in part to avoid confusion with the early-morning Bloomberg Television program of the same name."
"The following segments below were carried over to ""The Call"" as of 2007-08-08:"
"The following segments below moved to the second hour of ""Squawk on the Street"" as of 2007-07-23:"
"Occasionally, ""Morning Call"" was broadcast live on location, such as the NYMEX. One of these examples came on May 31, 2007, when this program was named ""Morning Call"", Liz Claman anchored the entire 2-hour program from the NYMEX (along with Haines at the NYSE for the first hour and Ratigan at CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ for the second hour). She was joined on location at the NYMEX by Sharon Epperson on the day the weekly crude oil, gasoline, distillate, and natural gas inventories report were released by the EIA."
"Lambie was known for his eccentricity, cigar smoking and fondness for pigeons. An occasion when he instructed for a concussed player to be told he was Pelé and sent back onto the pitch is one of the most famous quotes in British football."
"Born in Whitburn, Lambie played for his hometown junior team Whitburn before signing for Falkirk in 1958, where he turned professional and switched position from inside forward to full back. In August 1969 he joined St Johnstone, where he played in the October 1969 Scottish League Cup Final (1–0 loss to Celtic) and took part in the Perth-based club's first European campaign (reaching the third round of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup)."
"After retiring as a player in 1974, Lambie joined the St Johnstone coaching staff, and later moved to Hibernian. He became assistant manager at Hamilton Academical to his former Hibs colleague Bertie Auld, and succeeded him as manager in 1984. He led the ""Accies"" to the First Division title in 1985–86 and won away at Rangers in the next season's Scottish Cup."
"In 1988, Lambie was appointed manager for the first time at Partick Thistle, but a year later returned to Hamilton, before going back to Partick in 1990. He led the ""Jags"" to promotion to the top flight in 1992 and left in 1995 for his former club Falkirk, but quit his post in March 1996. ""The Herald"" wrote in 2002 that ""It is odd how, despite Lambie playing over 200 games for Falkirk, and scoring a decent haul of goals as a defender, he is only remembered for his disastrous managerial reign""."
"Lambie returned for a third spell at Partick in 1999, with the club now in the third tier, and got them into the Scottish Premier League in 2002 via back-to-back promotions. Also in 2002, he guided the club to the Cup semi-finals, where they lost 3–0 to Rangers at Hampden Park. The final stages of the season were chronicled in the BBC Scotland fly on the wall documentary ""Grasping the Thistle"", known for Lambie's use of profanity."
"In January 2003, Lambie announced that he would retire at the end of the season as he did not agree with new regulations in football; he had attempted to sign Nathan Lowndes and Steven Ferguson on loan from English clubs but was barred by FIFA as they had both recently played in Scotland for other teams. On 17 May 2003 he made his farewell in his last game at Firhill Stadium, a 1–0 loss to Dundee United, having already guaranteed survival in the SPL on a considerably lower budget than their competitors. He became a member of the club's board and had a brief fourth spell as manager from December 2004."
"Lambie is remembered for his reaction when Partick player Colin McGlashan suffered a concussion; he ordered his assistant Gerry Collins to ""Tell him he's Pelé and get him back on"". A book of football quotes titled ""Tell Him He's Pelé"" was released in 2010. He is also remembered for taming Chic Charnley, a player sent off 17 times in his career, whom he signed once for Hamilton and three times for Partick."
Lambie was known for his love of pigeon racing and cigars. He spoke of the importance of his Christian faith in his life. He was a member and activist for the Scottish National Party but said that he was not a suitable candidate to seek elected office.
He was awarded the position of Honorary Vice President of Partick Thistle F.C. in August 2006. He was inducted into the Halls of Fame at both Falkirk and Partick Thistle.
"Lambie had three daughters with his wife Mamie, from whom he was separated at the time of his death at the age of 77 on 10 April 2018."
= = = Psyclon Nine = = =
"Psyclon Nine is an American band formed in 2000 in San Francisco, CA, known for their unique blend of electronic, industrial metal and black metal. Originally, Psyclon Nine's music was aggrotech. However, the band has since evolved a more industrial/black metal sound."
"Psyclon Nine's main music contributor is lead vocalist, lyricist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Nero Bellum, who is the only remaining original member. In 2009, Psyclon Nine's fourth album We the Fallen was the band's first and only album to chart on the Billboard Charts."
"Psyclon Nine began in 1999 when roommates, Marshall Goppert and Josef Heresy created an industrial metal music project called ""Defkon Sodomy"", influenced by bands like KMFDM and Ministry. The band only performed under that name twice before changing it to Psyclon Nine. The name was a malapropism of Zyklon B, the trade name of hydrogen cyanide used in the gas chambers during the Holocaust. The “Nine” was used because of the number's significance in Aleister Crowley’s numerological writings. Around this time, Marshall and Josef took on their stage names as Josef Heresy, and Nero Bellum. Nero's name was taken from the Roman Emperor Nero Caesar, and Bellum is Latin for war."
"Bellum met with European NoiTekk record label executive Marco Gruhn at a San Francisco Grendel show, and persuaded him to sign Psyclon Nine. The band's first album Divine Infekt was recorded shortly thereafter, produced and engineered by Da5id Din of Informatik. The title track was remixed by Tactical Sekt and the album was released on September 15th, 2003."
"Psyclon Nine toured lightly on the west coast in the United States and in Europe. They supported acts such as Dismantled, Nocturne, and Martin Atkins."
"Bellum later said in an interview for Vampirefreaks about the Divine Infect remix, ""Tactical Sekt's remix left a bad taste in my mouth"", and attributed that to Anthony Mathers of Tactical Sekt in which his philosophical beliefs made him not want to collaborate with anyone outside of Psyclon Nine again."
"In 2004, Psyclon Nine signed with the American industrial record label Metropolis and returned to Da5id Din's studio for mixing. INRI was released on April 26, 2005 on both Metropolis and NoiTekk Records. The album featured thirteen tracks of dark, aggressive electro focused on religious themes. The album also featured a cover of the Ministry song “You Know What You Are.”"
"In 2005, Nero Bellum met Rotny Ford of the industrial metal band Nocturne on the social networking site LiveJournal. The two discussed musical ideas which led to the band using guitars and drums in their live performances. Ford joined the band on keyboard and guitar."
"Psyclon Nine made several major live appearances following the album's release, including several dates opening for Mindless Self Indulgence. The tour gained the band a fan base. Psyclon Nine returned to Europe for another tour that included a spot on the world's largest Gothic festival, Wave-Gotik-Treffen. It was around this time when drummer Abby Nex, who was also from Nocturne, joined the band as a live drummer."
"At the end of 2005, the band had dropped from their European label NoiTekk and Eric Gottesman quit the band. Gottesman was replaced by members of the industrial rock band Columbine: keyboardist VII and bassist Daniel Columbine."
"With the release of Crwn Thy Frnicatr in 2006, Psyclon Nine began to stray from their early aggrotech sound into a darker black metal / industrial metal approach."
"In late 2006, the band was featured on the cover of the German Gothic magazine Orkus."
"Psyclon Nine went on their first headlining US tour, which eventually led to creative differences between the band and Columbine bassist Daniel. Daniel decided to leave the band at the end of the tour. Abbey Nex replaced him on bass, and Mushroomhead drummer Daniel Fox was used as a live fill-in drummer."
"In early 2007, the band opened for Mushroomhead's 'Savor Sorrow' North American tour which gained the band huge attention among the underground extreme metal / industrial dance scene."
"In May 2007, Psyclon Nine did a European tour that included a spot again at Wave Gotik Treffen. After the European tour, Rotny Ford decided to leave the band for personal reasons."
"In October, the band opened for Mushroomhead again on their second North American tour with Josef on guitar and keys, Abbey on bass, VII on synth, and Daniel on drums."
"In early 2008, the band released its first music video of the fan favorite track 'Parasitic' directed by Mushroomhead's Richard Thomas."
"After the tour with Mushroomhead, Josef Heresy decided to leave the band to go back to college, and VII left to return to his band Columbine. Daniel Fox continued with Mushroomhead. At this time, Nero Bellum decided to move to Los Angeles, CA to begin writing a new album."
"Nero Bellum appeared on the internet channel NoisescapeTV in 2008 and said that he was in the studio working on an album entitled We the Fallen, and has decided to stray away from the harsh EBM music style and incorporate a more black metal meets dark ambient sound."
"Spilsbury, descended from Mormon settlers in Mexico, spent much of his childhood in Arizona, where his father was a football coach, first in the high school ranks and then at Arizona State Teachers College (now Northern Arizona University). After his father left Northern Arizona, the family returned to Mexico, settling in Colonia Juárez. The younger Spilsbury briefly attended Brigham Young University before moving to Hollywood to attempt to break into acting."
"Using the name Max Keller in 1979, he moved to New York City, where he did a few minor bit parts on a few daytime soaps."
"Klinton Spilsbury's dialogue in ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" was dubbed by actor James Keach. Considerable controversy surrounded Spilsbury at the time of the film's release, in part because of the studio's treatment of Clayton Moore, star of the popular 1950s TV series, who was prevented through legal action from wearing his black mask during personal appearances. Controversy also was due to Spilsbury's on-set antics, which included fighting with crew members and being uncooperative and combative during the production. It was the only film Spilsbury made. For his performance in this film, Spilsbury received the 1981 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor."
"Andy Warhol interviewed Spilsbury during his promotion tour, later describing the interview as ""nutty,"" because Spilsbury was ""blowing his whole image"" during their conversation. Spilsbury told Warhol that, before making the movie, he had been an art student married to a rich woman and that they had a baby together. He went on to state that they did not spend much time together because he needed too much time with his own thoughts, a detail that Warhol found amusing. Spilsbury told Warhol that he was a friend of actor Dennis Christopher and had fallen in love with him, and that he also had later fallen in love with actor Bud Cort. Warhol described Spilsbury as ""very drunk"" during the latter part of the interview, and the latter also mentioned that ""he'd been picked up by Halston and woke up in bed with Halston."""
"An article about him in ""The Los Angeles Times"" in 1989 revealed that he had spent some time in Europe and was working as a model. He had hopes to revive his career as an actor, but admitted in the article that he was not having much luck. He has intermittently coached acting workshops at the Herpolscheimer Academy in Vancouver."
"In 2013, when a reboot film, ""The Lone Ranger"" starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer was released, Spilsbury was sought out by media sources but declined to comment. According to ""Variety"", Spilsbury was working as a photographer in Los Angeles at the time."

= = = Let's Go to Bed (The Cure song) = = =
"""Let's Go to Bed"" is a song by English rock band the Cure, released as a stand-alone single by Fiction Records in November 1982. In the aftermath of the dark ""Pornography"", Robert Smith returned from a month-long detox in the Lake District to write the song, the antithesis to what the Cure currently represented. It was later included on the album ""Japanese Whispers""."
"The single was a minor success in the UK (peaking at No. 44) but was a top 20 hit in both Australia and New Zealand in 1983, reaching respectively No. 15 and No. 17."
"The origins of ""Let's Go to Bed"" lie in ""Temptation"", one of the demos for ""Pornography"". The song is a relatively upbeat, guitar-driven instrumental. In August 1982, soon after Simon Gallup's departure from the band, Smith demoed a vocal version of the track, entitled ""Temptation Two"", a psychedelic piece not far removed from the ""Pornography"" album but somewhat lighter in tone. At the end of the song, Smith sings a string of wordless syllables, nearly identical to the ""doo doo doo""s of the later song. The song version was debuted on Kid Jensen's radio show on 27 November 1982, as a take which was very close to the final version that appeared as a single in the same month."
"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Robert Smith discussed the initial reaction when playing the song to Fiction Records: However, the song became a success much to Smith’s surprise. Later on in the same interview he said"
"On 15 March 1983, the song was the first broadcast for the pioneering Boston-based alternative rock radio station WFNX. When WFNX was sold and ceased broadcasting on 20 July 2012, ""Let's Go to Bed"" was selected as the station's final broadcast."
"AllMusic described the song as ""antic, herky-jerky new wave pop"", while ""Pitchfork"" called it ""bratty, funky synthpop""."
"The song's music video was the band's first collaboration with Tim Pope, who would go on to direct several more videos for the group. The video features members Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst, who at that point were the only members of the Cure – the only instance in the band's history where the band officially had a two-person lineup. Pope’s video treatment displayed the band’s more whimsical side, something absent from the band’s early work. In his book, Tolhurst also recalls that he was dancing naked behind the screen as a shadowy silhouette."

= = = Emperor Duzong = = =
"Emperor Duzong of Song (2 May 1240 – 12 August 1274), personal name Zhao Qi, was the 15th emperor of the Song dynasty in China and the sixth emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He was a nephew of his predecessor, Emperor Lizong, and reigned from 1264 until his death in 1274."
"His birth name was Zhao Mengqi but his name was changed to Zhao Zi in 1251 and finally to Zhao Qi in 1253 after he was designated as Emperor Lizong's heir apparent. Duzong's reign was filled with rebellions and warfare; the court was dominated by his chancellor Jia Sidao and Duzong himself gave in into drinking and women, thus abandoning his duties. He died in 1274 leaving behind three young boys, one of whom took the throne as Emperor Gong. He is the last Emperor of the Song to issue coins; subsequent Emperors were too busy fighting the Mongols to establish mints to cast any coins and did not have enough resources."
"Emperor Duzong's mother wanted to have an abortion because she thought she was of low social status so she took drugs in an futile attempt to abort Duzong. Duzong was born anyway but the drugs affected him in many ways such as that his intelligence was lower than an average person, his hand and feet were soft; using them in an awkward fashion and he couldn't even speak until he was seven years old. He was Yurui's only son. Like his uncle Zhao Yun, he lived in Shaoxing."
"Duzong was discovered by his paternal uncle Zhao Yun, better known as Emperor Lizong in 1253, who was sonless and therefore had no heirs so to compensate, adopted Duzong and designated him crown prince in 1260, an action historians still view as confusing. Emperor Lizong died in 1264 and Emperor Duzong then ascended the throne."
"Emperor Duzong's reign was plagued with rebellions, warfare and corruption in his court; many officials accused the chancellor Jia Sidao of corruption but Duzong trusted Jia Sidao who Duzong honoured by bowing down to Jia even calling him ""teacher"" and according to anecdotes, when Jia was considering resigning, Duzong knelt down in tears begging Jia to remain in office."
"Emperor Duzong ignored his duties and instead delegated all state and military affairs to the hands of Jia Sidao; the emperor instead indulged in drinking, women, and lived in opulence. To make things even worse, Duzong’s intelligence was lower than a normal person and he was often depressed. At first, he told the officials to be straightforward and tell him the problems in the countries, but this was all an act. Soon, he completely neglected his duties. Furthermore, he had a very high sexual appetite. Under Song laws, any woman who had sexual relations with the emperor had to pay respects to the emperor every morning. At one point, there were as many as 30 women paying their respects to Emperor Duzong in one morning. Duzong also gave official documents to four of his most favored women."
"The Mongols had spent decades harassing the Song Empire's borders and were on the verge of conquering the whole of China. Emperor Duzong however, ignored this problem instead choosing to drink and indulging in sex because when Duzong heard that Xiangyang was being besieged by Mongol troops, Duzong asked Jia Sidao ""I hear that Xiangyang had been besieged by the Yuan troops for several years. Is this true?"" in which Jia said in all seriousness ""Well, I haven't heard such a thing."" Duzong replied with ""A palace maid told me this."""
"Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong, to request immediate reinforcements to defend Xiangyang. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor but upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements. The decisive Battle of Xiangyang was fought in 1274 when the Mongols succeeded in capturing and destroying the last Song stronghold. The loss of Xiangyang sealed the fate of the Song dynasty and the news of its capture was deliberately hidden from Emperor Duzong by Jia Sidao."
"Emperor Duzong died shortly thereafter from overindulgence in wine but Richard Davis and other sources claim that, Duzong died suddenly from a severe negligence of a Palace Doctor. In any case, he was succeeded by his sixth son, Zhao Xian (Emperor Gong), who was then only four years old. Although Emperor Duzong was technically not the last emperor of the Song dynasty, historians see him as the last Song emperor who could have made decisions that would've significantly halted or even prevented the fall of the dynasty."
Emperor Duzong was buried in the Yongshao Mausoleum on January 1275.

"The Armenian Native Faith, also termed Armenian Neopaganism or Hetanism (Armenian: Հեթանոսութիւն ""Hetanosutiwn""; a cognate word of ""Heathenism""), is a modern Pagan new religious movement that harkens back to the historical, pre-Christian belief systems and ethnic religions of the Armenians. The followers of the movement call themselves ""Hetans"" (Armenian: հեթանոս ""Hetanos"", which means ""Heathen"", thus ""ethnic"", both of them being loanwords from the Greek ""ἔθνος"", ""ethnos"") or ""Arordi"", meaning the ""Children of Ari"", also rendered as ""Arordiners"" in some scholarly publications."
"The Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of ""Tseghakron"" (Ցեղակրօն, literally ""national religion"") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist Garegin Nzhdeh. It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a climate of national reawakening, when the Armenologist Slak Kakosyan founded the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (""Arordineri Ukht""). Neopaganism expert Victor Schnirelmann estimated the following of Armenian neopaganism to be ""no more than a few hundred people""."
"The first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (or ""Ara""; ""Arordineri Ukht"" in Armenian) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936–2005). He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from Soviet Armenia; in 1979 he fled to the United States where he became familiar with the ideas of Garegin Nzhdeh (1886–1955)."
"Nzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and ""fedayi"" of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of Armenia, and is still one of the driving forces of Armenian nationalism. Kakosyan praised him as the ""prophet of the Armenians"". Nzhdeh founded a movement named ""Tseghakron"" (""religion of the nation""), which was among the core doctrines of the Armenian Youth Federation. In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as Atlas upholding the ordered world, and it makes reference to Hayk, the mythical patriarch of the Armenians, and to Vahagn, the solar and warrior god ""fighter of the serpent"", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide of 1915."

"Barin and Jatindranath Mukherjee alias Bagha Jatin were instrumental in the recruitment of many young revolutionaries from across Bengal. The revolutionaries formed the Maniktala group in Maniktala, Kolkata. It was a secret place where they started manufacturing bombs and collected arms and ammunition."
"Following the attempted killing of Kingsford by two revolutionaries Khudiram and Prafulla on 30 April 1908, the police intensified its investigation which led to the arrest of Barin and Aurobindo Ghosh on 2 May 1908, along with many of his comrades. The trial (known as the Alipore Bomb Case) initially sentenced Barin Ghosh and Ullaskar Datta to death. However, the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, by Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Barin was deported to the Cellular Jail in Andaman in 1909 along with other convicts."
"Barin was released during a general amnesty in 1920 and returned to Kolkata to start a career in journalism. Soon he left journalism and formed an ""ashram"" in Kolkata. He published his memoirs ""The tale of my exile - twelve years in Andamans"". In 1923, he left for Pondicherry where his elder brother Aurobindo Ghosh had formed the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He was influenced by Aurobindo towards spirituality and Sadhana. Barin returned to Kolkata in 1929 and again took up journalism. In 1933 he started an English weekly, ""The Dawn of India"". He was associated with the newspaper ""The Statesman"", and in 1950, he became the editor of the Bengali daily ""Dainik Basumati"". This time he got married. He died on 18 April 1959."

"""Residence may refer to various parts of English law including taxation, immigration, and family law. This article deals exclusively with English family law. See residence in English law for disambiguation."""
"In family law, the Court can order a Residence Order of the Family Court under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 following the breakdown of a marriage and determining where the children are to live and with whom. The order can be sole or joint, and if joint, it can be made to a couple regardless whether they are married. If a residence order is granted, this automatically gives him, her, or them parental responsibility for the child(ren) which will continue until the order terminates (usually this will be until the child(ren) reach their sixteenth birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying a longer period)."
The following can make an application for a Residence Order under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 as of right:
"If an applicant cannot apply for the Order as of right, (e.g. they are wider family members such as grandparents etc. who wish to seek orders for their grandchildren), they can make an application to the court seeking leave to issue the application. In deciding whether to grant leave, the court will consider, amongst other things:"
"As a matter of public policy, the courts have always operated under the doctrine of ""parens patriae"" to make the best interests of any children their first and paramount concern. From time to time, this doctrine has been included in statutes, the most recent relevant version being section 1 of The Children Act 1989 which requires the court to consider the ""welfare checklist"". Before making a section 8 order (i.e. a residence order) the court must consider:"
"A child is not automatically a party to the proceedings and will be represented by a Guardian ad litem unless the court considers it necessary. If a Guardian is appointed but the children and the Guardian do not agree on what recommendations to make to the court and the children are of sufficient age and understanding, they will be able to instruct a solicitor directly to represent their views and the Guardian will present an independent view to the court. Whether or not a Guardian is appointed, the court can request a Welfare Report under section 7 of The Children Act 1989, either from the local authority where the child currently resides or from a Children and Family Reporter who is an officer appointed by CAFCASS. The report will usually inform the court of the child's wishes and feelings, but the officer will recommend what he or she thinks is in the child's best interests in the circumstances of the case rather than just advocate the child's wishes."

"In April 2005, the New York City based Film Forum premiered an ""expanded"" version featuring several restored scenes, along with a new musical score by Christopher Caliendo. This expanded version was actually the 136-minute cut authorized by producer Jerry Bresler before he left Columbia Studios. Recently unearthed in Sony Pictures' archives, the restored version played in selected cities in North America and has been released on a Region 1 DVD. All of the cuts were edited out of the released version at the last minute; it is highly unlikely that Peckinpah's director's cut will ever be fully restored."
"Restored scenes are listed below. These include both brief inserts and additions to existing scenes, as well as four major scenes restored to the film."
"Available as extras on the DVD are an unfinished knife fight scene between Potts and Gomez in a Mexican village, a longer version of Teresa and Dundee's interlude at the lake, and several silent outtakes – including a master shot which would have opened the massacre scene at the beginning, of Lt. Brannin and his men riding past a sheep farmer to the Rostes Ranch."
"For the 2005 restored version, a new score was composed by Christopher Caliendo. This score was composed and recorded with a small studio orchestra to authentically sound the way director Peckinpah might have approved it had he been alive at the time of the film's restoration, and the way the music might have been done in its original 1965 release as opposed to today's larger orchestra-type scores. The new score is regarded by some critics as being better than the original, which was disliked by film experts and featured the title song performed by the Mitch Miller Sing-a-Long Gang, though many concede the new music is far from perfect; for example, there has been criticism of Caliendo's decision to leave unscored several sequences which did have music in the original version."
"Upon its theatrical release, ""Major Dundee"" received generally negative reviews while acknowledging the film's potential. In his review in ""The New York Times"", Eugene Archer wrote that the film had ""an interesting cast, a superior visual texture, unexpected bits of character revelation and a choppy continuity that finally negates its impact."" He praised Peckinpah for ""seeking a fresh approach to the Western"" and acknowledged that the director ""displays a fine eye for panoramic vistas."" Archer concludes:"
"Many of the flaws identified by film critics in 1965 were addressed in the 2005 restored version, and film reviews of the DVD are much more positive. In his review in ""Alt Film Guide"", Dan Schneider called ""Major Dundee"" ""a near-great film that has a checkered history"" and ""likely the most gritty and realistic Western ever made."""
"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% positive rating from top film critics based on 32 reviews, and a 67% positive audience rating based on 3,478 ratings. Metacritic, another review aggregator, reports a score of 62/100 based on 12 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews""."

"The Volkswagen Bratislava Plant is an automotive factory and co-located test track in Bratislava, Slovakia owned by Volkswagen Group."
"Funded by the ruling Communist Party to expand car production across Czechoslovakia, it agreed a partnership in 1969 with Italian automaker Alfa Romeo, but the proposed new-model was never developed beyond the clay-mock-up."
"On 1 July 1971, Bratislavské Automobilové Závody (BAZ) was founded, sub-contracted to produce Škoda Auto models, but with all pressings and parts supplied by the Czech-based partner. The factory began producing the Mladá Boleslav-designed 731 (saloon) and 732 (station wagon), as well as other BAZ marketed small (MNA) and medium-sized trucks (SNA). Later vehicles developed included the 3-door Locusta coupé."
"After developing a partnership with Tatra, the company also produced military vehicles, including the popular Praga V3S."
"BAZ vehicle production ended in 1982, when the production of the Škoda Garde was started, with the resultant development of the factory spurring the construction of new apartment blocks in the borough of Devínska Nová Ves. However, parts supply from the parent plant in the Czech Republic was slow, resulting often in a number of part-finished vehicles being held in storage, often awaiting singular parts. The factory later produced the Škoda Rapid 130/135/136, as well as a variety of parts for other car manufacturers in Czechoslovakia."
Some prototypes from BAZ can be seen in Museum of Transport in Bratislava.
"After the fall of the Iron Curtain, in May 1991 Volkswagen Group bought an 80% share of BAZ. Skoda Auto production continued, and was expanded to include other models within the VW Group portfolio, initially the Volkswagen Passat. In 1998 Volkswagen Group bought out the remaining company shares, and renamed the company Volkswagen Slovakia. Volkswagen then bought the remaining shares in Skoda Auto in 2000."
"Since VW developed their large SUV platform, the factory has become a specialist producer of all VW Group marques large SUV's, which presently include the Audi Q7 and the Volkswagen Touareg, and the co-designed Porsche Cayenne which is based on the same platform. It is also the only VW Group factory to produce the Golf Syncro four-wheel drive. Since December 2011 the factory has produced the VW up!, as well as the badge-engineered SEAT Mii and Škoda Citigo for European markets."
"The factory area of the plant currently covers an area of . Bodies are assembled and welded in one of two body shops, and then painted with one of 26 standard colours in the paint shop. The co-located Aggregate/Modules hall produces gearboxes for both on-site consumption and various models of the VW Group brands. The bodies are moved to the assembly hall, which covers an area equivalent to 21 football pitches, where the painted body is mated with the pre-assembled under-body and chassis. The VW Group and Porsche models then split."
"The Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Toureg and Up! variants are completed by installing the finishing components including wiring, wheels, seats and the steering wheel. The final assembled SUV is then transported via cable car to the co-located test track for a final on-road test. If the car then passes a further inspection, it is prepared for dealer delivery."
"Since 2016, the Bentley Bentayga has also been produced at Bratislava."
"DHL handle all shipping and distribution arrangements from the site, via railway (70%) or road. Aside from on-site body pressings, gearbox production, and various under-body and drive train components sourced from the Martin plant; 90% of parts are delivered to site from Volkswagen's component consolidation centre in Wolfsburg, Germany, shipped directly to site via 10 daily trains."
"First and second generation Porsche Cayenne models were sent direct to shipping once the body has been mated with under body. They were then shipped directly by rail to the Porsche factory in Leipzig, Germany, where interior fitting out, finishing and inspection were completed. Third generation Porsche Cayenne are being completely produced, and finished directly in Bratislava."

"TLRC sold Win FM to the Tindle Radio Group in September 2006, and the new owner rebranded the station as Dream 107.2 in October 2007, adopting a soft adult contemporary music policy."
"With extensive competition in the South Hampshire marketplace from numerous regional rivals - including Ocean (now Heart), Wave 105 and Original 106 (now 106 Sam FM) - Dream 107.2 struggled to build an audience, and Tindle Group subsequently decided the station was not viable as a business and should be sold off."
"In November 2008, Tindle Radio Group sold Dream 107.2 to Town & Country Broadcasting, who sought and received permission to largely absorb the Winchester service into their existing Radio Hampshire service at Southampton. The Winchester studios were closed and the 107.2 FM Winchester frequency switched to sharing content with Southampton's service 20 hours a day.

The Quay broadcast from studios on Twyford Avenue in Portsmouth.
"Portsmouth F.C. subsequently entered into a joint-venture with TLRC to run the station (along with Spirit FM in Chichester and Isle of Wight Radio), with the club taking full control of The Quay when the partnership was dissolved in August 2009 (TLRC retained Spirit FM) and renaming the station Quay Radio."
"In the summer of 2010, Portsmouth F.C. went into administration; Quay Radio was shut down at noon on Friday 30 July 2010 as a result. The station was sold to Celador Radio Broadcasting, who announced that following their purchase of the frequency, 107.4 FM would broadcast as part of The Breeze 107 from the end of July 2010."

It was the brainchild of County Sound CEO, Mike Powell who successfully lobbied the IBA for permission to put separate programming for the Haslemere district on what was originally intended to be a relay transmitter for Guildford's County Sound. The station was launched by County Sound's Terry Mann, formerly Programme Director of Radio 210, Reading."
"After County Sound merged with Radio Mercury to form Allied Radio, Delta Radio was closed down by its new owners in 1992 and the transmitter went back to being a relay. However, when Mike Powell's UKRD Group won the Guildford licence (after it came up for renewal), Delta Radio was relaunched in 1996. Wey Valley Radio had already been operating as a full-time service in nearby Alton and Four Marks since 1992. This station was launched as a ""community"" station by David Way and Paul Mann after years of campaigning for such a licence. David Way and Paul Wisdom are the new Wey Valley Radio licence holders today. It was acquired by UKRD in 1994."
"The decision to merge the two stations operationally was made in 1998 and the Wey Valley service was renamed Delta, and then in 2000, the Haslemere licence (which had previously been a part of the Surrey and North East Hampshire franchise) was merged with the Alton licence to finally form a single radio station."
"On 28 May 2009, Radio Hampshire ceased broadcasting due to Town & Country Broadcasting deciding to sell the station. On 5 June 2009, the two licences for Radio Hampshire in Southampton and Winchester were acquired by internet station Play Radio UK."
"The new station for Southampton and Winchester, named Play Radio, launched on the 107.2 and 107.8 FM frequencies at 10am on 4 July 2009. As under Radio Hampshire, the station operated a split breakfast programme (one for Southampton and one for Winchester), with all other programming shared across the two frequencies."
"In April 2010, the licences were purchased by Celador Radio Broadcasting for an undisclosed sum."
"It was announced on 21 June 2010 that the service would be relaunched as The Breeze 107. The new station would be aimed at upmarket 40- to 59-year-olds and broadcast classic and contemporary easy listening music with a slight female bias. It was also announced that the station would relocate, leaving its longtime base at St. Mary's Stadium to share facilities with sister regional station Jack FM in the Kingsway area of Southampton."
"Celador subsequently sought and received permission from Ofcom to end the split breakfast programme, meaning that as of the Breeze relaunch, listeners in Southampton and Winchester were receiving identical programming at all times."
"The Breeze 107 launched on-air to Southampton and Winchester on 4 July 2010, exactly a year after its predecessor Play Radio had officially replaced Radio Hampshire."
"In late July 2010, following Celador's purchase of the Portsmouth licence, the broadcast area of The Breeze expanded."

"Erta Ale (or Ertale or Irta'ale) is a continuously active basaltic shield volcano in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia. It is situated in the Afar Depression, a badland desert area. Erta Ale is the most active volcano in Ethiopia."
"Erta Ale is high, with one or sometimes two active lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow on the south side of the volcano. It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906). Volcanoes with lava lakes are very rare: there are only eight in the world."
"""Erta Ale"" means ""smoking mountain"" in the local Afar language and its southernmost pit is known locally as ""the gateway to Hell"". In 2009, it was mapped by a team from the BBC using three-dimensional laser techniques, in order for the mapping team to maintain a distance and avoid the lakes' searingly hot temperatures."
"Erta Ale is centered over the East African Rift system, which is a triple junction setting whose movements are resulting in the formation of a pull-apart basin or rift. The volcano comprises mainly mafic material which has been brought up to the surface caused by unroofing of the mantle due to this rift formation."
"There was a major eruption on 25 September 2005 which killed 250 head of livestock and forced thousands of nearby residents to flee. There was further lava flow in August 2007, forcing the evacuation of hundreds and leaving two missing. An eruption on 4 November 2008 was reported by scientists at Addis Ababa University. Another eruption was reported in January 2017."
"Not much is known about Erta Ale, and the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth, making travel difficult and dangerous. The Afar region also experiences intermittent ethnic violence due to unification struggles by the native Afar people. On January 16, 2012, a group of European tourists was attacked at Erta Ale. Five tourists were killed, two taken as hostages and seven others wounded. The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) claimed responsibility for the attack and released the two kidnapped tourists in March 2012. One travel guide recommends hiring ""one or maybe two armed guards or police"" as guides to visit Erta Ale. Commercial tour companies offer tours to Erta Ale which are generally accompanied by military escort."

The album was produced by Jason Miller of Godhead and was released on September 9, 2009. It reached the top Billboard 500 sales and was sold in every Hot Topic store in the United States, which gave the band huge exposure across the nation."

"Around the same time, Nero Bellum announced on Psyclon Nine's Facebook page that the band's new album would be titled """", and would be released in November 2013 with the help of the band's Bandcamp website page that allowed fans to donate to help raise funds for the album's production. In return, fans would receive different sorts of merchandise. Chris Vrenna of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails helped produce a few tracks on the album."
"After a long hiatus, Psyclon Nine went on their first US tour in over four years co-headlined with Dawn of Ashes. Both Rotny Ford and Jon Siren returned, along with two musicians who were new to the band. They were Glitch Nix on synth, and Merritt Goodwin, on Bass."
"On November 12, 2013, Psyclon Nine released ""Order of the Shadow: Act I"" through Metropolis Records. The album continued the industrial black metal fusion previously heard on We the Fallen, but was heavily influenced by industrial rock, notably Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar and Nine Inch Nails's The Downward Spiral."
"In February 2014, the band released a music video for the track 'Use Once and Destroy' on YouTube."
"On March 11, 2014, Psyclon Nine released a remix album entitled """". It featured remixes of from Falling Skies, Die Sektor, Alien Vampires, Dismantled, Misfit Toys, Modern Weapons, and Life Cried."
"The band had booked a European tour for May 2014, however the merchandise from Bandcamp was never shipped to the people who donated. This left many fans to believe that Nero had stolen from them once again."
"After the Bandcamp controversy, Rotny and Jon posted on the official Psyclon Nine Facebook page that both had quit the band due to Nero disappearing again, stating they felt he was irresponsible. Jon left a very apologetic letter to the fans on his personal Facebook page, explaining again how he and Rotny had nothing to do with the Bandcamp donations."
"On March 30, 2014, Nero Bellum explained on his personal Facebook page that he was in therapy and was unable to send out the Bandcamp orders. Due to Rotny and Jon quitting the band and other misunderstandings, Nero felt it was time to put an end to Psyclon Nine, canceling their European tour."

The reformed lineup featured Nero Bellum (vocals), Dorian Starchild (guitars), Ashes (guitars), and Raanen Bozzio (drums). They went on to do a few more shows (including a show at Bar Sinister in May 2015), resulting in Psyclon Nine returning as a live band. Raanen Bozzio was subsequently replaced by Anthem on electronic drums."
"During mid to late 2015 and throughout 2016, Psyclon Nine resolved their former Bandcamp and Kickstarter merchandise controversies by partnering with merchandise management company Black Umbrella based in Las Vegas, NV. Psyclon Nine's Bandcamp page was also given a major graphical update in late 2015 and continues to carry older legacy merchandise along with signed albums and new apparel designs for fans to purchase. All merchandise shipments to fans have returned to a normal schedule of being sent out every Saturday."
"On October 30, 2016, Psyclon Nine performed a special live set featuring songs exclusively from Divine Infekt, INRI and Crwn Thy Frnicatr. They played alongside label mates Dawn of Ashes for the first time in 3 years. Nero Bellum was also brought on stage during Dawn of Ashes' song ""Poisoning The Steps of Babel"" to provide vocals during his verse featured on the album. Nero also provided backing vocals during the chorus."
"On December 22, 2016 via Psyclon Nine's Facebook and Instagram pages, they announced the reissuing of their first album entitled ""Divine Infekt"".

In early 2018, the new album was officially confirmed and is entitled ""Icon of the Adversary: Act 2"". The band debuted the first new single from the upcoming album called ""Crown of the Worm"" during a live performance in Downey, CA on February 24 as well as a teaser via Nero Bellum's official YouTube channel. The new album is tentatively planned for release in August 2018. The band also released a new shirt design via their Bandcamp page based on one of the songs entitled ""Beware the Wolves"". In June 2018, via the band's official Facebook page, tour dates for ""Tour of the Worm"" were announced."
"Icon Of The Adversary was released on August 24, 2018 through Metropolis Records. Described as, ""the epitome of dark metal industrial,"" with violent, mechanical drums, scathing vocals, punishing guitars and evil electronics.

= = = Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos = = =
"Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on Nine Network on 3 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its first and only episode on the order of network owner Kerry Packer."
"""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) ""America's Funniest Home Videos:"" viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the ""funniest"" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show."
"The producers often received racy or risqué videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience."
"It differed from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""'s theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30 PM and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"The show followed the same structure of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray. Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as ""The most sensational collection of home videos since Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently."" Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"LSI conducts Quick Counts during General Elections and District Head Elections (Pilkada.) The vast and geographical nature of Indonesia tend to cause delayed announcements of election results—typically, those results can only be known around 2 weeks or even 1 month after the election. Once, people required a significant amount of time in order to finding out the victors of such elections, and this can cause a less than conducive atmosphere on the political situation on areas where those elections are held. Participants of the elections may take numerous visits to the office The General Election Commission (KPU) demanding the results—visits that are often accompanied with violence and demonstration, which in turn will cause a domino effect on the stability of the region (either economically or socially.) These undesirable possibilities of outcomes can be mitigated by using Quick Count: a rapid counting method using scientifically collected results from voting locations (TPS) during elections Done correctly, Quick Count can achieve a result with less than 1% margin of error compared to the official results announced by the General Election Commission (KPU). Through Quick Count, result calculation can be finished very rapidly—at the very least, only 4 hours after the votes are officially collected and counted the results can already be summarized and concluded."
"Since 2005, LSI has conducted hundreds of Quick Counts and made the results available via press conferences and national television channels TV One and Metro TV. The Indonesia Museum of Record (MURI) gifted LSI with various awards such as (1) The Quick Count Accuracy for Sumbawa Election on November 2010 with 0% margin of error when compared to official results. . Before that record, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia has also achieved a record for Quick Count results for the District Head Election on East Tanjung Jabung, Jambi, with only 0.05% difference when compared to the official results (2) The Fastest Announced Accurate Quick Count results (1 hour post voting period ends) on 2009 Presidential Election. This Quick Count was broadcast live by TV One. (3) The first 100 times successively accurate Quick Count results"
"Since 2005, LSI has conducted national surveys to gauge public opinion regarding various public issues/policies, such as democracy, Islam, tolerance and the performance of public institutions."
"Quick Poll is a type of survey introduced by LSI in 2011. Quick Poll results are routinely broadcast by TV One every Mondays and Thursdays Quick Poll displays results on how public view recent, up-to-date cases and issues. Quick Poll is a quick survey of public opinion. The main point of difference is that the interview is not done face to face but rather by utilizing handsets connected to all selected respondents. In order to create a representative group of respondents (representing targeted populations in Indonesia), the Quick Poll is conducted in three steps. The first step is the respondent selection process. In this first step, respondents’ characteristic data will be recorded as comprehensively as possible—from job, income, household expenditure, religion, race, education, and any other relevant information. This data includes not only the selected respondent but also his/her members of family. The second step is to give the selected respondent a handset; for a certain kind of respondent however (for example, those who are illiterate or those living in secluded area with no signal), special treatment will be given. The third step is conducting interviews through the handset—all answers from the respondent will be automatically recorded into the server that has been equipped with automatic data processing function able to computerize all data fed into it."

"Edward J. Ennis (1908–1990) was an American civil rights lawyer. He worked for the Department of Justice in the 1930s and 1940s, where as director of the alien enemy control unit he oversaw the Japanese American internment. He contributed to the American Civil Liberties Union's efforts to fight the internment, and after World War II resigned from the Department of Justice to join the ACLU, where he rose up through the organization and eventually served as its president from 1969 to 1976."
"Ennis graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1932, and went on to work for the Department of Justice for fourteen years. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild in the 1930s, but withdrew from the organization, believing it to be under the influence of Communists. He held a variety of positions in the Department of Justice, including as general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, director of the alien enemy control unit, and administrator of foreign travel control. His role made him the administrator of the Japanese American internment. Ennis chose not resign from his role at that time, but he did help American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin to come up with legal strategies to oppose the internment, and testified at the trial of Gordon Hirabayashi about the Department of War's withholding of evidence relating to Japanese Americans' loyalty to the United States."
"In 1946, Ennis did resign from the Department of Justice, and joined the board of the ACLU himself. He became the ACLU's general counsel in 1955, and was elected chairman of the ACLU in 1969, succeeding Ernest Angell who was retiring after 19 years with the organization. He served as ACLU president until 1976, during which time he called for the resignation of President Richard Nixon and an end to the property tax exemption enjoyed by religious organizations. Notwithstanding the former, he was critical of the zealousness of opposition to Nixon shown by Charles Morgan, Jr. of the ACLU's Washington, D.C. office. He was succeeded as ACLU president by Norman Dorsen. He remained a member of the ACLU executive committee until 1985."

"The Yeshiva College, also known as the Harry O. Triguboff Centre, is a Hasidic Jewish synagogue, learning centre, and library of the Chabad-Lubavitch nusach, located at 36 Flood Street, in the Sydney suburb of Bondi, New South Wales, Australia. The Centre runs various adult and child-based educational programs."
The centre was established in 1956 by Abraham Rabinovitch and others. The leaders from 1956 to 1968 were Rabbi G. Hertz and Rabbi C. E. Barzel. In 1968 the Yeshiva's board of trustees appointed Rabbi Pinchus Feldman to lead its synagogue and to assist with expanding its small ultra-orthodox Jewish day school.
"Our Big Kitchen, a charity established by Yeshiva Sydney in 2005, operates from the Yeshiva."
"In February 2015 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard Rabbi Yossi Feldman testify, where he stated that he ""was not aware it was illegal to touch a child's genitals"". Feldman told the Commission that he did not find it necessary for victims to report sexual abuse to the police if offences took place decades prior. He proposed that the law be lenient on sexual predators who had not committed any sexual abuse for two decades if they had repented. His comments outraged the Australian Jewish community, and victims of sexual harassment called for him to stand down. Rabbi Yossi Feldman stood down from his administrative positions at the Yeshiva Centre."
"Due to their negligent handling of sex abuse in the Centre, survivor advocate, Manny Waks, placed the centre on his wall of shame."
The Royal Commission issued a case study on Yeshiva educational facilities in Sydney and Melbourne. The Commission reported that:
"The Yeshiva Gedolah Rabbinical College, like other Chabad Yeshivot Gedolot, provides education and training to young men seeking ordination as rabbis. Established in 1986 by the Yeshiva Centre, it forms part of the Tomchei Temimim Yeshiva network. Rabbi Boruch Lesches served as its Rosh Yeshiva and Mashpia for almost twenty years. He has since left Sydney, and is currently serving as the rabbi of the Chabad-Lubavitch shul in Monsey, New York, which also contains a Yeshiva that is part of the Tomchei Temimim network."
"The Yeshiva Gedolah was administered by Rabbi Yossi Feldman, a son of the Chabad Emissary for New South Wales, Head Rabbi and spiritual leader for Chabad-Lubavitch, New South Wales, Pinchus Feldman, until February 2015 when, following Rabbi Yossi Feldman's evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies labelled his views repugnant and declared him to be ""unfit to hold any position of authority or leadership in the Jewish community""."
"Yeshiva College was a Jewish day school, established by the Yeshiva Centre in 1956. From 1968 to 2003 it was headed by Rabbi Pinchus Feldman. After financial difficulty, in late 2003 the Feldman family ceded control over the school to philanthropist Meir Moss for 1. The school later rebranded as Kesser Torah. In 2007 the Yeshiva opened a new school called Cheder Chabad Lubavitch, later renamed Yeshiva College Bondi Ltd."
= = = Ayds = = =
"Ayds (pronounced as ""aids"") Reducing Plan Candy was an appetite-suppressant candy that enjoyed strong sales in the 1970s and early 1980s and was originally manufactured by The Campana Company. It was available in chocolate, chocolate mint, butterscotch, and caramel flavors, and later a peanut butter flavor was introduced. The original packaging used the phrase ""Ayds Reducing Plan vitamin and mineral Candy""; a later version used the phrase ""appetite suppressant candy"". The active ingredient was originally benzocaine, presumably to reduce the sense of taste to reduce eating, later changed in the candy (as reported by ""The New York Times"") to phenylpropanolamine."
"By the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients. While initially sales were not affected, by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease. While the product's name was changed to Diet Ayds (Aydslim in Britain), it was eventually withdrawn from the market."
The product was introduced by the Carlay Company of Chicago. A U.S. trademark was registered in 1946 claiming first use in commerce was in 1937.
"In 1944, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission objected to the claim that the product could cause the user to ""lose up to 10 pounds in 5 days, without dieting or exercising""."
"The Carlay Company later became a division of Campana Corporation of Batavia, Illinois. Then Campana bought Allied Laboratories of Kansas City in 1956. Thereafter, Campana was bought by Dow Chemical and its president, Irving Willard Crull, was president of Dow for less than six months, during which time he engineered the sale of Campana to Purex in the 1960s. He again become president of Campana while serving as a vice president of Purex, which allowed Campana to function as a separate division. Crull also relied on socialite and Hollywood friends like Bob Hope and his wife Dolores Hope, Tyrone Power and his wife Linda Christian, and others to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan Candy line. A ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine article in November 1956 reported that Crull had already recruited a number of his friends amongst socialite and Hollywood celebrities to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan weight-loss regimen."
"In 1981, Purex sold the rights to the Ayds name to Jeffrey Martin Inc. In 1987, Jeffrey Martin, Inc. and its product line (including Ayds Appetite Suppressant and Compoz Sleep Aid) were acquired by the Dep Corporation (sometimes written DEP)."
= = = Justin King (guitarist) = = =
"Justin King (born June 13, 1979) is an American musician and artist from Eugene, Oregon, recognized as a pioneering guitarist for his percussive ""tapping"" playing style which consists of a variety of influences ranging from Flamenco to Celtic music. Currently, King is running a recording studio in Brooklyn, New York called Vinegar Hill Sound as well as doing part-time war photojournalism in places like Iraq and Afghanistan."
"King comes from a family well known in the wine business under the King Estate name. King attended O'Hara Catholic School from the first grade through the eighth grade. He later attended Marist High School before attending South Eugene High School. He dropped out of high school as a sophomore and entered the San Francisco Art Institute to study painting. He began playing drums and guitar around age 14 and wrote and performed songs with his current bassist, Drew Dresman. King began to focus on acoustic guitar at age 19, and in 1999 he released his self-titled album, followed by ""Opening"" in 2000. In 2001, after traveling through Europe, Ireland and Great Britain, King recorded ""Le Bleu""—an instrumental acoustic guitar record which featured long-time friends and James West on percussion, Troy Sicotte on bass and Linh Renken on violins. Le Bleu was recorded at Peter Gabriel's ""Real World Studios"" just outside Bath, England."
"Inspired by Real World Studios, King returned to the US and began construction on his own studio ""Blackberry Hill"". The studio took about two years to complete during which time King toured the country as a solo guitarist opening for James Taylor, BB King, Diana Krall, North Mississippi All-Stars, Al Green and others. Just after building Blackberry Hill King recorded another instrumental record, ""I-XII"", with James West, renowned bassist Michael Manring and European guitarist Carlos Vamos. Shortly after that King started a band with James West (later replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee), Troy Sicotte (later replaced by Drew Dresman), and Ehren Ebbage (later replaced by Chris Plank). The band toured the country for about one year before being signed to a major label record deal with Epic Records in 2006."
"The band recorded the self-titled ""Justin King and the Apologies"" record at King's Blackberry Hill studio as well as studios in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The recording process took more than a year during which time the band continued to tour extensively throughout the nation as well as some international performances. After a large shakeup at Epic Records in which the president and the band's A&R representative left the company the band stayed on in limbo with Epic for about one more year before requesting to be let go from the label. Epic gave the master recording rights to the band and the album was released independently by the band shortly thereafter. After touring tirelessly throughout the year the band broke up around the end of 2007."
"Since the disbanding of The Apologies, King has pursued an interest in photojournalism, having spent August 2008 in Iraq embedded with the Oregon National Guard at Balad Air Base. He accompanied the US military on patrols and raids as well as medevac missions and convoys. His photos appeared on the BBC's website and his stories were featured in Oregon's mainstream news publications."
"In 2001, King released ""Le Bleu"", which was a mostly instrumental album featuring only one track with vocals (""Ashes""). It dramatically showcased his skills on acoustic instruments, and although the album was independently released, it would receive critical acclaim. However, the biggest boom to his music career was the release of live videos on the Internet. The first, and most famous, was a clip of the credits from a documentary on Jean Larrivée guitars. In it, King plays an energetic, fast-paced version of ""Phunkdified,"" which served to introduce younger, web-savvy players to King's unique playing style. His live performance of ""Knock on Wood"" at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene introduced the Doolin double-neck acoustic guitar."
"Following the release of ""Le Bleu"", King began several new projects including an electronic remix of ""Le Bleu"" by the Raging Family, and another instrumental project with Carlos Vamos and Michael Manring. His primary focus, however, was a songwriting-based album. He assembled a new band with longtime friends Ehren Ebbage (lead guitar) and Drew Desman (bass). In 2005, drummer James West and was replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee. King's endeavor in rock music also features a return to playing piano on several songs. King's latest music maintains his complex musical style despite acquiring a more mainstream sound."
"On March 20, 2007, King and his band, after a long struggle, ended their contract with Sony BMG/Epic Records. The band felt that the label took away a considerable amount of freedom in deciding how the music should sound, as well as showing little interest in King's musical ambitions. The band released a five-song EP, ""Fall/Rise"", in spring 2007 before resuming touring, which included several performances in South Korea. The band's debut album, ""Justin King and The Apologies"", was released on September 28, 2007."

"Mortal Kombat: Conquest (stylized on-screen as Mortal Kombat: Konquest) is an American martial arts television series based on the ""Mortal Kombat"" fighting game series, which aired for one season, from 1998 to 1999. Set prior to the events of the first game, the series follows the original Kung Lao (Paolo Montalbán) as he protects Earthrealm with the help of warriors Siro (Daniel Bernhardt) and Taja (Kristanna Loken)."
"Many centuries ago, Earth was an enchanting and desirable planet. Powerful and rich with natural resources, the vicious megalomaniac Shao Kahn wanted Earth as part of his growing collection of conquered realms known as Outworld. To protect Earth, Mortal Kombat was created: a tournament in which the fate of the planet is decided in battles between competitors from Earthrealm and Outworld. Five hundred years in the past, the monk warrior Kung Lao defeated Shao Kahn's sorcerer, Shang Tsung. When Kung Lao spared his life, Kahn imprisoned Tsung in the cobalt mines."
"Kung Lao now had to train the next generation of warriors, who would give their lives to save Earth. Kung Lao created a partnership and friendship between two warriors: Siro, a former bodyguard, and Taja, an ex-thief. In the mysterious city of Zhuzin, Kung Lao and his new friends are guided and watched over by the thunder god Rayden. The three now battle various evils of both Outworld and Earthrealm, including an imprisoned Tsung, who swore eternal revenge on Kung Lao for his humiliating defeat, and the sultry and seductive Vorpax, who is also imprisoned in the mines and has an agenda of her own."
"With ""Conquest"" immediately following TNT's top-rated program, ""WCW Monday Nitro"", WCW wrestlers Meng and Wrath filmed separate appearances. Former QVC model Dorian John played the barmaid Magda in the episodes ""Twisted Truth"" and ""Quan Chi."""
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" was produced by Threshold Entertainment (who produced the ""Mortal Kombat"" film series) in association with New Line Television (television arm of the films' distributor). Warner Bros. Television Distribution distributed the series. The program was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. The Warner Bros. unit (eventual holder of the ""Mortal Kombat"" property), as New Line's corporate sibling-turned-parent, syndicated the series until it was later picked up by TNT, which aired the remaining new episodes in addition to broadcasting repeats of the first-run syndication run. With a lucrative timeslot following ""WCW Monday Nitro"", ""Conquest"" was very popular, but according to the show's developer, Joshua Wexler, this resulted in higher budget costs for the show than anticipated. The cancellation was not announced at first, and rumors of a second season circulated. However, TNT pulled the plug on the show, leaving it with a cliffhanger ending. The ending was planned to have been resolved in the second season, which would have summed up the series and corresponded with the ""MK"" timeline."
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" has been released on DVD in the United Kingdom and Australia, where it enjoyed a more successful run on television. Unofficial collections produced in the UK consist of unrelated and edited episodes merged so that each disc contains a theme, and some of the DVDs contain spelling errors on the covers. Several episodes of the series, consisting of one show per disc, were released in Germany; two of the discs feature episodes centered around Kreeya and Sub-Zero. DVDs were also recently released in Portugal, with many spelling errors on the covers.

= = = Just'a Lotta Animals = = =
Just'a Lotta Animals is a fictional superhero team that appeared in stories published by DC Comics. The team is an anthropomorphic funny animal parody of the Justice League of America.
"Just'a Lotta Animals originally appeared in the series ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!"" as the name of a superhero comic book written and drawn by Captain Carrot's alter ego, Roger Rodney Rabbit. Various panels of the Just'a Lotta Animals' comic that were shown in the ""Captain Carrot"" series were often parodies of classic Justice League storylines. The team was in fact the original proposal by Zoo Crew creators Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw for a funny animal superhero series for DC, but DC's editor Dick Giordano asked them to create original characters instead. They agreed and created the Zoo Crew, but still ended up introducing the Just'a Lotta Animals team in the series."
"In ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew"" #14 and #15, in a storyline titled ""Crisis On Earth-C!,"" the Just'a Lotta Animals were finally revealed to actually exist, on a parallel Earth named ""Earth-C-Minus"" (as opposed to the world of the Zoo Crew, which was named ""Earth-C""). The two teams united to defeat the villains of the story, Dr. Hoot (an owl mad scientist) and Feline Faust (a cat sorcerer; an analog of Justice League villain Felix Faust)."
"The team's imagery was brought to life by a confused paranormal teenager in the second part of the ""Young Justice: World Without Grownups"" storyline."
"Just'a Lotta Animals lived on the parallel world of Earth-C-Minus, and made its headquarters in an orbiting satellite space station."
"Events and characters on Earth-C-Minus were considered to be fictional to natives of Earth-C, similar to how events and characters of Earth-Two were considered as fictional on Earth-One. Additionally, events and characters on Earth-C-Minus paralleled those of the then-mainstream DC Universe of Earth-One. Like Earth-C, the names of characters and locations tended to make heavy use of various animal-based puns."
"After the events of the 1985 miniseries ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"", it was revealed that Earth-C-Minus (and Earth-C) survived intact, as they were actually ""alternate dimensions"" instead of parallel Earths, although the most recent mini-series ""Captain Carrot and the Final Ark"" has suggested that Earth-C is now also considered Earth-26, one of the new 52 parallel Earths in the new DC Multiverse."

"Ipatiev House () was a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg (later renamed Sverdlovsk) where the former Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (1868–1918, reigned 1894–1917), his family, and members of his household were executed in July 1918 following the Bolshevik Revolution. Its name is identical to that of the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, from where the Romanovs came to the throne. As an act for the 60th anniversary of the Russian Revolutions, it was demolished in 1977 by orders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the local communist soviet government, almost 59 years after the Romanov family execution and 14 years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1990–1991."
"In the 1880s, Ivan Redikortsev, an official involved in the mining industry, commissioned a two-story house to be built on the slope of a prominent hill. The length of the facade was 31 metres. In 1898, the mansion passed to Sharaviev, a gold dealer of tainted reputation. Ten years later, the house was acquired by Nikolai Nikolayevich Ipatiev, a military engineer, who turned the ground floor into his office."
"It seems to have been on the basis of information supplied by Pyotr Voykov that Ipatiev was summoned to the office of the Ural Soviet at the end of April 1918 and ordered to vacate what was soon to be called ""The House of Special Purpose."""
"The Imperial Romanov family moved in on 30 April 1918 and spent 78 days at the house. This household included Tsar Nicholas Romanov, his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, their four daughters, their son and heir Alexei, the Tsarevich (crown prince); their court physician Dr. Yevgeny Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov, and valet Alexei Trupp. They occupied four rooms on the upper story of the Ipatiev House, while their guards were housed on the ground floor. From early July, command of this guard was taken over by Yakov Yurovsky, a senior member of the Ural Soviet."
"In 1808 he sailed with his regiment to Portugal for the Peninsular War on the Iberian Peninsula and saw action in the battles of Roliça (17 August 1808), Vimeiro (21 August 1808) and Talavera (July 1809), after which he returned to England for a short period."
"In 1810 he returned to Portugal with the 45th Regiment and, as part of the 3rd Division commanded by Lieutenant-general Sir Thomas Picton, fought in the battles of Bussaco (September 1810), Sabugal (April 1811), Fuentes de Oñoro (May 1811), El Bodón (September 1811), Ciudad Rodrigo (January 1812), Badajoz (March – April 1812, where he was appointed as brigade major for Major-General Sir James Kempt's brigade), Salamanca (July 1812), and Buen Retiro Palace (Madrid, August 1812, where a significant French garrison was surrendered)."
"Serving in the 3rd Division in the same brigade, now commanded by Major-general Sir Thomas Brisbane, he fought in the battles of Vitoria (June 1813), the Pyrenees (July – August 1813), Nivelle (November 1813), Nive (December 1813), Orthez (February 1814, where he was promoted to the rank of major), and Toulouse (April 1814)."
"After Napoleon's surrender in April 1814, Campbell sailed from Bordeaux for North America to serve in the American War of 1812. As brigade major for Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane's brigade, he took part in the Battle of Plattsburgh in September 1814."
"In July 1815 he returned to France and was brigade major for a brigade in the 7th Division and, on the formation of the Army of Occupation in France, to the 1st brigade in the 3rd Division. When the occupation force was reduced in 1817 he returned to Ireland."
"According to Burnham and McGuigan Campbell was one of only 15 men to receive 14 or more clasps on the Military General Service Medal. His obituary in the ""Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle"" states:"
"""""The ranks of Major and Lieutenant-Colonel were successively conferred on him for his services in the field, and he had also the honour of receiving a war medal different from those usually conferred, and no fewer than fourteen clasps, (being one more than any officer in the British service had been honoured with)."""""
"In 1840, Campbell published the book ""A British army, as it was, – is, – and ought to be"", which recounts some of his experience in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Plattsburgh (see Bibliography below). In Volume 1 of ""Excursions, Adventures, and Field-sports in Ceylon"" Campbell notes that, from the start of his service in the army, he was in the habit of keeping a journal. However the night before the Battle of Talavera, thinking that he would be likely to die the next day and not wanting his journal to fall into enemy hands, he burnt it, and thus destroyed the record of events from the previous eight years."
"In February 1819, after promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, Campbell sailed with a command of 300 men to Ceylon. For two years he was the commander of the Galle District and then for a further period he was commander and Judicial Officer (Magistrate) of the Sath (Seven) Korles district."
"He repeatedly became ill in Ceylon from jungle fever and had to return England, where he sold his commission and retired from the army."
"Campbell was married to Charlotte Alicia (1793 – 5 January 1860) and had two children, a son and a daughter. His son, Major Francis Eastwood Campbell (1823–1911), was Clerk of the New Zealand House of Representatives for 35 years. Campbell's granddaughter from his Son's marriage to Elizabeth (""Eliza"") Susan Downing was Jessie Mary, who married Arthur Hylton Brisco, son of Sir Robert Brisco the 3rd Brisco Baronet of Crofton Place."
"Campbell's daughter, Blanche Emily, married AG Anderson. Campbell's granddaughter from his daughter's marriage was Dame Adelaide Mary Anderson."
"After Campbell returned from Ceylon (around 1823) he resided at Ravensdale Estate in the parish of Ballaugh on the Isle of Man, where he was appointed as a magistrate. Around 1846 Lieutenant Governor John Ready selected Campbell to serve as a member of the House of Keys. However Campbell refused to attend the swearing in at Castle Rushen as he disagreed with the way in which members of the House of Keys were appointed, having previously been a signatory to a petition to Queen Victoria requesting that she change the appointment process."
"During this period Campbell wrote books on the British army (published 1840), Ceylon (two volumes in 1843) and Ireland (published 1847). See Bibliography below for further details."
"Campbell had mixed fortunes after leaving the army. He became interested in matters relating to British colonization of lands such as New Zealand. In ""Excursions, Adventures, and Field-sports in Ceylon"" (Preface and Appendix O of Volume 1 and chapter 13 of Volume 2 – see Bibliography below) he set out his views on colonization, including the merits of providing colonists with cheap passage, land and labour (including convict labour)."
"Campbell was appointed to the Committee of Management of the Society of Canterbury Colonists when it was formed in London on 25 April 1850. The Society was formed """"for the purpose of making suggestions and expressing the opinions of the Colonists upon matters relating to the welfare of the proposed Colony"""" being established by the Canterbury Association in Canterbury New Zealand. The other members of the Society's first Committee of Management were Guise Brittan (Chairman), James FitzGerald, Rev Dr Thomas Rowley, Henry Phillips, Henry Sewell, Conway Lucas Rose and Edward Ward (brother of Crosbie Ward), who was appointed secretary of the society. After elections on 18 July 1850 C L Rose and Rev Dr Thomas Rowley were replaced on the Committee by George Leslie Lee, Charles Maunsell, John Watts Russell, Henry John Tancred, James Townsend (father of Mary Townsend) and Felix Wakefield; however, Lee and Sewell immediately vacated their appointments."
"Later in 1850 Campbell fell out with the Society of Canterbury Colonists. On 17 August 1850 Edward Gibbon Wakefield wrote to John Robert Godley, calling Campbell a """"mere self-seeker, but hardly a respectable, perhaps a very discreditable one: all wrong about money-matters, and very incompetent to boot"""" and advising Godley to keep Campbell """"at full arms length""""."
"On 1 November 1851 the Lyttelton Times (under the editorship of James FitzGerald) reported that Campbell: """"joined the Canterbury scheme... in the hope of obtaining appointment of Resident Magistrate in the settlement; he professed himself a warm advocate of the plan of the colony, and announced his intention of purchasing land largely; he even took cabins in , which were retained for him for a considerable time; he was in constant communication with the colonists for many weeks; and [when] he was not recommended to the appointment he wished to obtain, or any other appointment... he ceased to frequent the colonists' rooms in London, gave up his cabins, bought no land, and in a short time after the sailing of the first four ships, he left England, and was lost sight of until he turned up in Auckland."""""
"Campbell boarded the ""Victory"" in London on 10 October 1850, arriving in Auckland on or about 1 February 1851. He was accompanied on the voyage by his wife, son Francis Eastwood Campbell, his daughter Blanche Emily and a servant."
"Campbell came to New Zealand with recommendations from the British government. On 27 September 1851 Governor of New Zealand George Grey appointed him as a Magistrate of the Province of New Munster, and to the three separate commissionerships within the """"Middle District of the Middle"" [i.e. South] ""Island"""": Commissioner of Crown Lands under the Crown Lands Ordinance (excluding the Canterbury District), Commissioner for hearing claims under the New Zealand Company's Land Claimant's Ordinance and Commissioner for investigating and reporting upon claims to Land under the Land Claims Ordinance. As a result of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passing the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 the Provinces of New Zealand came into effect on 17 January 1853. The boundaries of the Canterbury Province were gazetted on 28 February 1853 and Campbell then became the """"Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Province of Canterbury, exclusive of the Canterbury Block"""""
"Campbell's commissionership appointments gave him responsibility for adjudicating land claims for around half of the South Island; from Kaikoura and Westport in the north, to Glenavy and Cascade Point in the south. He also had responsibility for issuing pasturage licences on Crown Land outside the block of land purchased by the Canterbury Association (the ""Canterbury Block""). As Commissioner of Crown Lands he issued over 50 pasturage licences covering an area of over one million acres. Unfortunately these licences were later declared invalid and quashed, creating considerable confusion and litigation. His outward letter-book contains more than 200 letters covering the period October 1851 to November 1853."
"It is possible that Grey's antipathy towards the Canterbury Association led him to appoint Campbell in order to frustrate the plans of the Colonists and delay the settlement of claims and the issuing of pasturage licences. Certainly Campbell, and George Grey's appointment of him as Commissioner, were strongly criticized by the press and prominent colonists. The Lyttelton Times and the Daily Southern Cross published articles stating:""""There never was a more unfortunate or more offensive appointment than that of Col. Campbell... he was considered by all who came in contact with him to be wholly incompetent to discharge the duties of any responsible station... there could hardly have been found another man whose presence within this settlement, as an official, would have been so offensive to its inhabitants."""""
"An editorial in the Otago Witness expressed similar views about Campbell and added that his """"gross ignorance"""" and """"hostility to the [Canterbury] scheme"""" made him """"an object of derision, sorrow and dislike"""". The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle complained about the large area of land that Campbell was expected to administer and that his office was in Christchurch, while the Lyttelton Times harshly criticised the language and grammar Campbell used in his official notices."
"Henry Sewell described Campbell on 21 April 1853 as that:""""doited old idiot who is about as fit to be Crown Commissioner as he is to be Lord Chancellor. He is in truth a compound of conceit, stupidity, ignorance and self importance, with a total incapacity for business of the meanest kind; withal he is mischievous and malignant; altogether as great an infliction on the poor Province of Canterbury as could have been sent, and for this Canterbury has to thank the tender mercies of Sir Geo. Grey."""""
"William Travers sarcastically referred to him as a """"genius"""" and Charlotte Godley (the wife of ""father of Canterbury"" John Robert Godley) described Campbell in letters to her mother by saying:""""There is a certain old Colonel Campbell, who had many dealings with the C. Assoc. in early days, and ended by quarrelling with everyone and writing an insulting letter to Lord Lyttelton, after innumerable statements on his part had turned out to be perfectly false... He is naturally predisposed to dislike the plan, and the Colonists, and goes about abusing the place, the land, and all belonging to it, to anyone who will listen to him. The new-comers are his especial prey...he is a very bad element in our society. He is now going over to Akaroa to decide summarily certain claims of some of the old settlers there, and my husband intends to go over and watch what he is about; he can hardly help making mistakes, as he has no knowledge whatever of his subject... vexatious, underhand way of doing business... an overweening idea of his own importance..."""""
"Howard Jacobson, owner of the ""Akaroa Mail and Banks Peninsula Advertiser"" (father of Ethel May Jacobson), later wrote:""""Colonel Campbell did not make things at all pleasant for the Canterbury Association settlers. He was a disappointed man, having taken great interest in the foundation of the settlement when in London, and fully expected to be appointed first agent, a post that was afterwards given to Mr. Godley."""""
"Alfred Hamish Reed notes that Campbell: """"was looked upon by his fellows as a renegade. He had further aroused the hostility of the leaders of the settlement by his decisions on certain ""pre-Adamite"""" [i.e. settlers that had arrived before the first Canterbury Association ships in December 1850] ""Banks Peninsula land claims, and by his support for Sir George Grey's cheap land policy."""""
"Johannes Carl Andersen notes that at least some of the Canterbury Colonists' criticism of Campbell appears to have been warranted: """"The Colonel wrote in a very minute, nervous hand and his letters were extraordinarily diffuse, even as compared with other letters in those days of formal long-drawn-out and often tedious official correspondence... He located his office at Akaroa"" (some 50 miles by bush track from the main settlement at Christchurch) ""and sometimes published instructions to Canterbury stock-owners in the Wellington Spectator"""" (i.e. in the New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, a Wellington publication)."
"In February 1853 Campbell stood for election to the newly created office of Superintendent of the Canterbury Province. He campaigned strongly, his catchcry being ""cheap land, cheap bread and no Chinese labour""."
"The price of land was the dominant election issue: The business strategy of the Canterbury Association was to sell land at a price that was sufficient to finance all the development that was necessary for the new settlement. The other two candidates, James FitzGerald and Henry Tancred, were therefore both proponents of a high land price. Campbell on the other hand was in favour of setting a low price for land outside the Canterbury Block. Hence there was a real possibility that vote splitting would result in neither Tancred nor FitzGerald being elected."
"Resident Magistrate for Akaroa John Watson removed Campbell from the electoral roll on the grounds that he did not believe Campbell met the property qualifications to either vote or stand for election. Captain Charles Simeon, returning officer for the election, allowed Campbell to be nominated, but at the same time impressed on electors the fact that if Campbell received the most votes he would not be declared as superintendent. Simeon stated that """"all votes for Colonel Campbell would be thrown away"""". The New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian stated: """"This seems to have acted very prejudicially to Colonel Campbell in the Christchurch District, where the declaration was made, and to have lost him his election."""""
"The election result was: Fitzgerald 135 votes, Campbell 94 votes and Tancred 89 votes. Campbell was supported by the French settlers at Akaroa, where he topped the poll. He just headed off FitzGerald at Lyttelton, but the majority of Christchurch voters favoured FitzGerald."
