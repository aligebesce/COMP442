Old age pensioners?
But it wasn't here!

"No, I've er, I, I, think it happened since."
And you see er  it's one of those things that can wait.

Rush rushed into the bathroom.
"Went in there and went and got dressed  so Mary was up then  so when I got back downstairs  the er breakfast, my breakfast was on the table."
Again.
"So all in all, it's quite exciting."
You all looking forward to this?
Yeah.
Yes I am.
"I said to Sue  I said I can't ring and tell him I ain't going I says, I'll upset him too much."

"I thought I'm, I'm going this morning."
Did you go yesterday?

Jeremy .
I wouldn't be surprised!
"And he won't, and he wouldn't own up  ever!"
He would never own up.
Well that isn't very fair on the rest of you though is it?

Yeah.
And
Thank you.
Which one?
"she obviously didn't know this for a long time  and then one day I said to her, well, it was lovely meal and all that but I do think your mark-up on the wine is scandalous!"

Really?
"She says well  I know, and you know that that bottle of wine costs"
Mm mm.
"ten ninety five  and, and we had two bottles last night so  it costs us sixty pounds."

I mean if you're gonna have McGoldrick as a sweeper then you'd have to bring Mortimer back but

"I mean we, we went out to win that game didn't we, again?"
"Well, don't you think?"

There's only us who never moved.
Oh yeah.
Angie  how long's me mother been in there.
"I'm forty-eight this year, me mum must have been in there nearly fifty year."
And we've only moved into here.
"In actual fact your Pete and Margaret have moved more, in the twelve years that they were married, I know they've been married longer now, but when,th they been married twelve years and they moved four times,"
Yeah.
"we've been married twelve years, and we've moved three times, so we haven't moved as much as them, really."
No.
No.
I couldn't keep moving and
I couldn't move like that.
"I mean, a couple of moves, is fair enough, yeah, but bloody twelve."
No.
"And it's not as if they made money every time they moved, 'cos they haven't, 'cos they lost money on that 'ouse, there."
Yes.
I  won't it.
"Well, Chris said they moved because er,"
Give up.
"er, transport, you know."
"It would be difficult for 'er to get back'ards and for'ards, and she were on her own all the time."
Yeah.
That's why they moved.
"But they moved down, they moved from 'ere because he says, er,"
"Too noisy, weren't it."
Too too noisy and dogs were keeping them up all night.
Oh.
So I don't what the excuse is for moving from   Road.
"Same thing, 'cos it's noisy down there."
Yeah.
"I could scare you, Auntie June."
Could ya.
not far
I know.
Don't let it beat you.
I dunno mum.
Only a little omelette.
Yeah but it was bigger than the plate.
You had to fold it in half to get it on.
That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette.
Yeah.
That's right.
I thought I could call it erm  a Spanish omelette.
What I tried to do was one of those
Did you have
ploughman's things.
did you have a surplus of eggs or something?
Pardon me.
"Well  erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm  vegetables."
So  I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette.
Mm.
"I mean, if it had of been smaller."
"Well, I'll have a go but  I may not eat all this but  if it was smaller it's really tasty as well."
Mm.
But you liked those erm  were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes?
And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it?
And some cheese.
And bacon.
Don't remember.
Oh.
"What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can."
Well I think eight pounds is a good start.
But when I go to the shops and I spend  seventy pound for a week.
We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need  bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten.
They might be symmetrical about here or here.
Or  it this way round.
What's that?
What's that?
That's a .
Erm
Well I mean what gives you that?
What gives you that?
"Well, what does that look like from the way you're looking at it?"
s
"The way you're looking at it, it looks something like erm Y equals X to"
X
the fourth plus three or something.
Mm.
Good.
So looking at it this way up I mean  it's  X equals Y to the fourth  plus three and that's all minus.
Mm.
X X equals three minus Y to the fourth.
It's a funny way of putting it.
Yeah.
But you could write your equation that way.
"Er if someone says that's not good enough, I want it in terms of Y equals"
"well okay we'll have to bring the three over to this side, and take the fourth root,."
"But you can always swap the axes, if you don't like what they give you."
Mm.
"So if, if I say  draw erm  Y equals the square root of X, and you think I haven't got a clue what that looks like."
You can square both sides.
"You can draw Y squared equals X, and all you have to do is say well, I can draw  the other way round."
Mm.
Y equals X squared.
"You draw your Y equals X squared,turn the paper round that way, and whichever way, I'm going to draw Y equals X squared."
"And erm   Y equals X squared, and that's Y and that's an X. Then turn it the other way up to get X equals Y squared, and now that's the Y and this is the X."
Hold the bible up in your right hand and read the words from that card.
"I swear by almighty God that the evidence I shall give is  shall be truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
Okay.
Now  full name and address could you?
"Jacqueline ,."
"And er, what is your date of birth?"
"Thirteenth of the twelfth, sixty four."
And you're making application for temporary authority to  operate the licensed
premises  known as Quick Save Supermarket
That's right.
"at er Station Road,Wetherall is that right?"
"That's right, yes."
Is the outgoing licensee present?
Pardon?
Is the outgoing licensee present?
No.
Why?
Don't know.
Not had a
You don't know?
"Well, somebody's handed these documents in, have these come with you today?"
Yeah.
The present license holder is Susan .
That's right.
Right.
"Sir, there is a letter simply saying er  she consents to the  er, application, but there's no indication to why she's not here."

Yes.
She's at work for the company too?

I've done all enquiries about putting the advert in for the temps.
Yes.
It went to Liverpool on Friday  and they were gonna do their best  to get it done  and
Do we know when it goes in the er
I think  I told Liverpool that if it gets to  erm  Caernarvon to the  Caernarvon office by today it will appear in this week's issue.
Do we know when that comes out?
"No, I couldn't get that off her."
Off who?
"Well I asked the girl and the she, we sort of sidetracked and  when I come off the phone I realized that she hadn't said."
I think it's
What I'm thinking of is that
Thursday or something like that.
Presumably after that we w or on that date we'll start to get phone calls?
This is true.
And we need to be prepared
Yep.
because obviously er  I mean if you're in
Yeah.
they can be rung through to you but p erm  will need to be warned that we may get a flood of phone calls
Yeah.
and what they're about.
And also I think it might be as well to have a pro forma.
Probably you've got one.
"Yeah, well no we haven't so we could probably do with doing"
Oh
"that and then, you know like if I get inundated I can let Jim do some."
Well that's right.
Now they're closing the bloody things!
"Now, you know we sho something should of happened then  they should of prolonged that strike  to destroy these buggers and said no you're not gonna close them!"
But the peop lot of people agreed with it!
Well of course!
They said they weren't being
But
realistic!
"what do they do, they divide and conquer Ray!"
Yeah but why should bloody intelligent people go along with it Ken?
That's what gets my plate!
"Because they , because the intelligent people weren't involved!"
"No I mean, I'm talking about the people  who are not actually  er, you know"
I i if
concerned directly but give
But
their approval  for these
But they're
people.
"they're not involved, the people  the people that give their approval are the people that want it!"
"And I mean er, and"
Yeah but I mean
"and also  they, they get the masses on their side by the media!"
I know!
The same as they're
Exactly!
doing now with the  I mean  what paper have you got?
"I know, well there you are!"
A Labour paper!
This is what terrifies me!
"And what's, what's er  what's your chance?"
The Mirror.
Where's that ball gone?
The instructors
Oh.
and all the other lads.
Oh right.
"Did they record it or that, no?"
Which is a good job.
Mm.
Cos most of us were petrified anyway.
And that's a bit like that erm  the teaching skills that I had to do that time when I was on the course.
Mm?
Erm  and I had to think up  something  that I do as a hobby er to teach other people.
"I, I did those little flowers you see  and took them in."
And er  it is quite nervewracking really to sit there.
Specially when the instructors come over and they're sort of sitting watching as well.
"Well  the bad thing was, as soon as I picked my cards up I dropped them all  you know?"
Mm.
All your flash cards?
Good morning yeah.
"Good morning ladies and gentlemen pshoow and they, they went all over the place."
So I had to pick them back up  mm sorry.
Bit of nerves.
"Be back to front now, this morning yeah?"
John wants me to er  sew his trousers for him.
Oh.
I'm waiting on him  picking up the machine.
It tickles me the way they call it portable and you can hardly lift it.
"we took Patricia in to, we give her a lift as far as Longbridge today."
She was going back to get her coat changed.
And then she was going to the careers office.
And erm they were going to send her for an interview straight away.
I told her to be home reasonably early but she's not home yet.

"Our Tom don't like it when he flies and yet, they're not bothered about him, that one, that's the one that bites."

"On a  were it last Sunday, yeah it were last Sunday when I took  off, er Lisa always goes down to 'elp 'er, when, like what, you know when Eileen cut her finger, what did she do to her finger?"
"She did have it all bandaged up, she were she were cleaning toilet at bottom, and er, apparently there was a piece out of it and she didn't know, and she wiped round it, it sliced it, and it were bleeding like mad, well she came across to our 'ouse, and we weren't in, and then she went to Kevin's and she had she had it, but it, now it's just like a line now,"

"Not that I like walking around with music blasting anyway, I'd rather listen to the birds."
"Mm  oh, I'm warm now after that walk."

"Your friend's coming, your friend's coming, your friend's coming, look, look who's that, who's that, who is it?"
"Who's down there, who is it, who is it, who is it?."

"Three of us  he's gonna have a widdle, that'll sort all the problems out, hello."
"We haven't got the   oh yes there is, oh course there is, that's a lie  we go through  yeah."

"In Cambridge got something to do with, what was that he said?"
Well anyway something about University  you know all these  studies they do.
Yeah.
It's all about speech patterns.
Geoff and Joan  thought erm  someone was trying to  rob us along here!
He sat  in his car out there
Poor little man!
and they thought that he was the accomplice  sitting outside while somebody was going round the house.
"I said I don't know what hollering for, he's got a bloody"
I'm surprised they haven't got
rottweiller there!
the bloody postman down as a
Oh yeah.
detective or something!
But how pathetic!
"Well my, my, my line's just about full of jumpers."
I must see Daphne today.
"Well I've, I've seen her today but  she said she'd er  get me some socks and that out for, out for Lianne."
She gave me those on Monday.
"Actually I thought they were quite nice, but Gillian er  made I Ian erm  ring the short up  cos she thought the legs weren't long enough."
"So, she tried it on her and that and I said it's fine."
But I  she'd had to lend Ian some money  the week before last so  so he could do their pocket money.
He hadn't any money so he had to borrow it off Gillian.
Mm mm.
Well they'll not be  as that.
bad we could all live in four-bedroomed detached houses can't you?
Mm.
"We well, well, you know, today what was the point of having a four bedroom?"
For show?
Mm.
"You know, you don't go from a, a one-up two-down to a two-bedroomed bung semi-bungalow and then shoot  to a four-bedroomed detached."
And then your own commonsense tells you it's gonna cost you more doesn't it?
Yeah.
"So  anyhow, money's that, he, cos he said summat on the Monday night."
Yeah I want money for  Andrew's trainers.
Oh I'll see you next week about that.
"He thinks I'm going halves with him, if he do, well he's got another shock."
He has.
Mm.
"And if he turns round and says owt, I'll say, Ian if weren't for me your kids would be naked."
I just bought Alan a new pair of jeans.
Sixteen pound out of club.
Cos I thought  needs a pair of decent jeans.
I bought them both a denim shirt.
"Alright, out of club, but it will get paid for."
Ah but see you've still got to pay for it haven't you?
What?
This.
I mean I have been into this  window frame business.
Mm
Because we have to have sash and  sash  soft wood.
So anyway  various companies wrote.
Well they do use tropical rainforest wood but
Yeah.
it's government  er schemes.
Yeah it's like some sort of erm okay.
Yeah.
"And I mean I have, I I remember that on some T V programmes they they said it's all  bogus"
Mm.
I mean that it is not really government run er .
They reforest it but what they reforest is eucalyptus or
Yeah palm erm they  oil palm plantations
Mm.
Mm.
They just er .
"Actually I've got a, I've got a brilliant picture that I took outside the train."
Erm we were travelling through Malaysia and erm  it's just one canopy tree standing on its own  in the middle of nowhere.
And there's all this sort of undergrowth.
"And it's obviously that one wasn't, just didn't want it or it was dead or something and they just left it."
Mhm.
And it's just the one.
"And then  I've got all the pictures of all the logs on the  train wagons and er that was really  it was a, it was a good picture actually cos I thought oh look at that poor old tree there it's"
Yeah.
all its friends and then it was just standing there on the ground.
But really it's completely  it's completely wiped out Malaysia the whole of central Malaysia is just  just gone.
And all the soil's eroding cos it's sort of  sand and it's red.
And it goes into dust.
So it goes everywhere so I mean there's gonna be trouble with that in the future .
It's where they get all the flooding isn't it?
Was it?
It is when you see us struggling against Birmingham.
What do you think the score's gonna be against Birmingham?
Three one to Palace.
Three one to Palace?
Be great if that is.
We will score first.
They will equalize and we'll score two more.
We have got to get another goalgetter.
I mean old erm   does his bit  crossing and splitting defences and getting goals but not scoring them.
"What do you mean, getting goals and then not"
"Now, well now  it's just now we've got nobody who, who score actually really scores goals  except Thomas I would say at the moment."
We really do need somebody who regularly pops them in.
What about Gabbiadini?
What about Gabiadini?
Well  he's coming along.
I don't see him
"I think he  he had a really good first half  I think it like, I think that  to be fair, apart from Coleman an Southgate everybody faded in the second half didn't they?"
Yo.
Yo
Yeah.
"What's that, Man United fans?"
Wallington.
Where's Wallington?
Oh that's boring.
Why are we going this way then?
"Are, are Manchester United not the most cockiest fans going aren't they?"
They really are cocky .
Yeah.
"Leeds, I like Man United, I don't, I don't hate them or anything I just, they get a bit I dunno."
"Mind you not that they've had an awful lot of success recently but they are, really are a cocky lot."
Leeds are aggressive so you're always quite glad that you've beaten them but .
All of it?
"Yeah, don't usually get them for nothing"
"three, four out, half a dozen"
"No tomorrow, I went into town and then I went to Emma's"
Oh did you?
Yeah
Did you have a look at the wallpaper?
"I forgot all about it, when I got to Emma's then I realized, I'm going over"
I don't usually buy that sort anyway but the last couple of
"They've got so much work, those safety ones"
"that's it, yeah"
Cor they dunno
well they would I
oh dear
all depends on the nature of
they won't need
If they thought it was that bad they would of picked it up on the M O T wouldn't they?
"That's what they said, cos I, I said is it something that has to be checked regularly, he said no, it doesn't really go that often"
Yeah
so erm  something
so you'd be paying out for some more tyres if you don't have that checked or anything
Yeah
ain't you?
"So Emma's given me his present to drop round, ha"
How long
she doesn't finish work until about half past five
Oh
and in between time she goes to meet Gordon so er
Oh yeah
"I don't know where they live, I know the court but I don't know whereabouts they are."
No
only where erm Mrs  and that live and that's about it
I don't believe  .
Thursday night I was living in dread of the choir.
"And I trundling along the district line to the Embankment across to Sloane Square  and then hello, hello, I didn't expect to see you here."
Oh oh!
I never met anyone on the tube before from choir.
And I'm sure my face was a picture.
I was just
appalled!
I was just thinking about what a horrendous evening it had been the night before and then he
confronted me
with his awful beard and everything.
Oh I dunno.
Is there anyone in
And I had
"the choir that lives near you, or  sca , can travel with you?"
"Actually there's Paul, the guy who'd given me a lift to the concert and, and he mentioned going to the  , the film I saw, erm  but I knew he was going to the pub, he always goes to the pub afterwards."
"So I pa , I told one girl in the choir what had happened, and I think to begin"
And what did she say?
with she thought I was overreacting cos she didn't really  respond.
Is she married or what?
"And then , she is married."
"Er erm  and then later on I, I, I think maybe she did realize, you know, cos I said  I wasn't prepared for that and that hasn't happened before."
"I didn't want to think, her to think that I was a show-off, you know"
Yes.
"oh I have fun with men all the time, chasing them and that."
Mm mm.
In my dreams!
And  er er
"she, she said to me on the way o , er as I was  I said look I'm going to  scoot now and she said well I hope you don't get any unwanted company on the way back."
And I really felt on edge walking back to

Well is he an alcoholic?
Well he's always been able to drink like that  he's .
Well he's happy enough behind all this isn't he?
Well  well I dunno.
"Well I'm, I must admit I don't know."
But I was   the trouble
What?
is
He's rotting his stomach isn't he?
"yeah I mean, and the trouble is  what  n annoys me more than anything  is the fact that he's good worker  I me even when he's drunk, alright he don't work at full capacity  but he does sort of almost as much as what they do  and when he's"
Yeah.
"sober  he can do more than they do  I mean i that ain't the sort bloke you wanna lose, and I'm, when he balls and shouts at them  well he gets on your nerves really  but at the end of the day I'll  you know, I'll put up with it."
"You can put up with that, good God!"
"Yeah because he's a, he's a bloody good worker but  and when he's like  Cor!"
And the other morning  disgrace!
"The funny thing is, like  there's a beer smell isn't there?"
Yeah.
"But he has got the sort of  acidy sort of alcohol smell on his breath  just like you'd been on  spirits all night  or whatever, any sort of  you know, wine and  it's not a beer sort of smell."
"But I mean he's  I mean Ivan said to me, phworgh, he said when Cliff's breathing over you!"
"I said I know I said, just like neat alcohol innit?"
God he said!
Well I should think  that's   acidity in his stomach innit?
"Definitely  and he'll say I've got this pain, I've got this pain, I should think you have Cliff!"
"Oh it's not that, no it's not."
Where's he get the pain?
In his side.
In his side?
"I think he's rotting his liver, that's the feeling."
"Liver, yeah , exactly."
But you see he's that thick
.
"I will try and remind you about that, er, on other occasions, so that it doesn't er, slip into the recesses."
"Er, and the other thing, just to comment on the programme."
"I hope that we shall have the Deputy Lord Mayor, er, Bob  on the last Wednesday of our session."
"The reason the programme's taken so long, was to find a time when he's available."
"That Wednesday is in the school holiday, although we shall be continuing."
"It means that he can slip out of school, er, in the afternoon, when normally, in nor on a normal school day, he would not be able to do that."
"Erm, so I'm hoping that that will work, it's it's down in the diary for him to do that, and and I've given a little note about what the Adult School is all about."
"And I'll write to him to confirm, and er, if I do bump into him, I shall jog memory of that one."
"Erm, with the change of programme, then, the Black Sheep of the, of the Family."
"Er, which I have already found."
"It is on page a hundred and thirty- nine, for those of you who wish to er, follow."
It starts off with.
"Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have you any Wool?"
How does the black sheep of the nursery rhyme appear to children?
"Other sheep they see, are unlikely to be black, so a black sheep is different."
"They soon learn that anyone referred to as a black sheep, is not only different, but is regarded as being in disgrace."
This is all politically incorrect.
"Yes, yes, yes it is, indeed,"
I was thinking about that.
"isn't it, nowadays."
"Wh wh wha what shall we do, if they were saying a black sheep?"
Erm.
A green one.
"Erm, a green."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"I don't think you can even say, non-white, can you, nowadays."
Yes.
A Jacob.
a Jacobs sheep.
A Jacob.
A Jacob's sheep.

We went swimming with Jonathan the other night and he got up on the top board and sort of and he was sort of like hanging on to the bar like this  looking over
"Oh god, that's  like."
and he couldn't do it and the worse thing was everybody in the pool had gone  go on
"What, what happened was Robert, Rob and me shouted, Robert  and me were there and who was it, Helen was there I think as well, his ex girlfriend  we were going  go on Jon, go on jump   and everybody in the pool started it  go on Jonathan"
"and he couldn't do it, he was so totally embarrassed and all the rest of it, he had to get down and everybody was  boo boo, chicken, chicken"
Oh he felt so wet.
I felt so sorry for him.
Can you do it?
Mm?
No
"Fuck, no way."

I went off the second board and I had to get out cos I felt sick.
And like I'm not afraid of the water like.
I used to dive off the first board
Yes.
and then I hurt my back
I di I dive off the first board but I couldn't even jump or drop off the second board.
"there was one time I dove in and I hurt my back, I sort of like keeled over, kicked  well"
"Oh I know what you mean  you went in like that and your back, your, your legs went like that there?"
Yeah.
Ooh!
"But I've jumped off the second one, I haven't dived off the second one."
No way.
"I got up, I remember like I'd just  I'd just learnt to dive off the first one  like I was running down like, yes!"
And I got up with the intention of diving off the second one and I went no!
Jumped off it.
Pete   Petey  right?
"I'm not joking, his leg  his legs were about that wide right?"
He wore those new shorts

"Nope, he don't know  erm  what he's saying is"
A lovely little man weren't he?
that blokes that's erm  dro been rigging it  who he does the things for.
Why?
"Well, because he said  for obvious reasons, he said er  I didn't want  my name and address  mentioned."

Now he's gonna wish we'd tell him  so he said erm
Well what has he done with it then?
"Oh it was genuinely gone  quite genuine, he said  you now, he had a , that we know about  but it had  genuine"
"Cor , it didn't do that!"
Well there are you  don't go near them.
Well we'll have to get our own then won't we?
So he said   choice  because it was his  property they contacted him  but he said what he's done is though right  there isn't anywhere near that amount!
He said we're talking about eighty or ninety
We're short on twenty two.
"We could  we can, ah no  no  in terms of money  he's talking about four or five thousand maximum."
Well
Where did you  get the twenty two from then?
Cos he told me there's three hundred gone.
Well Jimmy ought to tell her
"Well  you know what he's trying to do, he's trying up the claim  so when  back, he's still gonna get the amount that he wants  so he said t to  Jim  something about, he isn't paying the insurance  I said you're joking!"
He said I've insured it he said but I ain't paying  as well he said!
"If you're getting all the money he said, you can pay the premium!"
So erm  they're sort of having a few words at the moment.
Oh good.
and waiting for his next one to come
Oh marvellous.
Er
Is he selling them over there?
"No he's keeping them for just fun cars for himself, he's just got the money to burn over there"
Marvellous
"so  he's only, he's got a  one of the new  B M W seven three five that er no the big Merc, a big new Merc through that's right, not the  the latest Merc  so he says er er he's a bit disappointed with the brakes on the M G but  Dave said they were a phenomenal brake for an  M G he said"
Yes.
compare it against the latest Merc
That's right.
He's all
I expect
he's all been paid all his money and
"Mm but it's good in a way that he's got his money because he can sort of, sort of finance ours"
"Well yeah he is, he's got a little bit anyway"
"till we, yeah yeah, I should imagine he is."
quite a few bits and pieces.
It's getting Kevin in to finish it off.
"I phoned Kevin, I've got Kevin's mum and dad's phone number off Dave and phoned at home but he's gone out for the day or something they said."
"But he's got to strip the bonnet so Dave said well I'll get my lad to strip the bonnet this afternoon and er  you know,few hundred quid for the day we'll be glad to be able to finish off doing them and  He's got too many"
Yeah cos you haven't been able to
to play with really er we c to clear ten we've still got two and a half grand left
Have we?
and so there's twelve and a half grand we're owed
Yeah yeah
"so if he charges, you know, fifteen hundred for his bit and then another grand to finish it off we're still clearing ten, you know,"
Oh well that's good then.
we might even clear a little bit more than ten but
"Bit more than ten, yeah."
"I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be disappointed cos it's been in his garage, he's pushed everything along and he's always  so"
"Yeah, oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he?"
That's why he's
Yes.

"Yes, but it doesn't"
"I just mentioned it er  we have we have had a suggestion from B class judges    that er  that the B class judges can show at er  an, an open show  providing, providing they declare beforehand"
Providing they declare their interests
"it is what I've always thought for a long time that  somebody like Brian   if he's not  if he's not showing at our fish  at our show, even as an A class judge, I, I  fail to see why he can't  judge at our show  it's, he goes to Skelm and, and judges there and our fish will be there or    strange really when we're struggling for judges that, that we don't do these things."
"Yeah, but we're looking at the financial side, aren't we really?"
W with Brian
"Well I know  I mean it  we're struggling to get judges, aren't we, and it's not going to get any better, it's going"

"I eat, I went, when I went round to Maryanne and my  baked bread next door, I like I went down, I went in there before, before I went upstairs into the flat, and bought a, a roll for twelve P."
"Oh, yeah, that was good."
Mm.
"Soft roll, and then erm, I had a Viennese Whirl with it, and I sat and had that with my can of Diet Coke that dad bought a can of drink on the train this morning and never drank."
"Did you have lunch in a park, did you say?"
"Yeah, we had a piece of quiche,"
That was nice.
"and a hot chocolate,in this park in London."
"It was really nice, we had a good old drive around,"
Mm.
"Hampstead, erm, round Hampstead, round Highgate, had to drive up there, it's so nice."
"Oh right, right, just so it's just mum and dad we're ."
Oh I need some money.
I want to believe it.
Now one of these in the morning and one at tea time.
"Twice a day, for the next week."
"One, two, three, four."
"Tell your mum she could be kinder to you, she's got to  for"
even though she's  already.
"Right oh, okay, bye Mrs ,"
Right
cheerio now.
up and call me now  A little music as well we have on the show we have a video from Elvis to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is Mary Whitehouse.
Oh ho ho Steeley Dan and erm reeling reeling out the thingummybobs.
Hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it?
Good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call O  never mind you know the number.
Now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals.
More specifically why we're so cruel to them.
Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics.
Why do we hate animals so much?
If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call  now  sorry.
"Did Karen say to somebody on that thing did I hear her say, What are you on?"
She looked at me and said that when I walked in this morning.
What are you on?
I didn't like to tell her is was Phylisan but there we are.
Anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel.
But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed.
Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas.
The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan.
"Is this Alan Oritt, Alan?"
Correct yeah.
OK you're the Superintendent for the north east of England that covers this area too.
it's too much isn't it?
"But like erm  my mum was saying, you know  she's like  she's  got a, definitely got a good job and like, the kids really sort of"
"You get, are you alright?"
Comfortable?
Yeah.
"sh , he's really sort of like, dead brainy and goes to the child-minder and  goes to school and whatever!"
"But like erm  she said like, he's a really good kid."
Well
Mm.
"I mean  well I thought to myself, God what a life!"
"I mean, I know it's not her fault  but like, every Wednesday she has  all the people from the college bridge  go to her house to play bridge."
I mean the kid's
Poor kid!
just sat there on the sofa!
"I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what, eight o'clock or whatever?"
"But like, I mean  God, do you know I'd really hate that!"
"I mean, I used to hate it with like  having  flipping  anyone come up to our house when I was little!"
Yeah.
"I remember, I remember once"
Apparently his mum's hardly there!
"Because  the baby-sitter she's got at the moment right  she said she doesn't mind doing  Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays  as well as the weekends  but she doesn't wanna do every day  each week."
"Ma , how much does she go out?"
"I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really sorry for him!"
Yeah!
I mean  ooh!
"That's why she's asked me to do it, but like I said to mum  you know, I'm not gonna say to her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say like  they're gonna do this extra course on Wednesday nights  and she said, like  unless she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go  which is the reason I'm doing it."
So like
Just say you'll do it Wednesday night.
"Yeah  say I can do it Wednesday nights, apart from that, you know  it's too bad sort of thing!"
"So I think I'm gonna change my nights  this, of staying in  to either Mo , Monday and Wednesday or  Tuesday and Wednesday  something like that."
I don't know really!
"But like, like erm  that'd be quite good because if I go to someone else 's house like, you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to  mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you?"
and they had to they had to sit in rows and they had to do as they were told and they weren't allowed
Ha!
to speak.
Yes.
Apparently some of the children got quite scared of Jan cos Jan played the part so well  ah Joan  for life.
Frightened the life out of them.
Yeah.
Ah back ah back ah back and bill .
So what did John look like perhaps like a little Billy Bunter didn't he?
"Ah no he looked very good he had a gown and a mortar board and cane  and bow tie  and pin striped socks, quite good, yep."
And they wore that all day all of them all day?
"All day and then he got  all to do   at lunch time  yeah they kept it up all the day, they had separate play time, they had had to eat their lunch in the class room  all they were allowed was a piece of fruit, a bread and water  and they all had to have, you know, they had a bread roll  supplied by the school  an a an apple I think    And Jan made them write out their names and some of them couldn't write their name!"
Boy called Daniel couldn't write Daniel cos all last year he'd been allowed to put Danny  an he'd forgotten how to write Daniel!
Search me!
How old's that child?
Ten  and John
And he can't
"that's what's so dreadful, Joe was language coordinator and they came from her!"
Can't write names.
And another boys name was Thomas   and he couldn't write that cos all last year he'd been Tom  an he'd forgotten how to write his surname  they're not dim children  both of them
Frightening isn't it?
family  she says  quite an eye opener  an they had write lines if they did anything wrong  one boy just   I reckon she could carried him but
No.
You can't be  three times    Where's tonight gone?
All this stuff in out here shall I?
"You think you're exhausted after a days work imagine if you've been doing that all day long, shouting"
Look!
"and shrieking, no I mean that"
I shout and shriek all day long!
Ooh I'll lose my voice up there today  we've done some really good things though  try and do see more my hall is very full  if he bothered to come to school he'd have seen them!
Still  find those  what's this that's broken from?
But Mummy you could
That's a   about a  innit  bloody hell!
Paying  they're paying
yeah so
Well you .
"so I er  he said er  no he said, it's not that he said  I don't like people to tell me  you've got to do overtime today, he said, I like to be asked!"
"I said well I'll be quite honest mate, there's two hundred people working in this factory  and I said, if you think that e all the charge hands and the supervisors have got to come down and roll up you lot to get the job done  I said you  turn round and you think if you was in business, whatever it is you like to do, if you're in business and you've got an order and that order's gotta be out by six o'clock tonight  and you've gotta grovel to your workers  otherwise you'd lose that order, I said what would you say?"
"Down the road mate, I'd get somebody who wants to do the job."
Yeah  that's right
I said and that's exactly how they are!
I said they aren't gonna put up with  like you!
"I said and that's why  cos Paul said to me, he said, I never hear you moan, I said look you won't hear me moan  because  it's not that I enjoy the job  I hate the job  I said I hate the work, and I find it hard work  but at the end of the day  on a Friday, I know that  six o'clock in the morning on a Friday  I can go up to the Nationwide Anglia, slip my card in there  and I know there's gonna be a couple of hundred of quid in there  with the"
Yeah.
"tax paid and everything, and I know it's gonna be in there  I said now that to me is worth a lot  I ain't gotta worry whether there's gonna be cheque from   out on my doormat in the morning  or if it's gonna bounce when I put it in  so I sa"
.
as far as I'm concerned
"whatever o overtime they sling at me, I'll do  not because I feel like doing it  but I need to do it  there's"
Yeah.
my wife and kid at home!
"So he said oh oh said his moan and groan  so he said well I spoke to Blue he said, he's off sick he said and he gets ninety pounds a week for being at home  I've been working here all week he said, for a hundred and forty  so I'm forty pound a week better off than him!"
Yes but he's sick!
I said he's not on holiday  he's sick!
Well forty pound a week's forty pound a week extra
Yeah.
innit?
That's
So I said
how much a month.
Yeah.
Yeah so I said to him
Yeah.
I said but what an attitude to take!
I said you're not working for forty pound a week
"Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams."
All right.
Did you watch that animated version that you recorded.
Yeah.
Does it give you the gist of the story?
"It,half an hour long."
Well I think it's longer than half an hour.
They probably should
an hour at the most.
Given you er  erm
The film is about hour and five minutes.
You can probably have a video of it as long  of another version.
Well it's does help to see different  versions because  you see that different people interpret the
Why do you
Mm?
"Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got  different ways of doing it."
When I was studying  I went to  Open Air Theatre  and  I saw  a version there  on Christopher  er what's his name  that chubby fellow with the glasses  Christopher Biggins that's it.
"He was playing Puck  and when I went to see the  Company  doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er  a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream."
"They did it in a completely  slapstick farce way  you know th the men who were dressed up  women they  balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite  different."
How they
"Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of  of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would  would have a different way of doing it."
Okay.
There's a comedienne  erm  she apparently was born in Wales.
Mhm.
Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her.
Two Ton Tessie?
"She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from  quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had  might well have had a Welsh  nurse."
So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy.
Mm.
"She did it as she would have  thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that."
Mm.
And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet
And there used to be a a lean to just there.
That doorway is still there.
"C C eighteen sixty seven, Charles ."
"Er it's not the date the place was built, it's the date it er the last time that that particular area was erm rebuilt."
"They had a number of fires over the years at  's Mill, er and one was in eighteen sixty six or sixty seven."
Erm and er that rebuilding was the was when erm that part of the job was er was done.
There's a picture that I obtained from actually Ruth  who was who was a Miss .
"Erm and it shows it's the twenty I think it's the twenty second or twenty third I've got it at home, er of October nineteen fourteen, this."
"Erm and it's the the livery of the first full load of coal, into round the back of the er  's Mill, erm and there's there's fifteen eight ton  Railway wagons there, full of coal, just erm coming."
"And it's an  twelve twenty seven, Railway, M R on the front as as standard."
"And er bit misty, but that's looking out from the signal box, you can just, possibly just about make out there, and at the back erm the er er with the the erm station master's house etcetera."
"Er that was taken out I say in in due course,"
"but erm er I think that er that picture I borrowed, I mean with her permission of course, erm and er I think it was hung up in the bathroom or somewhere, which was not the best place for a photograph to be really."
"And so I took  with I say with her blessing, took a er a picture of it for posterity."
". Erm that's a er rather nice picture, erm which has never been published, not at the moment anyhow."
"Erm and it was one that erm er Mr  gave me, many years ago when I was involved with the  Cricket Club, about nineteen seventy seven I think it was."
"He knew I was interested in railways and his grand grandfather I think, or uncle was er  photographer of the town."
And this was a photograph erm taken from the roof of the engine shed.
And about er I'd guess about nineteen nineteen.
Nineteen twenty perhaps.
And you're looking up towards .
I don't know why I'm not really using this er this pointer.
Well perhaps cos you can't see it.
Erm the er  Arms over there.
The cattle dock here.
"Er a loading gauge just here, to ensure that er anything coming out of that er er that had been loaded in the goods shed was not erm overloaded, and likely to hit tunnels and bridges and so on."
"There's the wagon turntable, that we mentioned."
That end loading er and ramp at er the end.
That's a er that's a  Railway horsebox there.
Erm and the line running into the goods shed there.
Erm you've got er fire buckets on the end.
"Er a warning not to trespass or something,careful about that."
And the  where the meeting of the day is at Lingfield Park.
First race there twelve twenty because there are eight races so an action-packed good value afternoon there.
An eighth of an inch of rain overnight but that shouldn't make any difference at all but a wet windy day.
No reported hazards.
Doesn't look a brilliant day does it weatherwise at the races  clouds.
Wetherby by the way  Tuesday third annual charity meeting in aid of the International Spinal Research Trust.
It's on Tuesday sixteenth of November.
A lot of local people have certainly er given generously so should be a good day's racing.
Always is at Wetherby if you can win there you can win anywhere.
But what about the guy who's won the Channel Four champion tipster competition for last week?
Let me first of all give you his name and I'll tell you what this guy's damn brilliant.
It is Robert  from  road in  in Oxfordshire who got an amazing a hundred and thirty points.
Now I say amazing let's just see where he got his winners.
"Now  that okay no problems there,second and third but look at this, he gave the first second and third and they didn't even have a handicap."
"Er the  Looking for a Rainbow, Flight Lieutenant, all skill of course, well you deserve that."
Well done Robert  and you get five hundred pounds.
We'll have another champion tipster competition in a fortnight here on Channel Four which will be coming from Newcastle.
Now let's test your turf knowledge as we go into the commercial break.
This er turf trivia today has been sent in by S  who comes from Great Lumley in County Down.
Know it well.
"He asks quite simply  with which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson Gold Cup four years running in nineteen sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one?"
You get scratching those  heads and I'll give you the answer in three minutes from now.
Okay did you get it right?
"With which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson in sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one four years running."
"They were  Jupiter Boy, Gay Trip, Chatham and Gay Trip again."
What an incredible performance that was.
Three different horses won it four years running.
The late and much missed Fred Rival By the way I saw Mercy at the horse of the year show a few weeks ago.
Still looking as good as ever.
"Erm  non runners, non runners there were three in so far, two of them were at Cheltenham."
They are Far Senior in the first in the twelve fifty and Panto Prince did not run in the Mackeson at two o'clock.
And Canderbill is out of the one fifteen at Nottingham.
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
"Emily , who had said nothing , now spoke harshly ."
"`` Lynde is right , Mr. Douglas ."
You have no right to risk your life for a stranger .
"My advice is to go to the village for help , and Lynde and I will make a fire and watch here ."
That is all that can be expected of you or us . ''
Alan paid no heed to Emily .
Very tenderly he loosened Lynde 's hold on his arm and looked into her quivering face .
"`` You know it is my duty , Lynde , '' he said gently ."
"`` If anything can be done for that poor man , I am the only one who can do it ."
"I will come back safe , please God ."
"Be brave , dear . ''"
"Lynde , with a little moan of resignation , turned away ."
Old Emily looked on with a face of grim disapproval as Alan waded out into the surf that boiled and swirled around him in a mad whirl of foam .
"The shower of sleet had again slackened , and the wreck half a mile away , with its solitary figure , was dearly visible ."
"Alan beckoned to the man to jump overboard and swim ashore , enforcing his appeal by gestures that commanded haste before the next shower should come ."
For a few moments it seemed as if the seaman did not understand or lacked the courage or power to obey .
The next minute he had dropped from the rigging on the crest of a mighty wave and was being borne onward to the shore .
"Speedily the backwater was reached and the man , sucked down by the swirl of the wave , threw up his arms and disappeared ."
"Alan dashed in , groping , swimming ; it seemed an eternity before his hand clutched the drowning man and wrenched him from the undertow ."
"And , with the seaman in his arms , he staggered back through the foam and dropped his burden on the sand at Lynde 's feet ."
"Alan was reeling from exhaustion and chilled to the marrow , but he thought only of the man he had rescued ."
"The latter was unconscious and , as Alan bent over him , he heard Lynde give a choking little cry ."
"`` He is living still , '' said Alan ."
`` We must get him up to the house as soon as possible .
How shall we manage it ? ''
"`` Lynde and I can go and bring the Captain 's mattress down , '' said Emily ."
Now that Alan was safe she was eager to do all she could .
`` Then you and I can carry him up to the house . ''
"`` That will be best , '' said Alan ."
`` Go quickly . ''
He did not look at Lynde or he would have been shocked by the agony on her face .
She cast one glance at the prostrate man and followed Emily .
"Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving !"
"He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! ''"
"`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' said the young seaman . ''"
"` Tai n't much use for fools , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cried Silver ."
"`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
"I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . ''"
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself .
"I think , if I had been able , that I would have killed him through the barrel ."
"Meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard ."
`` Here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
"They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets ."
"Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts ."
But that 's not the course I lay .
"I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion ."
"I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest ."
"Time enough too , says you ."
"Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea ."
And how did I begin ?
"Before the mast , like you ! ''"
"`` Well , '' said the other , `` but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ?"
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . ''
"`` Why , where might you suppose it was ? ''"
asked Silver derisively .
"`` At Bristol , in banks and places , '' answered his companion ."
"`` It were , '' said the cook ; `` it were when we weighed anchor ."
But my old missis has it all by now .
"And the Spy-glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me ."
"I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . ''"
`` And can you trust your missis ? ''
asked the other .
"`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' returned the cook , `` usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it ."
"But I have a way with me , I have ."
On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King .
She turned and walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its inhabitants .
"If Alan had troubled himself to look , he would have seen a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes ."
But the only eyes which had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver .
"* * * * * During Alan 's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde , either in the house or out of it ."
This surprised and worried him .
"There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony , who continued to be suave and friendly ."
"Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the Captain , who was witty , incisive , and pungent ; yet he disliked the man himself more at every visit ."
"If he had been compelled to define his impression , he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel ."
But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something .
"Sometimes he caught her glance , full of perplexity and -- it almost seemed -- distrust ."
She looked as if she felt hostile towards him .
But Alan dismissed the idea as absurd .
She had been friendly from the first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval .
Lynde 's mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem .
"She had not gone away , for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her , he responded indifferently that she was out walking ."
Alan caught a glint of amusement in the older man 's eyes as he spoke .
He could have sworn it was malicious amusement .
One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore .
"As he turned the headland of the cove , he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet away ."
The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared among the firs .
Alan was thunderstruck .
There was no room for doubt that she meant to avoid him .
He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings which he did not even then understand .
He only realized that he felt bitterly hurt and grieved -- puzzled as well .
What did it all mean ?
He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and stopped her resolutely .
"`` Miss Oliver , '' he said bluntly , `` is Miss Lynde angry with me ?"
And why ? ''
Emily looked at him piercingly .
`` Have you no idea why ? ''
she asked shortly .
"`` A mother is the best thing in the world -- I realized that when I lost mine , '' said Alan gently ."
`` How long is it since your mother died ? ''
`` Three years .
"Oh , I thought I should die too when she did ."
"She was very ill -- she was never strong , you know -- but I never thought she could die ."
There was a year then -- part of the time I did n't believe in God at all and the rest I hated Him .
I was very wicked but I was so unhappy .
Father had so many dreadful moods and -- there was something else .
I used to wish to die . ''
She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground .
"Alan , leaning against a pine tree , looked down at her ."
The sunlight fell through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood brown .
"All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time and she seemed like a helpless , weary child ."
He wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her .
"`` You must resemble your mother , '' he said absently , as if thinking aloud ."
`` You do n't look at all like your father . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , I do n't look like Mother either ."
She was tiny and dark -- she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair .
"Oh , I remember her look so well ."
I wish I did resemble her .
I loved her so -- I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble .
"At least , she died in peace . ''"
There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl 's voice as she spoke the last sentence .
Again Alan felt the unpleasant impression that there was much in her that he did not understand -- might never understand -- although such understanding was necessary to perfect friendship .
"She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him before , yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in jealous repression ."
"It must be something connected with her father , Alan thought ."
"Doubtless , Captain Anthony 's past would not bear inspection , and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her knowledge ."
His heart filled with aching pity for her ; he raged secretly because he was so powerless to help her .
"Her girlhood had been blighted , robbed of its meed of happiness and joy ."
Was she likewise to miss her womanhood ?
Alan 's hands clenched involuntarily at the unuttered question .
"`` Oh , I did n't mean to deceive you !"
I never thought of such a thing .
"When you asked me to write to you I wanted to , but I did n't know what to write about to a stranger ."
"I just could n't write you about my life here , not because it was hard , but it was so ugly and empty ."
So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live -- the life I did live in imagination .
"And when once I had begun , I had to keep it up ."
"I found it so fascinating , too !"
Those letters made that other life seem real to me .
I never expected to meet you .
These last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me .
"Oh , please go away and forgive me if you can !"
I know I can never make you understand how it came about . ''
Sidney turned away and hid her burning face against the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her .
It was worse than she had even thought it would be .
"He was so handsome , so manly , so earnest-eyed !"
"Oh , what a friend to lose !"
John Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her .
"There was a great tenderness in his face , mingled with a little kindly , friendly amusement ."
"`` Please do n't distress yourself so , Sidney , '' he said , unconsciously using her Christian name ."
`` I think I do understand .
I 'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for .
"After all , those letters were true -- or , rather , there was truth in them ."
You revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life . ''
"Sidney turned her flushed face and wet eyes slowly toward him , a little smile struggling out amid the clouds of woe ."
This young man was certainly good at understanding .
`` You -- you 'll forgive me then ? ''
she stammered .
"`` Yes , if there is anything to forgive ."
"And for my own part , I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were ."
"If I had come here and found you what I expected , living in such a home as I expected , I never could have told you or even thought of telling you what you have come to mean to me in these lonely years during which your letters have been the things most eagerly looked forward to ."
"I should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you , and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning , and that would have been all ."
"`` But I find instead just a dreamy romantic little girl , much like my sisters at home , except that she is a great deal cleverer ."
We were swept down ; the shot fell thick among us ; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall .
"For myself , I came sound to Shoreby , and being mindful of the Black Arrow , got me this gown and bell , and came softly by the path for the Moat House ."
There is no disguise to be compared with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it .
At length I came by you and Matcham .
"I could see but evilly through this same hood , and was not sure of you , being chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonished at the finding you together ."
"Moreover , in the open , where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff , I feared to disclose myself ."
"But see , '' he added , `` this poor shrew begins a little to revive ."
A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . ''
"The knight , from under his long dress , produced a stout bottle , and began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the patient , who returned gradually to consciousness , and began to roll dim eyes from one to another ."
"`` What cheer , Jack ! ''"
said Dick .
"`` It was no leper , after all ; it was Sir Daniel !"
See ! ''
"`` Swallow me a good draught of this , '' said the knight ."
`` This will give you manhood .
"Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall ."
"For , Dick , '' he continued , laying forth bread and meat upon the grass , `` I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irks me sorely to be safe between four walls ."
"Not since I backed a horse have I been pressed so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down ."
But I be not yet shent .
Some of my lads will pick me their way home .
"Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he had six ."
"Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we 'll be a man again and go a-horseback ! ''"
"And so saying , the knight filled himself a horn of canary , and pledged his ward in dumb show ."
"`` Selden , '' Dick faltered -- `` Selden '' -- And he paused again ."
Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted .
`` How ! ''
"he cried , in a changed voice ."
`` Selden ?
Speak !
What of Selden ? ''
Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre .
"The knight heard in silence ; but as he listened , his countenance became convulsed with rage and grief ."
"You remember the Pied Piper -- but no , of course you would n't -- you were too young ."
One evening long ago when Nan and Di and Jem and the Merediths and I were together in Rainbow Valley I had a queer vision or presentiment -- whatever you like to call it .
"Rilla , I saw the Piper coming down the Valley with a shadowy host behind him ."
The others thought I was only pretending -- but I saw him for just one moment .
"And Rilla , last night I saw him again ."
"I was doing sentry-go and I saw him marching across No-man 's - land from our trenches to the German trenches -- the same tall shadowy form , piping weirdly -- and behind him followed boys in khaki ."
"Rilla , I tell you I saw him -- it was no fancy -- no illusion ."
"I heard his music , and then -- he was gone ."
But I had seen him -- and I knew what it meant -- I knew that I was among those who followed him .
"`` Rilla , the Piper will pipe me ` west ' tomorrow ."
I feel sure of this .
"And Rilla , I 'm not afraid ."
"When you hear the news , remember that ."
I 've won my own freedom here -- freedom from all fear .
"I shall never be afraid of anything again -- not of death -- nor of life , if after all , I am to go on living ."
"And life , I think , would be the harder of the two to face -- for it could never be beautiful for me again ."
There would always be such horrible things to remember -- things that would make life ugly and painful always for me .
I could never forget them .
"But whether it 's life or death , I 'm not afraid , Rilla-my-Rilla , and I am not sorry that I came ."
I 'm satisfied .
"I 'll never write the poems I once dreamed of writing -- but I 've helped to make Canada safe for the poets of the future -- for the workers of the future -- ay , and the dreamers , too -- for if no man dreams , there will be nothing for the workers to fulfil -- the future , not of Canada only but of the world -- when the ` red rain ' of Langemarck and Verdun shall have brought forth a golden harvest -- not in a year or two , as some foolishly think , but a generation later , when the seed sown now shall have had time to germinate and grow ."
"Yes , I 'm glad I came , Rilla ."
It is n't only the fate of the little sea-born island I love that is in the balance -- nor of Canada nor of England .
It 's the fate of mankind .
That is what we 're fighting for .
"And we shall win -- never for a moment doubt that , Rilla ."
For it is n't only the living who are fighting -- the dead are fighting too .
Such an army can not be defeated .
"`` Is there laughter in your face yet , Rilla ?"
I hope so .
The world will need laughter and courage more than ever in the years that will come next .
I do n't want to preach -- this is n't any time for it .
They then quarrelled ; the cause of the quarrel was insignificant ; with anyone else than Eugene a reconciliation would soon have been effected .
But Eugene never was friendly with your father from that time .
I think he was jealous of old Grandfather 's affection ; thought the old man loved your father best .
"And then , as I have said , he was very eccentric and stubborn ."
"Well , your father went away to college and graduated , and then -- we were married ."
Grandfather Page was very angry with him for marrying me .
He wanted him to marry somebody else .
He told him he would disinherit him if he married me .
I did not know this until we were married .
But Grandfather Page kept his word .
"He sent for a lawyer and had a new will made , leaving everything to Eugene ."
"I think , nay , I am sure , that he would have relented in time , but he died the very next week ; they found him dead in his bed one morning , so Eugene got everything ; and that is all there is of the story , Dorinda . ''"
`` And Uncle Eugene has been our enemy ever since ? ''
"`` Yes , ever since ."
"So you see , Dorinda dear , that I can not ask any favours of Uncle Eugene . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , '' said Dorinda understandingly ."
"We kept thinking of poor Laura and Magsie at home , dining off potatoes on Thanksgiving !"
But at least Aunt Susanna was satisfied .
When Kate and I were washing the dishes she came out quite beamingly .
"`` Well , my dears , I must admit that you made a very good job of the dinner , indeed ."
The turkey was done to perfection .
"As for the mince pies -- well , of course Miranda Mary made them , but she must have had extra good luck with them , for they were excellent and heated to just the right degree ."
"You did n't give anything to the McGinnis dog , I hope ? ''"
"`` No , we did n't give him anything , '' said Kate ."
Aunt Susanna did not notice the emphasis .
When we had finished the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen out of the house and went home .
Laura and Margaret were busy painting and studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we had n't robbed them of their dinner .
But we had to tell them the whole story before we even took off our hats .
"`` There is a special Providence for children and idiots , '' said Laura gently ."
We did n't ask her whether she meant us or Tony McGinnis or both .
There are some things better left in obscurity .
I 'd have probably said something much sharper than that if anybody had made off with my Thanksgiving turkey so unceremoniously .
Kettley was one such place ; it had come very lately into his clutches ; he still met with opposition from the tenants ; and it was to overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way .
"By two in the morning , Sir Daniel sat in the inn room , close by the fireside , for it was cold at that hour among the fens of Kettley ."
By his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale .
"He had taken off his visored headpiece , and sat with his bald head and thin , dark visage resting on one hand , wrapped warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak ."
"At the lower end of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay asleep on benches ; and somewhat nearer hand , a young lad , apparently of twelve or thirteen , was stretched in a mantle on the floor ."
The host of the Sun stood before the great man .
"`` Now , mark me , mine host , '' Sir Daniel said , `` follow but mine orders , and I shall be your good lord ever ."
"I must have good men for head boroughs , and I will have Adam-a-More high constable ; see to it narrowly ."
"If other men be chosen , it shall avail you nothing ; rather it shall be found to your sore cost ."
"For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take good measure -- you among the rest , mine host . ''"
"`` Good knight , '' said the host , `` I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion ."
"Nay , bully knight , I love not the rogue Walsinghams ; they were as poor as thieves , bully knight ."
Give me a great lord like you .
"Nay ; ask me among the neighbours , I am stout for Brackley . ''"
"`` It may be , '' said Sir Daniel , dryly ."
`` Ye shall then pay twice . ''
"The innkeeper made a horrid grimace ; but this was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times , and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily ."
"`` Bring up yon fellow , Selden ! ''"
cried the knight .
"And one of his retainers led up a poor , cringing old man , as pale as a candle , and all shaking with the fen fever ."
"`` Sirrah , '' said Sir Daniel , `` your name ? ''"
"`` A n't please your worship , '' replied the man , `` my name is Condall -- Condall of Shoreby , at your good worship 's pleasure . ''"
"`` I have heard you ill reported on , '' returned the knight ."
"`` Ye deal in treason , rogue ; ye trudge the country leasing ; y ' are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals ."
"How , fellow , are ye so bold ?"
But I will bring you down . ''
"`` Right honourable and my reverend lord , '' the man cried , `` here is some hodge-podge , saving your good presence ."
"I am but a poor private man , and have hurt none . ''"
"`` The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely , '' said the knight . ''"
"` Seize me , ' saith he , ` that Tyndal of Shoreby . ' ''"
"`` Condall , my good lord ; Condall is my poor name , '' said the unfortunate ."
"`` Condall or Tyndal , it is all one , '' replied Sir Daniel , coolly ."
Ride -- ride fast ! ''
And then the poor young lady fainted once again .
"One of Dick 's men carried a flask of some strong cordial , and with this Dick succeeded in reviving consciousness ."
"Then he took Joanna 's friend upon his saddlebow , and once more pushed toward the forest ."
`` Why do ye take me ? ''
said the girl .
`` Ye but delay your speed . ''
"`` Nay , Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick ."
`` Shoreby is full of blood and drunkenness and riot .
Here ye are safe ; content ye . ''
"`` I will not be beholden to any of your faction , '' she cried ; `` set me down . ''"
"`` Madam , ye know not what ye say , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Y ' are hurt '' -- `` I am not , '' she said ."
`` It was my horse was slain . ''
"`` It matters not one jot , '' replied Richard ."
"`` Ye are here in the midst of open snow , and compassed about with enemies ."
"Whether ye will or not , I carry you with me ."
Glad am I to have the occasion ; for thus shall I repay some portion of our debt . ''
For a little while she was silent .
"Then , very suddenly , she asked : `` My uncle ? ''"
`` My Lord Risingham ? ''
returned Dick .
"`` I would I had good news to give you , madam ; but I have none ."
"I saw him once in the battle , and once only ."
Let us hope the best . ''
"CHAPTER V -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS : ALICIA RISINGHAM It was almost certain that Sir Daniel had made for the Moat House ; but , considering the heavy snow , the lateness of the hour , and the necessity under which he would lie of avoiding the few roads and striking across the wood , it was equally certain that he could not hope to reach it ere the morrow ."
"There were two courses open to Dick ; either to continue to follow in the knight 's trail , and , if he were able , to fall upon him that very night in camp , or to strike out a path of his own , and seek to place himself between Sir Daniel and his destination ."
"Either scheme was open to serious objection , and Dick , who feared to expose Joanna to the hazards of a fight , had not yet decided between them when he reached the borders of the wood ."
"At this point Sir Daniel had turned a little to his left , and then plunged straight under a grove of very lofty timber ."
"His party had then formed to a narrower front , in order to pass between the trees , and the track was trod proportionally deeper in the snow ."
"The eye followed it under the leafless tracery of the oaks , running direct and narrow ; the trees stood over it , with knotty joints and the great , uplifted forest of their boughs ; there was no sound , whether of man or beast -- not so much as the stirring of a robin ; and over the field of snow the winter sun lay golden among netted shadows ."
"`` How say ye , '' asked Dick of one of the men , `` to follow straight on , or strike across for Tunstall ? ''"
"Any day , any hour , might bring John Lincoln to Plainfield ."
What should she do ?
Hide from him ?
Refuse to see him ?
But he would find out the truth just the same ; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely .
"Sidney trod the way of the transgressor , and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow ."
Everything had come to an end -- nothing was left to her !
In the untried recklessness of twenty untempered years she wished she could die before John Lincoln came to Plainfield .
The eyes of youth could not see how she could possibly live afterward .
* * * * * Some days later a young man stepped from the C.P.R. train at Plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place boasted .
After getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could direct him to `` The Evergreens . ''
Caleb Williams looked at his guest in bewilderment .
"`` Never heerd o ' such a place , '' he said ."
"`` It is the name of Mr. Conway 's estate -- Mr. James Conway , '' explained John Lincoln ."
"`` Oh , Jim Conway 's place ! ''"
said Caleb .
`` Did n't know that was what he called it .
Sartin I kin tell you whar ' to find it .
You see that road out thar ' ?
"Well , just follow it straight along for a mile and a half till you come to a blacksmith 's forge ."
Jim Conway 's house is just this side of it on the right -- back from the road a smart piece and no other handy .
You ca n't mistake it . ''
"John Lincoln did not expect to mistake it , once he found it ; he knew by heart what it appeared like from Sidney 's description : an old stately mansion of mellowed brick , covered with ivy and set back from the highway amid fine ancestral trees , with a pine-grove behind it , a river to the left , and a harbour beyond ."
"He strode along the road in the warm , ruddy sunshine of early evening ."
It was not a bad-looking road at all ; the farmsteads sprinkled along it were for the most part snug and wholesome enough ; yet somehow it was different from what he had expected it to be .
And there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible .
Had the hotel-keeper made a mistake ?
Perhaps he had meant some other James Conway .
Presently he found himself before the blacksmith 's forge .
"Beside it was a rickety , unpainted gate opening into a snake-fenced lane feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces ."
"It ran down a bare hill , crossed a little ravine full of young white-stemmed birches , and up another bare hill to an equally bare crest where a farmhouse was perched -- a farmhouse painted a stark , staring yellow and the ugliest thing in farmhouses that John Lincoln had ever seen , even among the log shacks of the west ."
"He knew now that he had been misdirected , but as there seemed to be nobody about the forge he concluded that he had better go to the yellow house and inquire within ."
"And we could hear him adding to himself , `` Cap'n , is it ?"
"My heart , and here 's promotion ! ''"
Long John answered for himself .
"`` Me , sir ."
"These poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sir '' -- laying a particular emphasis upon the word `` desertion . ''"
"`` We 're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it ."
"All I ask is your word , Cap'n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ' shot before a gun is fired . ''"
"`` My man , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I have not the slightest desire to talk to you ."
"If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that 's all ."
"If there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and the Lord help you . ''"
"`` That 's enough , cap'n , '' shouted Long John cheerily ."
`` A word from you 's enough .
"I know a gentleman , and you may lay to that . ''"
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back .
"Nor was that wonderful , seeing how cavalier had been the captain 's answer ."
But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd .
"Then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side ."
"I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand ."
"He was whistling `` Come , Lasses and Lads . ''"
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll .
"What with the steepness of the incline , the thick tree stumps , and the soft sand , he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays ."
"But he stuck to it like a man in silence , and at last arrived before the captain , whom he saluted in the handsomest style ."
"He was tricked out in his best ; an immense blue coat , thick with brass buttons , hung as low as to his knees , and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head ."
"`` Here you are , my man , '' said the captain , raising his head ."
`` You had better sit down . ''
"`` You ai n't a-going to let me inside , cap'n ? ''"
complained Long John .
"`` It 's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand . ''"
"`` Why , Silver , '' said the captain , `` if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley ."
It 's your own doing .
"You 're either my ship 's cook -- and then you were treated handsome -- or Cap'n Silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang ! ''"
"`` Well , well , cap'n , '' returned the sea-cook , sitting down as he was bidden on the sand , `` you 'll have to give me a hand up again , that 's all ."
`` Mostly .
"Rather a neat job , I flatter myself . ''"
`` I should say so .
What a clever fellow you are !
Any new inventions lately ? ''
"asked Frank , coming up to examine and admire ."
"`` Only an anti-snoring machine and an elbow-pad , '' answered Ralph , with a twinkle in his eye , as if reminded of something funny ."
"`` Go on , and tell about them ."
I never heard of an anti-snorer .
"Jack better have one , '' said Frank , interested at once ."
"`` Well , a rich old lady kept her family awake with that lively music , so she sent to Shirtman and Codleff for something to stop it ."
"They thought it was a good joke , and told me to see what I could do ."
"I thought it over , and got up the nicest little affair you ever saw ."
"It went over the mouth , and had a tube to fit the ear , so when the lady snored she woke herself up and stopped it ."
It suited exactly .
"I think of taking out a patent , '' concluded Ralph , joining in the boys ' laugh at the droll idea ."
`` What was the pad ? ''
"asked Frank , returning to the small model of an engine he was making ."
"`` Oh , that was a mere trifle for a man who had a tender elbow-joint and wanted something to protect it ."
"I made a little pad to fit on , and his crazy-bone was safe . ''"
"`` I planned to have you make me a new leg if this one was spoilt , '' said Jack , sure that his friend could invent anything under the sun ."
`` I 'd do my best for you .
"I made a hand for a fellow once , and that got me my place , you know , '' answered Ralph , who thought little of such mechanical trifles , and longed to be painting portraits or modelling busts , being an artist as well as an inventor ."
"Here Gus , Ed , and several other boys came in , and the conversation became general ."
"Grif , Chick , and Brickbat were three young gentlemen whose own respectable names were usually ignored , and they cheerfully answered to these nicknames ."
"As the clock struck seven , Frank , who ruled the club with a rod of iron when Chairman , took his place behind the study table ."
"Seats stood about it , and a large , shabby book lay before Gus , who was Secretary , and kept the records with a lavish expenditure of ink , to judge by the blots ."
"The members took their seats , and nearly all tilted back their chairs and put their hands in their pockets , to keep them out of mischief ; for , as every one knows , it is impossible for two lads to be near each other and refrain from tickling or pinching ."
"Frank gave three raps with an old croquet-mallet set on a short handle , and with much dignity opened the meeting ."
"`` Gentlemen , the business of the club will be attended to , and then we will discuss the question , ` Shall girls go to our colleges ? '"
The Secretary will now read the report of the last meeting . ''
"Clearing his throat , Gus read the following brief and elegant report : -- `` Club met , December 18th , at the house of G. Burton , Esq. ."
"As for me , I had n't any real objection to marrying him , after all , for if he was short of romance he was good-natured and has a fat bank account ; but I hated to be driven into it that way ."
"`` You 'd better take him , Melissa , '' I said entreatingly ."
`` I 've had one husband and that is enough . ''
"`` More than enough for me , thank you , '' said Melissa sarcastically ."
"`` Isaac is a fine man and has a lovely house ; and you are n't sure the Kingsbridge man really means anything , '' I went on ."
"`` I would rather , '' said Melissa , with the same awful calmness , `` jump down from this roof and break my neck , or be devoured piecemeal by that fiend down there than marry Isaac Appleby . ''"
It did n't seem worth while to say anything more after that .
We sat there in stony silence and the time dragged by .
"I was hot , hungry , thirsty , cross ; and besides , I felt that I was in a ridiculous position , which was worse than all the rest ."
We could see Isaac sitting in the shade of one of his apple trees in the front orchard comfortably reading a newspaper .
I think if he had n't aggravated me by doing that I 'd have given in sooner .
"But as it was , I was determined to be as stubborn as everybody else ."
We were four obstinate creatures -- Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I .
At four o'clock Isaac got up and went into the house ; in a few minutes he came out again with a basket in one hand and a ball of cord in the other .
"`` I do n't intend to starve you , of course , ladies , '' he said politely , `` I will throw this ball up to you and you can then draw up the basket . ''"
"I caught the ball , for Melissa never turned her head ."
"I would have preferred to be scornful , too , and reject the food altogether ; but I was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride in my pocket and hauled the basket up ."
"Besides , I thought it might enable us to hold out until some loophole of escape presented itself ."
Isaac went back into the house and I unpacked the basket .
"There was a bottle of milk , some bread and butter , and a pie ."
"Melissa would n't take a morsel of the food , but she was so thirsty she had to take a drink of milk ."
"She tried to lift her veil -- and something caught ; Melissa gave it a savage twitch , and off came veil and hat -- and all her front hair !"
You never saw such a sight .
"I 'd always suspected Melissa wore a false front , but I 'd never had any proof before ."
"Melissa pinned on her hair again and put on her hat and drank the milk , all without a word ; but she was purple ."
I felt sorry for her .
And I felt sorry for Isaac when I tried to eat that bread .
It was sour and dreadful .
"As for the pie , it was hopeless ."
"I tasted it , and then threw it down to Julius Caesar ."
"Julius Caesar , not being over particular , ate it up ."
"I thought perhaps it would kill him , for anything might come of eating such a concoction ."
Make it up to him -- show him but this chance to become wealthy -- and I will go pledge he will forgive you . ''
"So far Dick had spoken pretty much at random ; but it was now necessary , under the supervision of six eyes , to invent and tell some marvellous story , and , if it were possible , get back into his hands the all-important signet ."
To squander time was the first necessity .
"The longer his stay lasted , the more would his captors drink , and the surer should he be when he attempted his escape ."
"Well , Dick was not much of an inventor , and what he told was pretty much the tale of Ali Baba , with Shoreby and Tunstall Forest substituted for the East , and the treasures of the cavern rather exaggerated than diminished ."
"As the reader is aware , it is an excellent story , and has but one drawback -- that it is not true ; and so , as these three simple shipmen now heard it for the first time , their eyes stood out of their faces , and their mouths gaped like codfish at a fishmonger 's ."
Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale was called for ; and while Dick was still artfully spinning out the incidents a third followed the second .
"Here was the position of the parties towards the end : Arblaster , three-parts drunk and one-half asleep , hung helpless on his stool ."
"Even Tom had been much delighted with the tale , and his vigilance had abated in proportion ."
"Meanwhile , Dick had gradually wormed his right arm clear of its bonds , and was ready to risk all ."
"`` And so , '' said Pirret , `` y ' are one of these ? ''"
"`` I was made so , '' replied Dick , `` against my will ; but an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share , I should be a fool indeed to continue dwelling in a filthy cave , and standing shot and buffet like a soldier ."
Here be we four ; good !
"Let us , then , go forth into the forest to-morrow ere the sun be up ."
"Could we come honestly by a donkey , it were better ; but an we can not , we have our four strong backs , and I warrant me we shall come home staggering . ''"
Pirret licked his lips .
"`` And this magic , '' he said -- `` this password , whereby the cave is opened -- how call ye it , friend ? ''"
"`` Nay , none know the word but the three chiefs , '' returned Dick ; `` but here is your great good fortune , that , on this very evening , I should be the bearer of a spell to open it ."
It is a thing not trusted twice a year beyond the captain 's wallet . ''
`` A spell ! ''
"said Arblaster , half awakening , and squinting upon Dick with one eye ."
`` Aroint thee !
no spells !
I be a good Christian .
"Ask my man Tom , else . ''"
"`` Nay , but this is white magic , '' said Dick ."
"`` It doth naught with the devil ; only the powers of numbers , herbs , and planets . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Pirret ; '' 't is but white magic , gossip ."
"There is no sin therein , I do assure you ."
"But proceed , good youth ."
This spell -- in what should it consist ? ''
"`` Nay , that I will incontinently show you , '' answered Dick ."
`` No snow . ''
"`` Lawn to rake , then ? ''"
`` Not time for that yet . ''
`` Catalogue of books ? ''
`` Frank got that job . ''
`` Copy those letters for your mother ? ''
`` Take me too long .
"Must have my money Friday , if possible . ''"
"`` I do n't see what we can do , then ."
"It is too early or too late for everything , and you wo n't borrow . ''"
`` Not of you .
"No , nor of any one else , if I can possibly help it ."
"I 've promised to do this myself , and I will ; '' and Jack wagged his head resolutely ."
`` Could n't you do something with the printing-press ?
"Do me some cards , and then , perhaps , the other girls will want some , '' said Jill , as a forlorn hope ."
`` Just the thing !
What a goose I was not to think of it .
I 'll rig the old machine up at once . ''
"And , starting from his seat , Jack dived into the big closet , dragged out the little press , and fell to oiling , dusting , and putting it in order , like one relieved of a great anxiety ."
"`` Give me the types ; I 'll sort them and set up my name , so you can begin as soon as you are ready ."
You know what a help I was when we did the programmes .
"I 'm almost sure the girls will want cards , and I know your mother would like some more tags , '' said Jill , briskly rattling the letters into the different compartments , while Jack inked the rollers and hunted up his big apron , whistling the while with recovered spirits ."
"A dozen neat cards were soon printed , and Jill insisted on paying six cents for them , as earning was not borrowing ."
"A few odd tags were found and done for Mamma , who immediately ordered four dozen at six cents a dozen , though she was not told why there was such a pressing call for money ."
"Jack 's monthly half-dollar had been spent the first week , -- twenty-five cents for a concert , ten paid a fine for keeping a book too long from the library , ten more to have his knife ground , and five in candy , for he dearly loved sweeties , and was under bonds to Mamma not to spend more than five cents a month on these unwholesome temptations ."
"She never asked the boys what they did with their money , but expected them to keep account in the little books she gave them ; and , now and then , they showed the neat pages with pardonable pride , though she often laughed at the queer items ."
"All that evening Jack & Co. worked busily , for when Frank came in he good-naturedly ordered some pale-pink cards for Annette , and ran to the store to choose the right shade , and buy some packages for the young printer also ."
`` What do you suppose he is in such a pucker for ? ''
"whispered Jill , as she set up the new name , to Frank , who sat close by , with one eye on his book and one on her ."
"`` Oh , some notion ."
"He 's a queer chap ; but I guess it is n't much of a scrape , or I should know it ."
"He 's so good-natured he 's always promising to do things for people , and has too much pluck to give up when he finds he ca n't ."
"`` This morning , '' he said , `` I was somewhat jealous of your favour ; it hath not been of a long growth ; and now , Sir Richard , it is with a very good heart that I offer you this horse -- to ride away with . ''"
"`` Suffer me yet a moment , '' replied Dick ."
`` This favour of mine -- whereupon was it founded ? ''
"`` Upon your name , '' answered Catesby ."
`` It is my lord 's chief superstition .
"Were my name Richard , I should be an earl to-morrow . ''"
"`` Well , sir , I thank you , '' returned Dick ; `` and since I am little likely to follow these great fortunes , I will even say farewell ."
"I will not pretend I was displeased to think myself upon the road to fortune ; but I will not pretend , neither , that I am over-sorry to be done with it ."
"Command and riches , they are brave things , to be sure ; but a word in your ear -- yon duke of yours , he is a fearsome lad . ''"
Catesby laughed .
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` of a verity he that rides with Crooked Dick will ride deep ."
"Well , God keep us all from evil !"
Speed ye well . ''
"Thereupon Dick put himself at the head of his men , and giving the word of command , rode off ."
"He made straight across the town , following what he supposed to be the route of Sir Daniel , and spying around for any signs that might decide if he were right ."
"The streets were strewn with the dead and the wounded , whose fate , in the bitter frost , was far the more pitiable ."
"Gangs of the victors went from house to house , pillaging and stabbing , and sometimes singing together as they went ."
"From different quarters , as he rode on , the sounds of violence and outrage came to young Shelton 's ears ; now the blows of the sledge-hammer on some barricaded door , and now the miserable shrieks of women ."
Dick 's heart had just been awakened .
He had just seen the cruel consequences of his own behaviour ; and the thought of the sum of misery that was now acting in the whole of Shoreby filled him with despair .
"At length he reached the outskirts , and there , sure enough , he saw straight before him the same broad , beaten track across the snow that he had marked from the summit of the church ."
"Here , then , he went the faster on ; but still , as he rode , he kept a bright eye upon the fallen men and horses that lay beside the track ."
"Many of these , he was relieved to see , wore Sir Daniel 's colours , and the faces of some , who lay upon their back , he even recognised ."
"About half-way between the town and the forest , those whom he was following had plainly been assailed by archers ; for the corpses lay pretty closely scattered , each pierced by an arrow ."
"And here Dick spied among the rest the body of a very young lad , whose face was somehow hauntingly familiar to him ."
"He halted his troop , dismounted , and raised the lad 's head ."
"As he did so , the hood fell back , and a profusion of long brown hair unrolled itself ."
At the same time the eyes opened .
`` Ah !
lion driver ! ''
said a feeble voice .
`` She is farther on .
"And then there was water there , and water 's a thing that dauntons even me ."
"No , no , '' said Alan , `` it 's no you that 's to blame , it 's me . ''"
I asked him why .
"`` Why , '' said he , `` I have proved myself a gomeral this night ."
"For first of all I take a wrong road , and that in my own country of Appin ; so that the day has caught us where we should never have been ; and thanks to that , we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort ."
"And next -LRB- which is the worst of the two , for a man that has been so much among the heather as myself -RRB- I have come wanting a water-bottle , and here we lie for a long summer 's day with naething but neat spirit ."
"Ye may think that a small matter ; but before it comes night , David , ye 'll give me news of it . ''"
"I was anxious to redeem my character , and offered , if he would pour out the brandy , to run down and fill the bottle at the river ."
"`` I wouldnae waste the good spirit either , '' says he ."
"`` It 's been a good friend to you this night ; or in my poor opinion , ye would still be cocking on yon stone ."
"And what 's mair , '' says he , `` ye may have observed -LRB- you that 's a man of so much penetration -RRB- that Alan Breck Stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar ' . ''"
`` You ! ''
"I cried , `` you were running fit to burst . ''"
`` Was I so ? ''
said he .
"`` Well , then , ye may depend upon it , there was nae time to be lost ."
"And now here is enough said ; gang you to your sleep , lad , and I 'll watch . ''"
"Accordingly , I lay down to sleep ; a little peaty earth had drifted in between the top of the two rocks , and some bracken grew there , to be a bed to me ; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles ."
"I dare say it would be nine in the morning when I was roughly awakened , and found Alan 's hand pressed upon my mouth ."
`` Wheesht ! ''
he whispered .
`` Ye were snoring . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , surprised at his anxious and dark face , `` and why not ? ''"
"He peered over the edge of the rock , and signed to me to do the like ."
"It was now high day , cloudless , and very hot ."
The valley was as clear as in a picture .
"About half a mile up the water was a camp of red-coats ; a big fire blazed in their midst , at which some were cooking ; and near by , on the top of a rock about as high as ours , there stood a sentry , with the sun sparkling on his arms ."
"All the way down along the river-side were posted other sentries ; here near together , there widelier scattered ; some planted like the first , on places of command , some on the ground level and marching and counter-marching , so as to meet half-way ."
"Higher up the glen , where the ground was more open , the chain of posts was continued by horse-soldiers , whom we could see in the distance riding to and fro ."
"Lower down , the infantry continued ; but as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable burn , they were more widely set , and only watched the fords and stepping-stones ."
"I took but one look at them , and ducked again into my place ."
"It was strange indeed to see this valley , which had lain so solitary in the hour of dawn , bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and breeches ."
"asked Oliver Sloane , arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla ."
`` Have n't you heard ? ''
said Jane wrathfully .
"`` Well , its simply this ... Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green ... a deep , brilliant blue , the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows ."
"And Mrs. Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building , especially when combined with a red roof , that she ever saw or imagined ."
You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I heard it .
"It 's heartbreaking , after all the trouble we 've had . ''"
`` How on earth could such a mistake have happened ? ''
wailed Diana .
The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the Pyes .
The Improvers had decided to use Morton-Harris paints and the Morton-Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card .
A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number .
"Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr. Roger Pye sent word to the Improvers by his son , John Andrew , that he was going to town and would get their paint for them , the Improvers told John Andrew to tell his father to get 147 ."
"John Andrew always averred that he did so , but Mr. Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him 157 ; and there the matter stands to this day ."
That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an Improver lived .
The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it quenched even Davy .
Anne wept and would not be comforted .
"`` I must cry , even if I am almost seventeen , Marilla , '' she sobbed ."
`` It is so mortifying .
And it sounds the death knell of our society .
We 'll simply be laughed out of existence . ''
"In life , as in dreams , however , things often go by contraries ."
The Avonlea people did not laugh ; they were too angry .
Their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake .
Public indignation centered on the Pyes .
"Roger Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them ; and as for Joshua Pye , he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint ."
"Joshua Pye , when thus animadverted upon , retorted that the Avonlea taste in colors was no business of his , whatever his private opinion might be ; he had been hired to paint the hall , not to talk about it ; and he meant to have his money for it ."
"The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit , after consulting Mr. Peter Sloane , who was a magistrate ."
"`` You 'll have to pay it , '' Peter told him ."
"`` You ca n't hold him responsible for the mistake , since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead ."
But it 's a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful . ''
"The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them ; but instead , public sympathy veered around in their favor ."
But this was different .
Perhaps she needed the advice or assistance only he could give .
"To whom else in Bayside could she turn for it but to him , her old friend ?"
Was it possible that she must leave Pinehurst ?
The thought struck cold dismay to his soul .
How could he bear his life if she went away ?
He had loved Sara Stuart from childhood .
"He remembered vividly the day he had first seen her -- a spring day , much like this one had been ; he , a boy of eight , had gone with his father to the big , sunshiny hill field and he had searched for birds ' nests in the little fir copses along the crest while his father plowed ."
"He had so come upon her , sitting on the fence under the pines at the back of Pinehurst -- a child of six in a dress of purple cloth ."
"Her long , light brown curls fell over her shoulders and rippled sleekly back from her calm little brow ; her eyes were large and greyish blue , straight-gazing and steadfast ."
To the end of his life the boy was to carry in his heart the picture she made there under the pines .
"`` Little boy , '' she had said , with a friendly smile , `` will you show me where the mayflowers grow ? ''"
"Shyly enough he had assented , and they set out together for the barrens beyond the field , where the arbutus trailed its stars of sweetness under the dusty dead grasses and withered leaves of the old year ."
The boy was thrilled with delight .
She was a fairy queen who thus graciously smiled on him and chattered blithely as they searched for mayflowers in the fresh spring sunshine .
He thought it a wonderful thing that it had so chanced .
"It overjoyed him to give the choicest dusters he found into her slim , waxen little fingers , and watch her eyes grow round with pleasure in them ."
"When the sun began to lower over the beeches she had gone home with her arms full of arbutus , but she had turned at the edge of the pineland and waved her hand at him ."
"That night , when he told his mother of the little girl he had met on the hill , she had hoped anxiously that he had been `` very polite , '' for the little girl was a daughter of Colonel Stuart , newly come to Pinehurst ."
"Jeffrey , reflecting , had not been certain that he had been polite ; `` But I am sure she liked me , '' he said gravely ."
A few days later a message came from Mrs. Stuart on the hill to Mrs. Miller in the valley .
Would she let her little boy go up now and then to play with Sara ?
Sara was very lonely because she had no playmates .
"So Jeff , overjoyed , had gone to his divinity 's very home , where the two children played together many a day ."
All through their childhood they had been fast friends .
Sara 's parents placed no bar to their intimacy .
They had soon concluded that little Jeff Miller was a very good playmate for Sara .
"He was gentle , well-behaved , and manly ."
Sara never went to the district school which Jeff attended ; she had her governess at home .
"With no other boy or girl in Bayside did she form any friendship , but her loyalty to Jeff never wavered ."
"As for Jeff , he worshipped her and would have done anything she commanded ."
He belonged to her from the day they had hunted arbutus on the hill .
`` What 's this ? ''
"`` We 're a-changing of the powder , Jack , '' answers one ."
"`` Why , by the powers , '' cried Long John , `` if we do , we 'll miss the morning tide ! ''"
`` My orders ! ''
said the captain shortly .
"`` You may go below , my man ."
Hands will want supper . ''
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley ."
"`` That 's a good man , captain , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Very likely , sir , '' replied Captain Smollett ."
"`` Easy with that , men -- easy , '' he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , `` Here you , ship 's boy , '' he cried , `` out o ' that !"
Off with you to the cook and get some work . ''
"And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , `` I 'll have no favourites on my ship . ''"
"I assure you I was quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply ."
"10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place , and boatfuls of the squire 's friends , Mr. Blandly and the like , coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return ."
"We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work ; and I was dog-tired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars ."
"I might have been twice as weary , yet I would not have left the deck , all was so new and interesting to me -- the brief commands , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship 's lanterns ."
"`` Now , Barbecue , tip us a stave , '' cried one voice ."
"`` The old one , '' cried another ."
"`` Aye , aye , mates , '' said Long John , who was standing by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- '' And then the whole crew bore chorus : -- `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
And at the third `` Ho ! ''
drove the bars before them with a will .
"Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second , and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus ."
"But soon the anchor was short up ; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows ; soon the sails began to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure ."
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail .
It was fairly prosperous .
"The ship proved to be a good ship , the crew were capable seamen , and the captain thoroughly understood his business ."
"But before we came the length of Treasure Island , two or three things had happened which require to be known ."
"Mr. Arrow , first of all , turned out even worse than the captain had feared ."
"He had no command among the men , and people did what they pleased with him ."
"But that was by no means the worst of it , for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheeks , stuttering tongue , and other marks of drunkenness ."
Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace .
"cried Frank , relenting ."
"`` Now , Jack , make their minds easy before they begin to weep and wail . ''"
`` Left the box outside .
"You tell while I go for it ; '' and Jack bolted , as if afraid the young ladies might be too demonstrative when the tale was told ."
"`` Tell away , '' said Frank , modestly passing the story along to Gus , who made short work of it ."
"`` We rampaged all over the country , and got only that small mess of greens ."
"Knew you 'd be disgusted , and sat down to see what we could do ."
"Then Jack piped up , and said he 'd show us a place where we could get a plenty ."
"` Come on , ' said we , and after leading us a nice tramp , he brought us out at Morse 's greenhouse ."
"So we got a few on tick , as we had but four cents among us , and there you are ."
"Pretty clever of the little chap , was n't it ? ''"
"A chorus of delight greeted Jack as he popped his head in , was promptly seized by his elders and walked up to the table , where the box was opened , displaying gay posies enough to fill most of the baskets if distributed with great economy and much green ."
`` You are the dearest boy that ever was ! ''
"began Jill , with her nose luxuriously buried in the box , though the flowers were more remarkable for color than perfume ."
"`` No , I 'm not ; there 's a much dearer one coming upstairs now , and he 's got something that will make you howl for joy , '' said Jack , ignoring his own prowess as Ed came in with a bigger box , looking as if he had done nothing but go a Maying all his days ."
`` Do n't believe it ! ''
"cried Jill , hugging her own treasure jealously ."
`` It 's only another joke .
"I wo n't look , '' said Molly , still struggling to make her cambric roses bloom again ."
`` I know what it is !
"Oh , how sweet ! ''"
"added Merry , sniffing , as Ed set the box before her , saying pleasantly , -- `` You shall see first , because you had faith . ''"
"Up went the cover , and a whiff of the freshest fragrance regaled the seven eager noses bent to inhale it , as a general murmur of pleasure greeted the nest of great , rosy mayflowers that lay before them ."
"`` The dear things , how lovely they are ! ''"
"and Merry looked as if greeting her cousins , so blooming and sweet was her own face ."
"Molly pushed her dingy garlands away , ashamed of such poor attempts beside these perfect works of nature , and Jill stretched out her hand involuntarily , as she said , forgetting her exotics , `` Give me just one to smell of , it is so woodsy and delicious . ''"
"`` Here you are , plenty for all ."
"Real Pilgrim Fathers , right from Plymouth ."
"One of our fellows lives there , and I told him to bring me a good lot ; so he did , and you can do what you like with them , '' explained Ed , passing round bunches and shaking the rest in a mossy pile upon the table ."
`` Ed always gets ahead of us in doing the right thing at the right time .
"Hope you 've got some first-class baskets ready for him , '' said Gus , refreshing the Washingtonian nose with a pink blossom or two ."
"`` Not much danger of his being forgotten , '' answered Molly ; and every one laughed , for Ed was much beloved by all the girls , and his door-steps always bloomed like a flower-bed on May eve ."
"It was now his business to seek out the Duke of Gloucester , who alone , in the disorder of the forces , might be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men ."
"The fighting in the main town was now practically at an end ; and as Dick ran hither and thither , seeking the commander , the streets were thick with wandering soldiers , some laden with more booty than they could well stagger under , others shouting drunk ."
"None of them , when questioned , had the least notion of the duke 's whereabouts ; and , at last , it was by sheer good fortune that Dick found him , where he sat in the saddle directing operations to dislodge the archers from the harbour side ."
"`` Sir Richard Shelton , ye are well found , '' he said ."
"`` I owe you one thing that I value little , my life ; and one that I can never pay you for , this victory ."
"Catesby , if I had ten such captains as Sir Richard , I would march forthright on London ."
"But now , sir , claim your reward . ''"
"`` Freely , my lord , '' said Dick , `` freely and loudly ."
"One hath escaped to whom I owe some grudges , and taken with him one whom I owe love and service ."
"Give me , then , fifty lances , that I may pursue ; and for any obligation that your graciousness is pleased to allow , it shall be clean discharged . ''"
`` How call ye him ? ''
inquired the duke .
"`` Sir Daniel Brackley , '' answered Richard ."
"`` Out upon him , double-face ! ''"
cried Gloucester .
"`` Here is no reward , Sir Richard ; here is fresh service offered , and , if that ye bring his head to me , a fresh debt upon my conscience ."
"Catesby , get him these lances ; and you , sir , bethink ye , in the meanwhile , what pleasure , honour , or profit it shall be mine to give you . ''"
"Just then the Yorkist skirmishers carried one of the shoreside taverns , swarming in upon it on three sides , and driving out or taking its defenders ."
"Crookback Dick was pleased to cheer the exploit , and pushing his horse a little nearer , called to see the prisoners ."
"There were four or five of them -- two men of my Lord Shoreby 's and one of Lord Risingham 's among the number , and last , but in Dick 's eyes not least , a tall , shambling , grizzled old shipman , between drunk and sober , and with a dog whimpering and jumping at his heels ."
The young duke passed them for a moment under a severe review .
"`` Good , '' he said ."
`` Hang them . ''
And he turned the other way to watch the progress of the fight .
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` so please you , I have found my reward ."
Grant me the life and liberty of yon old shipman . ''
Gloucester turned and looked the speaker in the face .
"`` Sir Richard , '' he said , `` I make not war with peacock 's feathers , but steel shafts ."
"Those that are mine enemies I slay , and that without excuse or favour ."
"For , bethink ye , in this realm of England , that is so torn in pieces , there is not a man of mine but hath a brother or a friend upon the other party ."
"If , then , I did begin to grant these pardons , I might sheathe my sword . ''"
"`` It may be so , my lord ; and yet I will be overbold , and at the risk of your disfavour , recall your lordship 's promise , '' replied Dick ."
"Then I was afraid Jerry would go and make a fuss , and Bob would run off , or do something desperate , being worried , and I said I 'd pay it for him , if I could ."
"So he went home pretty jolly , and I scratched ` round for the money ."
"Got it , too , and was n't I glad ? ''"
"Jack paused to rub his hands , and Frank said , with more than usual respect , `` Could n't you get hold of Jerry in any other place , and out of school time ?"
"That did the mischief , thanks to Joe ."
"I thrashed him , Jill -- did I mention it ? ''"
"`` I could n't get all my money till Friday morning , and I knew Jerry was off at night ."
"I looked for him before school , and at noon , but could n't find him , so afternoon recess was my last chance ."
"I was bound to do it and I did n't mean to break the rule , but Jerry was just going into the shop , so I pelted after him , and as it was private business we went to the billiard-room ."
"I declare I never was so relieved as when I handed over that money , and made him say it was all right , and he would n't go near Bob ."
"He 's off , so my mind is easy , and Bob will be so grateful I can keep him steady , perhaps ."
"That will be worth two seventy-five , I think , '' said Jack heartily ."
"`` You should have come to me , '' began Frank ."
"`` And got laughed at -- no , thank you , '' interrupted Jack , recollecting several philanthropic little enterprises which were nipped in the bud for want of co-operation ."
"`` To me , then , '' said his mother ."
`` It would have saved so much trouble . ''
"`` I thought of it , but Bob did n't want the big fellows to know for fear they 'd be down on him , so I thought he might not like me to tell grown people ."
"I do n't mind the fuss now , and Bob is as kind as he can be ."
"Wanted to give me his big knife , but I would n't take it ."
"I 'd rather have this , '' and Jack put the letter in his pocket with a slap outside , as if it warmed the cockles of his heart to have it there ."
"`` Well , it seems rather like a tempest in a teapot , now it is all over , but I do admire your pluck , little boy , in holding out so well when every one was scolding at you , and you in the right all the time , '' said Frank , glad to praise , now that he honestly could , after his wholesale condemnation ."
"`` That is what pulled me through , I suppose ."
"I used to think if I had done anything wrong , that I could n't stand the snubbing a day ."
"I should have told right off , and had it over ."
"Now , I guess I 'll have a good report if you do tell Mr. Acton , '' said Jack , looking at his mother so wistfully , that she resolved to slip away that very evening , and make sure that the thing was done ."
"`` That will make you happier than anything else , wo n't it ? ''"
"asked Jill , eager to have him rewarded after his trials ."
"`` There 's one thing I like better , though I 'd be very sorry to lose my report ."
"It 's the fun of telling Ed I tried to do as he wanted us to , and seeing how pleased he 'll be , '' added Jack , rather bashfully , for the boys laughed at him sometimes for his love of this friend ."
"`` I know he wo n't be any happier about it than someone else , who stood by you all through , and set her bright wits to work till the trouble was all cleared away , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking at Jill 's contented face , as she lay smiling on them all ."
"Jack understood , and , hopping across the room , gave both the thin hands a hearty shake ; then , not finding any words quite cordial enough in which to thank this faithful little sister , he stooped down and kissed her gratefully ."
Chapter XV .
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon .
"`` I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , '' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"`` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , '' he said coaxingly ."
"`` I promise to come back , '' he said solemnly and meant it , too ."
"And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
Many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long .
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as `` Never put off laying to-day , because you can lay to-morrow , '' and `` In this world there are no second chances , '' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as `` I wish the grass was not so wet , '' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , `` I do wish you would keep time ! ''"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , `` I wish -- '' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , `` I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , '' they had to tickle his shoulder and let him go ."
"He went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
"Oh , he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , `` Mother !"
mother ! ''
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her .
"Ah , Peter , we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right ; there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_and_Wendy.txt.out
"Let him alone , and it will all come out soon enough , '' answered Frank , who laughed at his brother , but loved him none the less for the tender heart that often got the better of his young head ."
"But for once Frank was mistaken ; the mystery did not come out , and Jack worked like a beaver all that week , as orders poured in when Jill and Annette showed their elegant cards ; for , as everybody knows , if one girl has a new thing all the rest must , whether it is a bow on the top of her head , a peculiar sort of pencil , or the latest kind of chewing-gum ."
"Little play did the poor fellow get , for every spare minute was spent at the press , and no invitation could tempt him away , so much in earnest was our honest little Franklin about paying his debt ."
"Jill helped all she could , and cheered his labors with her encouragement , remembering how he stayed at home for her ."
"`` It is real good of you to lend a hand , and I 'm ever so much obliged , '' said Jack , as the last order was struck off , and the drawer of the type-box held a pile of shining five and ten cent pieces , with two or three quarters ."
"`` I love to ; only it would be nicer if I knew what we were working for , '' she said demurely , as she scattered type for the last time ; and seeing that Jack was both tired and grateful , hoped to get a hint of the secret ."
"`` I want to tell you , dreadfully ; but I ca n't , because I 've promised . ''"
"`` What , never ? ''"
`` Never ! ''
and Jack looked as firm as a rock .
"`` Then I shall find out , for I have n't promised . ''"
`` You ca n't . ''
`` See if I do n't ! ''
"`` You are sharp , but you wo n't guess this ."
"It 's a tremendous secret , and nobody will tell it . ''"
`` You 'll tell it yourself .
You always do . ''
`` I wo n't tell this .
It would be mean . ''
"`` Wait and see ; I can get anything out of you if I try ; '' and Jill laughed , knowing her power well , for Jack found it very hard to keep a secret from her ."
`` Do n't try ; please do n't !
"It would n't be right , and you do n't want to make me do a dishonorable thing for your sake , I know . ''"
"Jack looked so distressed that Jill promised not to make him tell , though she held herself free to find out in other ways , if she could ."
"Thus relieved , Jack trudged off to school on Friday with the two dollars and seventy-five cents jingling in his pocket , though the dear gold coin had to be sacrificed to make up the sum ."
"He did his lessons badly that day , was late at recess in the afternoon , and , as soon as school was over , departed in his rubber boots `` to take a walk , '' he said , though the roads were in a bad state with a spring thaw ."
"Nothing was seen of him till after tea-time , when he came limping in , very dirty and tired , but with a reposeful expression , which betrayed that a load was off his mind ."
"Frank was busy about his own affairs and paid little attention to him , but Jill was on tenter-hooks to know where he had been , yet dared not ask the question ."
`` Merry 's brother wants some cards .
He liked hers so much he wishes to make his lady-love a present .
"Here 's the name ; '' and Jill held up the order from Harry Grant , who was to be married in the autumn ."
`` Must wait till next week .
"I 'm too tired to do a thing to-night , and I hate the sight of that old press , '' answered Jack , laying himself down upon the rug as if every joint ached ."
"One by one all the kites went up , and floated far overhead like gay birds , balancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the hill ."
Such a merry time as they had !
"running and shouting , sending up the kites or pulling them down , watching their antics in the air , and feeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape ."
"Nan was quite wild with the fun , Daisy thought the new play nearly as interesting as dolls , and little Bess was so fond of her `` boo tite , '' that she would only let it go on very short flights , preferring to hold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by Tommy 's dashing brush ."
"Mrs. Jo enjoyed hers immensely , and it acted as if it knew who owned it , for it came tumbling down head first when least expected , caught on trees , nearly pitched into the river , and finally darted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the clouds ."
"By and by every one got tired , and fastening the kite-strings to trees and fences , all sat down to rest , except Mr. Bhaer , who went off to look at the cows , with Teddy on his shoulder ."
`` Did you ever have such a good time as this before ? ''
"asked Nat , as they lay about on the grass , nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep ."
"`` Not since I last flew a kite , years ago , when I was a girl , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
"`` I 'd like to have known you when you were a girl , you must have been so jolly , '' said Nat ."
"`` I was a naughty little girl , I am sorry to say . ''"
"`` I like naughty little girls , '' observed Tommy , looking at Nan , who made a frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment ."
"`` Why do n't I remember you then , Aunty ?"
Was I too young ? ''
asked Demi .
"`` Rather , dear . ''"
`` I suppose my memory had n't come then .
"Grandpa says that different parts of the mind unfold as we grow up , and the memory part of my mind had n't unfolded when you were little , so I ca n't remember how you looked , '' explained Demi ."
"`` Now , little Socrates , you had better keep that question for grandpa , it is beyond me , '' said Aunt Jo , putting on the extinguisher ."
"`` Well , I will , he knows about those things , and you do n't , '' returned Demi , feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the comprehension of the present company ."
"`` Tell about the last time you flew a kite , '' said Nat , for Mrs. Jo had laughed as she spoke of it , and he thought it might be interesting ."
"`` Oh , it was only rather funny , for I was a great girl of fifteen , and was ashamed to be seen at such a play ."
"So Uncle Teddy and I privately made our kites , and stole away to fly them ."
"We had a capital time , and were resting as we are now , when suddenly we heard voices , and saw a party of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic ."
"Teddy did not mind , though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite , but I was in a great flurry , for I knew I should be sadly laughed at , and never hear the last of it , because my wild ways amused the neighbors as much as Nan 's do us . ''"
` What shall I do ? '
"I whispered to Teddy , as the voices drew nearer and nearer . ''"
"` I 'll show you , ' he said , and whipping out his knife he cut the strings ."
"Away flew the kites , and when the people came up we were picking flowers as properly as you please ."
"They never suspected us , and we had a grand laugh over our narrow escape . ''"
"`` Were the kites lost , Aunty ? ''"
asked Daisy .
"Though I had lived by the shore all my life , I seemed never to have been near the sea till then ."
The smell of tar and salt was something new .
"I saw the most wonderful figureheads , that had all been far over the ocean ."
"I saw , besides , many old sailors , with rings in their ears , and whiskers curled in ringlets , and tarry pigtails , and their swaggering , clumsy sea-walk ; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted ."
"And I was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure !"
"While I was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney , all dressed out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor 's walk ."
"`` Here you are , '' he cried , `` and the doctor came last night from London ."
Bravo !
The ship 's company complete ! ''
"`` Oh , sir , '' cried I , `` when do we sail ? ''"
`` Sail ! ''
says he .
`` We sail tomorrow ! ''
"8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver , at the sign of the Spy-glass , and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign ."
"I set off , overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen , and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales , for the dock was now at its busiest , until I found the tavern in question ."
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment .
The sign was newly painted ; the windows had neat red curtains ; the floor was cleanly sanded .
"There was a street on each side and an open door on both , which made the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke ."
"The customers were mostly seafaring men , and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door , almost afraid to enter ."
"As I was waiting , a man came out of a side room , and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John ."
"His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird ."
"He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling ."
"Indeed , he seemed in the most cheerful spirits , whistling as he moved about among the tables , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests ."
"Now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney 's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow ."
But one look at the man before me was enough .
"I had seen the captain , and Black Dog , and the blind man , Pew , and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like -- a very different creature , according to me , from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord ."
"I plucked up courage at once , crossed the threshold , and walked right up to the man where he stood , propped on his crutch , talking to a customer ."
"`` Mr. Silver , sir ? ''"
"I asked , holding out the note ."
"`` Yes , my lad , '' said he ; `` such is my name , to be sure ."
And who may you be ? ''
"And then as he saw the squire 's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start ."
"`` Then do go to sleep , '' said Nan , pettishly ."
`` I want my own bed .
"Oh , I wish I could see Teddy ! ''"
"cried Rob , painfully reminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests ."
"`` I do n't believe your mother will ever find us , '' said Nan , who was becoming desperate , for she hated patient waiting of any sort ."
`` It 's so dark she wo n't see us . ''
"`` It was all black in the ice-house , and I was so scared I did n't call her , but she saw me ; and she will see me now , no matter how dark it is , '' returned confiding Rob , standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him ."
`` I see her !
I see her ! ''
"he cried , and ran as fast as his tired legs would take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching ."
"Suddenly he stopped , then turned about , and came stumbling back , screaming in a great panic , `` No , it 's a bear , a big black one ! ''"
and hid his face in Nan 's skirts .
"For a moment Nan quailed ; ever her courage gave out at the thought of a real bear , and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder , when a mild `` Moo ! ''"
"changed her fear to merriment , as she said , laughing , `` It 's a cow , Robby !"
"the nice , black cow we saw this afternoon . ''"
"The cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two little people in her pasture after dark , and the amiable beast paused to inquire into the case ."
"She let them stroke her , and stood regarding them with her soft eyes so mildly , that Nan , who feared no animal but a bear , was fired with a desire to milk her ."
"`` Silas taught me how ; and berries and milk would be so nice , '' she said , emptying the contents of her pail into her hat , and boldly beginning her new task , while Rob stood by and repeated , at her command , the poem from Mother Goose : `` Cushy cow , bonny , let down your milk , Let down your milk to me , And I will give you a gown of silk , A gown of silk and a silver tee . ''"
"But the immortal rhyme had little effect , for the benevolent cow had already been milked , and had only half a gill to give the thirsty children ."
`` Shoo !
get away !
"you are an old cross patch , '' cried Nan , ungratefully , as she gave up the attempt in despair ; and poor Molly walked on with a gentle gurgle of surprise and reproof ."
"`` Each can have a sip , and then we must take a walk ."
We shall go to sleep if we do n't ; and lost people must n't sleep .
Do n't you know how Hannah Lee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died ? ''
"`` But there is n't any snow now , and it 's nice and warm , '' said Rob , who was not blessed with as lively a fancy as Nan ."
"`` No matter , we will poke about a little , and call some more ; and then , if nobody comes , we will hide under the bushes , like Hop - ` o-my-thumb and his brothers . ''"
"It was a very short walk , however , for Rob was so sleepy he could not get on , and tumbled down so often that Nan entirely lost patience , being half distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself ."
"`` If you tumble down again , I 'll shake you , '' she said , lifting the poor little man up very kindly as she spoke , for Nan 's bark was much worse than her bite ."
`` Please do n't .
"It 's my boots they keep slipping so ; '' and Rob manfully checked the sob just ready to break out , adding , with a plaintive patience that touched Nan 's heart , `` If the skeeters did n't bite me so , I could go to sleep till Marmar comes . ''"
"`` Put your head on my lap , and I 'll cover you up with my apron ; I 'm not afraid of the night , '' said Nan , sitting down and trying to persuade herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings all about her ."
But I am still waiting your opinion . ''
I am sure if ever Cluny hated any man it was David Balfour .
"He looked me all over with a warlike eye , and I saw the challenge at his lips ."
"But either my youth disarmed him , or perhaps his own sense of justice ."
"Certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned , and not least Cluny ; the more credit that he took it as he did ."
"`` Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` I think you are too nice and covenanting , but for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman ."
"Upon my honest word , ye may take this money -- it 's what I would tell my son -- and here 's my hand along with it ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXIV THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE QUARREL Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night , and went down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch Rannoch , whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage ."
"This fellow carried all our luggage and Alan 's great-coat in the bargain , trotting along under the burthen , far less than the half of which used to weigh me to the ground , like a stout hill pony with a feather ; yet he was a man that , in plain contest , I could have broken on my knee ."
"Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered ; and perhaps without that relief , and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness , I could not have walked at all ."
"I was but new risen from a bed of sickness ; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion ; travelling , as we did , over the most dismal deserts in Scotland , under a cloudy heaven , and with divided hearts among the travellers ."
"For long , we said nothing ; marching alongside or one behind the other , each with a set countenance : I , angry and proud , and drawing what strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings ; Alan angry and ashamed , ashamed that he had lost my money , angry that I should take it so ill ."
"The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind ; and the more I approved of it , the more ashamed I grew of my approval ."
"It would be a fine , handsome , generous thing , indeed , for Alan to turn round and say to me : `` Go , I am in the most danger , and my company only increases yours . ''"
"But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me , and say to him : `` You are in great danger , I am in but little ; your friendship is a burden ; go , take your risks and bear your hardships alone -- '' no , that was impossible ; and even to think of it privily to myself , made my cheeks to burn ."
"And yet Alan had behaved like a child , and -LRB- what is worse -RRB- a treacherous child ."
"Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce better than theft ; and yet here he was trudging by my side , without a penny to his name , and by what I could see , quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg ."
"True , I was ready to share it with him ; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness ."
These were the two things uppermost in my mind ; and I could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity .
"So I did the next worst , and said nothing , nor so much as looked once at my companion , save with the tail of my eye ."
"At last , upon the other side of Loch Errocht , going over a smooth , rushy place , where the walking was easy , he could bear it no longer , and came close to me ."
"`` David , '' says he , `` this is no way for two friends to take a small accident ."
I have to say that I 'm sorry ; and so that 's said .
"And now if you have anything , ye 'd better say it . ''"
"`` O , '' says I , `` I have nothing . ''"
He seemed disconcerted ; at which I was meanly pleased .
"`` No , '' said he , with rather a trembling voice , `` but when I say I was to blame ? ''"
"`` Why , of course , ye were to blame , '' said I , coolly ; `` and you will bear me out that I have never reproached you . ''"
"`` Never , '' says he ; `` but ye ken very well that ye 've done worse ."
Are we to part ?
Ye said so once before .
Are ye to say it again ?
"It comes -- we may say -- he was your true companion ; nor less paribus curis vestigia figit , for I dare say you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows ."
"Well , well , these days are fortunately by ; and I think -LRB- speaking humanly -RRB- that you are near the end of your troubles . ''"
"As he thus moralised on my adventures , he looked upon me with so much humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction ."
"I had been so long wandering with lawless people , and making my bed upon the hills and under the bare sky , that to sit once more in a clean , covered house , and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth , seemed mighty elevations ."
"Even as I thought so , my eye fell on my unseemly tatters , and I was once more plunged in confusion ."
But the lawyer saw and understood me .
"He rose , called over the stair to lay another plate , for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner , and led me into a bedroom in the upper part of the house ."
"Here he set before me water and soap , and a comb ; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son ; and here , with another apposite tag , he left me to my toilet ."
"CHAPTER XXVIII I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE I made what change I could in my appearance ; and blithe was I to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past , and David Balfour come to life again ."
"And yet I was ashamed of the change too , and , above all , of the borrowed clothes ."
"When I had done , Mr. Rankeillor caught me on the stair , made me his compliments , and had me again into the cabinet ."
"`` Sit ye down , Mr. David , '' said he , `` and now that you are looking a little more like yourself , let me see if I can find you any news ."
"You will be wondering , no doubt , about your father and your uncle ?"
To be sure it is a singular tale ; and the explanation is one that I blush to have to offer you .
"For , '' says he , really with embarrassment , `` the matter hinges on a love affair . ''"
"`` Truly , '' said I , `` I can not very well join that notion with my uncle . ''"
"`` But your uncle , Mr. David , was not always old , '' replied the lawyer , `` and what may perhaps surprise you more , not always ugly ."
"He had a fine , gallant air ; people stood in their doors to look after him , as he went by upon a mettle horse ."
"I have seen it with these eyes , and I ingenuously confess , not altogether without envy ; for I was a plain lad myself and a plain man 's son ; and in those days it was a case of Odi te , qui bellus es , Sabelle . ''"
"`` It sounds like a dream , '' said I. `` Ay , ay , '' said the lawyer , `` that is how it is with youth and age ."
"Nor was that all , but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise great things in the future ."
"In 1715 , what must he do but run away to join the rebels ?"
"It was your father that pursued him , found him in a ditch , and brought him back multum gementem ; to the mirth of the whole country ."
"However , majora canamus -- the two lads fell in love , and that with the same lady ."
"Mr. Ebenezer , who was the admired and the beloved , and the spoiled one , made , no doubt , mighty certain of the victory ; and when he found he had deceived himself , screamed like a peacock ."
"The whole country heard of it ; now he lay sick at home , with his silly family standing round the bed in tears ; now he rode from public-house to public-house , and shouted his sorrows into the lug of Tom , Dick , and Harry ."
"Your father , Mr. David , was a kind gentleman ; but he was weak , dolefully weak ; took all this folly with a long countenance ; and one day -- by your leave !"
-- resigned the lady .
"She was no such fool , however ; it 's from her you must inherit your excellent good sense ; and she refused to be bandied from one to another ."
Both got upon their knees to her ; and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed both of them the door .
That was in August ; dear me !
the same year I came from college .
"`` Mr. Hyde told me ; he 's been among 'em , and can talk their talk , and likes 'em , '' began Dan , flattered by their attention , but rather embarrassed by having a grown-up listener ."
`` What is wampum for ? ''
"asked curious Demi , from his perch ."
"The others asked questions likewise , and , before he knew it , Dan was reeling off all Mr. Hyde had told him , as they sailed down the river a few weeks before ."
"Mr. Laurie listened well , but found the boy more interesting than the Indians , for Mrs. Jo had told him about Dan , and he rather took a fancy to the wild lad , who ran away as he himself had often longed to do , and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and patience ."
"`` I 've been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have a museum of your own ; a place in which to collect all the curious and interesting things that you find , and make , and have given you ."
"Mrs. Jo is too kind to complain , but it is rather hard for her to have the house littered up with all sorts of rattletraps , half-a-pint of dor-bugs in one of her best vases , for instance , a couple of dead bats nailed up in the back entry , wasps nests tumbling down on people 's heads , and stones lying round everywhere , enough to pave the avenue ."
"There are not many women who would stand that sort of thing , are there , now ? ''"
"As Mr. Laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes , the boys laughed and nudged one another , for it was evident that some one told tales out of school , else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient treasures ."
"`` Where can we put them , then ? ''"
"said Demi , crossing his legs and leaning down to argue the question ."
`` In the old carriage-house . ''
"`` But it leaks , and there is n't any window , nor any place to put things , and it 's all dust and cobwebs , '' began Nat ."
"`` Wait till Gibbs and I have touched it up a bit , and then see how you like it ."
"He is to come over on Monday to get it ready ; then next Saturday I shall come out , and we will fix it up , and make the beginning , at least , of a fine little museum ."
"Every one can bring his things , and have a place for them ; and Dan is to be the head man , because he knows most about such matters , and it will be quiet , pleasant work for him now that he ca n't knock about much . ''"
`` Wo n't that be jolly ? ''
"cried Nat , while Dan smiled all over his face and had not a word to say , but hugged his book , and looked at Mr. Laurie as if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever blessed the world ."
"`` Shall I go round again , sir ? ''"
"asked Peter , as they came to the gate , after two slow turns about the half-mile triangle ."
"`` No , we must be prudent , else we ca n't come again ."
"I must go over the premises , take a look at the carriage-house , and have a little talk with Mrs. Jo before I go ; '' and , having deposited Dan on his sofa to rest and enjoy his book , Uncle Teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who were raging about the place in search of him ."
"Leaving the little girls to mess up-stairs , Mrs. Bhaer sat down by Dan , and listened to his eager account of the drive till the flock returned , dusty , warm , and much excited about the new museum , which every one considered the most brilliant idea of the age ."
"`` I always wanted to endow some sort of an institution , and I am going to begin with this , '' said Mr. Laurie , sitting down on a stool at Mrs. Jo 's feet ."
`` You have endowed one already .
What do you call this ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo pointed to the happy-faced lads , who had camped upon the floor about him ."
"`` I call it a very promising Bhaer-garden , and I 'm proud to be a member of it ."
Did you know I was the head boy in this school ? ''
"he asked , turning to Dan , and changing the subject skilfully , for he hated to be thanked for the generous things he did ."
`` I thought Franz was ! ''
"answered Dan , wondering what the man meant ."
"`` There are plenty of lessons you can learn lying there , and several little jobs of work you can do for me . ''"
`` Can I ? ''
and Dan looked both surprised and pleased .
`` You can learn to be patient and cheerful in spite of pain and no play .
"You can amuse Teddy for me , wind cotton , read to me when I sew , and do many things without hurting your foot , which will make the days pass quickly , and not be wasted ones . ''"
"Here Demi ran in with a great butterfly in one hand , and a very ugly little toad in the other ."
"`` See , Dan , I found them , and ran back to give them to you ; are n't they beautiful ones ? ''"
"panted Demi , all out of breath ."
"Dan laughed at the toad , and said he had no place to put him , but the butterfly was a beauty , and if Mrs. Jo would give him a big pin , he would stick it right up in the drawer ."
"`` I do n't like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin ; if it must be killed , let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor , '' said Mrs. Jo , getting out the bottle ."
"`` I know how to do it Mr. Hyde always killed 'em that way but I did n't have any camphor , so I use a pin , '' and Dan gently poured a drop on the insect 's head , when the pale green wings fluttered an instant , and then grew still ."
"This dainty little execution was hardly over when Teddy shouted from the bedroom , `` Oh , the little trabs are out , and the big one 's eaten 'em all up . ''"
"Demi and his aunt ran to the rescue , and found Teddy dancing excitedly in a chair , while two little crabs were scuttling about the floor , having got through the wires of the cage ."
"A third was clinging to the top of the cage , evidently in terror of his life , for below appeared a sad yet funny sight ."
"The big crab had wedged himself into the little recess where Polly 's cup used to stand , and there he sat eating one of his relations in the coolest way ."
"All the claws of the poor victim were pulled off , and he was turned upside down , his upper shell held in one claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish , while he leisurely ate out of it with the other claw , pausing now and then to turn his queer bulging eyes from side to side , and to put out a slender tongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with laughter ."
"Mrs. Jo carried the cage in for Dan to see the sight , while Demi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted wash-bowl ."
"`` I 'll have to let these fellers go , for I ca n't keep 'em in the house , '' said Dan , with evident regret ."
"`` I 'll take care of them for you , if you will tell me how , and they can live in my turtle-tank just as well as not , '' said Demi , who found them more interesting even that his beloved slow turtles ."
"So Dan gave him directions about the wants and habits of the crabs , and Demi bore them away to introduce them to their new home and neighbors ."
`` What a good boy he is ! ''
"said Dan , carefully settling the first butterfly , and remembering that Demi had given up his walk to bring it to him ."
"`` He ought to be , for a great deal has been done to make him so . ''"
"`` He 's had folks to tell him things , and to help him ; I have n't , '' said Dan , with a sigh , thinking of his neglected childhood , a thing he seldom did , and feeling as if he had not had fair play somehow ."
"`` I know it , dear , and for that reason I do n't expect as much from you as from Demi , though he is younger ; you shall have all the help that we can give you now , and I hope to teach you how to help yourself in the best way ."
"Have you forgotten what Father Bhaer told you when you were here before , about wanting to be good , and asking God to help you ? ''"
"`` No , ma'am , '' very low ."
`` Do you try that way still ? ''
"`` No , ma'am , '' lower still ."
`` Will you do it every night to please me ? ''
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' very soberly ."
"`` I shall depend on it , and I think I shall know if you are faithful to your promise , for these things always show to people who believe in them , though not a word is said ."
"`` Quite lost , but I did not care , for I made up my mind that it would be best to wait till I was an old lady before I played with kites again ; and you see I have waited , '' said Mrs. Jo , beginning to pull in the big kite , for it was getting late ."
`` Must we go now ? ''
"`` I must , or you wo n't have any supper ; and that sort of surprise party would not suit you , I think , my chickens . ''"
`` Has n't our party been a nice one ? ''
"asked Tommy , complacently ."
`` Splendid ! ''
answered every one .
`` Do you know why ?
"It is because your guests have behaved themselves , and tried to make everything go well ."
"You understand what I mean , do n't you ? ''"
"`` Yes 'm , '' was all the boys said , but they stole a shamefaced look at one another , as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home , thinking of another party where the guests had not behaved themselves , and things had gone badly on account of it ."
"CHAPTER X. HOME AGAIN July had come , and haying begun ; the little gardens were doing finely and the long summer days were full of pleasant hours ."
"The house stood open from morning till night , and the lads lived out of doors , except at school time ."
"The lessons were short , and there were many holidays , for the Bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise , and our short summers are best used in out-of-door work ."
"Such a rosy , sunburnt , hearty set as the boys became ; such appetites as they had ; such sturdy arms and legs , as outgrew jackets and trousers ; such laughing and racing all over the place ; such antics in house and barn ; such adventures in the tramps over hill and dale ; and such satisfaction in the hearts of the worthy Bhaers , as they saw their flock prospering in mind and body , I can not begin to describe ."
"Only one thing was needed to make them quite happy , and it came when they least expected it ."
"One balmy night when the little lads were in bed , the elder ones bathing down at the brook , and Mrs. Bhaer undressing Teddy in her parlor , he suddenly cried out , `` Oh , my Danny ! ''"
"and pointed to the window , where the moon shone brightly ."
"`` No , lovey , he is not there , it was the pretty moon , '' said his mother ."
"`` No , no , Danny at a window ; Teddy saw him , '' persisted baby , much excited ."
"`` It might have been , '' and Mrs. Bhaer hurried to the window , hoping it would prove true ."
"But the face was gone , and nowhere appeared any signs of a mortal boy ; she called his name , ran to the front door with Teddy in his little shirt , and made him call too , thinking the baby voice might have more effect than her own ."
"No one answered , nothing appeared , and they went back much disappointed ."
"Teddy would not be satisfied with the moon , and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask if Danny was not `` tummin ' soon . ''"
"By and by he fell asleep , the lads trooped up to bed , the house grew still , and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night ."
"Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing , for the big basket was always piled with socks , full of portentous holes , and thinking of the lost boy ."
"She had decided that baby had been mistaken , and did not even disturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child 's fancy , for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed , and he was busy writing letters ."
It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house .
"As she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps , something white caught her eye on one of the hay-cocks scattered over the lawn ."
"The children had been playing there all the afternoon , and , fancying that Nan had left her hat as usual , Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it ."
"But as she approached , she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief , but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it ."
"She hurried round the hay-cock , and there lay Dan , fast asleep ."
"A glance showed that it was not the composition nor a note , but the beginning of a letter from Mrs. Minot to her sister , and Jill was about to lay it down when her own name caught her eye , and she could not resist reading it ."
"Hard words to write of one so young , doubly hard to read , and impossible to forget ."
"`` Dear Lizzie , -- Jack continues to do very well , and will soon be up again ."
But we begin to fear that the little girl is permanently injured in the back .
"She is here , and we do our best for her ; but I never look at her without thinking of Lucinda Snow , who , you remember , was bedridden for twenty years , owing to a fall at fifteen ."
"Poor little Janey does not know yet , and I hope '' -- There it ended , and `` poor little Janey 's '' punishment for disobedience began that instant ."
"She thought she was getting well because she did not suffer all the time , and every one spoke cheerfully about `` by and by . ''"
"Now she knew the truth , and shut her eyes with a shiver as she said , low , to herself , -- `` Twenty years !"
"I could n't bear it ; oh , I could n't bear it ! ''"
"A very miserable Jill lay on the floor , and for a while did not care who came and found her ; then the last words of the letter -- `` I hope '' -- seemed to shine across the blackness of the dreadful `` twenty years '' and cheer her up a bit , for despair never lives long in young hearts , and Jill was a brave child ."
"`` That is why Mammy sighs so when she dresses me , and every one is so good to me ."
"Perhaps Mrs. Minot does n't really know , after all ."
"She was dreadfully scared about Jack , and he is getting well ."
"I 'd like to ask Doctor , but he might find out about the letter ."
"Oh , dear , why did n't I keep still and let the horrid thing alone ! ''"
"As she thought that , Jill pushed the paper away , pulled herself up , and with much painful effort managed to get back to her sofa , where she laid herself down with a groan , feeling as if the twenty years had already passed over her since she tumbled off ."
"`` I 've told a lie , for I said I would n't stir ."
"I 've hurt my back , I 've done a mean thing , and I 've got paid for it ."
"A nice missionary I am ; I 'd better begin at home , as Mammy told me to ; '' and Jill groaned again , remembering her mother 's words ."
"`` Now I 've got another secret to keep all alone , for I 'd be ashamed to tell the girls ."
I guess I 'll turn round and study my spelling ; then no one will see my face . ''
"Jill looked the picture of a good , industrious child as she lay with her back to the large table , her book held so that nothing was to be seen but one cheek and a pair of lips moving busily ."
"Fortunately , it is difficult for little sinners to act a part , and , even if the face is hidden , something in the body seems to betray the internal remorse and shame ."
"Usually , Jill lay flat and still ; now her back was bent in a peculiar way as she leaned over her book , and one foot wagged nervously , while on the visible cheek was a Spanish stamp with a woman 's face looking through the black bars , very suggestively , if she had known it ."
"How long the minutes seemed till some one came , and what a queer little jump her heart gave when Mrs. Minot 's voice said , cheerfully , `` Jack is all right , and , I declare , so is Jill ."
"I really believe there is a telegraph still working somewhere between you two , and each knows what the other is about without words . ''"
"`` I did n't have any other book handy , so I thought I 'd study awhile , '' answered Jill , feeling that she deserved no praise for her seeming industry ."
"She cast a sidelong glance as she spoke , and seeing that Mrs. Minot was looking for the letter , hid her face and lay so still she could hear the rustle of the paper as it was taken from the floor ."
"It was well she did not also see the quick look the lady gave her as she turned the letter and found a red stamp sticking to the under side , for this unlucky little witness told the story ."
"Mrs. Minot remembered having seen the stamp lying close to the sofa when she left the room , for she had had half a mind to take it to Jack , but did not , thinking Frank 's plan had some advantages ."
"She also recollected that a paper flew off the table , but being in haste she had not stopped to see what it was ."
"Now , the stamp and the letter could hardly have come together without hands , for they lay a yard apart , and here , also , on the unwritten portion of the page , was the mark of a small green thumb ."
"Saint Lucy Saturday was a busy and a happy time to Jack , for in the morning Mr. Acton came to see him , having heard the story overnight , and promised to keep Bob 's secret while giving Jack an acquittal as public as the reprimand had been ."
Then he asked for the report which Jack had bravely received the day before and put away without showing to anybody .
"`` There is one mistake here which we must rectify , '' said Mr. Acton , as he crossed out the low figures under the word `` Behavior , '' and put the much-desired 100 there ."
"`` But I did break the rule , sir , '' said Jack , though his face glowed with pleasure , for Mamma was looking on ."
`` I overlook that as I should your breaking into my house if you saw it was on fire .
"You ran to save a friend , and I wish I could tell those fellows why you were there ."
It would do them good .
"I am not going to praise you , John , but I did believe you in spite of appearances , and I am glad to have for a pupil a boy who loves his neighbor better than himself . ''"
"Then , having shaken hands heartily , Mr. Acton went away , and Jack flew off to have rejoicings with Jill , who sat up on her sofa , without knowing it , so eager was she to hear all about the call ."
"In the afternoon Jack drove his mother to the Captain 's , confiding to her on the way what a hard time he had when he went before , and how nothing but the thought of cheering Bob kept him up when he slipped and hurt his knee , and his boot sprung a leak , and the wind came up very cold , and the hill seemed an endless mountain of mud and snow ."
"Mrs. Minot had such a gentle way of putting things that she would have won over a much harder man than the strict old Captain , who heard the story with interest , and was much pleased with the boys ' efforts to keep Bob straight ."
"That young person dodged away into the barn with Jack , and only appeared at the last minute to shove a bag of chestnuts into the chaise ."
"But he got a few kind words that did him good , from Mrs. Minot and the Captain , and from that day felt himself under bonds to behave well if he would keep their confidence ."
"`` I shall give Jill the nuts ; and I wish I had something she wanted very , very much , for I do think she ought to be rewarded for getting me out of the mess , '' said Jack , as they drove happily home again ."
`` I hope to have something in a day or two that will delight her very much .
"I will say no more now , but keep my little secret and let it be a surprise to all by and by , '' answered his mother , looking as if she had not much doubt about the matter ."
`` That will be jolly .
"You are welcome to your secret , Mamma ."
I 've had enough of them for one while ; '' and Jack shrugged his broad shoulders as if a burden had been taken off .
"In the evening Ed came , and Jack was quite satisfied when he saw how pleased his friend was at what he had done ."
"`` I never meant you should take so much trouble , only be kind to Bob , '' said Ed , who did not know how strong his influence was , nor what a sweet example of quiet well-doing his own life was to all his mates ."
`` I wished to be really useful ; not just to talk about it and do nothing .
"That is n't your way , and I want to be like you , '' answered Jack , with such affectionate sincerity that Ed could not help believing him , though he modestly declined the compliment by saying , as he began to play softly , `` Better than I am , I hope ."
I do n't amount to much . ''
"`` Yes , you do !"
and if any one says you do n't I 'll shake him .
"I ca n't tell what it is , only you always look so happy and contented -- sort of sweet and shiny , '' said Jack , as he stroked the smooth brown head , rather at a loss to describe the unusually fresh and sunny expression of Ed 's face , which was always cheerful , yet had a certain thoughtfulness that made it very attractive to both young and old ."
"`` Soap makes him shiny ; I never saw such a fellow to wash and brush , '' put in Frank , as he came up with one of the pieces of music he and Ed were fond of practising together ."
`` I do n't mean that ! ''
said Jack indignantly .
"`` I wash and brush till you call me a dandy , but I do n't have the same look -- it seems to come from the inside , somehow , as if he was always jolly and clean and good in his mind , you know . ''"
"`` Born so , '' said Frank , rumbling away in the bass with a pair of hands that would have been the better for some of the above-mentioned soap , for he did not love to do much in the washing and brushing line ."
"David wonders whether they know each other , now that they are so different , and if it makes them fight with the wrong ones ."
"They are great fighters , and thus so unlike country sheep that every year they give my St. Bernard dog , Porthos , a shock ."
"He can make a field of country sheep fly by merely announcing his approach , but these town sheep come toward him with no promise of gentle entertainment , and then a light from last year breaks upon Porthos ."
"He can not with dignity retreat , but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery , and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye ."
-LSB- Illustration : Porthos -RSB- The Serpentine begins near here .
"It is a lovely lake , and there is a drowned forest at the bottom of it ."
"If you peer over the edge you can see the trees all growing upside down , and they say that at night there are also drowned stars in it ."
"If so , Peter Pan sees them when he is sailing across the lake in the Thrush 's Nest ."
"A small part only of the Serpentine is in the Gardens , for soon it passes beneath a bridge to far away where the island is on which all the birds are born that become baby boys and girls ."
"No one who is human , except Peter Pan -LRB- and he is only half human -RRB- , can land on the island , but you may write what you want -LRB- boy or girl , dark or fair -RRB- on a piece of paper , and then twist it into the shape of a boat and slip it into the water , and it reaches Peter Pan 's island after dark ."
"-LSB- Illustration : One of the Paths that have Made Themselves -RSB- We are on the way home now , though of course , it is all pretence that we can go to so many of the places in one day ."
"I should have had to be carrying David long ago , and resting on every seat like old Mr. Salford ."
"That was what we called him , because he always talked to us of a lovely place called Salford where he had been born ."
"He was a crab-apple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens from seat to seat trying to fall in with somebody who was acquainted with the town of Salford , and when we had known him for a year or more we actually did meet another aged solitary who had once spent Saturday to Monday in Salford ."
"He was meek and timid , and carried his address inside his hat , and whatever part of London he was in search of he always went to Westminster Abbey first as a starting-point ."
"Him we carried in triumph to our other friend , with the story of that Saturday to Monday , and never shall I forget the gloating joy with which Mr. Salford leapt at him ."
"They have been cronies ever since , and I notice that Mr. Salford , who naturally does most of the talking , keeps tight grip of the other old man 's coat ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Old Mr. Salford was a crab-apple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Away he flew , right over the houses to the Gardens -RSB- The two last places before you come to our gate are the Dogs ' Cemetery and the chaffinch 's nest , but we pretend not to know what the Dogs ' Cemetery is , as Porthos is always with us ."
The nest is very sad .
"It is quite white , and the way we found it was wonderful ."
"We were having another look among the bushes for David 's lost worsted ball , and instead of the ball we found a lovely nest made of the worsted , and containing four eggs , with scratches on them very like David 's handwriting , so we think they must have been the mother 's love-letters to the little ones inside ."
"Every day we were in the Gardens we paid a call at the nest , taking care that no cruel boy should see us , and we dropped crumbs , and soon the bird knew us as friends , and sat in the nest looking at us kindly with her shoulders hunched up ."
"But one day when we went there were only two eggs in the nest , and the next time there were none ."
"The saddest part of it was that the poor little chaffinch fluttered about the bushes , looking so reproachfully at us that we knew she thought we had done it ; and though David tried to explain to her , it was so long since he had spoken the bird language that I fear she did not understand ."
He and I left the Gardens that day with our knuckles in our eyes .

'"
"Then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl , she also says , ` Why , of course I did , child , ' but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days , she says she never heard of his having a goat ."
"Perhaps she has forgotten , just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you Mildred , which is your mother 's name ."
"Still , she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat ."
Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl .
"This shows that , in telling the story of Peter Pan , to begin with the goat -LRB- as most people do -RRB- is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest ."
"Of course , it also shows that Peter is ever so old , but he is really always the same age , so that does not matter in the least ."
"`` Mistress Mary , '' and her `` pretty maids all in a row , '' passed by to their places in the background ; `` King Cole '' and his `` fiddlers three '' made a goodly show ; so did the royal couple , who followed the great pie borne before them , with the `` four-and-twenty blackbirds '' popping their heads out in the most delightful way ."
"Little `` Bo-Peep '' led a woolly lamb and wept over its lost tail , for not a sign of one appeared on the poor thing ."
"`` Simple Simon '' followed the pie-man , gloating over his wares with the drollest antics ."
"The little wife came trundling by in a wheelbarrow and was not upset ; neither was the lady with `` rings on her fingers and bells on her toes , '' as she cantered along on a rocking-horse ."
`` Bobby Shafto 's '' yellow hair shone finely as he led in the maid whom he came back from sea to marry .
"`` Miss Muffet , '' bowl in hand , ran away from an immense black spider , which waggled its long legs in a way so life-like that some of the children shook in their little shoes ."
"The beggars who came to town were out in full force , `` rags , tags , and velvet gowns , '' quite true to life ."
"`` Boy Blue '' rubbed his eyes , with hay sticking in his hair , and tooted on a tin horn as if bound to get the cows out of the corn ."
"Molly , with a long-handled frying-pan , made a capital `` Queen , '' in a tucked-up gown , checked apron , and high crown , to good `` King Arthur , '' who , very properly , did not appear after stealing the barley-meal , which might be seen in the pan tied up in a pudding , like a cannon-ball , ready to fry ."
"But Tobias , Molly 's black cat , covered himself with glory by the spirit with which he acted his part in , `` Sing , sing , what shall I sing ?"
The cat 's run away with the pudding-bag string . ''
"First he was led across the stage on his hind legs , looking very fierce and indignant , with a long tape trailing behind him ; and , being set free at the proper moment , he gave one bound over the four-and-twenty blackbirds who happened to be in the way , and dashed off as if an enraged cook had actually been after him , straight downstairs to the coal-bin , where he sat glaring in the dark , till the fun was over ."
"When all the characters had filed in and stood in two long rows , music struck up and they danced , `` All the way to Boston , '' a simple but lively affair , which gave each a chance to show his or her costume as they pranced down the middle and up outside ."
"Such a funny medley as it was , for there went fat `` King Cole '' with the most ragged of the beggar-maids ."
"`` Mistress Mary , '' in her pretty blue dress , tripped along with `` Simple Simon '' staring about him like a blockhead ."
The fine lady left her horse to dance with `` Bobby Shafto '' till every bell on her slippers tinkled its tongue out .
`` Bo-Peep '' and a jolly fiddler skipped gayly up and down .
"`` Miss Muffet '' took the big spider for her partner , and made his many legs fly about in the wildest way ."
"The little wife got out of the wheelbarrow to help `` Boy Blue '' along , and Molly , with the frying-pan over her shoulder , led off splendidly when it was `` Grand right and left . ''"
"But the old lady and her goose were the best of all , for the dame 's shoe-buckles cut the most astonishing pigeon-wings , and to see that mammoth bird waddle down the middle with its wings half open , its long neck bridling , and its yellow legs in the first position as it curtsied to its partner , was a sight to remember , it was so intensely funny ."
"The merry old gentleman laughed till he cried ; Mr. Burton split his gloves , he applauded so enthusiastically ; while the children beat the dust out of the carpet hopping up and down , as they cried : `` Do it again ! ''"
`` We want it all over ! ''
"when the curtain went down at last on the flushed and panting party , Mother G -- bowing , with her hat all awry , and the goose doing a double shuffle as if it did not know how to leave off ."
"But they could not `` do it all over again , '' for it was growing late , and the people felt that they certainly had received their money 's worth that evening ."
"So it all ended merrily , and when the guests departed the boys cleared the room like magic , and the promised supper to the actors was served in handsome style ."
"Jack and Jill were at one end , Mrs. Goose and her bird at the other , and all between was a comical collection of military heroes , fairy characters , and nursery celebrities ."
"All felt the need of refreshment after their labors , and swept over the table like a flight of locusts , leaving devastation behind ."
"But they had earned their fun : and much innocent jollity prevailed , while a few lingering papas and mammas watched the revel from afar , and had not the heart to order these noble beings home till even the Father of his Country declared `` that he 'd had a perfectly splendid time , but could n't keep his eyes open another minute , '' and very wisely retired to replace the immortal cocked hat with a night-cap ."

I do hope that Peter is not too ready with his spade .
It is all rather sad .
"_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens,_Version_2.txt.out"
"Peter Pan If you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a little girl she will say , `` Why , of course , I did , child , '' and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say , `` What a foolish question to ask , certainly he did . ''"
"Then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl , she also says , `` Why , of course , I did , child , '' but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days , she says she never heard of his having a goat ."
"Perhaps she has forgotten , just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you Mildred , which is your mother 's name ."
"Still , she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat ."
Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl .
"This shows that , in telling the story of Peter Pan , to begin with the goat -LRB- as most people do -RRB- is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest ."
"Of course , it also shows that Peter is ever so old , but he is really always the same age , so that does not matter in the least ."
"His age is one week , and though he was born so long ago he has never had a birthday , nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one ."
The reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days ' old ; he escaped by the window and flew back to the Kensington Gardens .
"If you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape , it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days ."
"When David heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape , but I told him to think back hard , pressing his hands to his temples , and when he had done this hard , and even harder , he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the tree-tops , and with that memory came others , as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep , and how she had once caught him half-way up the chimney ."
"All children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples , for , having been birds before they were human , they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks , and very itchy at the shoulders , where their wings used to be ."
So David tells me .
"I ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story : First , I tell it to him , and then he tells it to me , the understanding being that it is quite a different story ; and then I retell it with his additions , and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more his story or mine ."
"In this story of Peter Pan , for instance , the bald narrative and most of the moral reflections are mine , though not all , for this boy can be a stern moralist , but the interesting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the bird-stage are mostly reminiscences of David 's , recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard ."
"Well , Peter Pan got out by the window , which had no bars ."
"Standing on the ledge he could see trees far away , which were doubtless the Kensington Gardens , and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown , and away he flew , right over the houses to the Gardens ."
"It is wonderful that he could fly without wings , but the place itched tremendously , and , perhaps we could all fly if we were as dead-confident-sure of our capacity to do it as was bold Peter Pan that evening ."
"He alighted gaily on the open sward , between the Baby 's Palace and the Serpentine , and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick ."
"He was quite unaware already that he had ever been human , and thought he was a bird , even in appearance , just the same as in his early days , and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand , which , of course , a bird never does ."
"He saw , however , that it must be past Lock-out Time , for there were a good many fairies about , all too busy to notice him ; they were getting breakfast ready , milking their cows , drawing water , and so on , and the sight of the water-pails made him thirsty , so he flew over to the Round Pond to have a drink ."
"He stooped , and dipped his beak in the pond ; he thought it was his beak , but , of course , it was only his nose , and , therefore , very little water came up , and that not so refreshing as usual , so next he tried a puddle , and he fell flop into it ."
"When a real bird falls in flop , he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry , but Peter could not remember what was the thing to do , and he decided , rather sulkily , to go to sleep on the weeping beech in the Baby Walk ."
"At first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch , but presently he remembered the way , and fell asleep ."
"He awoke long before morning , shivering , and saying to himself , `` I never was out in such a cold night ; '' he had really been out in colder nights when he was a bird , but , of course , as everybody knows , what seems a warm night to a bird is a cold night to a boy in a nightgown ."
"Peter also felt strangely uncomfortable , as if his head was stuffy , he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply , though they were really himself sneezing ."
"He found the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope."
"The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no better with him."
"No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him, which so frightened him that he also turned back."
"The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he went through fire and water, right on till he came to the bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket, but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that direction."
"When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world."
"First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing here?"" said the Princess. ""Heaven preserve you! what do you want?"""
"""I want to set you free and get you out of the mountain,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once; he has three heads,"" said she."
"""I do not care if he has four,"" said the soldier. ""I am here, and here I shall remain."""
"""Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I can help you,"""
said the Princess.
She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.
"""And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in,"""
"she said. ""But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table."" No, it was too heavy, he could not even move it."
"He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he was just able to stir it, so he took another draught, and then he could lift it. At last he took a right, big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as anything."
All at once the troll came home; he walked so heavily that the palace shook.
"""Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house,"" said he."
"""Yes,"" answered the Princess, ""a raven flew past here just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells."""
"""So it does,"" said the troll."
"""But come and lie down and I'll scratch your heads,"" said the Princess; ""the smell will be gone by the time you wake."""
"The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll."
"The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler, and went with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door."
"""Here you must enter: here she is,"" said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the second sister at a silver spinning-wheel."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear!"" she said. ""What do you want here?"""
"""I want to set you free from the troll,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay, but go,"" said the Princess. ""If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot."""
"""That would be awkward that is if I don't take his first,"" said the soldier."
"""Well, since you will stay,"" she said, ""you will have to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens."""
"First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the troll's sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin."
"Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in."
"In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument had reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic cat ascended the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and tubing. When the workmen arrived at the upper landing the next morning, and began to prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright and, springing to the outer edge, took a ""header"" of 160 feet to the hard earth below. In the descent which was watched closely by two score of men, the cat spread herself out like a flying squirrel and alighted on all fours. After turning over on the ground a few times in a dazed manner, she prepared to leave the grounds and had gotten almost beyond the shadow of the monument, when a dog belonging to one of the workmen pounced upon her and killed her, she, of course, not being in her best running trim, after performing such an extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the body of the dead feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the remains over to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who mounted the skin and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case tells this wonderful story in a few words: ""This cat on September 23, 1880, jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived."""
A Brave Queen
"Long ago, when this country was a wild land, there lived a beautiful and brave queen named Boadicea."
"Her husband, the king, was dead, but she had two daughters whom she loved very much."
"Boadicea was queen of a part of Britain. There were no large towns in her land, but there were forests of fine trees, and fields of corn, and wide stretches of grass-land where many cattle and sheep roamed and fed."
"Her people were called Iceni. They were tall and strong, with blue eyes and yellow hair. The men were brave fighters and good hunters. They hunted the bears and wolves which lived in the forests, and they fought the foes of their beautiful queen."
"They made spears to fight with, and strange carts called war-chariots to fight in. These chariots were drawn by swift horses, and, upon the wheels, long sharp knives were fixed. The Iceni drove the chariots very fast among their foes, and the knives cut down and killed many of them."
The Romans from over the sea were the most dangerous enemies of Boadicea and her people.
"In those days the Romans were the best fighters, and the strongest and wisest people in the world. They came in ships to Britain. They had been told that it was a good country, and they hoped to take it for themselves. Some of them came to Boadicea's land, and took a part of it and of her riches. And when she tried to stop them from doing this, they seized her and the two princesses and beat them cruelly."
"This wicked act made the Iceni very angry. From all parts of the land, fierce fighting-men came marching in haste to avenge themselves on their enemies, bringing with them their spears and their war-chariots. When all were gathered together, they fell upon the Romans."
"There were so many of them, and they were so fierce, that the Romans could not stand against them. Thousands were killed, and the rest ran away to their ships."
"But there were many more Romans in other parts of Britain, and when these heard how their friends had been beaten, they came marching in haste to punish the Iceni."
"The Iceni did their best to get ready to defend themselves, but many of their brave men had been slain and others were wounded and weary, so they could not hope again to win a victory over their strong foes."
"Before the battle, Queen Boadicea, with her fair hair waving in the wind, stood before her soldiers and spoke to them. She told them of the wrong which the Romans had done, and begged them to fight bravely for their country. Then she got into her chariot, and with her daughters lying at her feet, drove to and fro, so that all might see them."
"And the soldiers shouted, and promised to fight to the end for their brave queen."
"They did fight long and bravely, until most of them were killed, but their foes were too strong for them. When Queen Boadicea saw that her brave soldiers were beaten, she drank some poison which killed her. She thought it better to die than to be again taken prisoner by the cruel Romans."
King Alfred and the Cakes
"Once, when good King Alfred of England was forced to flee from his strong foes the Danes, he hid himself in a wood. In this wood, there was a small cottage, and Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest."
"Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired, so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen."
"Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking, and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them, and took care that they did not burn, she would give him some supper. Then she went away to do her work."
"At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and of his poor people, and then he forgot his task."
"When the woman came back, the cakes were black and burnt. ""You are an idle fellow,"" cried she angrily. ""You would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take the trouble to watch them."""
"While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home. He knew King Alfred. ""Hush, wife!"" cried he. ""It is our noble lord the king!"""
"When the woman heard this, she was much afraid, and she begged Alfred to forgive her."
"The king smiled, and said: ""I will gladly forgive you for your scolding, good wife, if you will forgive me for spoiling your supper."""
"Not Angles, but Angels"
"In old days the people of England were not all free, as they are now."
"Sometimes young men, and women, and little children were sold as slaves, and had to work hard for their masters."
"Many of these slaves were sent to Rome, for the Romans thought the tall, fair Angles very beautiful, and liked to have them as their servants."
"One night, after they had both been flying through forest and over field, he came back to the hollow tree to rest. He expected to find Mrs."
"Owl, for she had started home before he did. She was not there and he grew quite impatient. ""I should like to know what keeps her so long,"" he said, fretfully. After a while he looked into the nest and saw the two big white eggs. ""It is a shame,"" he said. ""Our beautiful eggs will be chilled, and it will be all her fault if we have no Owlets this summer."""
"You see, even then he did not seem to think that he could do anything to keep them warm. But the next time he looked in, he put one feathered foot on the round eggs and was surprised to find how cool they were."
"It fairly made his head feathers stand on end to think of it, and he was so frightened that he forgot to be cross, and stepped right in and covered them with his own breast. What if they had already been left too long, and the Owlets within would never hatch? Would Mrs. Owl ever forgive him for being so stupid? He began to wonder if any of the other fellows would see him. He thought it so absurd for the king of the forest to be hatching out a couple of eggs, instead of swooping around in the dark and frightening the smaller birds."
"The night seemed so long, too. It had always been short enough before, and he had often disliked to have daylight come, for then he had to go to bed. He was very much upset, and it is no wonder that when he heard a doleful wail from a neighboring tree, and knew that his cousin, the Screech Owl, was near, he raised his head and called loudly, ""Hoo-hoo-oooo! Waugh-hoo!"""
"The Screech Owl heard him and flew at once to a branch beside the nest hollow. He was a jolly little fellow in spite of his doleful call, and before he could talk at all he had to bend his body, look behind him, nod his head, and shake himself, as Screech Owls always do when they alight. Then he looked into the tree and saw his big cousin, the Great Horned Owl, the night king of the forest, sitting on the eggs and looking very, very grumpy. How he did laugh! ""What is the matter?"" said he. ""Didn't you like your wife's way of brooding over the eggs? Or did she get tired of staying at home and make you help tend the nest?"""
"""Matter enough,"" grumbled the Great Horned Owl. ""We went hunting together at twilight and she hasn't come home yet. I didn't get into the nest until I had to, but it was growing very cold and I wouldn't miss having our eggs hatch for anything. Ugh-whoo! How my legs do ache!"""
"""Well,"" said his cousin, ""you are having a hard time. Are you hungry?"""
"The Great Horned Owl said that he was, so the Screech Owl went hunting and brought him food. ""I will look in every night,"" he said, ""and bring you a lunch. I'm afraid something has happened to your wife and that she will not be back."""
"As he flew away he called out, ""It is too bad. I am very sorry for you. But then, I suppose you would never have the Owlets if you didn't stick to the nest."""
"This last remark made the Great Horned Owl quite angry. ""Much he knows about it,"" he said. ""I guess if he had ever tried it he would be a little more sorry for me."" And then he began to think, ""Who have I heard say those very words before? Who? Who? Who?"""
"All at once the Great Horned Owl remembered how many times he had said just that to his patient wife, and he began to feel very uncomfortable."
"His ears tingled and he felt a queer hot feeling under his face feathers. Perhaps he hadn't been acting very well after all! He knew that even when he told her he was sorry, he had been thinking she made a great fuss. Well, if she would only come back now, that should all be changed, and he shifted his weight and wriggled around into a more comfortable position."
"Now, if this were just a story, one could say that Mrs. Owl came back and that they were all happy together; but the truth is she never did come, and nobody ever knew what became of her. So her husband, the night king of the forest, had to keep the eggs warm and rear his own Owlets."
"You can imagine how glad he was on the night when he first heard them tapping on the inside of their shells, for then he knew that he would soon be free to hunt."
"A finer pair of children were never hatched, and their father thought them far ahead of all his other broods. ""If only Mrs. Owl were here to see them, how lovely it would be!"" he said. Yet if she had been there he would never have had the pleasure of hearing their first faint cheeps, and of covering them with his soft breast feathers as he did each day. He forgot now all the weary time when he sat with aching legs, wishing that his cousin would happen along with something to eat. For that is always the way, when we work for those we love, the weariness is soon forgotten and only happiness remains."
"It is said that the Screech Owl was more thoughtful of his wife after his cousin had to hatch the eggs, and it is too bad that some of the other forest people could not have learned the same lesson; but the Great Horned Owl never told, and the Screech Owl kept his secret, and to this day there are many people in the forest who know nothing whatever about it."
THE SWAGGERING CROW
"When the Crows who have been away for the winter return to the forest, all their relatives gather on the tree-tops to welcome them and tell the news. Those who have been away have also much to say, and it sometimes seems as though they were all talking at once. They spend many days in visiting before they begin nest-building. Perhaps if they would take turns and not interrupt each other, they would get the news more quickly, for when people are interrupted they can never talk well."
"Sometimes, too, one hungry fellow will fly off for a few mouthfuls of grain, and get back just in time to hear the end of a story. Then he will want to hear the first part of it, and make such a fuss that they have to tell it all over again just for him."
"At this time in the spring, you can hear their chatter and laughter, even when you are far away; and the song-birds of the forest look at each other and say, ""Dear me! The Crows are back."" They have very good reasons for disliking the Crows, as any Robin will tell you."
"There was one great shining black Crow who had the loudest voice of all, and who was not at all afraid to use it. This spring he looked very lean and lank, for it had been a long, cold winter, and he had found but little to eat, acorns, the seeds of the wild plants, and once in a great while a frozen apple that hung from its branch in some lonely orchard."
"He said that he felt as though he could reach around his body with one claw, and when a Crow says that he feels exceedingly thin. But now spring was here, and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, yes, and his brothers and his uncles, too, had returned to the forest to live. He had found two good dinners already, all that he could eat and more too, and he began to feel happy and bold. The purple gloss on his feathers grew brighter every day, and he was glad to see this. He wanted to look so handsome that a certain Miss Crow, a sister of one of his friends, would like him better than she did any of the others."
"That was all very well, if he had been at all polite about it. But one day he saw her visiting with another Crow, and he lost his temper, and flew at him, and pecked him about the head and shoulders, and tore the long fourth feather from one of his wings, besides rumpling the rest of his coat. Then he went away. He had beaten him by coming upon him from behind, like the sneak that he was, and he was afraid that if he waited he might yet get the drubbing he deserved. So he flew off to the top of a hemlock-tree where the other Crows were, and told them how he had fought and beaten. You should have seen him swagger around when he told it. Each time it was a bigger story, until at last he made them think that the other Crow hadn't a tail feather left."
"The next day, a number of Crows went to a farm not far from the forest."
Miss Crow was in the party. On their way they stopped in a field where there stood a figure of a man with a dreadful stick in his hand.
"Everybody was frightened except Mr. Crow. He wanted to show how much courage he had, so he flew right up to it. They all thought him very brave. They didn't know that down in his heart he was a great coward. He wasn't afraid of this figure because he knew all about it. He had seen it put up the day before, and he knew that there was no man under the big straw hat and the flapping coat. He knew that, instead of a thinking, breathing person, there was only a stick nailed to a pole. He knew that, instead of having two good legs with which to run, this figure had only the end of a pole stuck into the ground."
"Of course, he might have told them all, and then they could have gathered corn from the broken ground around, but he didn't want to do that. Instead, he said, ""Do you see that terrible great creature with a stick in his hand? He is here just to drive us away, but he dares not touch me. He knows I would beat him if he did."" Then he flew down, and ate corn close beside the figure, while the other Crows stood back and cawed with wonder."
"When he went back to them, he said to Miss Crow, ""You see how brave I am. If I were taking care of anybody, nothing could ever harm her."" And he looked tenderly at her with his little round eyes. But she pretended not to understand what he meant, for she did not wish to give up her pleasant life with the flock and begin nest-building just yet."
"When they reached the barn-yard, there was rich picking, and Mr. Crow made such a clatter that you would have thought he owned it all and that the others were only his guests. He flew down on the fence beside a couple of harmless Hens, and he flapped his wings and swaggered around until they began to sidle away. Then he grew bolder (you know bullies always do if they find that people are scared), and edged up to them until they fluttered off, squawking with alarm."
"Next he walked into the Hen-house, saying to the other Crows, ""You might have a good time, too, if you were not such cowards."" He had no more than gotten the words out of his bill, when the door of the Hen-house blew shut and caught there. It was a grated door and he scrambled wildly to get through the openings. While he was trying, he heard the hoarse voice of the Crow whom he had beaten the day before, saying, ""Thank you, we are having a fairly good time as it is""; and he saw Miss Crow picking daintily at some corn which the speaker had scratched up for her."
"""Ugh, ugh!"" he said as soon as he got his noses inside the door. ""I smell Christian blood and bone in my house."""
"""Yes, just think! A raven came flying past here with a thigh-bone, which he dropped down the chimney,"" said the Princess. ""I threw it out, but the raven brought it back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to clean the room, but I suppose the smell is not quite gone,"" she said."
"""No, I can smell it well,"" said the troll; but he was tired and put his heads in the Princess's lap, and she went on scratching them till they all fell a-snoring. Then she called the hens, and the soldier came and cut off all the six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks."
"She was no less glad than her elder sister, as you may imagine, and danced and sang; but in the midst of their joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went with the soldier across a large courtyard, and, after walking through many, many rooms, he came to the hall of gold where the third sister was."
"She sat at a golden spinning-wheel spinning gold yarn, and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered till it hurt one's eyes."
"""Heaven preserve both you and me, what do you want here?"" said the Princess. ""Go, go, else the troll will kill us both."""
"""Just as well two as one,"" answered the soldier. The Princess cried and wept; but it was all of no use, he must and would remain. Since there was no help for it he would have to try if he could use the troll's sword on the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to move it; it was still larger and heavier than the other two swords."
"He then had to take the horn down from the wall and take three draughts from it, but was only just able to stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts he could lift it, and when he had taken another three he swung it as easily as if it had been a feather."
"The Princess then settled with the soldier to do the same as her sisters had done. As soon as the troll was well asleep she would call the hens, and he must then make haste and come in and put an end to the troll."
"All of a sudden they heard such a thundering, rambling noise, as if the walls and roof were tumbling in."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell Christian blood and bone in my house,"" said the troll, sniffing with all his nine noses."
"""Yes, you never saw the like! Just now a raven flew past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney. I threw it out, but the raven brought it back, and this went on for some time,"" said the Princess; but she got it buried at last, she said, and she had both swept and cleaned the place, but she supposed it still smelt."
"""Yes, I can smell it well,"" said the troll."
"""Come here and lie down in my lap and I will scratch your heads,"" said the Princess. ""The smell will be all gone when you awake."""
"He did so, and when he was snoring at his best she put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could get away to call the hens."
"The soldier then came in in his stockinged feet and struck at the troll, so that eight of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was too short and did not reach far enough; the ninth head woke up and began to roar."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell a Christian."""
"""Yes, here he is,"" answered the soldier, and before the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier struck him another blow and the last head rolled along the floor."
You can well imagine how glad the Princesses became now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls' heads; they did not know how they could do enough for him who had saved them. The youngest Princess took off her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took with them as much gold and silver as they thought they could carry and set off on their way home.
"As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the lieutenant pulled up the Princesses, the one after the other. But when they were safely up, the soldier thought it was foolish of him not to have gone up before the Princesses, for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He thought he would first try them, so he put a heavy lump of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the basket was half-way up they cut the rope and the lump of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces flew about his ears."
"""Now we are rid of him,"" they said, and threatened the Princesses with their life if they did not say that it was they who had saved them from the trolls. They were forced to agree to this, much against their will, and especially the youngest Princess; but life was precious, and so the two who were strongest had their way."
"When the captain and lieutenant got home with the Princesses you may be sure there were great rejoicings at the palace. The King was so glad he didn't know which leg to stand on; he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they had never been honoured before they were honoured now in full measure, and no mistake. They walked and strutted about the whole of the day, as if they were the cocks of the walk, since they were now going to have the King for father-in-law. For it was understood they should each have whichever of the Princesses they liked and half the kingdom between them. They both wanted the youngest Princess, but for all they prayed and threatened her it was of no use; she would not hear or listen to either."
They then asked the King if they might have twelve men to watch over her; she was so sad and melancholy since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid she might do something to herself.
"Yes, that they might have, and the King himself told the watch they must look well after her and follow her wherever she went and stood."
"They then began to prepare for the wedding of the two eldest sisters; it should be such a wedding as never was heard or spoken of before, and there was no end to the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering."
"In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about down in the other world. He thought it was hard that he should see neither people nor daylight any more; but he would have to do something, he thought, and so for many days he went about from room to room and opened all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there. At last he came to a drawer in a table, in which there lay a golden key; he tried this key to all the locks he could find, but there was none it fitted till he came to a little cupboard over the bed, and in that he found an old rusty whistle. ""I wonder if there is any sound in it,"" he thought, and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down, that they blackened all the field in which they settled."
"""What does our master want to-day?"" they asked."
"If he were their master, the soldier said, he would like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the earth again. No, none of them knew anything about that; ""But our mother has not yet arrived,"" they said; ""if she can't help you, no one can."""
"So he whistled once more, and shortly heard something flapping its wings far away, and then it began to blow so hard that he was carried away between the houses like a wisp of hay across the courtyard, and if he had not caught hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown away altogether."
A big eagle bigger than you can imagine then swooped down in front of him.
"""Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense."" George kicked his boots against the fencing to warm his toes. ""It's half the world away."""
"""It looks very near,"" said Jane, hunching up her shoulders to keep her neck warm."
"""They're close to the North Pole,"" said George. ""Look here I don't care a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the North Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home and write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how brave you are."""
Jane got off the fence.
"""Oh, George, let's,"" she said. ""We shall never have such a chance again all alone by ourselves and quite late, too."""
"""I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you,"" George answered gloomily, ""but you know they always say I lead you into mischief and if we went to the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and you remember what they said about not going on the grass."""
"""They said the lawn,"" said Jane. ""We're not going on the lawn. Oh, George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so very far we could be back before they had time to get dreadfully angry."""
"""All right,"" said George, ""but mind, I don't want to go."""
"So off they went. They got over the fence, which was very cold and white and shiny because it was beginning to freeze, and on the other side of the fence was somebody else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly as they could, and beyond that was a field where there was another big bonfire, with people standing around it who looked quite dark-skinned."
"""It's like Indians,"" said George, and wanted to stop and look, but Jane pulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire and got through a gap in the hedge into another field a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a number of other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled and twinkled."
"Now, during the winter the Arctic regions come much farther south than they are marked on the map. Very few people know this, though you would think they could tell it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just when George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the Arctic regions had come down very nearly as far as Forest Hill, so that, as the children walked on, it grew colder and colder, and presently they saw that the fields were covered with snow, and there were great icicles hanging from all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still seemed some way off."
"They were crossing a very rough, snowy field when Jane first noticed the animals. There were white rabbits and white hares and all sorts and sizes of white birds, and some larger creatures in the shadows of the hedges that Jane was sure were wolves and bears."
"""Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean,"" she said, for she did not want George to think her stupid again."
"There was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered with snow and icicles; but the children found a place where there was a hole, and as no bears or wolves seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they crept through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the other side."
And then they stood still and held their breath with wonder.
"For in front of them, running straight and smooth right away to the Northern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure dark ice, and on each side were tall trees all sparkling with white frost, and from the boughs of the trees hung strings of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and shining so brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane said so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the Earl's Court Exhibition."
The rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away away and away and at the other end of them shone the Aurora Borealis.
"There was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters of pure ice the children read: THIS WAY TO THE NORTH POLE."
"Then George said: ""Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one so here goes."" And he took a run on the frozen snow, and Jane took a run when she saw him do it, and the next moment they were sliding away, each with feet half a yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North Pole."
"This great slide is made for the convenience of the Polar bears, who, during the winter months, get their food from the Army and Navy Stores and it is the most perfect slide in the world. If you have never come across it, it is because you have never let off fireworks on the eleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly naughty and disobedient. But do not be these things in the hope of finding the great slide because you might find something quite different, and then you will be sorry."
"The great slide is like common slides in that when once you have started you have to go on to the end unless you fall down and then it hurts just as much as the smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs downhill all the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and faster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not time to notice the scenery. They only saw the long lines of frosted trees and the starry lamps, and on each side, rushing back as they slid on, a very broad, white world and a very large, black night; and overhead as well as in the trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead shone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears. Jane said that, and George said: ""I can see the Northern Lights quite plain."""
"It is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear, dark ice especially if you feel you are really going somewhere, and more especially if that somewhere is the North Pole. The children's feet made no noise on the ice, and they went on and on in a beautiful white silence. But suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out over the snow."
"""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and he fell down at once, because it is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top of him and then they crawled on hands and knees to the snow at the edge of the slide and there was a sportsman, dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache, like the one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a gun in his hand."
"""You don't happen to have any bullets about you?"" said he."
"""No,"" George said, truthfully. ""I had five of father's revolver cartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets to see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake."""
"""Quite so,"" said the sportsman, ""these accidents will occur. You don't carry firearms, then, I presume?"""
"""I haven't any firearms,"" said George, ""but I have a firework. It's only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good."" And he began to feel among the string and peppermints, and buttons and tops and nibs and chalk and foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets."
"""One could but try,"" the sportsman replied, and he held out his hand."
"But Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered, ""Ask him what he wants it for."""
"So then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted the firework to kill the white grouse with; and, when they came to look, there was the white grouse himself, sitting in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn, and waiting anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the other."
"George put all the things back in his pockets, and said, ""No, I shan't."
"Once, Queen Victoria herself gave medals to some wounded and disabled soldiers who had fought very bravely. Some of these men could not raise their arms to salute their queen; some could not walk, but had to be wheeled in chairs to her side; but all were proud to receive their medals of honour from her hands."
"""Noble fellows,"" she wrote of them afterwards, ""I feel as if they were my own children."""
The Relief of Lucknow
"During the time of the terrible Indian Mutiny, when most of the native troops rose against their British rulers, and vowed to kill every white person in the land, many cruel deeds were done. A great number of white people were slain before the British troops could come to their rescue, but in some places they managed to hold out until help reached them."
"This was the case in the city of Lucknow, where the British governor with a small body of troops, and a great many women and children, took refuge in the Government House from a vast host of rebels who came to attack them. Many of the brave defenders were killed by the shot and shell of the enemy. Many others, and especially the little children, fell sick and died, for the heat was very great, and there was no good water to be had. Then, after many days, a small body of white soldiers fought their way into the city, and brought help and hope to the rest of the party. They were only just in time. Had they come a few days later they would have found the Government House a heap of ruins, and their friends dead, for the rebels were making a mine under the building and meant to blow it up with gunpowder. But alas! the newcomers were not strong enough to fight their way out of Lucknow with a crowd of helpless women and children and sick folk, so they, too were now shut in. For two months longer they held out. Then at last, when they had almost lost hope, the great Sir Colin Campbell with his brave Highlanders and other soldiers defeated the rebels, and brought the band of sick, starving, and weary people safely away."
Grace Darling
"On a small rocky island, off the north coast of England, there is a lighthouse. A man named William Darling was once keeper of this lighthouse, and his daughter Grace lived with him. Every day Grace Darling helped her father to trim the lamps, so that at night they might shine brightly, and warn sailors to steer their ships away from the dangerous rocks, upon which they would have been dashed to pieces."
"One stormy night Grace woke with the sound of screams in her ears. The screams came from the sea, so she knew that some ship must be in distress. She roused her father, but they could see nothing in the darkness. When daylight came, they found that a ship had been wrecked upon the rocks some way off, and a few people were clinging to the masts. Grace wished to go at once in a boat to save them; but at first her father hung back, for the wind and sea were wild, and he feared that the small boat would be overturned by the great waves. Then Grace ran to the boat, and seized an oar, for she could not bear to let the poor men die without trying to save them; and the father could not let his brave, daughter go alone, so he followed, and they rowed off."
"It was hard work pulling against the strong sea, and several times the small boat was almost sunk. But at last it reached the wreck, and William Darling managed to land upon the rock, and with great care and skill helped the half-frozen people into the small boat. Then they were taken to the lighthouse, where Grace warmed and fed them, until the storm ceased, and they could return to their homes."
David Livingstone
"At one time many people believed that the middle of Africa was a sandy desert, where nothing could live but camels and ostriches. But they were mistaken. The great traveller, David Livingstone, journeyed into this unknown country, and he found that it was not a desert but a beautiful land, where many tribes of black people dwelt. He also saw that these people were often seized by strangers, and taken away to be sold as slaves. This sight filled him with sadness, and he made up his mind to put a stop to this cruel traffic. He worked hard, tracing the courses of the rivers, finding the best tracts of land, and teaching the natives."
"Then he urged his countrymen to send others after him to settle in this fair country, to help the natives to learn useful trades, and to drive away the slave-merchants."
"For some years he was quite alone, with his black servants, in the midst of this wild land. His friends grew anxious, and sent Mr. Stanley, another great traveller, to look for him. Stanley marched for nearly a year before he found Livingstone. The old explorer was white and worn with sickness and hardship, and he was overjoyed to clasp once more the hand of a white man, and to hear again the English tongue. But he would not return to England. He said his work was not yet done, and he set out once more on his travels. It was his last journey. One morning his servants found him dead upon his bed. Since that time much has been done to make Central Africa a prosperous land. Other white men have followed where Livingstone led, and wherever they have settled, the wicked slave-trade has been stopped."
The Battle of Waterloo
"Fields of waving corn, green woods, fruitful orchards, a pretty farmhouse and a few cottages such was the plain of Waterloo. And there, on a summer Sunday, nearly a hundred years ago, was fought a famous battle, in which the British troops under the Duke of Wellington beat the French army, and broke the power of the great Napoleon for ever."
"""We have them,"" cried Napoleon as he saw the British drawn up before him. He thought it would be easy to destroy this army, so much smaller than his own, before their friends the Prussians, who were on the way to help them, came up. But he was mistaken. Wellington had placed his foot-soldiers in squares, and though the French horsemen, then the finest soldiers in the world, charged again and again, these little clumps of brave men stood fast. On his favourite horse ""Copenhagen"", Wellington rode to and fro cheering his men. ""Stand firm, my lads,"""
"cried he. ""What will they say to this in England?"""
"Not till evening, when the Prussians came, would he allow them to charge the French in their turn. Then, waving his cocked hat over his head, he gave the order, ""The whole line will advance"", and the impatient troops dashed forward. The French bravely tried to stand against this terrific charge, but they were beaten back, and the battle of Waterloo was ended."
"Sixty thousand men lay dead or wounded under the fruit-trees, and among the trampled corn and grass at the end of that terrible day."
The Charge of the Light Brigade
Forward the Light!
"Such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred British soldiers. Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready to shoot them down as they came, while on the hills on either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the Russians."
"""Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent to certain death,"""
thought the leader of the Light Brigade.
"""Forward! Attack!"""
"The order was repeated, and with the obedience of well-trained soldiers the Brigade started."
"“If others have tried it,” said Brother Lustig, “I will try it too.”"
"“Leave it alone,” said the host, “it will cost you your neck.” “It won’t kill me at once,” said Brother Lustig, “just give me the key, and some good food and wine.” So the host gave him the key, and food and wine, and with this Brother Lustig went into the castle, enjoyed his supper, and at length, as he was sleepy, he lay down on the ground, for there was no bed. He soon fell asleep, but during the night was disturbed by a great noise, and when he awoke, he saw nine ugly devils in the room, who had made a circle, and were dancing around him."
"Brother Lustig said, “Well, dance as long as you like, but none of you must come too close.” But the devils pressed continually nearer to him, and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet. “Stop, you devils’ ghosts,” said he, but they behaved still worse. Then Brother Lustig grew angry, and cried, “Hola! but I will soon make it quiet,”"
"and got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with it. But nine devils against one soldier were still too many, and when he struck those in front of him, the others seized him behind by the hair, and tore it unmercifully. “Devils’ crew,” cried he, “it is getting too bad, but wait. Into my knapsack, all nine of you!” In an instant they were in it, and then he buckled it up and threw it into a corner. After this all was suddenly quiet, and Brother Lustig lay down again, and slept till it was bright day. Then came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle belonged, to see how he had fared; but when they perceived that he was merry and well they were astonished, and asked, “Have the spirits done you no harm, then?” “The reason why they have not,” answered Brother Lustig, “is because I have got the whole nine of them in my knapsack! You may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them will ever haunt it again.” The nobleman thanked him, made him rich presents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would provide for him as long as he lived. “No,”"
"replied Brother Lustig, “I am used to wandering about, I will travel farther.” Then he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack, which contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and his apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers with all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were quite pitiable. When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of them were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was still alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell. Thereupon Brother Lustig travelled a long time about the world, and those who know them can tell many a story about him, but at last he grew old, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to be a pious man, and said to him, “I am tired of wandering about, and want now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” The hermit replied, “There are two roads, one is broad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough, and leads to heaven.” “I should be a fool,” thought Brother Lustig, “if I were to take the narrow, rough road.” So he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length came to a great black door, which was the door of Hell. Brother Lustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there. But when he saw Brother Lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very same ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had escaped from it with a black eye. So he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the devil’s lieutenant, and said, “There is a fellow outside with a knapsack, who wants to come in, but as you value your lives don’t allow him to enter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack. He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.” So they called out to Brother Lustig that he was to go away again, for he should not get in there! “If they won’t have me here,” thought he, “I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must be somewhere.” So he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of Heaven, where he knocked. St. Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper. Brother Lustig recognised him at once, and thought, “Here I find an old friend, I shall get on better.” But St. Peter said, “I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven.” “Let me in, brother; I must get in somewhere; if they would have taken me into Hell, I should not have come here.” “No,” said St."
"Peter, “thou shalt not enter.” “Then if thou wilt not let me in, take thy knapsack back, for I will have nothing at all from thee.” “Give it here, then,” said St. Peter. Then Brother Lustig gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside his seat. Then said Brother Lustig, “And now I wish myself inside my knapsack,” and in a second he was in it, and in Heaven, and St. Peter was forced to let him stay there."
82 Gambling Hansel
"Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and for that reason people never called him anything but Gambling Hansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house and all that he had. Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night. Then Gambling Hansel said, “For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat.” So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which Gambling Hansel made no objection. Thereupon St. Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker’s and fetch some bread. So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, “Hansel, do come in.” “Oh,” said he, “do you want to win the three groschen too?” On this they would not let him go. So he went in, and played away the three groschen also. Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him. When Gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play. St. Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf. Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, “Alack, sir, the casks are all empty!” But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there. For a long time he would not believe this, but at length he said, “Well, I will go down, but I know that there is none there.” When he turned the tap, however, lo and behold, the best of wine ran out! So he took it to them, and the two passed the night there. Early next day our Lord told Gambling Hansel that he might beg three favours. The Lord expected that he would ask to go to Heaven; but Gambling Hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything, for dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree whereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who had climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so. The Lord gave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter."
"And now Gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest, and before long he had gained half the world. Upon this St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on, he will win, and thou lose, the whole world. We must send Death to him.” When Death appeared, Gambling Hansel had just seated himself at the gaming-table, and Death said, “Hansel, come out a while.” But Gambling Hansel said, “Just wait a little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into that tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have something to munch on our way.” Thereupon Death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and Gambling Hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died."
"So St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on. People no longer die; we must go ourselves.” And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down. So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, “Come down,” and Death took him directly and put an end to him. They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it. “Who is there?” “Gambling Hansel.” “Ah, we will have nothing to do with him! Begone!” So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more. “Who is there?” “Gambling Hansel.” “Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him. We do not want to gamble, just go away again.” Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in. There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world."
And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again.
"Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, “Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.” And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, “Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.” So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day."
83 Hans in Luck
"Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, “Master, my time is up; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother; give me my wages.” The master answered, “You have served me faithfully and honestly; as the service was so shall the reward be;” and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home."
"As he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse. “Ah!” said Hans quite loud, “what a fine thing it is to ride! There you sit as on a chair; you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and get on, you don’t know how.”"
"The rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, “Hollo! Hans, why do you go on foot, then?”"
"“I must,” answered he, “for I have this lump to carry home; it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.”"
"“I will tell you what,” said the rider, “we will exchange: I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump.”"
"“With all my heart,” said Hans, “but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.”"
"The rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up; then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, “If you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, “Jup! Jup!”"
"Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free. After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, “Jup! Jup!”"
"The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him."
"Hans got his limbs together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, “It is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one’s neck. Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one’s milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow.”"
"“Well,” said the countryman, “if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.” Hans agreed with the greatest delight; the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away."
"Hans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain. “If only I have a morsel of bread—and that can hardly fail me—I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like; if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk. Good heart, what more can I want?”"
"When he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great content ate up what he had with him—his dinner and supper—and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother’s village."
"As it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross. He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst. “I can find a cure for this,” thought Hans; “I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk.” He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath; but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was."
"By good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig. “What sort of a trick is this?”"
"cried he, and helped the good Hans up. Hans told him what had happened."
"The butcher gave him his flask and said, “Take a drink and refresh yourself. The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast; at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher.” “Well, well,” said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, “who would have thought it? Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home; what meat one has! But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me. A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different; and then there are the sausages!”"
"“Hark ye, Hans,” said the butcher, “out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow.” “Heaven repay you for your kindness!” said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand."
"Hans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished; if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right. Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains. The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast. “Just lift her,” added he, and laid hold of her by the wings; “how heavy she is—she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks. Whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.” “Yes,” said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, “she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one.”"
It is the only historical question regarding America not fully settled by this book.
"Nothing more was heard of him till he turned up in a thinking part in ""Rip Van Winkle."""
"Many claims regarding the discovery of various parts of the United States had been previously made. The Cabots had discovered Labrador, the Spaniards the southern part of the United States; the Norsemen had discovered Minneapolis, and Columbus had discovered San Salvador and gone home to meet a ninety-day note due in Palos for the use of the Pinta, which he had hired by the hour."
But we are speaking of the discovery of New York.
"About this time a solitary horseman might have been seen at West 209th Street, clothed in a little brief authority, and looking out to the west as he petulantly spoke in the Tammany dialect, then in the language of the blank-verse Indian. He began, ""Another day of anxiety has passed, and yet we have not been discovered! The Great Spirit tells me in the thunder of the surf and the roaring cataract of the Harlem that within a week we will be discovered for the first time."""
"As he stands there aboard of his horse, one sees that he is a chief in every respect and in life's great drama would naturally occupy the middle of the stage. It was at this moment that Hudson slipped down the river from Albany past Fort Lee, and, dropping a nickel in the slot at 125th Street, weighed his anchor at that place. As soon as he had landed and discovered the city, he was approached by the chief, who said, ""We gates. I am one of the committee to show you our little town. I suppose you have a power of attorney, of course, for discovering us?"""
"""Yes,"" said Hudson. ""As Columbus used to say when he discovered San Salvador, 'I do it by the right vested in me by my sovereigns.' 'That oversizes my pile by a sovereign and a half,' says one of the natives; and so, if you have not heard it, there is a good thing for one of your dinner-speeches here."""
"""Very good,"" said the chief, as they jogged down-town on a swift Sixth Avenue elevated train towards the wigwams on 14th Street, and going at the rate of four miles an hour. ""We do not care especially who discovers us, so long as we hold control of the city organization. How about that, Hank?"""
"""That will be satisfactory,"" said Mr. Hudson, taking a package of imported cheese and eating it, so that they could have the car to themselves."
"""We will take the departments, such as Police, Street-Cleaning, etc., etc., etc., while you and Columbus get your pictures on the currency and have your graves mussed up on anniversaries. We get the two-moment horses and the country châteaux on the Bronx. Sabe?"""
"""That is, you do not care whose portrait is on the currency,"" said Hudson, ""so you get the currency."""
"Said the man, ""That is the sense of the meeting."""
"Thus was New York discovered via Albany and Fort Lee, and five minutes after the two touched glasses, the brim of the schoppin and the Manhattan cocktail tinkled together, and New York was inaugurated."
"Obtaining a gentle and philanthropical gentleman who knew too well the city by gas-light, they saw the town so thoroughly that nearly every building in the morning wore a bright red sign which read"
+           +
|   BEWARE OF PAINT.   |
+           +
"Regarding the question as to who has the right to claim the priority of discovery of New York, I unite with one of the ablest historians now living in stating that I do not know."
"Here and there throughout the work of all great historians who are frank and honest, chapter after chapter of information like this will burst forth upon the eye of the surprised and delighted reader."
"Society at the time of the discovery of the blank-verse Indian of America was crude. Hudson's arrival, of course, among older citizens soon called out those who desired his acquaintance, but he noticed that club life was not what it has since become, especially Indian club life."
He found a nation whose regular job was war and whose religion was the ever-present prayer that they might eat the heart of their enemy plain.
"The Indian High School and Young Ladies' Seminary captured by Columbus, as shown in the pictures of his arrival at home and his presentation to the royal pair one hundred and seventeen years before this, it is said, brought a royal flush to the face of King Ferdie, who had been well brought up."
"This can be readily understood when we remember that the Indian wore at court a court plaster, a parlor-lamp-shade in stormy weather, made of lawn grass, or a surcingle of front teeth."
"They were shown also in all these paintings as graceful and beautiful in figure; but in those days when the Pocahontas girls went barefooted till the age of eighty-nine years, chewed tobacco, kept Lent all winter and then ate a brace of middle-aged men for Easter, the figure must have been affected by this irregularity of meals."
"Unless the Pocahontas of the present day has fallen off sadly in her carriage and beauty, to be saved from death by her, as Smith was, and feel that she therefore had a claim on him, must have given one nervous prostration, paresis, and insomnia."
"The Indian and the white race never really united or amalgamated outside of Canada. The Indian has always held aloof from us, and even as late as Sitting Bull's time that noted cavalry officer said to the author that the white people who simply came over in the Mayflower could not marry into his family on that ground. He wanted to know why they had to come over in the Mayflower."
"""We were here,"" said the aged warrior, as he stole a bacon-rind which I used for lubricating my saw, and ate it thoughtfully, ""we were here and helped Adam 'round up' and brand his animals. We are an old family, and never did manual labor. We are just as poor and proud and indolent as those who are of noble blood. We know we are of noble blood because we have to take sarsaparilla all the time. We claim to come by direct descent from Job, of whom the inspired writer says,"
"""Old Job he was a fine young lad,       Sing Glory hallelujah."
"The Queen, however, did not love the King because he had no nose, but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful. Once, therefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the Queen said she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off any one’s head and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it. But none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again at the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it and she hewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed together directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat."
"Then the King said to her, “My child, and where hast thou learnt that?”"
"“Yes,” she said, “I understand the art; shall I just try it on thee also?” “Oh, yes,” said he. But she cut off his head, and did not put it on again; but pretended that she could not get it on, and that it would not keep fixed. Then the King was buried, but she married Ferdinand the Faithful."
"He, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was seated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he knew, and gallop three times round it. And when he had done that, the white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed into a King’s son."
127 The Iron Stove
"In the days when wishing was still of some use, a King’s son was bewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest."
"There he passed many years, and no one could deliver him. Then a King’s daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could not find her father’s kingdom again. After she had wandered about for nine days, she at length came to the iron stove. Then a voice came forth from it, and asked her, “Whence comest thou, and whither goest, thou?” She answered, “I have lost my father’s kingdom, and cannot get home again.”"
"Then a voice inside the iron stove said, “I will help thee to get home again, and that indeed most swiftly, if thou wilt promise to do what I desire of thee. I am the son of a far greater King than thy father, and I will marry thee.”"
"Then was she afraid, and thought, “Good heavens! What can I do with an iron stove?” But as she much wished to get home to her father, she promised to do as he desired. But he said, “Thou shalt return here, and bring a knife with thee, and scrape a hole in the iron.” Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, but in two hours he took her home; there was great joy in the castle when the King’s daughter came home, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, “Dear father, what I have suffered! I should never have got home again from the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I have been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it.”"
"Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had but this one daughter. They therefore resolved they would send, in her place, the miller’s daughter, who was very beautiful. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the iron stove."
"So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off the least morsel of it. When day dawned, a voice in the stove said, “It seems to me it is day outside.” Then she answered, “It seems so to me too; I fancy I hear the noise of my father’s mill.”"
"“So thou art a miller’s daughter! Then go thy way at once, and let the King’s daughter come here.” Then she went away at once, and told the old King that the man outside there, would have none of her he wanted the King’s daughter. They, however, still had a swine-herd’s daughter, who was even prettier than the miller’s daughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the King’s daughter. So she was taken thither, and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours. She, however, made nothing of it. When day broke, a voice inside the stove cried, “It seems to me it is day outside!” Then answered she, “So it seems to me also; I fancy I hear my father’s horn blowing.”"
"“Then thou art a swine-herd’s daughter! Go away at once, and tell the King’s daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised, and if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined and destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another.” When the King’s daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there was nothing for it but to keep her promise. So she took leave of her father, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove in the forest."
"When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron gave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a small hole. Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so brilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was delighted. Now, therefore, she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that he was able to get out. Then said he, “Thou art mine, and I am thine; thou art my bride, and hast released me.” He wanted to take her away with him to his kingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her father, and the King’s son allowed her to do so, but she was not to say more to her father than three words, and then she was to come back again. So she went home, but she spoke more than three words, and instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over glass mountains and piercing swords; but the King’s son was set free, and no longer shut up in it. After this she bade good-bye to her father, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the great forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be found. For nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do, for she could no longer live. When it was evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind to spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts. When midnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and thought, “Ah, there I should be saved!” She got down from the tree, and went towards the light, but on the way she prayed. Then she came to a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a small heap of wood lay in front of it."
"She thought, “Ah, whither have I come,” and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing inside but toads, big and little, except a table well covered with wine and roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver. Then she took courage, and knocked at the door. The fat toad cried,"
"“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither, And quickly see who is without:”"
"and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her. When she entered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down."
"They asked, “Where hast thou come from, and whither art thou going?”"
"Then she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had transgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than three words, the stove, and the King’s son also, had disappeared, and now she was about to seek him over hill and dale until she found him."
"Then the old fat one said,"
"“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither, And bring me the great box.”"
"Then the little one went and brought the box. After this they gave her meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like silk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God’s name, and slept."
"When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three needles out of the great box which she was to take with her; they would be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, and go over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all this she would get her lover back again. Then she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest care of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts. With these she travelled onwards, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully. After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them."
"At last she arrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a large and beautiful castle. She went and asked for a place; she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired. She knew, however, that the King’s son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle. Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages. But, already the King’s son had another maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead."
"In the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. She cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when lo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it! But when the bride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to buy it, and said, “It is not a dress for a servant-girl.” But she said no, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one thing she should have it, and that was, leave to sleep one night in her bridegroom’s chamber. The bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it. When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, “That silly girl will sleep in thy room.”"
"“If thou art willing so am I,” said he. She, however, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him."
"She wept the whole night and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!”"
"The servants sat by the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night through, and in the morning they told it to their lord. And the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second nut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride beheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom’s chamber. The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so soundly that he could hear nothing. But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!” The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in the morning informed their lord of it. And on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the third nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff with pure gold. When the bride saw that she wanted to have it, but the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the bridegroom’s apartment. The King’s son was, however, on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away. Now, therefore, when she began to weep and to cry, “Dearest love, I set thee free when thou wert in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest,” the King’s son leapt up and said, “Thou art the true one, thou art mine, and I am thine.” Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took away the false bride’s clothes so that she could not get up. When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated themselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass mountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they got to the little old house; but when they went inside that, it was a great castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were King’s children, and full of happiness. Then the wedding was celebrated, and the King’s son and the princess remained in the castle, which was much larger than the castles of their fathers. As, however, the old King grieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him to live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy wedlock."
"A mouse did run, This story is done."
128 The Lazy Spinner
"In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and the wife was so idle that she would never work at anything; whatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done, and what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain entangled in a heap. If the man scolded her, she was always ready with her tongue, and said, “Well, how should I wind it, when I have no reel? Just you go into the forest and get me one.” “If that is all,” said the man, “then I will go into the forest, and get some wood for making reels.” Then the woman was afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel of it, and she would have to wind her yarn off, and then begin to spin again. She bethought herself a little, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she secretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had climbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept into the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,"
"“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
But _Who'd be a king?_
_Who killed Cock Robin?_
_Who's to blame?_

"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!

"""But what was the cause of it all?""  I demanded.  ""You surely know the"
"reason?"""
"""No, we cannot yet tell,"" he answered.  ""The marks puzzle us.  That mark"
on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."
"""Personally, I think there can be no doubt."""
"""But by whom?  No one called here after my departure."""
"""It is that mystery which we must elucidate,"" he said.  ""All I fear is,"
"however, that she may render us no assistance."""
“Yes.”
“The artist is not living?”
"“For heaven’s sake, man! No.”"
"“Well, if he were alive today they would employ him to make those"
gewgaws some people present to leading ladies and to the deputies of
their district. He would be the king of the manufacturers of ornate
barometers.”
“It is undeniable that Bernini had a baroque taste.”
“He gives the impression of a rather pretentious and affected person.”
"“Yes, he does. He was an exuberant, luxuriant Neapolitan; but when he"
chose he could produce marvels. Haven’t you seen his Saint Teresa?”
“No.”
“Then you must see it. Let’s take a carriage.”
"They drove to the Piazza San Bernardo, a little square containing three"
"churches and a fountain, and went into Santa Maria della Vittoria."
"Kennedy went straight toward the high altar, and stopped to the left of"
it.
"In an altar of the transept is to be seen a group carved in marble,"
representing the ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Cæsar gazed at it absorbed.

"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
"""What's the use of crossing bridges,"" Tommy grinned. ""If he won't"
"persuade, then sit on his head--anything, I don't care! The main thing"
"is--keep him!"""
CHAPTER III
THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ
"Next morning began the conversion, or rather the persuasion, of Monsieur"
Dragot to remain a while longer with the _Whim_. Pete started off with
another triumphant breakfast and before our guest had gone far with it
his face was agleam with pleasure. Tommy and I put ourselves out to be
"agreeable, telling him jokes that sometimes registered but frequently"
"did not. Yet we were on most affable terms when, stuffed to repletion,"
we leaned back and lighted cigarettes.
"""Professor,"" Tommy suggested, ""I think if you stay with us you'll have a"
"better chance to find that child!"""
"Our guest beamed agreeably at the appelative, then looked toward me."
"""I'm sure of it,"" I said. ""We've nowhere to go but anywhere, and that"
"ought to fall in with your plans."""
"""_Pardieu_, you overwhelm me! You mean I may sail about with you,"
"searching?"""
"""Nothing simpler,"" I assured him. ""We've rather taken a fancy to you,"
"""They're hostile, whatever they are,"" said Dex. ""Look out: that one's"
"pointing something at you!"""
"One of the slender, tottering creatures had raised an arm and leveled"
"at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned"
flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between
them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to
whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.
"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"
*       *       *       *       *
The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"
"mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth"
oaths exploded from his lips.
The general shrugged his shoulders and laughed grimly. 'Why not?' he
"said. 'What are waiting-women and the like made for, if not to be"
bribed--or slapped?'
She hated him for that sly hit--if never before; but she controlled
herself. She would throw the burden on him.
"He read the thought, and it led him to change his tone. There was a"
"gloomy fire in his eyes, and smouldering passion in his voice, when he"
spoke again.
"'Well, Countess,' he said, 'I am here for your answer.'"
'To what?'
"'To the question I asked you some time ago,' he rejoined, dwelling on"
her with sullen eyes. 'I asked you to be my wife. Your answer?'
"'Prythee!' she said proudly, 'this is a strange way of wooing.'"
"'It is not of my choice that I woo in company,' he answered, shrugging"
his shoulders. 'My answer; that is all I want--and you.'
"'Then you shall have the first, and not the last,' she exclaimed on a"
"sudden impulse. 'No, no--a hundred times no! If you do not see that by"
"pressing me now,' she continued impetuously, 'when I am alone,"
"friendless, and unprotected, you insult me, you should see it, and I"
do.'
"For a moment there was silence. Then he laughed; but his voice,"
"notwithstanding his mastery over it and in spite of that laugh, shook"
"with rage and resentment. 'As I expected,' he said. 'I knew last night"
translation and they'd only have lost one day. What the hell. Use that
"as a fallback position. Time, that's all it would take, just a little"
more time.
"""But what does it matter? The game's up anyway."" He nodded toward Vera,"
"then turned to Eva, sending her a pointed signal."
"""What was it Shakespeare said about discretion and valor,"" she"
"concurred, understanding exactly what he was thinking."
"""The man knew when to fish and when to cut bait."""
"""True enough. Shall you tell them or shall I?"""
"""You can do the honors."""
"She walked over and picked up her briefcase. ""You didn't really think"
"we'd leave it, did you, Comrade? So just take it and good riddance. A"
little gift from the NSA. Who says America's getting stingy with its
"foreign aid?"""
"Comrade Karanova motioned for the two _kobun _to take the case. ""See if"
"it's there."""
"As they moved to comply, Vance found himself wondering if this really"
was going to turn off the heat. Somehow it no longer seemed adequate.
"""_Hai so_,"" he grunted through his teeth as he lifted it, ""something is"
"here."" Vance noticed that two digits of the little finger on his left"
"hand were missing, along with another digit on his ring finger. Good"
"thing Ken was never a street man, he thought fleetingly. Guess bankers"
get to pay for their mistakes with something besides sections of fin-
"The grace of her attitude, the intimacy of the scene, the pleasantness"
"of her greeting, made his task hateful."
"“No,” he said, with an asperity directed towards the disinvited guest."
“We shall dine alone to-night.”
"But his tone made Yvonne’s heart give a great throb, and she turned to"
him quickly.
“Has anything happened?”
"“A great deal,” said the Canon."
"Where he stood in the dusk of the doorway, the shadow accentuated the"
stern lines of his face and deepened the sombreness of his glance. His
brows were bent in perplexities of repugnance. It was horrible to demand
"of her such explanations. To Yvonne’s scared fancy, his brows seemed"
bent in accusation. That was the pity of it. For a few seconds they
"looked at one another, the Canon severely, Yvonne in throbbing suspense."
“What?” she asked at length.
"He paused for a moment, then threw his hat and the crumpled Visitors’"
List on to the table and plunged into the heart of things--but not
before Yvonne had glanced at the paper with a sudden pang of intuition.
"“Emmeline has discovered, Yvonne, that the man--”"
"He got no further. Yvonne rushed to him with a cry of pain, clung to his"
"arm, broke into wild words."
“Don’t say any more--don’t--don’t. Spare me--for pity’s sake. I did not
"""Oh, well...."" she said. ""No, let's not tonight,"" she added suddenly;"
"""some other time. Yes? In a few days? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good"
"night."""
"For the first time it struck me: she wants to rouse you, too, settled man"
though you are; she wants to make you as mad as the others! That's what
she's after!
"And now I remember, before the lawyer arrived, when there was Tradesman"
"Batt--I remember how during his first few days here, she would give me a"
"kind word or a look that was quite out of the picture, and as unmistakable"
"as her pride would permit. No, she had no objections to seeing old age"
wriggle. And listen to this: before this she had been intent to show a
"well-behaved indifference to sex, but that was finished; was she not at"
"this moment resisting only faintly, and raising definite hopes? ""Not"
"tonight, but some other time,"" she had said. Yes, a half-refusal, a mere"
"postponement, that I was meant to hear. She was corrupt, but she was also"
"cunning, with the cunning of a madman. So corrupt."
"Dear child, Pharaoh laughs before his pyramids; standing before his"
"pyramids he laughs. He would laugh at me, too."
*       *       *       *       *
Next day we three remaining guests were sitting in the living room. The
lady and the actor read one book; I read another.
"""Will you,"" she says to him, ""do me a great favor?"""
"""With pleasure."""
"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"
corks float.”
"your employ."""
"""What!"""
"""I hear you have bought them."""
"""Do you mean to insinuate--"""
"""I don't mean to insinuate anything. Listen! We are where we can talk"
"plainly, Marsh, and I am tired of all this subterfuge. You did what you"
"could to stop me, you even tried to have me killed--"""
"""You dare to--"""
"""But I guess it never occurred to you that I may be just as desperate"
"as you are."""
"The men stared at each other with hostile eyes, but the accusation had"
come so suddenly and with such boldness as to rob Marsh of words.
"Emerson went on in the same level voice: ""I broke through in spite of"
"you, and I'm on the job. If you want to cry quits, I'm willing; but, by"
"God! I won't be balked, and if any of your hired marshals try to take"
"me before I put up my catch I'll put you away. Understand?"""
Willis Marsh recoiled involuntarily before the sudden ferocity that
"blazed up in the speaker's face. ""You are insane,"" he cried."
"""Am I?"" Emerson laughed, harshly. ""Well, I'm just crazy enough to do"
what I say. I don't think you're the kind that wants hand-to-hand
"trouble, so let's each attend to his own affair. I'm doing well, thank"
"you, and I think I can get along better if yon don't come back here"
"until I send for you. Something might fall on you."""
raining. He was a proud and comical sight. But why speak harsh words about
"a raincoat? It was not he, the owner, that had abused it, and it hung from"
his shoulders as innocently as a bridal veil.
"Why speak harsh words about anyone? Life is good, but life is stern."
"Perhaps when she comes out, I think to myself, the following scene will"
take place: I stand here waiting only for this departure. So she gives me
her hand and says good-bye.
"""Why don't you say something?"" she asks in order to seem bright and easy"
in her mind.
"""Because I don't want to hurt you in the great error of your ways."""
"""Ha, ha, ha,"" she laughs, too loudly and in a forced tone; ""the great"
"error of my ways! Well, really!"""
"And her anger grows, while I am assured and fatherly, standing on the firm"
ground of conscious virtue. Yet I say an unworthy thing like this:
"""Don't throw yourself away, Miss Torsen!"""
"She raises her head then; yes, the Torsen type would raise her head and"
"reply, pale and offended:"
"""Throw myself away?--I don't understand you."""
"But it is possible, too, that Miss Torsen, at heart a fine, proud girl,"
would have a lucid moment and see things in their true light:
"""Why not, why shouldn't I throw myself away? What is there to keep? I am"
"thrown away, wasted ever since my school days, and now I am seven and"
"""Got a funny feeling I know."" He was settling into the water beside"
"her. ""But if I told you, you'd probably think I'm hallucinating."" Above"
"the tub, he suddenly noticed yet another video camera."
"As they lay soaking, the _koto _music around them abruptly stopped, its"
poignant twangs disappearing with an electronic click.
"""Are you finding the accommodations adequate?"""
The voice was coming from a speaker carefully integrated into the raw
cypress ceiling.
"""All things considered, we'd sooner be in Philadelphia."" Vance looked"
up.
"""I'm sorry to hear that,"" the voice continued. ""No expense has been"
"spared. My own personal quarters have been placed at your disposal."""
"""Mind telling me who's watching me bathe?"" Eva splashed a handful of"
water at the lens.
"""You have no secrets from me, Dr. Borodin. However, in the interest of"
propriety I have switched off the monitor for the bath. I'm afraid my
"people were somewhat overly zealous, installing one there in the first"
"place."" The voice chuckled. ""But I should think you'd know. I am CEO of"
"the Daedalus Corporation, an organization not unfamiliar to you."""
"""All right,"" she said, ""so where are we?"""
"""Why, you are in the corporation's Hokkaido facility. As my guests."
"Since you two have taken such an interest in this project, I thought it"
"it, though we know better. Do not disown us. You know how triumphantly"
"certain letters of yours are circulated, in which, to protect yourself"
"from suspicion, you rather meanly fasten it on others ... If you are now"
"afraid to incur a little hostility for _my_ sake, concede me at least"
"that you will not allow yourself, out of fear for another, to be tempted"
to renounce me; rather be silent about me.'
Those were bitter reproaches. In the man who had to swallow them there
"was a puny Erasmus who deserved those reproaches, who took offence at"
"them, but did not take them to heart, who continued to act with prudent"
reserve till Hutten's friendship was turned to hatred. In him was also a
"great Erasmus who knew how, under the passion and infatuation with which"
"the parties combated each other, the Truth he sought, and the Love he"
"hoped would subdue the world, were obscured; who knew the God whom he"
professed too high to take sides. Let us try ever to see of that great
Erasmus as much as the petty one permits.

CHAPTER XV
AT LOUVAIN
"""Or open the cottage, if you'd rather,"" she excitedly interrupted him."
"""I hadn't intended leaving New York this winter, but will chaperon a"
"house party if you like!"""
"""Fiddlesticks! Cruise, by all means,"" he spoke with good-natured"
"emphasis. ""Get another fellow, and go after adventures and romances and"
"that kind of thing! Go after 'em hammer and tongs! By George, that's"
"what I'd do if I were a boy, and had the chance!"""
"They waited, rather expectantly."
"""Cruising's all right,"" I said, without enthusiasm. ""But it's a waste of"
"time to go after romance and adventure. They died with the war."""
"""Ho!--they did, did they?"" he laughed in mock derision. ""What's become"
"of your imagination--your vaporings? You used to be full of it!"" And the"
Mater supported him by exclaiming:
"""Why, Jack Bronx! And I used to call you my Pantheist! Don't tell me"
your second sight for discovering the beautiful in things has failed
"you!"""
"""It got put out by mustard gas, maybe,"" I murmured, remembering with"
bitterness some of the fellows who had been with me.
"What was romance here to the colorful, high-tensioned thing I had seen"
in devastated areas where loves of all gradations were torn and
scattered and trampled into the earth like chaff! Fretfully I told them
this.
"They exchanged glances, yet she continued in coaxing vein:"
“Eh?” bawled Sir Gilders Persimmon.
All eyes turned from Ffolliott to the perspiring Fosse. The little man
shifted uneasily under the fire of many amused critical eyes.
"“I was saying,” shrilled the minor critic in his thin jerky voice,"
“that the man who does not play whist is laying up a sad old age for
himself.”
The old baronet shook his head:
“The man who what?”
Fosse licked his lips sullenly:
"“The man who doesn’t play whist,” shrieked Fosse, reddening miserably."
“What about him?” asked Sir Gilders peremptorily.
"“Lays up a sad old age for himself,” screamed the miserable little man."
The old gentleman knit his brows:
“A reformed rake?” he asked testily....
But attention was diverted from the fussy little minor critic’s despair
by the murmur of admiration which greeted the entrance into the room
of a beautiful woman to whom Quogge Myre was paying aggressively
marked court as the announcement of her name called the regard of
the assembled guests to her arrival. Myre was ever for stealing the
lime-light. He was a born filcher of honour. But the beauty’s calm
"dismissal of him, as she swept towards her host, gave Myre a sudden"
"Then Alice added, ""And even if it weren't for the hundred per, he isn't"
"the kind to kill himself."""
"Andrews grunted, ""No, he isn't. But Alice, I'm not at all sure that"
"Norton knows whether he's doing the right thing or not."""
"She shook her head. There was no answer to that argument. Furthermore,"
it was the kind of unresolvable argument that could go on and on until
the answer was supplied from the outside. There could be no end to it
until they were either picked up safely or died in lonely space.
"She decided to drop the discussion as pointless, so headed for the"
bathroom. A hot shower and a quick tubbing of her underclothing were
"on her mind. Her garments, of course, would dry instantly. She had"
to smile a little. To think that a hundred years ago women thought
something they called nylon was wonderful because it was fairly
"quick-drying! Not instantaneous, of course, as was the material of"
which her lingerie was made.
"Anyhow, getting it clean now, and having a bath herself would make"
her feel better. And she would be better equipped to face the
nerve-gruelling business of just sitting there watching the clock go
"around and around, with nothing to do but wait."
VII
"Regin Naylo faced his superior with a scowl. ""That rips it wide open,"""
he said.
torrent of rain beat upon the Frangipani's streaming face; he tottered
"on his knees, but still held his hands to the heavens."
"""They lied,"" he cried. ""Give me but life.""--"
The duke looked at him and heaved up his sword.
"Giovanni Frangipani saw the white face above him, gave a great cry and"
cowered behind his hands. It was all ended in a moment. The rain
washed his gilded harness as he lay with his blood soaking into the
crevices of the rocks.--
Francesco had witnessed neither the fight nor the ending. Impelled by
"an insensate desire to find Raniero, to have a final reckoning for all"
"the baseness and insults he had heaped upon him in the past, for his"
"treachery and cruelty to Ilaria, he had made his way to the great"
hall.
The door was closed and locked from within.
Francesco dealt it a terrific blow. Its shattered framework heaved
inward and toppled against the wall.
In the doorway stood Raniero and looked out at his opponent. He did
not recognize Francesco. His face was sullen; the glitter of his
little eyes mimicked the ring gleams of his hauberk. He put out the
tip of a tongue and moistened his lips.
Francesco's face was as the face of a man who has but one purpose left
"in life and, that accomplished, cares not what happens. Raising his"
"vizor, he said:"
Thursday 2:28 P.M.
"""The hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled,"" Tanzan Mino"
"said quietly. ""Now that all the financial arrangements have been"
"completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring"
"the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable."""
"""The problem is not technical, Mino-sama,"" Taro Ikeda, the project"
"director, continued, his tone ripe with deference. ""It is the Soviet"
"pilot. Perhaps he should be replaced."" He looked down, searching for"
"the right words. ""I'm concerned. I think he has discovered the stealth"
"capabilities of the vehicle. Probably accidentally, but all the same,"
I'm convinced he is now aware of them. Two nights ago he engaged in
certain unauthorized maneuvers I believe were intended to verify those
"capabilities."""
"""_So deshoo_."" Tanzan Mino's eyes narrowed. ""But he has said nothing?"""
"""No. Not a word. At least to me."""
"""Then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically. It would not be the"
"first time."""
"""The maneuvers. They were too explicit,"" Ikeda continued. ""As I said,"
"two nights ago, on the last test fight, he switched off the"
"transponder, then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a"
"power dive, all the way to the deck. It was intended to be a radar-"
"evasive action."" The project director allowed himself a faint, ironic"
"smile. ""At least we now know that the technology works. The vehicle's"
"lately?"""
"""Very well, I believe. The men were down the other day, and told me it"
"was a big thing."""
"""I'm delighted. How does it seem, to be rich?"""
There was the slightest hint of constraint in the girl's voice as she
"stared out at the slowly gathering twilight, murmuring:"
"""I--I hardly know. Rich! That has always been my dream, and yet--"""
"""The wonderful feature about dreams,"" he took advantage of her pause to"
"say, ""is that they come true."""
"""Not all of them--not the real, wonderful dreams,"" she returned."
"""Oh yes! My dream is coming true, and so is yours."""
"""I have given up hoping for that,"" she said, without turning."
"""But you shouldn't give up. Remember that all the great things ever"
"accomplished were only dreams at first, and the greater the"
"accomplishments, the more impossible they seemed to begin with."""
Something in the girl's attitude and in her silence made him feel that
"his words rang hollow and commonplace. While they had talked, an"
"unaccustomed excitement had been mounting in his brain, and it held him"
now in a kind of delicious embarrassment. It was as if both had been
"suddenly enfolded in a new and mysterious understanding, without the"
need of speech. He did not tell himself that Cherry loved him; but he
"roused to a fresh perception of her beauty, and felt himself privileged"
sob.
"""Surely there is confidence between us?""  I urged.  ""Do you not remember"
"that day long ago when we walked one evening in the sunset hand-in-hand,"
"as was our wont, along the river-path towards La Roche?  Do you not"
remember how you told me that in future you would have no single secret
"from me?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered hoarsely, with an effort, ""I recollect."""
"""Then you intend to break your promise to me?""  I whispered earnestly."
"""Surely you will not do this, Yolande?  You will not hide from me the"
"cause of all this bitterness of yours?""  She was silent.  Her breast,"
"beneath its lace, rose quickly and fell again.  Her tear-filled eyes"
were fixed upon the carpet.
"""I would not break my promise,"" she said at last, clasping my hand"
"convulsively and lifting her eyes to mine; ""but, alas! it is now"
"imperative."""
"""Why imperative?"""
"""I must suffer alone,"" she responded gloomily, shaking her head.  Her"
"countenance was as pale as her gown, and she shivered as though she were"
"cold, although the noonday heat was suffocating."
"""Because you refuse to tell me anything or allow me to assist you?""  I"
"said.  ""This is not in accordance with the promise made and sealed by"
"your lips on that evening long ago."""
"""Nor have your actions been in accordance with your own promise,"" she"
said slowly and distinctly.
"the greater number of her clothes, hers was the heavier sack. Thus had"
they shifted their burdens; what burdens would they carry in the future?
"She was, after all, no longer a schoolmistress, and perhaps he was no"
longer with the theater or the films.
"I watched those two crossing rocky, mountainous ground, bare ground, with"
not a tree anywhere except a few stunted junipers; far away near the ridge
"murmured the little Reisa. Those two had put their possessions together,"
"were walking together; at the next halt they would be man and wife, and"
take only one room because it was cheaper.
"Suddenly I started up and, moved by some impulse of human sympathy--nay,"
"of duty--I wanted to run across to her, talk to her, say a word of"
"warning: ""Don't go on!"" I could have done it in a few minutes--a good"
"deed, a duty...."
They disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill.
Her name was Ingeborg.

"And now I, too, must wander on again, for I am the last at the Tore Peak"
"farm. The season is wearing on, and this morning it snowed for the first"
"time--wet, sad snow."
"It is very quiet at the farm now, and Josephine might have played the"
"piano again and been friendly to the last guest; but now I am leaving,"
"""Oh, yes, a scratch. I hardly feel it. It isn't anything. It can't be"
"anything. There's nothing vital thereabouts, is there, Berry?"""
The missionary shrugged his shoulders. He had flung open the glass
"doors which led on to the verandah, and the brightening dawn flooded"
in upon them.
"""Come and help me carry this poor lady,"" he said. ""We have not a"
"minute to lose."""
"Travers tried to obey, but he had no strength, and the other thrust"
him impatiently on one side.
"""Mrs. Carmichael, you are a strong woman,"" he appealed. Between them"
"they managed to bring Mrs. Cary's heavy, unconscious frame down the"
"steps. It was a nerve-trying task, for their progress was of necessity"
"a slow one, and the sound of the desperate fighting seemed to surround"
them on every side. It was with a feeling of intense relief that the
little party saw Nicholson appear from amidst the trees and run toward
them.
"""That's right!"" he cried. ""Only be quick! They are at us on all sides"
"now, but my men are keeping them off until you are out of the"
bungalow. The old ruin at the back of the garden is our last stand.
"Carmichael is there already with a detachment, and is keeping off a"
"rear attack. I shall remain here."""
"""Alone?"" Berry asked anxiously."
"""Yes. I believe they will ransack the bungalow first. When they come,"
"the Rajah is sure to be at their head, and--well, it's going to be"
diamond cut diamond between us two when we meet. I know the beggars
"""So you're here at last----!"" then with a little gasp drew back, facing"
me in the most entrancing attitude of bewilderment.
It was the girl who had left that ball of paper!
"The sea, always my friend, at this moment did a rather decent thing; it"
gave the yacht a firm but gentle lurch and sent us into each other's
arms. Perhaps nothing else in all the world of chances could so
"effectively have broken the ice between us, for we were laughing as I"
"helped her back to the couch; and, as our eyes met, again we laughed."
"""I didn't know,"" she said, ""that Father brought a guest aboard last"
"night!"""
"""Awkward of him, wasn't it?"" I stammered, sparring for time."
"""One is apt to be awkward in weather like this,"" she graciously"
admitted.
"""You don't know how profoundly aware I am of--of how terribly true that"
"is,"" I stumbled along. ""Is he on deck?"" For, oh, if I could only get to"
see him five minutes alone!
"""No, he's unusually lazy this morning; but I've called, him, the old"
"dear!"""
"A chill crept up my spine--crept up, crept down, and then criss-crossed."
But she must know of her mistake before we had gone so far that putting
me ashore would be a serious inconvenience--for I knew he would put me
"ashore at the nearest point, if not, indeed, set me adrift in an open"
boat. Therefore I suggested:

"A large house, with and upper story of planks built on later, displayed a"
"new signboard on the wall: Room and Board. The barn, as usual, was a peat"
hut.
"As I did not know which was Eilert and which Olaus, and had stopped to"
"consider which road to take, a man came hurrying toward me. Ah, well, the"
world is a small place; we meet friends and acquaintances everywhere. Here
"am I, meeting an old acquaintance, the thief of last winter, the pork"
"thief. What luck, what a satisfaction!"
This was Eilert. He took in paying guests now.
"At first he pretended not to recognize me, but he soon gave that up. Once"
"he had done so, however, he carried the thing off in style:"
"""Well, well,"" he said, ""what a nice surprise! You are most welcome under"
"my humble roof, and such it is!"""
"My own response was rather less jaunty, and I stood still collecting my"
"thoughts. When I had asked a few questions, he explained that since the"
"motor traffic had started in Stordalen, many visitors came through this"
"way, and sometimes they wanted to stop over at his house before being"
"rowed across to the steamer. They always came down in the evenings, and it"
"might be fine, or it might not, and at night the fjord was often wild. He"
"had therefore had to arrange to house them, because after all, you can't"
"The green and mossy garden-ways she goes,"
With little mincing airs one keeps to pet
A darling and provoking perroquet.
"Her long-trained robe is blue, the fan she holds"
"With fluent fingers girt with heavy rings,"
So vaguely hints of vague erotic things
"That her eye smiles, musing among its folds."
"—Blonde too, a tiny nose, a rosy mouth,"
"Artful as that sly patch that makes more sly,"
"In her divine unconscious pride of youth,"
The slightly simpering sparkle of the eye.
CYTHÈRE.
"BY favourable breezes fanned,"
A trellised arbour is at hand
To shield us from the summer airs;
"The scent of roses, fainting sweet,"
"Afloat upon the summer heat,"
Blends with the perfume that she wears.
"True to the promise her eyes gave,"
"She ventures all, and her mouth rains"
A dainty fever through my veins;
"And Love, fulfilling all things, save"
"Hunger, we ’scape, with sweets and ices,"
'The second from the door end of the house?' he asked.
"'No, the third.'"
He nodded with an air of quiet triumph. 'Just so!' he said. 'I thought
"so afterwards. But the fact is, my friend, my house ends with the"
"second gable. The third gable-end does not belong to it, though"
doubtless it once did.'
"'No?' I exclaimed. And for a moment I stood taken aback, cursing my"
"carelessness. Then I stammered, 'But this third gable--I saw no door"
"in it, Herr Krapp.'"
"'No, the door is in another street,' he answered. 'Or rather it opens"
on the churchyard at the back of St. Austin's. So you may have seen
"her after all. Well, I wish you well,' he continued. 'I must be"
going.'
"The crowd was beginning to separate, moving away by twos and threes,"
talking loudly. The lights were dying down. He nodded and was gone;
while I still stood gaping. For how did the matter stand? If I had
really seen Marie at the window--as seemed possible now--and if
"nothing turned out to be amiss at home, then I had not been tricked"
"after all, and the message was genuine. True she had not kept her"
"appointment. But she might be in durance, or one of a hundred things"
might have frustrated her intention.
"Still I could do nothing now except go home, and cutting short my"
"speculations, I forced myself through the press, and with some labour"
"managed to reach the door. As I did so I turned to look back, and the"
"sight, though the people were moving away fast, was sufficiently"
"""Yes.  Have you brought the hydrated peroxide of iron?"""
"For answer the Frenchman produced the tiny tube, saying:"
"""Then you suspect poison?"""
"""Most certainly,"" he replied; and, taking a glass, he placed a single"
"pillule in it, dissolving it in water, which he afterwards forced"
between the grey lips of my unconscious love.  Afterwards he glanced at
"his watch, observing: ""We must give another in fifteen minutes."""
"Then, drawing a chair to the bedside, he seated himself, holding her"
wrist and watching her countenance for any change that might take place
there.
"""Have you no idea of the nature of the poison?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""None,"" he responded.  ""Ask me no questions now.  When we have brought"
her round will be time enough.  It should be sufficient for you to know
that she is not dead.  Why not leave us for the present?  Go and break
"the good news to the Countess."""
"""You wish to be alone?"""
"""Yes.  This is a serious matter.  Leave us undisturbed, and on no"
"pretext allow her mother to enter here."""
"Thus urged, and feeling reassured by their statement that she still"
lived and that the pulsations of her heart were already quite
"perceptible, I left the room, noiselessly closing the door after me, and"
sought the Countess in the small blue boudoir to which she had returned
plunged in grief and dark despair.
"_plus_?"""
"""All x--two points four seconds plus--we're riding on 981.286"
"centimeters, to allow for the reversal and for minor detours. Bye."""
"""All this may have been coincidence, Breck, but we'll find out pretty"
"quick now,"" the computer remarked when the flying vessel was nearing"
"the third check-station. ""Unless I'm all out of control we'll check in"
"almost fourteen seconds minus on W41, and we may not even find him on"
"the center block of the screen."""
"When he plugged in W41 was on the block, but was in the extreme upper"
right corner. They checked in thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on
"the station, and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned"
the accuracy of the location of the station and refused point-blank to
correct his course.
"""Not I, my friend, I have robbed you enough."""
"""And about time for the luck to turn, isn't it? Well, I don't care! What"
"shall we do?"""
"""What you will,"" answered the Frenchman absently."
"Benham pulled his beard, then leant forward and put a question with an"
intoxicated leer. A laugh of feigned reproof burst from Gaspard. Benham
"seemed to urge him, and at last he said,"
"""Oh, if you're bent on it, I can be your guide."""
"The two men left the house arm-in-arm, went down the street, and crossed"
"Digby Square. It was late, and few people were about, but Gaspard saw"
"one acquaintance. The doorkeeper was strolling along on his way home,"
matters worse Manufacturer Brede had said he would withdraw his money....
Paul's careworn face looked out of the kitchen door. Before going out
"himself he wanted to make sure there was no one about, but he was"
"disappointed in this, for the lawyer at once greeted him loudly: ""Good"
"evening, Paul!"" and drew him outside."
They strolled down the field in the dusk.
"Assuredly there is little to be gained by ""having a good talk"" with a man"
about his drinking; such matters are too vital to be settled by talking.
"But Paul seems to have admitted that the lawyer was right in all he said,"
and probably left him with good resolutions.
Paul went down to the village again. He was going to the post office; the
money he had from the seven departed guests would be scattered to all
quarters of the globe. And yet it was not enough to cover everything--in
"fact not enough for anything, for interest, repayments, taxes, and"
repairs. It paid only for a few cases of food from the city. And of course
he stopped the case of sirup from going back.
Paul returned blind-drunk because he no longer wished to see. It was the
same thing all over again. But his brain seemed in its own way to go on
"searching for a solution, and one day he asked the lawyer:"
"""What do you call those square glass jars for keeping small fish"
"in--goldfish?"""
"""Do you mean an aquarium?"""
"""That's it,"" said Paul. ""Are they dear?"""
"""How can you ask me?"" answered the maiden. ""You have been sitting here"
"yourself, and talking about our wedding the whole afternoon!"""
"""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who"
"had taken my shape!"""
Then she gradually came to her senses; but not until long afterward was
"she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that"
"her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been"
"there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that"
"they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their"
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day.
NOTE
Black jugglery and deception are practiced upon the poor
"dairy-maid in ""The Troll Wedding"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I,"
"p. 50. From Hadeland, told by a _Signekjarring_, a kind of wise"
woman or herb doctress). Characteristic is the belief that troll
magic and witchery may be nullified if a gun be fired over the
place where it is supposed to be taking place. Then all reverts to
"its original form. Curious, also, is the belief that trolls like"
"to turn into skeins of yarn when disturbed, and then roll swiftly"
away.

"I muse on all this, and understand that her staying here is somehow"
"connected with her carnal desires, with the fact that Solem is still here."
"How muddled it all is, and how this handsome girl has been spoiled! I saw"
"her not long ago, tall and proud, upright, untouched, walking"
"intentionally close to Solem, yet not replying to his greeting. Did she"
suspect him of complicity in the death of the lawyer and avoid him for
"that reason? Not in the least; she avoided him less than before, even"
"letting him take her letters to the post office, which she had not done"
"previously. But she was unbalanced, a poor thing that had lost her"
"bearings. Whenever she could, she secretly defiled herself with pitch,"
with dung; she sniffed at foulness and was not repelled.
"One day, when Solem swore a needlessly strong oath at a horse that was"
"restless, she looked at him, shivered, and went a deep red. But she"
"mastered herself at once, and asked Josephine:"
"""Isn't that man leaving soon?"""
"""Yes,"" Josephine replied, ""in a few days."""
Though she had seized this opportunity to ask her question with a great
"show of indifference, I am certain it was an important one to her. She"
went away in silence.
"Yes, Miss Torsen stayed, for she was sexually bound to Solem. Solem's"
"despair, Solem's rough passion that she herself had inflamed, his"
"""I wait for you!"""
Raniero broke into a boisterous laugh.
"""The bastard! The monk! Go home, Francesco, and don your lady's"
"attire! What would you with a sword?"""
Francesco's mouth was a hard line. He breathed through hungry
"nostrils, as he went step by step toward Raniero."
Then with a swift shifting of his sword from right to left he smote
"him on each cheek, then, lowering his vizor, he put up his guard."
"With an oath Raniero's sword flashed, feinted, turned with a cunning"
"twist, and swept low for Francesco's thigh."
"Francesco leaped back, but was slashed by the point a hair's breadth"
"above the knee. It was a mere skin wound, but the pain of it seemed to"
snap something that had been twisted to a breaking point within him.
He gave a great cry and charged down Raniero's second blow.
"Their shields met and clashed, and Raniero staggered. Francesco rushed"
him across the hall as a bull drives a rival about a yard. Raniero
"crashed against the wall, and Francesco sprang back to use his sword."
The blow hewed the top from Raniero's shield and smote him slant-wise
across the face.
"Raniero gathered himself and struck back, but the blow was caught on"
"Francesco's shield. Francesco thrust at him, before he could recover,"
and the point slipped under the edge of Raniero's gorget. He twisted
free and blundered forward into a fierce exchange of half-arm blows.
"Once he struck Francesco upon the mouth with the pommel of his sword,"
That evening I sat eating alone in the dining room. Since we had not
"brought back any haddock, the visitors upstairs had no desire to come"
"down. All they wanted, Eilert's wife said, was some bread and butter and"
milk to be sent up.
XXVIII
Next morning they had gone.
"Yes, indeed, they left at four in the morning, at dawn; I heard them"
"perfectly well, for my room was near the stairs. The knight of the plump"
"thighs came first, clumping heavily down the stairs. She hushed him, and"
her voice sounded angry.
"Eilert had just risen too, and they stood outside for some minutes,"
"negotiating with him for the boat--yes, at once; they had changed their"
"minds and wanted to leave, immediately. Then they went down to the boat,"
"Eilert with them. I could see them through the window, chilled by the cold"
of early morning and short-tempered with each other. There had been a
"frost during the night; ice lay on the water in the buckets, and the"
"ground was harsh to walk on. Poor things--no food, no coffee; a windy"
"morning, with the sea still running rather high. There they go with their"
knapsacks on their backs; she is still wearing her red hat.
"Well, it was no concern of mine, and I lay down again, intending to sleep"
"till about noon. Nothing was any concern of mine, except myself. I could"
"not see the boat from my bed, so I got up again--just to while the time"
"away--to see how far they had gone. Not very far, though both men were"
heard from the crippled dwarf.
"""It has nothing to do with you,"" she repeated; ""it is a matter of the"
"Gitanos!"""
"But there came up from the bottom of the ravine, the lantern-jawed"
"Sergeant, long, silent, lean, parched as a Manchegan cow whose pasture"
has been burnt up by a summer sun. With one beckoning finger he summoned
"La Giralda apart, and she obeyed him as readily as the boy had obeyed"
"her. They communed a long time together, the old gipsy speaking, the"
coffee-coloured Sergeant listening with his head a little to the side.
At the end of the colloquy Sergeant Cardono went directly up to Rollo
and saluted.
"""Is it permitted for me to speak a word to your Excellency concerning"
"the objects of the expedition?"" he said, with his usual deference."
"""Certainly!"" answered Rollo; ""for me, my mission is a secret one, but I"
"have no instructions against listening."""
The Sergeant bowed his head.
"""Whatever be our mission you will find me do my duty,"" he said; ""and"
"since this cursed plague may interfere with all your plans, it is well"
that you should know what has befallen and what is designed. You will
pardon me for saying that it takes no great prophet to discover that our
"purposes have to do with the movements of the court."""
Rollo glanced at him keenly.
"""Did General Cabrera reveal anything to you before your departure?"" he"
recognized by those whom I did know ha my former life.  There is scarce
an antechamber in those fine houses where patrons dwell where I might
not meet the curious and impertinent regard of those who would know me
"again. That I will not brook.""  And now Grey’s eyes flashed, thinking of"
"Lord Sandford, and how he would chuckle to hear how low his rival had"
"fallen.  ""No; if I am to succeed at all, I must needs do so without a"
"patron. If I fail, there is one resource left.  Able-bodied paupers are"
"sent to the wars.  I can go thither and fight."""
Again a smile flickered over the Old Lion’s face; but the tapster was
"entering with the smoking viands, and the gleam in Grey’s eyes bespoke"
the wolf within him.
"""Set to, my friend, and make a good meal.  When we have cleared the"
"trenchers, you shall come with me to my lodging.  I would hear the end"
"of your tale; but that can wait till after supper."""
*CHAPTER XI.*
*THE LION’S DEN.*
"""Welcome to the Lion’s Den!"" spoke the man Wylde, as he threw open the"
"door of a room which he had unlocked, and kicking a smouldering log upon"
"the hearth, evoked a cheery blaze, by the aid of which he lighted a lamp"
"that swung over a table littered with books, papers, and quills."
"Grey stepped within the threshold, and looked about him with curious"
eyes.  The house they had entered a few minutes before was a tall and
"Monsieur considered this a great joke, exclaiming:"
"""It is not so much as that! She is but three--to me, always three! Yet,"
"as you say, I might better find her with you than anywhere! A despairing"
"search, my boys!"""
Tommy's eyes were twinkling as he murmured sympathetically:
"""If it's a three-year-old you want, there's a place in Havana called"
"'Casa de Beneficencia Maternidad,' where furtive-eyed damsels leave"
"kiddies at twilight, ring the doorbell, and beat it. You might pick up"
"one there, as a last resort."""
"""But--but,"" Monsieur began to sputter, when I threw an orange at Tommy,"
"explaining to our agitated guest that he was a cut-up devoid of ideas,"
really an intellectual outcast.
"""Well,"" he cried, seeming to exude pleasure, ""I will stay with you a"
"while, eh? Maybe we can teach him something--this cut-upping Tommy of"
"yours!"""
"He had fallen in with our scheme most agreeably, and later Tommy"
confided to me that he was glad we wouldn't have to sit on the old
fellow's head.
"Passing that afternoon beneath Morro Castle, the _Whim_ tacked prettily"
through the entrance of Havana harbor and in another scant two miles
dropped anchor.
"Havana Bay is a dancing sheet of water, as bright as the skies and"
hardly less contagious than the city's laughter. But when one drops
and whispered in his ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to
"act promptly. Crouching low, he slid over the edge of the car, hung"
"lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the"
"top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming"
it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional
manner of alighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger
"dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between"
a furniture van and a florist’s delivery wagon.
"The girl in the tan jacket turned again, and looked in the eyes of Mrs."
James Williams. Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck
auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the
plainclothes man.
"“What’s eatin’ you?” demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his"
professional discourse for pure English.
"“Keep her at anchor for a minute,” ordered the officer. “There’s a man"
on board we want—a Philadelphia burglar called ‘Pinky’ McGuire. There
"he is on the back seat. Look out for the side, Donovan.”"
Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams.
"“Come down, old sport,” he said, pleasantly. “We’ve got you. Back to"
"Sleepytown for yours. It ain’t a bad idea, hidin’ on a Rubberneck,"
though. I’ll remember that.”
Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor:
"“Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour.”"
James Williams belonged among the level heads. With necessary slowness
ADJECTIVE-HEADINGS
"In general, a noun or a substantive phrase should be selected for the"
"heading, but when an adjective forms part of a name or well-known"
"term, the entry should include it: e.g., _Alimentary canal, hereditary"
"genius, perpetual motion_, etc."
SUBJECT-MATTER
It is not possible to formulate rules for indexing subject-matter
"as definitely as has already been done with names, places, etc. The"
judgment of the indexer and his analytical skill will be called fully
"into play. The effort should be to express in the index, in the"
"clearest yet briefest form, the _idea_ which the author has amplified"
"in his text. As an aid to the nature and form of the entries, a page of"
"text is shown on the opposite page, and the entries which would appear"
"in the index from this page, are given below. This is what would be"
considered as a medium full index:
"Bressani, Joseph, tortured by Iroquois, 73; life spared by Iroquois,"
"73; sent to Fort Orange, 73; ransomed by Dutch, 73; sent to Rochelle,"
73.
"Dutch, the, ransom Bressani, 73."
"Indian Torture, See _Torture, Indian_."
"Iroquois Indians, the, torture Bressani, 73; spare Bressani's"
"life, 73."
I flattered myself that we had all done a neat bit of convincing lying in
a good cause.
"""Odds fish!"" mumbled the king, pulling his chin beard, evidently puzzled."
"""Odds fish!"" exclaimed Frances, mimicking the king's tone of voice and"
"twisting an imaginary beard. ""Some one has been hoaxing Jacob Hall's"
"friend."""
"It was a bold speech, but Frances carried it off splendidly by turning to"
the king and speaking in mock seriousness:--
"""Your Majesty should put a check on Rochester and the wags. It is a shame"
to permit them to work upon the credulity of one who is growing weak in
"mind by reason of age."""
"The country girl had vanquished the terror of the court, and all who had"
"witnessed the battle rejoiced; that is, all save the king and Castlemain."
"She glared at Frances, and her face, usually beautiful despite the lack"
"of youth, became hideous with rage. She was making ready for another"
"attack of words, if not of finger nails, when the duchess interposed,"
saying:--
"""Evidently some one has been hoaxing you, Lady Castlemain. Mistress"
Jennings was not kidnapped Sunday nor any other day. She has been with
"me constantly of late, excepting Sunday after four o'clock, and she has"
"accounted for herself from that time till her return to my closet."""
"Castlemain was whipped out, so she turned the whole matter off with a"
"forced laugh, saying:--"
"been the crowning blow to her."""
"""I have told madame your mother everything,"" I said.  ""Do not be uneasy"
"on her account."""
"""Ah,"" she sighed, ""how I regret that we came to Paris!  I regret it all,"
"Gerald, save that you and I have met again;"" and she stretched out her"
"hand until it came into contact with my coat-button, with which she"
toyed like a child.
"""And this meeting has really given you satisfaction?""  I whispered to"
"her, heedless of the presence of the others."
"""Not only satisfaction,"" she answered, so softly that I alone could"
"catch her words, and looking into my face with that expression of"
"passionate affection which can never be simulated; ""it has given back to"
"me a desire for happiness, for life, for love."""
"There were tears in those wonderful blue eyes, and her small hand"
trembled within my grasp.  My heart at that moment was too full for mere
"words.  True, I loved her with a mad fondness that I had never before"
"entertained for any woman; yet, nevertheless, a hideous shadow arose"
"between us, shutting her off from me for ever--the shadow of her"
"secret--the secret that she, my well-beloved, was actually a spy."
CHAPTER NINE.
AT THE ELYSEE.
"Having reassured myself of Yolande's recovery, I was compelled to rush"
"off, slip into uniform, and attend a dinner at the Elysee.  The function"
"was a brilliant affair, as are all the official junketings of the French"
into a better channel.[23] Such stories are so easy to recognise that
"it would be useless to make a formal list, but I shall make further"
allusion to this in dealing with stories from the lives of the saints.
"These, then, are the main elements to avoid in the selection of"
material suitable for normal children. Much might be added in the way
"of detail, and the special tendency of the day may make it necessary to"
avoid one class of story more than another; but this care belongs to
another generation of teachers and parents.

"I tried to fathom the meaning of this, but gave it up and started to go"
"on deck. If I could take her father off to one side and explain, well"
and good. He would perhaps sympathize with my mistake when he understood
that it was partially the result of a desire to fill Monsieur with
"spirits. Considering this, I spoiled everything by asking:"
"""What does he look like?"""
"""My father?"" she gasped, in a wondering way."
"""No--yes--certainly not! I mean--oh, this is intolerable! I don't know"
"your father, never saw him in my life--unless he was the one with you"
last night when you drove me frantic with that ball of paper trick! But
what you did has nothing to do with my being here. I've not wilfully
followed. A stupid boatman mistook your yacht for my own when I was--I
"mean to say, when I was too engrossed with the memory of you to notice"
"his mistake."""

that there are no yard-arms on schooner yachts made no difference. And I
"do believe she was considering that when a sailor passed us, looking"
enough like Tommy to have been his twin brother.
"""Jack,"" she said to him, ""tell Mr. Graham to come below!"""
"The fellow saluted and left, and I stared at her in surprise, saying:"
said:
"""You deserve to win, Boyd; you have made a good fight."""
"""Oh, I'll win!"" he declared, wearily. ""I've got to win; only I wish we"
"were past Port Townsend."""
"""What will happen to Fraser?"" she queried."
"""Nothing serious, I am sure. You see, they wanted me, and nobody else;"
once they find they have the wrong man I rather believe they will free
"him in disgust."""
"A moment later he went on: ""Just the same, it makes me feel depressed"
and guilty to leave him--I--I wouldn't desert a comrade for anything if
"the choice lay with me."""
"""You did quite right,"" Cherry warmly assured him."
"""You see, I am not working for myself; I am doing this for another."""
"It was the girl's turn to sigh softly, while the eyes she turned toward"
the west were strangely sad and dreamy. To her companion she seemed not
at all like the buoyant creature who had kindled his courage when it
"was so low, the brave girl who had stood so steadfastly at his shoulder"
"and kept his hopes alive during these last, trying weeks. It struck him"
suddenly that she had grown very quiet of late. It was the first time
"he had had the leisure to notice it, but now, when he came to reflect"
"on it, he remembered that she had never seemed quite the same since his"
interview with her on that day when Hilliard had so unexpectedly come
to his rescue. He wondered if in reality this change might not be due
to some reflected alteration in himself. Well! He could not help it.
prove that; but I doubt if they could ever analyze that atomic motor
"with no hint as to how it works."""
"Silence descended on them again, in which each was lost in his own"
thoughts.
"How many hours had passed, the Earthmen did not know. They had spent"
the time in fruitless planning to escape from their tower room and go
back to the ship again. Though how they could get away in the ship
when the Rogans seemed able to propel it where-ever they wished
"against the utmost power of their motor, they did not attempt to"
consider.
"One of Jupiter's short nights had passed, however--a night weirdly"
"made as light as day by red glares from the plates, which seemed to"
"store up sunlight, among their other functions--and the tiny sun had"
risen to slant into their window at a sharp angle.
Suddenly they heard the familiar drawing of the great bolts outside
"their door. It was opened, and a dozen or more of the Rogans came in,"
with Greca cowering piteously in their midst and attempting to
communicate her distress to Brand.
*       *       *       *       *
At the head of the little band of Rogans was one the prisoners had not
"seen before. He was of great height, fully two feet taller than the"
others; and he carried himself with an air that proclaimed his
importance.
"The tall one turned to Greca and addressed a few high-pitched, squeaky"
"words to her. She shook her head; whereupon, at a hissed command, two"
must pay me one of her garters as her admission fee to this inn. If she
"be madam, she enters free. It is a privilege conferred on the Maid's"
"Garter by good St. Augustine when he was Bishop of Canterbury, so long"
"ago that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary."""
"""What nonsense is this?"" asked Frances, turning to me, and Bettina asked"
"the same question with her eyes. I explained the matter, and Frances,"
"turning to the porter, said:--"
"""I'll buy you off with a jacobus or a guinea."""
"""Not a hundred guineas would buy me off, my lady,"" answered the porter,"
"bowing, ""though I might say that a shilling usually goes with the"
"garter."""
"""Well, I'll send you both the shilling and the garter from my room,"" said"
"Frances, moving toward the inn door."
"""The garter must be paid here, my lady. The shilling may be paid at any"
"time,"" returned the porter, with polite insistence."
"Frances was about to protest, but Betty, more in sympathy with the"
"eccentric customs of inns, modestly lifted her skirts, untied her garter"
"and offered it to the porter, telling him very seriously:--"
"""I am a maid."""
"The porter thanked her gravely, whereupon Frances, turning her back on"
"the audience in the doorway, brought forth her garter, gave it to the"
"porter, and we were admitted."
"Our supper, beds, and breakfast were all so good that they reconciled"
"we are beginning to quarrel, Everard? It is slightly vulgar. I am your"
"oldest friend, remember, and I am trying to acquit myself of a painful"
duty to you.”
"“Duty is one of the chief instruments of the devil, if you will excuse"
"my saying so,” replied the Canon."
"“Oh, very well then, Everard,” she said hotly. “You can go on being"
a fool as long as you like. I saw your wife struggling in this man’s
"embrace, more or less, this morning. Two or three strange coincidences"
have been forced upon my notice. For your sake I have been excessively
"anxious. My conscience tells me I ought to take you into my confidence,"
and I can do no more. You can see the Christian name of this Bazouge
"in the Visitors’ List, and adopt what course of action you think fit."
I wash my hands of the whole matter. And I must say that from the very
"beginning, two years ago, you have treated me all through with the"
greatest want of consideration.”
The Canon did not heed the peroration. He stood with the flimsy sheet
"clenched in his hand and regarded her sternly. She shrank a little, for"
her soul seemed to be naked.
“You have tried to ferret this out through spite against Yvonne. Whether
"the horrible thing you imply is true or not, I shall find it hard to"
forgive you.”
"Mrs. Winstanley shrugged her shoulders. “In either case, you will come"
"to your senses, I hope. Meanwhile, considering the present relations, it"
might be pleasanter not to meet at dinner to-night.”
"“I am sorry to have to agree with you, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
must have an army in here. Ned was coaxed away by a fake note; Jimmie
"went to find Ned and got lost himself, and we go out to answer a call"
for help and get mixed up with a lot of half-breeds. I guess we’ll have
to take a company of state troops with us next time we go camping.”
"“Well, let’s be moving,” urged Frank. “Those fellows’ heads will be just"
sore enough when they quit rolling to shoot at anything in sight. They’d
string us up if they caught us now.”
"In accordance with this reasoning, the boys turned south in the thicket"
"then shifted to the east, then whirled back in a northerly direction. At"
one time they heard the shouts of the half-breeds on the slope far away
to the south.
"“They think we kept right on south,” laughed Jack. “Now,” he went on,"
"“we’ll walk north a long ways, climb the slope to the snow line, and"
come out on the camp from above. How’s that strike you boys?”
"“It listens good to me,” Frank answered. “Do you suppose Ned is back"
there yet?” he continued.
"“It struck me,” Jack replied, “that the half-breeds we encountered were"
out looking for Ned or Jimmie.”
"“You’ll have to guess again,” Harry put in. “The ginks we encountered"
were stationed there to catch any Boy Scout who came in answer to that
signal. That’s some more of the work of that crooked messenger.”
"“Well, I hope the bears won’t devour Gilroy while we’re gone,” Frank"
suggested. “It’s likely to be night before we get back.”
"The boys walked for a long distance, and it was three o’clock by their"
"""Oh, there's nothing in it,"" said the watchmaker reassuringly. He had"
not a letter in his pocket.
"The doorkeeper opened his mouth to speak, but seeing his wife"
"approaching, he shut it again and busied himself with his meal."
"""What was the letter, Ned?"""
"""Oh, about the procession,"" he answered."
"""Then you got it too late. Who was it from?"""
"""If you'd give us the tea,"" he broke out roughly, ""and let the damned"
"letter alone, it 'ud be a deal better."""
"""La, you needn't fly out at a woman so,"" said Mrs. Evans. ""It ain't the"
"way to treat his wife, is it, mister?"""
"""Mister"" gallantly reproved his friend, but pleaded that they were both"
"weary, and weary legs made short tempers. Giving them the tea, she left"
them to themselves; her work was not finished till three small children
were safely in bed.
The sensation of having one's neck for the first time within measurable
"distance of a rope must needs be somewhat disquieting. The doorkeeper,"
"in spite of his secret society doings, was a timid man, with a vastly"
"respectful fear of the law. To talk about things, to vapour idly about"
"them over the cups, is very different from being actually, even though"
"remotely, mixed up in them. Ned Evans was a man of some education: he"
"read the papers, accounts of crimes and reports of trials; he had heard"
of accessories after and before the fact. Was he not an accessory after
"the fact? He fancied they did not hang such; but if they caught him, and"

CHAPTER VI.
HOW TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE EFFECT OF THE STORY.
WE are now coming to the most important part of the question of
"Story-Telling, to which all the foregoing remarks have been gradually"
"leading, and that is the Effects of these stories upon the child, apart"
"from the dramatic joy he experiences in listening to them, which would"
"in itself be quite enough to justify us in the telling. But, since I"
have urged upon teachers the extreme importance of giving so much time
to the manner of telling and of bestowing so much care on the selection
"of the material, it is right that they should expect some permanent"
"results, or else those who are not satisfied with the mere enjoyment of"
the children will seek other methods of appeal--and it is to them that
I most specially dedicate this chapter.
"I think we are on the threshold of the re-discovery of an old truth,"
"that the Dramatic Presentation is the quickest and surest, because"
it is the only one with which memory plays no tricks. If a thing has
nature; nowadays we who have nerves all upset and brains probably upset
"too, form deceptive reflections. And so, that time in Paris, sick and"
"shut in, I was happy; and here, sound and strong, when toward nightfall,"
"I look at the splendid skies, the palaces, the yellow walls that take an"
"extraordinary tone, I feel that I am one of the most miserable men on"
the planet....”
_ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON_
His lack of tranquillity led Cæsar to make absurd resolutions which he
didn’t carry out.
"One Sunday in the beginning of April, he went out into the street,"
"disposed to take a walk outside of Rome, following the road anywhere it"
"led. A hard, fine rain was falling, the sky was grey, the air mild, the"
"streets were full of puddles, the shops closed; a few flower merchants"
were offering branches of almond in blossom.
Cæsar was very depressed. He went into a church to get out of the rain.
The church was full; there were many people in the centre of it; he
didn’t know what they were doing. Doubtless they were gathered there for
"some reason, although Cæsar didn’t understand what. Cæsar sat down on"
"a bench, worn out; he would have liked to listen to organ music, to a"
boy choir. No ideas occurred to him but sentimental ones. Some time
"passed, and a priest began to preach. Cæsar got up and went into the"
street.
"“I must get rid of these miserable impressions, get back to noble ideas."
I must fight this sentimental leprosy.”
I'm afraid the door of this little paradise might be shut to me after--
"Let's say this is my one hour--the hour that gave me--that kiss I want."""
"""Go long! You go to grass!"" returned the Girl with a nervous little"
laugh.
"Johnson made one more effort and won out; that is, he succeeded, at"
"last, in getting her in his grasp."
"""Listen,"" said the determined lover, pleading for a kiss as he would"
have pleaded for his very life.
"It was at this juncture that Wowkle, silently, stealthily, emerged from"
the cupboard and made her way over to the door. Her feet were heavily
moccasined and she was blanketed in a stout blanket of gay colouring.
"""Ugh--some snow!"" she muttered, as a gust of wind beat against her face"
"and drove great snow-flakes into the room, fairly taking her breath"
"away. But her words fell on deaf ears. For, oblivious to the storm that"
"was now raging outside, the youthful pair of lovers continued to"
concentrate their thoughts upon the storm that was raging within their
"own breasts, the Girl keeping up the struggle with herself, while the"
man urged her on as only he knew how.
"""Why, if I let you take one you'd take two,"" denied the Girl,"
"half-yielding by her very words, if she but knew it."
"""No, I wouldn't--I swear I wouldn't,"" promised the man with great"
earnestness.
"""Ugh--very bad!"" was the Indian woman's muffled ejaculation as she"
peered out into the night. But she had promised her lover to come to him
There was nothing more to be done till day-break. They had played their
"last card, and now they must wait to see what cards were out against"
"them, and who should win the final trick at the hour of sunrise."
"Rollo fell asleep again. And so soundly this time, that he only woke to"
consciousness when a soldier in a white _boina_ pulled roughly at his
"elbow, and ordered him to get up."
"All about the granary the Carlists were stamping feet, pulling on boots,"
and flapping arms.
"""It's a cold morning to be shot in,"" said the man, with rough"
"kindliness; ""but I will get you some hot chocolate in a moment. That"

"And Rollo Blair, with a slight singing in his ears, and a chill"
"emptiness about the pit of his stomach, stood on his feet critically"
rolling a cigarette in a leaf of Etienne's Alcoy paper.
"John Mortimer said nothing, but looked after the man who had gone for"

by indulgence in this particular chocolate would in all probability not

Appendix Q.
"1. ""The five writers to whose genius we owe the first attempt at"
"comprehensive views of history were Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, Voltaire,"
"Hume, and Gibbon. Of these the second was but a cold believer in"
"Christianity, if, indeed, he believed in it at all; and the other four"
"were avowed and notorious infidels.""--Buckle."
"2 ""Here, then, we have the starting-point of progress--_scepticism_...."
"All, therefore, that men want is _no hindrance_ from their political and"
religious rulers.... Until common minds doubt respecting religion they
can never receive any new scientific conclusion at variance with it--as
"Joshua and Copernicus.""--Ibid."
"3. ""The immortal work of Gibbon, of which the sagacity is, if possible,"
"equal to the learning, did find readers, but the illustrious author"
"was so cruelly reviled by men who called themselves Christians, that"
"it seemed doubtful if, after such an example, subsequent writers would"
hazard their comfort and happiness by attempting to write philosophic
history. Middleton wrote in 1750.... As long as the theological spirit
"was alive nothing could be effected.""--Ibid."
"4. ""The questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a"
hundred years ago were present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds
of years before that.... But the Church had known how to deal with
"intellectual insurgents, from Abelard in the twelfth century down to"
"Bruno and Vanini in the seventeenth. They were isolated, and for the"
"“They’re mighty good guns,” he said hesitatingly. “Seems a shame to"
throw ’em away like this.”
Bainbridge returned briefly: “I’m simply pulling the stings of this
gang.”
"He watched his man fling the weapons, one after another, into the"
"stream, and then, sending the automatic splashing after the others, he"
turned suddenly back to the six humiliated individuals before him.
"“Go!” he commanded, with a momentary flare of passion. “Beat it, and"
don’t let me set eyes on you again--understand? I won’t be so easy on
"you the next time. Here, take that scum with you. He’s only stunned.”"
"He waited, staring from under lowered lids, until the gang had"
"disappeared in the bushes, half dragging, half carrying their stunned"
"leader with them. Then, with a long sigh, he turned slowly and smiled at"
Peters.
"“All right, Jack,” he said quietly. “I don’t think we’ll have any more"
trouble here. Just hustle all you can to make up for this delay.”
"Peters grinned, and snapped out some orders to the men which sent them"
flying along the bank and even out on the stream over the tumbling logs.
"But as they went they cast glances of open, unadulterated admiration at"
"the young man coolly brushing a bit of mud from one shoulder, and their"
comments to each other left no trace of doubt of their thorough approval
of everything he had said and done.
"Bob heard some of them, and when the men had gone on he smiled a bit. To"
get that drive down successfully he knew he must have the men with him.
"""You cannot?  Why?""  I demanded, taken somewhat aback by her sudden"
attitude of determination.
"""I will not allow you to ruin yourself, Gerald, on my account,"" she"
declared in a very low but calm voice.
"""But why should my love for you prove my ruin?""  I cried madly.  ""The"
"truth is that you do not love me.  Why not admit it at once?"""
"""You are in error,"" she hastened to protest.  ""I do love you.  I love"
you to-day with the same fond affection as I entertained for you until
that day--fatal to me--when you turned your back upon me and left me.
"But, alas! we can never now be the same to one another as we were then."""
"She paused for a moment to regain breath; then, pale-faced, with eyes"
"filled with tears, she gripped my arm frantically, crying: ""Gerald, my"
"love, hear me!  These are my last words, but I pronounce them--I make"
confession--so that you may understand the barrier that now lies between
"us."""
"""Well,"" I said, ""speak--tell me!"""
"""Ah!"" she cried hoarsely, covering her face with her hands, ""you wring"
this confession from me.  I am the most unhappy girl in all the world.
"Would that I were dead that it was all ended!  If I did not love you,"
"Gerald, I should deceive you, and leave you to discover the truth after"
our marriage.  But I cannot--I cannot!  Even though we shall part to-day
"for ever, I have resolved to be frank with you because I still have one"
"single spark of honesty left within my heart!"""
"""I don't understand,"" I exclaimed.  ""Tell me."""
"""Then listen,"" she said in a hard, unnatural voice, after a few moments"
"""The depth ... seventy-three feet."""
"""What?  Have you guessed, you shaved ugly face?"""
"""Of course, Aristid Fomich!  If you have eyes you can see a thing or"
"two,"" shouted Vaviloff, joyfully."
"A few minutes afterwards they sat side by side in Vaviloff's parlour,"
and the Captain was engaged in drinking large quantities of beer.
"""And so all the walls of the factory stand on your ground,"" said he to"
"the eating-house keeper.  ""Now, mind you show no mercy! The teacher"
"will be here presently, and we will get him to draw up a petition to"
the court.  As to the amount of the damages you will name a very
"moderate sum in order not to waste money in deed stamps, but we will"
"ask to have the factory knocked down.  This, you see, donkey, is the"
result of trespassing on other people's property.  It is a splendid
"piece of luck for you. We will force him to have the place smashed, and"
I can tell you it will be an expensive job for him.  Off with you to
the court.  Bring pressure to bear on Judas.  We will calculate how
much it will take to break the factory down to its very foundations.
"We will make an estimate of it all, counting the time it will take too,"
"and we will make honest Judas pay two thousand roubles besides."""
"""He will never give it!"" cried Vaviloff, but his eyes shone with a"
greedy light.
"""You lie!  He will give it ...  Use your brains... What else can he do?"
"But look here, Egorka, mind you don't go in for doing it on the cheap."
They are sure to try to buy you off.  Don't sell yourself cheap.  They
"will probably use threats, but rely upon us..."""
"""What! Is that you, Mr. Dawson? Yes, Copplestone is here. The"
"_Antigone_? What about her? She is a sister ship of the _Antinous_,"
"and was in with damage to her forefoot, which had been ripped up when"
"she ran down that big German submarine north of the Orkneys--Yes, I"
know; she was due to go out some time to-day. What do you say? Wires
"cut? Whose wires have been cut? The _Antigone's?_ Oh, the devil! Yes,"
we will both come down to your office this afternoon. Whenever you

"Cary hung up the receiver and glared at me. ""It has happened again,"""
"he groaned. ""The _Antigone_ this time. She has been in dry dock for"
the past fortnight and was floated out yesterday. Her full complement
joined her last night. Dawson says that he was called up at
eight-o'clock by the news that her gun-wires have been cut exactly
like those of the _Antinous_ and in the same incomprehensible way. He
"seems, curiously enough, to be quite cheerful about it."""
"""He has had a few hours sleep. And, besides, he sees that this second"
"case, so exactly like the first, makes the solution of his problem"
"very much more easy. I am glad that he is cheerful, for I feel"
exuberantly happy myself. I was kept awake half the night by a
persistent notion which seemed the more idiotic the more I thought all
"round it. But now--now, there may be something in it."""
"""What is your idea? Tell me quick."""
"""No, thank you, Dr. Watson. We amateur masters of intuition don't work"
our thrilling effects in that way. We keep our notions to ourselves
"until they turn out to be right, and then we declare that we saw"

"nothing. So you observe, Cary, that whatever happens our reputations"

There was a double knock on the door and the Captain walked in without
waiting for an invitation. He was still holding Butt's blaster. He
"pointed it at me. ""Get your hands up, Ferdinand Sparling,"" he said."
I did.

alone would have saved the situation--he planted a carefully cut cigar
"between the parted lips aforesaid, and deliberately struck a match."
"“Your idea, John,” said Lady Blount, aware of victory, “is preposterous."
What would Stella do without you?”
"“Yes,” said Sir Oliver, after lighting his cigar; “Stella has to be"
considered before everything.”
Risca frowned on the unblushing turncoat. Stella! Stella! Everything
"was Stella. Here were three ordinary, sane, grown-up people seriously"
putting forward the proposition that he had no right to go and mend his
own broken life in his own fashion because he happened to be the favored
playmate of a little invalid girl!
"On the one side was the driving force of Furies of a myriad hell-power,"
and on the other the disappointment of Stella Blount. It was ludicrous.
"Even Walter Herold, who had a sense of humour, did not see the grotesque"
incongruity. Risca frowned upon each in turn--upon three serene faces
smilingly aware of the absurd. Was it worth while trying to convince
them?
"“Our dear friends are quite right, John,” said Herold. “What would"
become of Stella if you went away?”
"“None of you seems to consider what would happen to me if I stayed,”"
"said John, in the quiet tone of a man who is talking to charming but"
"unreasonable children. “It will go to my heart to leave Stella, more"
"than any of you can realize; but to Australia I go, and there's an end"
of it.”
CHAPTER XX.
THE LAW _VERSUS_ RULE 3.
Among the many tired but satisfied lovers of liberty who sought their
"houses that night, while an enthusiastic remnant was still parading the"
"streets, illuminations yet shining from windows, and weary police"
"treading their unending beats, was the doorkeeper, who had borne a"
banner in Company A of Procession 1. His friend the watchmaker came with
"him, to have a bit of supper and exchange congratulations and"
"fulminations. Hardly, however, had the doorkeeper pledged the cause in a"
first draught when his wife broke in on his oration by handing him a
"letter, which she said a boy in a blue jersey had left for him about ten"
"o'clock in the morning, just after he had started to join his company."
The envelope was cheap and coarse; there was no direction outside. The
doorkeeper opened it. It was addressed to no named person and it bore no
"signature. It was very brief, being confined to these simple words--""You"
"did not see me last night. Remember Rule 3."""
"The doorkeeper laid the letter down, with a hurried glance at his"
"friend, whose face was buried in a mug. He knew the handwriting; he knew"
"who it was that he had not seen; he remembered Rule 3, the rule that"
"said--""The only and inevitable penalty of treachery is death."" He turned"
white and took a hasty gulp at his liquor.
"""Who brought this?"" he asked."
"""I told you,"" answered his wife; ""a lad in a blue jersey; he looked as"
"if he might be from the harbour."" She put food before them, adding as"
"dairy--I have a kitchen. Milk the goats here, I command you, nowhere but"
"here!"""
"And thrusting the bucket into the old woman's hand, she watched"
carefully and eagerly as La Giralda pressed the milk downwards in
hissing streams. The she-goat operated upon expressed her gratitude by
turning to lick the hand which relieved her.
At this the little girl danced with delight.
"""It looks so easy--I could do it myself! I am sure of it. I tell you,"
"Susana, I will do it. Stand still, _cabra_! Do you not know that I am"
"Isabel the Second, Queen of all the Spains!"""
"But the she-goat, having no very strong monarchial sentiments, or"
"perhaps being inclined to Carlist opinions, as soon as she felt the grip"
of unaccustomed fingers promptly kicked over in the dust the Queen of
all the Spains.
The little girl had not time to gather herself up or even to emit the
"howl of disappointment and anger which hovered upon her lips, before her"
attendant rushed at her with pitiful cries:
"""Oh, the wicked goat! The devil-possessed emblem of Satan! Let it be"
slain! Did not your poor Susana warn you to have nothing to do with such
"evil things--thus to overturn in the dust the best, the sweetest, the"
"noblest of Princesses!"""
"But the best and sweetest of Princesses, having violent objections to"
"being gathered up into the capacious embrace of her nurse, especially"
"before company, vigorously objected in much the same manner as the goat"
"had done, and at last compelled Doña Susana to deposit her once more on"
"""Nehal--turn back! Turn back!"""
He did not understand her. He thought she was still pleading with him.
"""I can not--God have pity on us both!"""
Then she too set her lips. She could not betray the last hope of that
heroic handful of men and women behind her. He must go to his
"death--and she to hers. She fired,--whether with success or not, she"
never knew. In that same instant another sound broke upon their
"ears--the sound of distant firing, the rattle of drums and the high"
clear call of a trumpet. Nehal Singh swung around. She caught a
"glimpse of his face through the smoke, and she saw something written"
there which she could not understand. She only knew that his features
"seemed to bear a new familiarity, as though a mask had been torn from"
"them, revealing the face of another man, of a man whom she had seen"
"before, when and where she could not tell. She had no time to analyze"
her emotions nor the sense of violent shock which passed over her. She
"heard Nehal Singh giving sharp, rapid orders in Hindustani. The room"
emptied. She saw him follow the retreating natives. At the door he
turned and looked back at her. At no time had his love for her
revealed itself more clearly than in that last glance.
"""The English regiment has come to help you,"" he said. ""Fate has"
"intervened between us this time. May we never meet again!"""
"He passed out through the shattered doorway, but she stood where he"
"had left her, motionless, almost unconscious. It was thus Nicholson"
"and the Colonel found her when, a moment later, they entered the room"
by the verandah. Colonel Carmichael's passionate reproaches died away
as he saw her face.
"his side, with relaxed, enormous limbs, on the hearth-rug, lifted his"
"massive head for a second and glanced at John. Then with a half-grunt,"
"half-sigh, he dropped his head, and twitched his limbs and went to sleep"
again.
"“Now and then when you 're not looking at me,” said Stellamaris, “there"
is a strange look in your eyes: it is when you 're not speaking and you
stare out of window without seeming to see anything.”
For a moment Risca was assailed by a temptation to break the Unwritten
"Law and tell her something of his misery. She, with her superfine"
"intelligence, would understand, and her sympathy would be sweet. But he"
put the temptation roughly from him.
"“I am the happiest fellow in the world, Stellamaris,” said he."
“It would be difficult not to be happy in such a world.”
She pointed out to sea. The blustering wind of the day before had
"fallen, and a light breeze shook the tips of the waves to the"
"morning sunshine, which turned them into diamonds. The sails of the"
fishing-fleet of the tiny port flashed merrily against the kindly blue.
On the horizon a great steamer was visible steaming up Channel. The
salt air came in through the open windows. The laughter of fishermen's
children rose faintly from the beach far below.
"“And there's spring, too, dancing over everything,” she said. “Don't you"
feel it?”
"He acknowledged the vernal influence, and, careful lest his eyes should"
"betray him, talked of the many things she loved. He had not seen her for"
"a fortnight, so there were the apocryphal doings of Lilias and Niphetos"
"In less than a week Cæsar remained alone, knowing nobody in the hotel,"
and despite his believing that he was going to be perfectly indifferent
"about this, he felt deserted and sad. The influence of the springtime"
"also affected him. The deep blue sky, cloudless, dense, dark, made him"
"languish. Instead of entertaining himself with something or other, he"
did scarcely anything all day long but walk.
_TWO ABSURD MEN_
"“I have continually near me in the hotel,” wrote Cæsar to Alzugaray,"
“two absurd fellows: one is one of those stout red Germans with a square
"head; the other a fine slim Norwegian. The German, who is a captain in"
"some service or other, is a restless man, always busy about what the"
"devil I don’t know. He is constantly carrying about trunks and boxes,"
"with the aid of a sorrowful valet, dressed in black, who appears to"
detest his position. The captain must devote the morning to doing
"gymnastics, for I hear him from my room, which is next to his, jumping"
"and dropping weights on the floor, each of which must weigh half a ton,"
to judge by the noise they make.
"“He does all this to vocal commands, and when some feat doesn’t go right"
he reprimands himself.
"“This German isn’t still a moment; he opens the salon door, crosses the"
"room, stands at the window, takes up a paper, puts it down. He is a type"
that makes me nervous.
"“The Norwegian at first appeared to be a reasonable man, somewhat"
In practical agriculture my father was among Indians one of the first to
"start a tea industry in Assam, now regarded as one of the most"
flourishing. He gave practically everything in the starting of some
Weaving Mills. He stood by this and many other efforts in industrial
developments. The success of which I spoke did not come till long
after--too late for him to see it. He had come before the country was
"ready, and it happened to him as it must happen to all pioneers. Every"
one of his efforts failed and the crash came. And a great burden fell on
us which was only lifted by our united effects just before his work here
was over.
A failure? Yes but not ignoble or altogether futile. Since it was
through the witnessing of this struggle that the son learned to look on
"success or failure as one, to realise that some defeat was greater than"
"victory. And if my life in any way proved to be fruitful, then that came"
through the realisation of this lesson.
To me his life had been one of blessing and daily thanksgiving.
Nevertheless every one had said that he wrecked his life which was meant
for far greater things. Few realise that out of the skeletons of myriad
lives have been built vast continents. And it is on the wreck of a life
like his and of many such lives there will be built the Greater India
"yet to be. We do not know why it should be so, but we do know that the"
Earth Mother is hungry for sacrifice.
QUEST OF TRUTH AND DUTY
"Sir Jagadis Chandra Bose delivered the following Address, on the 25th"
and the framed photographs on the walls and the array of grease paints
on the dressing-table. John walked up and down the narrow space in great
perplexity of mind. Herold was right. He could not introduce Unity Blake
"into lodgings, saying that he had adopted her. Landladies would not"
"stand it. Even if they would, what in the world could he do with her?"
Could he move into a house or a flat and persuade a registry-office
to provide him with a paragon of a housekeeper? That would be more
"practicable. But, even then, what did he know of the training, moral and"
"spiritual, necessary for a girl of fifteen? He was not going to employ"
her as a servant. On that he was decided. What sort of a position she
"should have he did not know; but her floor-scrubbing, dish-scraping days"
were over. She should have ease of life and loving care--his own phrase
stuck in his head--especially loving care; and he was the only person in
the world who could see that she got it. She must live under his roof.
That was indisputable. But how? In lodgings or a flat? He went angrily
round and round the vicious circle.
"When Herold returned, he dragged him round and round, too, until Perkins"
appeared to help him to change for the third act. Then John had to stop.
He clapped on his hat. He must go and work.
“And you have n't a single suggestion to make?” he asked.
"“I have one,” said Herold, fastening his shirt-studs while Perkins was"
buttoning his boots. “But it's so commonplace and unromantic that you 'd
wreck the dressing-room if I made it.”
"“Well, what is it?” He stood, his hand on the door-knob."
"“You 've got a maiden aunt somewhere, have n't you?”"
"“Oh, don't talk rot!” said John. “I'm dead serious.”"
"faculty for absorbing butter. The stomachs of most men, really good at"
"their business, would have revolted at the diet which his superiors"
"shovelled into Dawson, but he visibly expanded and blossomed. Yes,"
"Scotland Yard knew its Dawson, and exactly how to stimulate the best"
that was in him. He never bored me; I enjoyed him too thoroughly.
One day in my club I chanced upon the Admiral.
"""Have you met our friend Dawson lately?"" I asked."
"""Met him?"" shouted he, with a roar of laughter. ""Met him? He is in my"
office every day--he almost lives with me; goodness knows when he does
his work. He has a pocket full of letters which he has read to me till
I know them by heart. If I did not know that he was a first-class man
"I should set him down as a colossal ass. Yet, I rather wish that the"
Admiralty would sometimes write to me as the severe but very human
"Scotland Yard does to Dawson."""
"""Does he ever come to you in disguise?"" I asked."
"""Not that I know of. I see vast numbers of people; some of them may be"
"Dawson in his various incarnations, but he has not given himself"
"away."""
"Then I explained to my naval friend my own experience. ""He tried,"" I"
"said, ""to play the disguise game on me, and clean bowled me the first"
time. While he was laughing over my discomfiture I studied his face
more closely than a lover does that of his mistress. I tried to
penetrate his methods. He never wears a wig or false hair; he is too
wise for that folly. Yet he seems able to change his hair from light
"to dark, to make it lank or curly, short or long. He does it; how I"
"don't know. He alters the shape of his nose, his cheeks, and his chin."
you to find what you want by looking for it. You ought to leave it a
little to chance.”
"“Abandon myself to events as they arrive? All right, it seems a good"
idea.”
"“Then if you find something practicable, utilize it.”"
Kennedy took his friend to a statue-shop where he used to pass some of
"his hours. The shop was in a lane near the Forum, and its stock was in"
"antiques, majolicas, and plaster casts of pagan gods."
"The shop was dark and rather gloomy, with a small court at the back"
"covered with vines. The proprietor was an old man, with a moustache,"
"an imperial, and a shock of white hair. His name was Giovanni Battista"
Lanza. He professed revolutionary ideas and had great enthusiasm about
Mazzini. He expressed himself in an ironical and malicious manner.
"Signora Vittoria, his wife, was a grumbling old woman, rather devoted to"
"wine. She spoke like a Roman of the lowest class, was olive-coloured and"
"wrinkled, and of her former beauty there remained only her very black"
eyes and hair that was still black.
"The daughter, Simonetta, a girl who resembled her father, blond, with"
"the build of a goddess, was the one that waited on customers and kept"
the accounts.
"Simonetta, being the manager, divided up the profits; the elder son was"
head of the workshop and he made the most money; then came two workmen
"from outside; and then the father who still got his day’s wages, out"
"of consideration for his age; and finally the younger son, twelve or"
"fourteen years old, who was an apprentice."
"these three stalwarts, the car--a source of the utmost excitement"
"and wonderment to them--Allan, Allah-dad and my weary self were, ere"
"long, safe in the rest-house of the small mud fort at Saindak."
"The following morning, after a good night's rest, I had a long talk"
"with Idu, and the very favourable impression I had formed of the man"
the night before was greatly increased. I found him by daylight to be
"a highly intelligent-looking, splendidly proportioned fellow of about"
"five feet eight, with a big black beard. I had glimpses, even then,"
of the keen sense of humour which was to do so much to lighten the
difficulties of the ensuing campaign. Never once in all the months to
come did I find his wit and humour fail.
"As after-events proved he was absolutely invaluable. In fact, I often"
"called him, and told him that I called him, my ""head."" Not only did"
"he know every yard of the country, but he knew by name practically"
"every one of the Raiders, knew their peculiarities and their weak"
"points as well as their strength. Idu was a man in a million, and I"
"should like to think that, some day, this public appreciation of him,"
"and of what he did to help in this campaign, may reach him."
"After breakfast and my talk with Idu, we set out on the last march of"
"the first phase of my journey, and reached Robat by two o'clock in"
the afternoon.
CHAPTER III
A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
"So we remained till, at last, about two a.m., I caught sight of a"
"light on a small hill not very far away in the west, and, on going"
"over to it, found a sort of recluse, or holy man, quietly cooking his"
food. After the usual courtesies I asked him to come and help me to
pull my car out. He replied that he was an old man and could not do
"much by himself, but that a caravan of nomads, who had arrived the"
"evening before, were encamped close by. So off I went again, flushed"
"my ""quarry"", and, with the help of large bribes, persuaded all the"
able-bodied men to come back to the car. Fortunately we carried a
"good strong rope as part of our kit, so soon had the car out and"
running again.
Allan was never again ordered to drive through water on that route.
[Illustration: IN DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN NASARATABAD AND ROBAT.]
"On the second day our troubles recommenced, for we had barely done"
"a dozen miles than we stuck in another sand-hill, and the laborious"
"digging-out process had to be done all over again. Fortunately, the"
party who had got the car out of the lake the night before were close
"behind, and for an obvious reason. They had been given so many rupees"
"for their timely help that, knowing the difficulties lying ahead,"
they had followed in the hope of further largesse. They got it.
"Once safely out again I made a tour of inspection round the car, but"
only to find more trouble.
"""Hullo, what on earth is this, Allan? She's leaking!"""
"Allan smiled a superior smile. ""I don't think so, sir. My cars don't"
"leak."""
Once again I am at an age when I walk in the moonlight. Thirty years ago I
"walked in the moonlight, too, walked on crackling, snowy roads, on bare,"
"frozen ground, round unlocked barns, on the hunt for love. How well I"
remember it! But it is no longer the same moonlight. I could even read by
it the letter she gave me. But there are no such letters any more.
"Everything is changed. The tale is told, and tonight I walk abroad on an"
"errand of the head, not of the heart: I shall go across to the trading"
center and dispatch a knapsack by the steamer; after that I shall wander
"on. And that requires nothing but a little ordinary training in walking,"
"and the light of the moon to see by. But in those old days, those young"
"days, we studied the almanac in the autumn to find out if there would be a"
"moon on Twelfth Night, for we could use it then."
Everything is changed; I am changed. The tale lies within the teller.
They say that old age has other pleasures which youth has not: deeper
"pleasures, more lasting pleasures. That is a lie. Yes, you have read"
"right: that is a lie. Only old age itself says this, in a self-interest"
that flaunts its very rags. The old man has forgotten when he stood on the
"summit, forgotten his own self, his own _alias_, red and white,"
"blowing a golden horn. Now he stands no longer--no, he sits--it is less of"
"a strain to sit. But now there comes to him, slow and halting, fat and"
"stupid, the honor of old age. What can a sitting man do with honor? A man"
on his feet can use it; to a sitting man it is only a possession. But
"honor is meant to be used, not to be sat with."
Let sitting men wear warm stockings.

"as all besieged cities are, of rumours of spies and treachery, and of"
"reported overtures made now to the city behind the back of the army,"
"and now to the army to betray the city. A single word of denunciation,"
and Tzerclas' life would not be worth three minutes' purchase--a rope
and the nearest butcher's hook would end it. My mind was made up to
say the word.
I suppose I had been going about in this state of vigilance three days
"or more, when something, but not the thing I sought, rewarded it. At"
the time I was on my way back from morning drill. It was a little
"after eight, and the streets and the people wore an air bright, yet"
"haggard. Night, with its perils, was over; day, with its privations,"
"lay before us. My mind was on the common fortunes, but I suppose my"
"eyes were mechanically doing their work, for on a sudden I saw"
"something at a window, took perhaps half a step, and stopped as if I"
had been shot.
"I had seen Marie's face! Nay, I still saw it, while a man might count"
two. Then it was gone. And I stood gasping.
"I suppose I stood so for half a minute, waiting, with the blood racing"
"from my heart to my head, and every pulse in my body beating. But she"
did not reappear. The door of the house did not open. Nothing
happened.
Yet I had certainly seen her; for I remembered particulars--the
"expression of her face, the surprise that had leapt into her eyes as"
"they met mine, the opening of the lips in an exclamation."
And still I stood gazing at the window and nothing happened.
"At last I came to myself, and I scanned the house. It was a large"
Suddenly a cart would come down one of these narrow streets without
"sidewalks, driving very quickly and scattering the women and children"
seated by the gutter.
In all these poor quarters there were lanes crossed by ropes loaded with
torn washing; there were wretched black shops from which an odour of
grease exhaled; there were narrow streets with mounds of garbage in the
"middle. In the very palaces, now shorn of their grandeur, appeared"
the same decoration of rags waving in the breeze. In the Theatre of
"Marcellus one’s gaze got lost in the depths of black caves, where smiths"
stood out against flames.
"This mixture of sumptuousness and squalor, of beauty and ugliness, was"
reflected in the people; young and most beautiful women were side by
"side with fat, filthy old ones covered with rags, their eyes gloomy, and"
of a type that recalled old African Jewesses.
_WHAT CAN BE READ ON WALLS_
Cæsar and Kennedy went on toward the Temple of Vesta and followed the
river bank until the Tiber Embankment ended.
Here the banks were green and the river clearer and more poetic. To the
left rose the Aventine with its villas; in the harbour two or three tugs
were tied up; and here and there along the pier stood a crane. Evening
was falling and the sky was filling with pink clouds.
"They sat down awhile on the side of the road, and Cæsar entertained"
himself deciphering the inscriptions written in charcoal on a mud-wall.
"""Oh, no, we shan't,"" I remarked calmly, for I had moved to a position"
"of tactical advantage on the Marine's port beam. ""We will have the"
"story here, if you don't mind, Dawson."""
"He stamped pettishly on the floor, whipped off his cap, and spun it"
"across the room. ""Confound you, Mr. Copplestone!"" he growled. ""How"
"the--how the--do you do it?"" He could not think of an expletive mild"
"enough for Mrs. Cary's ears. ""There's something about me that I can't"
"hide. What is it? If you don't tell, I will get you on the Regulation"
compelling all British subjects to answer questions addressed to them
"by a competent naval or military authority."""
"""You don't happen to be either, Dawson,"" said I unkindly. ""And,"
"beside, there was never yet a law made which could compel a man to"
"speak or a woman to hold her tongue. Some day perhaps, if you are"
"good, I will show you how the trick is done. But not yet. I want to"
have something to bargain with when you cast me into jail. Out with
"the story; we are impatient. If I mistake not, you come to us Dawson"
"triumphant. You haven't the air of a broken man."""
"""I have been successful,"" he answered gravely, ""but I am a long, long"
"way from feeling triumphant. No, thank you, Mrs. Cary, I have had my"
"breakfast, but if I might trouble you for a cup of coffee? Many"
"thanks."""
"Dawson sat down, and Cary moved about inspecting him from every angle."
"""No,"" declared he at last, ""I cannot see the smallest resemblance, not"
the smallest. You were thin; now you are distinctly plump. Your hair
was nearly white. Your cheeks had fallen in as if your back teeth were
"missing. Your lower lip stuck out."" Dawson smiled, highly gratified."
"""I took in all my people at the office this morning,"" he said. ""They"
logical.”
"“Yes, certainly. And the effort to learn about useful things seems"
"natural and logical to me too, but not to learn about merely agreeable"
things. To learn medicine and mechanics is logical; but to learn to look
at a picture or to hear a symphony is an absurdity.”
“Why?”
“At any rate the neophytes that go to see a Rafael picture or to hear
"a Bach sonata and have an exclamation all ready, give me the sad"
impression of a flock of lambs. As for your sublime pedagogues of the
"Ruskin type, they seem to me to be the fine flower of priggishness, of"
"pedantry, of the most objectionable bourgeoisie.”"
“What things your brother is saying!” exclaimed Kennedy.
"“You shouldn’t notice him,” said Laura."
“Those artistic pedagogues enrage me; they remind me of Protestant
"pastors and of the friars that go around dressed like peasants, and who"
I think are called Brothers of the Christian Doctrine. The pedagogues
"are Brothers of the Esthetic Doctrine, one of the stupidest inventions"
that ever occurred to the English. I don’t know which I find more
"ridiculous, the Salvation Army or Ruskin’s books.”"
“Why have you this hatred for Ruskin?”
“I find him an idiot. I only skimmed through a book of his called _The
"Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and the first thing I read was a paragraph"
in which he said that to use an imitation diamond or any other imitation
"stone was a lie, an imposition, and a sin. I immediately said: ‘This man"
"Almost unconsciously Rollo put it to his lips. It was a cold morning,"
and it is small wonder that his hand shook a little. He was just
"twenty-three, and his main regret was that he had not kissed little"
"Concha Cabezos--with her will, or against it--all would have been one"
now. Meantime he looked about him for a light. The general noticed his
"hesitation, rose from the table, and with a low bow offered his own, as"
one gentleman to another. Rollo thanked him. The two men approached as
"if to embrace. Each drew a puff of his cigarette, till the points glowed"
"red. Rollo, retreating a little, swept a proud acknowledgment of thanks"
with his _sombrero_. Cabrera bowed with his hand on his heart. The young
"Scot clicked his heels together as if on parade, and strode out with"
head erect and squared shoulders in the rear of his companions.
"""By God's bread, a man!"" said Cabrera, as he resumed his writing, ""'tis"
"a thousand pities I must shoot him!"""
"They stood all four of them in the garden of the mill-house, underneath"
the fig trees in whose shade El Sarria had once hidden himself to watch
the midnight operations of Don Tomas.
"The sun was just rising. His beams red, low, and level shot across the"
"mill-wheel, turning the water of the unused overshot into a myriad"
pearls and diamonds as it splashed through a side culvert into the
"gorge beneath, in which the gloom of night lingered."
"The four men still stood in order. Mortimer and Etienne in the middle,"
with slim Rollo and the giant Ramon towering on either flank.
"""_Load with ball--at six paces--make ready!_"""
"The officer's commands rang out with a certain haste, for he could"
and was smitten in turn by the beak of Francesco's shield.
"Again Francesco rushed Raniero to the wall, leaped back and got in his"
"blow. Raniero's face was a red blur. He dropped his shield, put both"
"his hands to his sword and swung great blows at Francesco, with the"
huge rage of a desperate and tiring man. Francesco led him up and down
"the hall. Raniero's breath came in gasps, and his strength began to"
wane.
"Francesco bided his chance and seized it. He ran in, after Raniero had"
"missed him with one of his savage sweeping blows, and rushed him"
"against the wall. Then he struck and struck again, without uttering a"
"word, playing so fast upon Raniero that he had his man smothered,"
blundering and dazed. The end came with a blow that cut the crown of
"Raniero's helmet. He threw up his hands with a spasmodic gesture,"
"lurched forward, fell, rolled over on his back and lay still."
"For a moment Francesco stood over him, the point of his sword on"
Raniero's throat. He seemed to waver; then all the misery the
Frangipani had inflicted on Ilaria rushed over him as in a blinding
cloud.
"His sword went home. A strange cry passed through the hall, then all"
was still. The torch spluttered once more and went out. Francesco was
in the darkness beside the dead body of Raniero.--
Meanwhile the Pisans had succeeded in scaling the walls. The clamor of
"the fight grew less and less, as one by one the defenders of Astura"
were relentlessly struck down and hurled over the ramparts. The storm
"had increased in violence, the heavens were cataracts of fire.--"
In the blood-drenched court the duke and the Pisan admiral shook
and I can’t for the life of me see an earthly way of scraping the
money together. Last of all--and worst of all--I haven’t been able to
make a single sale of lumber for the simple reason that the trust has
cut prices below cost and has taken every customer from us. If I cut
to meet them they go lower. You can see that. They’ve got the stock
"and the resources. Crane’s set out to ruin us at any cost, and he’s"
"succeeded. It hurts like sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left"
to do but give in and make the best terms we can. Let me hear from you
"at once. Yours ever, John Tweedy."
CHAPTER XI. NO QUITTER
"The letter dropped into Bob’s lap, and for a long minute he sat staring"
"into the yellow, dancing flames. His face was blank, and just a little"
"white, for the blow had been a heavy one, and totally unexpected. He"
"could not seem to understand it. It was unbelievable that he and Tweedy,"
"who had been fair and square in every one of their business dealings,"
could be forced to the wall by such a monster of corruption as Elihu
Crane.
There must be some mistake. Tweedy must have been thrown into one of his
"unjustifiable panics. That was it, of course."
Bob picked up the letter to read it carefully again.
"He perused it to the last word, and then leaned back against the"
"sapling, his face drawn and somber. It really did not sound like a"
"mistake. It was all clear and logical, and singularly cohesive. It was"
the sort of thing Crane would delight in planning and putting into
execution--the cutting of prices on a competitor. Tweedy had written
"that if they attempted to cut under the trust’s present rates, there"
"already hear the clattering of the horses of the general's cavalcade,"
"and he knew that if upon his arrival he had not carried out his orders,"
he might expect a severe reprimand.
But it was not the general's suite that rode so furiously. The sound
"came from a contrary direction. Two horses were being ridden at speed,"
and at sight of the four men set in order against the wall the foremost
rider sank both spurs into her white mare and dashed forward with a wild
cry.
"The officer already had his sword raised in the air, the falling of"
which was to be the signal for the volley of death. But it did not fall.
Something in the aspect of the girl-rider as she swept up parallel with
"the low garden wall, her hair floating disordered about her"
shoulders--her eyes black and shining like stars--the sheaf of papers
"she waved in her hand, all compelled the Carlist to suspend that last"
irrevocable order.
"It was Concha Cabezos who arrived when the eleventh hour was long past,"
and leaped from her reeking horse opposite the place of execution. With
"her, wild-haired as a Mænad, rode La Giralda, cross-saddled like a man."
"""General Cabrera! Where is General Cabrera?"" cried Concha. ""I must see"
"him instantly. These are no traitors. They are true men, and in the"
"service of Don Carlos. Here are their papers!"""
"""Where is Ramon Cabrera? Tell me quickly!"" cried La Giralda. ""I have"
news for him. I was with his mother when she died. They whipped me at
the cross of Tortosa to tell what I knew--stripping me to the waist they
"whipped me, being old and the mother of many. Cabrera will avenge me."
"Let me but see Ramon Cabrera whom of old I suckled at my breasts!"""
deferentially.
"""To Grosvenor Square now--and hurry along,"" he directed the driver in a"
voice his enemy could not fail to hear. And the taxicab swung into Drury
"Lane, on its way west."
"For a few minutes he sat silent, with bent head, biting at his"
moustache. Then he looked round at Sallie.
"""That fellow takes me for another man,"" he told her querulously. ""He's"
been dogging me ever since he first saw me at Monte Carlo. You've no
"idea, Sallie, what a dangerous risk I had to run there--for your sake."""
"""You haven't told me much about--anything, Jasper,"" she reminded him."
And he proceeded to describe in lurid detail the fate which would
undoubtedly have befallen him had M. Dubois been able then to fasten on
him responsibility for the misdeeds of that criminal whom he so
unfortunately resembled.
Sallie listened in silence. She had been wondering whether M. Dubois
could be in any way concerned with her affairs. She gathered that he was
interested only in Slyne. The latter's story of grave risk run for her
"sake fell somewhat flat, since it seemed to rest on the mere possibility"
of his having been mistaken for somebody else. She could scarcely
believe that his fear of M. Dubois had no other foundation. She even
ventured to suggest that he could easily have proved the detective in
the wrong.
"""He wouldn't have paid the slightest attention to anything I could say,"""
"Slyne assured her tartly. ""He wouldn't have asked any questions or"
listened to any statement of mine. You don't know anything about the
outrages that are committed every day by fellows like that on men like
"the hospitality of the Nat by hunting near his home, came to severe"
grief.
"But the Nat has gone now, alas! The tree is still there, but the Nat has"
fled away these many years.
"'I suppose he didn't care to stay,' said the headman. 'You see that the"
"English Government officials came and camped here, and didn't fear the"
"Nats. They had fowls killed here for their dinner, and they sang and"
"shouted; and they shot the green pigeons who ate his figs, and the"
little doves that nested in his branches.'
"All these things were an abomination to the Nat, who hated loud, rough"
"talk and abuse, and to whom all life was sacred."
"So the Nat went away. The headman did not know where he was gone, but"
there are plenty of trees.
"'He has gone somewhere to get peace,' the headman said. 'Somewhere in"
"the jungle, where no one ever comes save the herd-boy and the deer, he"
"will be living in a tree, though I do not think he will easily find a"
tree so beautiful as this.'
"The headman seemed very sorry about it, and so did several villagers who"
"were with him; and I suggested that if the Nat-houses were rebuilt, and"
"flowers and water offered, the Nat might know and return. I even offered"
"to contribute myself, that it might be taken as an _amende honorable_ on"
behalf of the English Government. But they did not think this would be
"any use. No Nat would come where there was so much going and coming, so"
"little care for life, such a disregard for pity and for peace. If we"
"were to take away our rest-house, well then, perhaps, after a time,"
"something could be done, but not under present circumstances."
"""The law is on my side...  I can even demand two thousand.  I can"
insist on your pulling down the building ... and enforce it too.  That
"is why my claim is so small. I demand that you should pull it down!"""
"""Very well.  Probably we shall do so ... after three years, and after"
"having dragged you into enormous law expenses.  And then, having paid"
"up, we shall open our public-house and you will be ruined ..."
annihilated like the Swedes at Poltava.  We shall see that you are
ruined ... we will take good care of that.  We could have begun to
"arrange about a public-house now, but you see our time is valuable, and"
besides we are sorry for you.  Why should we take the bread out of your
"mouth without any reason?"""
"Egor Terentievitch looked at his guest, clenching his teeth, and felt"
"that he was master of the situation, and held his fate in his hands."
"Vaviloff was full of pity for himself at having to deal with this calm,"
cruel figure in the checked suit.
"""And being such a near neighbour you might have gained a good deal by"
"helping us, and we should have remembered it too.  Even now, for"
"instance, I should advise you to open a small shop for tobacco, you"
"know, bread, cucumbers, and so on...  All these are sure to be in great"
"demand."""
"Vaviloff listened, and being a clever man, knew that to throw himself"
upon the enemy's generosity was the better plan.  It was as well to
"begin from the beginning, and, not knowing what else to do to relieve"
"his mind, the soldier began to swear at Kuvalda."
"""Curses be upon your head, you drunken rascal!  May the Devil take you!"""
"""Do you mean the lawyer who composed your petition?"" asked Petunikoff,"
"""We must be in La Granja in two hours if we are to save a soul within"
"its walls,"" he said, ""but--we have an hour for dinner first! Therefore"
"let us dine. God knows when we shall taste food again!"""
And with this dictum John Mortimer heartily agreed.
CHAPTER XXX
PALACE BURGLARS
The startling announcement of the Sergeant at once set the whole party
"in motion. Their suspicions of the morning were cast to the winds, as"
"the Sergeant and La Giralda in turn related their adventures. Concha,"
"having formerly vouched so strongly for the old gipsy woman, now nodded"
"triumphantly across to Rollo, who on his part listened intently. As"
Sergeant Cardono proceeded the young man leaned further and further
"forward, breathing deeply and regularly. The expression on his face was"
that of fierce and keen resolution.
"The Sergeant told all the tale as it had happened, reserving only the"
"identification of himself with the famous José Maria of Ronda, which the"
"gipsies had made on the strength of the red mark about his neck, now"
"once more concealed under his military stock. Cardono, however, made no"
"secret that he was of the blood of Egypt, and set down to this fact all"
that he had been able to accomplish. In swift well-chosen words he told
"of the fierce little girl with the dark hair and blue eyes, who declared"
"herself to be the daughter of Muñoz, sometime paramour and now reputed"
husband of the Queen-Regent--making it clear that she had indeed planned
circle of his own men. “Same gang who bought Schaeffer.”
"The jam boss nodded in a troubled way. “I’m afraid they’ve got us bad,"
"too. It’s goin’ to take one long time pickin’ that jam apart, but I"
can’t see anythin’ else to do. I spose I’d better start ’em at it right
"away, sir.”"
"“Not at all,” retorted Bob swiftly. “Do nothing of the kind. Let ’em"
"stay just where they are, Jerry!”"
At the sound of his imperative undertone Calker hustled up. There was a
"brief interchange of words between the trio, during which the faces of"
both lumberjacks brightened--amazingly. Then all three disappeared into
"the bushes a little way upstream, from which they did not emerge for a"
considerable time.
"When they finally appeared, Bainbridge held by his side a shapeless"
package of considerable size. Had not Peters and Calker walked so close
"beside him as he bent his way leisurely toward the crowd about the jam,"
it would probably have been noticed that this package was made up of a
"dozen or more sticks of giant powder fastened securely together, and"
depending from a sling of stout manila rope.
"The line of rivermen had turned, and were watching his approach with"
"interested curiosity, but Joyce and his gang could see nothing. Reaching"
"the men, Bob paused, struck a match, and carefully lighted the end of a"
"protruding fuse. As it sputtered up he gave a short, sharp word of"
"command, the line of men opened instantly to let him through, and a"
"second later he stood not a dozen paces from Joyce, deliberately"
swinging the deadly package round and round his head.
For a second there was a breathless hush. Then the red-haired man leaped
"again, would explain nothing, and name no quarter from which help"
"might come. All the afternoon the camp lay grilling in the sunshine,"
and in the shuttered room in the middle of it my lady suffered. Had
the house lain by the river she might have tried to escape; but the
"camp girdled it on three sides, and on the fourth, where a swampy"
"inlet guarded one flank of the village, a deep ditch as well as the"
morass forbade all passage.
She remained in her room until she heard the unwelcome sounds which
"told of the general's return. Then she came into the outer room, her"
"eyes glittering, a red spot on either cheek, all pretence at an end."
"Her glance withered Fraulein Max, who sat blinking in a corner with a"
"very evil conscience. And to Marie Wort, when the girl came near her"
"on the pretence of adjusting her lace sleeves, she had only one word"
to say.
"'You slut!' she hissed, her breath hot on the girl's cheek. 'If you"
fail me I will kill you. Begone out of my sight!'
"The child, excited before, broke down at that, and, bursting into a"
"fit of weeping, ran out. Her sobs were still in the air when General"
Tzerclas entered.
"The Countess's face was flushed, and her bearing, full of passion and"
"defiance, must have warned him what to expect, if he felt any doubt"
"before. The sun was just setting, the room growing dusk. He stood"
"awhile, after saluting her, in doubt how he should come to the point,"
or in admiration; for her scorn and anger only increased her beauty
"and his feeling for her. At length he pointed lightly to the women,"
who kept their places by the door.
"'Is it your wish, fair cousin,' he said slowly, 'that I should speak"
"Slyne was not beyond feeling somewhat ashamed of himself, but found easy"
solace in the reflection that all he had said was for her good as well
as his own. He could see that his last brutal argument had struck home.
"For Sallie could no longer doubt, now, in the lurid light of her recent"
"experiences, that Captain Dove looked upon her as a mere chattel, to be"
turned into cash as soon as occasion should offer.
"In a little she looked up at him again out of pleading, desperate eyes."
Some most unusual impulse of pity stirred him. She was only a young girl
"yet, and her helplessness spoke its own appeal, even to him. He made up"
"his mind again, quite apart from any question of policy, to deal with"
her as generously as might be practicable.
"""Will Captain Dove let me go now if I promise to marry you, Jasper?"" she"
asked. And he nodded solemnly.
"""And not unless I do?"" she insisted. ""You _know_ I didn't--before,"
"although you say I did."""
"""I swear to God, Sallie,"" he declared, ""that I can't raise the money the"
Old Man wants any other way. And--I won't say another word about what's
past and done with.
"""If you'll really promise to marry me,"" he said eagerly, ""I'll prove to"
you that all I have told you is true before you need even leave Captain
Dove; I won't ask you to go a step farther with me until you're
perfectly satisfied; I'll take you safely to your own home as soon as
you _are_ satisfied that you can trust me. And I won't ask you to keep
"your promise till--"""
An irrepressible light of longing had leaped up behind the despair in
her eyes.
"to which, thanks to the Captain's co-operation, he had fallen."
"""Now, then, my friend!"" said the Captain, glancing critically at the"
"restored client, ""we have a coat and jacket.  When I had respectable"
trousers I lived in town like a respectable man.  But when the trousers
"wore out, I too fell off in the opinion of my fellow-men and had to"
"come down here from the town.  Men, my fine mannikin, judge everything"
"by the outward appearance, while, owing to their foolishness, the"
actual reality of things is incomprehensible to them.  Make a note of
"this on your nose, and pay me at least half your debt.  Go in peace;"
"seek, and you may find."""
"""How much do I owe you, Aristid Fomich?"" asks the client, in confusion."
"""One rouble and 70 kopecks....  Now, give me only one rouble, or, if"
"you like, 70 kopecks, and as for the rest, I shall wait until you have"
"earned more than you have now by stealing or by hard work, it does not"
"matter to me."""
"""I thank you humbly for your kindness!"" says the client, touched to the"
"heart.  ""Truly you are a kind man....; Life has persecuted you in"
"vain....  What an eagle you would have been in your own place!"""
The Captain could not live without eloquent speeches.
"""What does 'in my own place' mean?  No one really knows his own place"
"in life, and every one of us crawls into his harness.  The place of the"
"merchant Judas Petunikoff ought to be in penal servitude, but he still"
"walks through the streets in daylight, and even intends to build a"
factory. The place of our teacher ought to be beside a wife and
"half-a-dozen children, but he is loitering in the public-house of"
"Vaviloff.  And then, there is yourself.  You are going to seek a"
"should not reach the men around; ""these, when they get there, will think"
of nothing but plunder. As if rags and diamonds and gold were worth
"venturing one's life for. But I desire death--death--death, do you hear?"
"To see the Italian woman and her paramour pleading for their lives, one"
"wailing over against the other, on their knees. Oh, I know them and the"
brat they call the little Queen! To-night they shall lie dead under my
"hands--with this--with this!"""
And the girl flashed a razor-keen blade out of her red waistband. She
thrust the hilt forward into the Sergeant's hands as if in token of
fealty.
"""See,"" she said, touching the edge lovingly, ""is it not sharp? Will it"
"not kill surely and swiftly? For months I have sharpened it--ah, and"
"to-night it will give me my desire!"""
"It was the Sergeant's belief that the girl was mad, nevertheless he"
"watched her with his usual quiet scrutiny, the power of which she"
evidently felt. For she avoided his eyes and hastened on with her story
before he had time to cross-question her.
"""Why do I hate them? I see the question on your lips. Because the"
Italian woman hath taken away my father and slain my mother--slain her
as truly and with far sharper agony than she herself shall know when I
"set this knife to her throat. I am the daughter of Muñoz, and I swore"
revenge on the man and on the woman both when I closed my mother's eyes.
"My mother's heart was broken. Ah, you see, she was weak--not like me! It"
would take a hundred like the Neapolitan to break my heart; and as for
"the man, though he were thrice my father, he should beg his life in"
"vain."""
"She snatched her knife jealously out of his hand, tried its edge on the"
Rollo coloured high.
"""General,"" he said, ""I will not conceal it from you that I have wasted"
too much time already; but if you wish for our assistance in your
"designs for twenty-four hours, I am not the man to deny you."""
"""I thought not,"" cried Cabrera, much pleased. ""And now have you any"
"business to despatch before we leave this place? If so, let it be seen"
"to at once!"""
"""None, Excellency,"" said Rollo, ""save that if you are satisfied of our"
good faith I should like to see Luis Fernandez the miller dealt with
"according to his deserts!"""
"""I will have him shot instantly,"" cried Cabrera; ""he hath given false"
tidings to his Majesty's generals. He hath belied his honest servants.
"Guard, bring Luis Fernandez hither!"""
This was rather more than Rollo had bargained for. He was not yet
"accustomed to the summary methods of Cabrera, even though the butcher's"
hand had hardly yet unclosed from himself. He was already meditating an
"appeal in favour of milder measures, when the guard returned with the"
"news that Luis Fernandez was nowhere to be found. Dwelling-house,"
"strong-room, mill, garden, and gorge beneath--all had been searched. In"
vain--they were empty and void. The tumbled beds where the general and
"his staff had slept, the granary with its trampled heaps of corn ready"
"for grinding, the mill-wheel with the pool beneath where the lights and"
"shadows played at bo-peep, where the trout lurked and the water-boxes"
seemed to descend into an infinity of blackness--all were deserted and
lonesome as if no man had been near them for a hundred years.
"""The rascal has escaped!"" cried Cabrera, full of rage; ""have I not told"
"father, and two other men. Susanna was most smart; she greeted Laura and"
"Cæsar very affably, and presented her father, Mr. Russell; then she"
"presented an English author, tall, skinny, with blue eyes, a white"
"beard, and hair like a halo; and then a young Englishman from the"
"Embassy, a very distinguished person named Kennedy, who was a Catholic."
_TEA_
"After the introductions they passed into the dining-room, which was"
"most impressive. It was an exhibition of very smart women, some of"
"them ideally beautiful, and idle men. All about them resounded a nasal"
English of the American sort.
Susanna Marchmont served the tea and did the honours to her guests.
"They all talked French, excepting Mr. Russell, who once in a long while"
uttered some categorical monosyllable in his own language.
Mr. Russell was not of the classic Yankee type; he looked like a vulgar
"Englishman. He was a serious man, with a short moustache, grey-headed,"
with three or four gold teeth.
What to Cæsar seemed wonderful in this gentleman was his economy of
"words. There was not one useless expression in his vocabulary, and"
"not the slightest redundancy; whatever partook of merit, prestige, or"
"nobility was condensed, for him, to the idea of value; whatever partook"
"of arrangement, cleanliness, order, was condensed to the word “comfort”;"
"so that Mr. Russell, with a very few words, had everything specified."
"To Susanna, imbued with her preoccupation in supreme _chic_, her father"
no doubt did not seem a completely decorative father; but he gave Cæsar
its way as Trafalgar. It proved that the whole German Fleet could not
fight out an action against our full force and have the smallest hope
of success. I am just praying for the chance of a whack at them in the
"_Malplaquet_. My destroyer was a bonny ship, the best in the flotilla,"
"but the _Malplaquet_ is a real peach. You should see her."""
"""We mean to,"" said Cary. ""This very afternoon. You shall take us back"
"with you."""
"The Commander opened his eyes at this cool proposal, but we prevailed"
"upon him to seek the permission of the Admiral-Superintendent, who, a"
"good deal to my surprise, proved to be quite pliable. Cary's"
reputation for discretion must be very high in the little village
where he lives if it is able to guarantee so disreputable a scribbler
"as Bennet Copplestone! The Admiral, fortunately, had not read any of"
my Works before they had been censored. When printed in _Cornhill_
they were comparatively harmless.
I must not describe the _Malplaquet_. Her design was not new to me--I
had seen more than one of her type--but as she is now a unit in
Beatty's Fleet her existence is not admitted to the world. As we went
"up and down her many steep narrow ladders, and peered into dark"
"corners, I looked everywhere for a Marine sentry whom I could identify"
"by mark of ear as Dawson. I never saw him, but Trehayne passed me"
"twice, and I found myself again admiring his splendid young manhood."
"He was not big, being rather slim and wiry than strongly built, but in"
"sheer beauty of face and form he was almost perfectly fashioned. ""Do"
"you know that man?"" I asked of our commander, indicating Trehayne."
"""No,"" said he. ""He is one of the shore party. But I should like to"
have him with me. He is one of the smartest looking petty officers
"that I have ever seen."""
"And, if I do give you another, you needn't suppose--"""
"""Come on inside,"" begged Captain Dove, shivering, in no case to listen"
"to any lecture. ""Come on, and we'll talk sense. Don't waste any more"
"good time."""
"Slyne followed him in again, congratulating himself on his firmness. He"
"felt that he had gained the whip-hand of the old man, and he meant to"
keep it. He curtly refused again Captain Dove's more hospitable offer of
"some refreshment, and, while his aggrieved host was clumsily getting"
"into some warmer clothing, talked to him from the saloon through the"
open doorway of his cramped sleeping-quarters. It was easier to arrange
matters so than under Captain Dove's direct observation.
"""You'll pay me cash, of course,"" Captain Dove stipulated, as though he"
had been bargaining about a charter-party.
"""I'll pay you cash,"" Slyne agreed, ""the day Sallie marries me. And"
"meantime I'll give you my note of hand at thirty days for the money."" He"
"listened intently, but Captain Dove, struggling fretfully with"
"refractory buttons, maintained an ominous silence."
"""I'll have it backed by a London lawyer, to keep you safe,"" said Slyne."
"""And listen! I'm not asking you to risk anything, or even to take my"
note at its face value. I want you to come ashore with me and find out
for yourself from my lawyer that you can depend on the money. If you
"don't feel satisfied about that after you've seen him, you needn't go"
"any farther, we'll call the bargain off; you can get back on board your"
ship at once and no harm done.
"""And, even as regards Sallie, I'm going out of my way to keep you right."
"I'd give a great deal to get married at once, but--I'm willing to wait"
"Eilert's house, they looked at their watches and swore because so many"
minutes were being wasted. Where the devil was the car? The populace
"followed at some distance, gazing with reverence on these dressed-up"
fools.
I remember a couple of them: an old man--the one with the loud voice--who
wore a pleated kilt on each thigh and a jacket of green canvas with braid
"and buckles and straps and innumerable pockets all over it. What a man,"
"what a power! His beard, streaming out from under his nose like the"
"northern lights, was greenish-white, and he swore like a madman. Another"
"of the party was tall and bent, a flagpole of sorts, astonishing,"
"stupendous, with sloping shoulders, a tiny cap perched above extravagantly"
"arched eyebrows; he was an upended Roman battering ram, a man on stilts. I"
"measured him with my eyes, and still there was something left over. Yet he"
"was bent and broken, old before his time, quite bald; but his mouth was"
"tight as a tiger's, and he had a madness in his head that kept him on the"
move.
"""Stordalen!"" he cried."
England will soon have to open old people's homes for her sons. She
desexes her people with sport and obsessive ideas: were not other
"countries keeping her in perpetual unrest, she would in a couple of"
generations be converted to pederasty....
"Then the horn of the car was heard tooting in the woods, and everyone"
raced to meet it.
Of course Olaus's two boys had done an honest day's work in meeting the
"car so far up the road, and urging the driver to hurry; were they not to"
"get any reward? True, they were allowed to sit in the back seat for their"
return journey and thus enjoyed the drive of a lifetime; but money! They
"""And lots and lots of love, father,"" interrupted Betty."

"Well, our journey was soon arranged on a grand scale. Pickering lent us"
"his new coach, just home from the makers in Cow Street. It was cushioned"
and curtained and had springs in place of thorough-braces. It also had
glass in the windows and doors; a luxury then little known in England
even among the nobles. There was a prejudice against its use in coach
windows because of the fact that two or three old ladies had cut their
faces in trying to thrust their heads through it.
"The new coach was a wonderful vehicle, and Frances and I, as well as"
"Betty, were very proud of our grandeur. Pickering sent along with the"
"coach and horses two lusty fellows as drivers, and gave us a hamper"
almost large enough to feed a company of soldiers. I was to pay all
expenses on the road.
"Almost at the last hour Sir Richard concluded not to go, but insisted"
"that Frances, Bettina, and I take the journey by ourselves. As Pickering"
"offered no objection, Frances shrugged her shoulders in assent, I"
"shrugged mine, and Betty laughed, whereby we all, in our own way, agreed"
"to the new arrangement, and preparations went forward rapidly."
"By the time we were ready to start, the king, the duke, the duchess, and"
"many ladies and gentlemen of the court circle had gone to Bath, thus"
giving us an opportunity to make our journey without the knowledge of any
one in Whitehall; a consideration of vast importance to us under the
circumstances. Some of our grand friends at court might have laughed at
"our taking the journey with an innkeeper's daughter, in an innkeeper's"
"coach, but Frances and I laughed because we were happy."
the Kalè Valley. There the buffaloes are turned out into the jungle for
"eight months in the year, and are only caught for ploughing and carting."
"Naturally they are quite wild; in fact, many of them are the offspring"
of wild bulls.
"The Burmans, too, are very fond of dogs. Their villages are full of"
"dogs; but, as far as I know, they never use them for anything, and they"
are never trained to do anything. They are supposed to be useful as
"watch-dogs, but I do not think they are very good even at that. I have"
"surrounded a village before dawn, and never a dog barked, and I have"
heard them bark all night at nothing.
But when a Burman sees a fox-terrier or any English dog his delight is
"unfeigned. When we first took Upper Burma, and such sights were rare,"
half a village would turn out to see the little 'tail-less' dog trotting
"along after its master. And if the terrier would 'beg,' then he would"
"win all hearts. I am not only referring to children, but to grown men"
and women; and then there is always something peculiarly childlike and
frank in these children of the great river.
"Only to-day, as I was walking up the bank of the river in the early"
"dawn, I heard some Burman boatmen discussing my fox-terrier. They were"
"about fifteen yards from the shore, poling their boat up against the"
"current, which is arduous work; and as I passed them my little dog ran"
"down the bank and looked at them across the water, and they saw her."
"'See now,' said one man to another, pausing for a moment with his pole"
"in his hand--'see the little white dog with the brown face, how wise she"
looks!'
"'And how pretty!' said a man steering in the stern. 'Come!' he cried,"
holding out his hand to it.
"""I shall just see the elections through, and Perry well started--at"
"least, I suppose it'll be Perry--and then we'll be off. Shan't you be"
"glad to see the old home again, Al?"""
"""It's so sudden,"" she said. ""I shall be sorry to leave here."""
"""Oh, so shall I--very sorry to leave some of the people too. Still, it's"
"a good thing. Where's Eleanor? I must tell her. I say, Dick gets here"
"to-morrow."""
"""Oh, I'm so glad."""
"The Governor hurried out again, and Alicia returned to the sofa. The"
knot of her troubles had been rudely cut. Perhaps this summary ending
"was best. She herself would not, she knew, have had the strength to tear"
"herself away from that place, but if fate tore her--perhaps well and"
good. Nothing but unhappiness waited there for her; it seemed to her
"that nothing but unhappiness waited anywhere now; but at least, over at"
"home, she would not have to fear the discovery of her secret, the secret"
"she herself kept so badly, nor to endure the torture of gossip, hints,"
"and clumsy pity. No one, over at home, would think of Medland; they"
"might just know his name, might perhaps have heard him rumoured for a"
dangerous man and a vexatious opponent of good Sir Robert. Certainly
they would never think of him as the cause of bruising of heart to a
young lady in fashionable society. So he would pass out of her life; she
"would leave him to his busy, strenuous, happy-unhappy life, so full of"
"triumphs and defeats, of ups and downs, of the love of many and the hate"
"of many. Perhaps she, like the rest, would read his name in the _Times_"
"now and then, unless indeed he were utterly vanquished. No, he was not"
finally beaten. Of that she was sure. His name would be read often in
"cold print, but the glow of the life he lived would be henceforth"
A suite of rooms received them in the quiet West End hotel where the
"Canon always stayed. They dined alone, the discreet butler waiting on"
"them, for the Canon was an honoured guest. When the cloth was removed,"
the Canon said in his even voice:--
"“Are you sufficiently recovered, Yvonne, to discuss this painful"
subject?”
"“I am quite ready, Everard.”"
“We will make it as short as possible. What I said last night must
"remain, whatever be the suffering. I have loved you deeply--like a young"
"man--in a way perhaps ill befitting my years. The memories, for they are"
"innocent, will always be there, Yvonne. If I did not seek strength from"
"Elsewhere, it might wreck my life to part from you.”"
A young teacher was telling her pupils the story of the emotional lady
"who, to put her lover to the test, bade him pick up the glove which"
she had thrown down into the arena between the tiger and the lion. The
"lover does her bidding, in order to vindicate his character as a brave"
"knight. One boy, after hearing the story, at once states his contempt"
"for the knight's acquiescence, which he declares to be unworthy."
"“But,” says the teacher, “you see he really did it to show the lady how"
foolish she was.” The answer of the boy sums up what I have been trying
"to show: “There was no sense in _his_ being sillier than _she_ was, to"
show her _she_ was silly.”
"If the boy had stopped there, we might have concluded that he was"
"lacking in imagination or romance, but his next remark proves what a"
"balanced and discriminating person he was, for he added: “Now, if _she_"
"had fallen in, and he had leapt after her to rescue her, that would"
clinging to hope.
"But when another quarter had gone by, doubt became conviction. I had"
been fooled! Either some one who had seen me loitering at Krapp's in
"the morning and heard my tale had gone straight off, and played me"
this trick; or--Gott im Himmel!--or I had been lured here that I might
be out of the way at home.
"That thought, which should have entered my thick head an hour before,"
"sped me from the street, as if it had been a very catapult. Before I"
reached the corner I was running; and I ran through street after
"street, sweating with fear. But quickly as I went, my thoughts"
outpaced me. My lady was alone save for her women. The men were
"drilling, the Waldgrave was in the camp. The crowded state of the"
"streets at sunset, and the number of strangers who thronged the city"
"favoured certain kinds of crime; in a great crowd, as in a great"
"solitude, everything is possible."
"I had this in my mind. Judge, then, of my horror, when, as I"
"approached the Ritter Strasse, I became aware of a dull, roaring"
"sound; and hastening to turn the corner, saw a large mob gathered in"
"front of our house, and filling the street from wall to wall. The"
"glare of torches shone on a thousand upturned faces, and flamed from a"
"hundred casements. At the windows, on the roofs, peering over"
"balconies and coping-stones and gables, and looking out of doorways"
"were more faces, all red in the torchlight. And all the time as the"
"smoking light rose and fell, the yelling, as it seemed to me, rose and"
"fell with it--now swelling into a stern roar of exultation, now"
"sinking into an ugly, snarling noise, above which a man might hear his"
neighbour speak.

"The authorities of Panama estimate that there are about 36,000 tribal"
"Indians, that is to say aborigines, still holding their tribal"
organizations and acknowledging fealty to no other government now in the
"Isthmus. The estimate is of course largely guesswork, for few of the"
wild Indians leave the jungle and fewer still of the census enumerators
enter it. Most of these Indians live in the mountains of the provinces
"of Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veragua, or in the Darien. Their tribes"
are many and the sources of information concerning them but few. The
most accessible and complete record of the various tribes is in a
"pamphlet issued by the Smithsonian Institution, and now obtainable only"
"through public libraries, as the edition for distribution has been"
"exhausted. The author, Miss Eleanor Yorke Bell, beside studies made at"
first hand has diligently examined the authorities on the subject and
has presented the only considerable treatise on the subject of which I
have knowledge.

Of life among the more civilized natives she says:
"“The natives of the Isthmus in general, even in the larger towns, live"
"together without any marriage ceremony, separating at will and dividing"
"the children. As there is little or no personal property, this is"
"accomplished amicably as a rule, though should disputes arise the"
"Several voices muttered ""Thank God,"" but one man's teeth were still"
chattering as though he was so absorbed by his own fear that he had not
noticed the disappearance of its cause. Soon there was complete silence
and one by one we fell asleep.
Another clear day and another clear night. We lay awake listening
anxiously to the bursting of bombs and the muttering of anti-aircraft
fire. But we went to sleep in the end and felt drowsy all the following
day--a clear day. Casualties came in from a camp that had been bombed
"overnight, and we saw shattered limbs, smashed heads, and lacerated"
flesh. Several of our men were looking pale through lack of sleep and
had dark rings round their eyes.
"Another clear night. The agonizing vigil began again, but I was so weary"
that I went to sleep a few minutes after lights out. Sullen thunders
mingled with my dreams and did not wake me up.
Another clear day. Would the fine weather never end? Late in the
"afternoon, however, a few clouds collected on the horizon. In the"
evening the entire sky was overcast and not a star was to be seen. And
as we went to bed we heard the rain swishing down upon the canvas roof.
The unspeakable joy we all felt at the prospect of an untroubled night!
"""Bloody fine, this rain: we'll get some proper sleep now, thank God. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life, and I've been out here"
"since '15 and in some pretty hot places too."""
"""I reckon the longer yer out 'ere the windier yer get. I joined up in"
'14 like a bloody fool. At first I didn't care a damn for anything. Then
I was wounded on the Somme an' sent across to Blighty. I dreaded comin'
"back agin. I only 'ad a little wound in me 'and, an' I used ter plug it"
"wi' dubbin' an' boot-polish ter keep it raw. It didn't 'alf 'urt, but it"
Tervueren road they met numbers of peasant refugees in carts and on
"foot, driving cattle, geese or pigs towards the capital; urging on"
the tugging dogs with small carts and barrows loaded with personal
"effects, trade-goods, farm produce, or crying children. All of them"
"had a distraught, haggard appearance and were constantly looking"
"behind them. From the east, indeed, came the distant sounds of"
explosions and intermittent rifle firing. Mrs. Warren was blanched
"with fear, her cheeks a dull peach colour. She questioned the people"
"in French and Flemish, but they only answered vaguely in raucous"
"voices: ""Les Allemands!"" ""De Duitscher."""
"One old woman, however, had flung herself down by the roadside,"
while her patient dog lay between the shafts of the little cart till
she should be pleased to go on. She was more communicative and told
"Mrs. Warren a tale too horrible to be believed, about husband, son,"
"son-in-law all killed, daughter violated and killed too, cottage in"
"flames, livestock driven off. Recovering from her exhaustion she"
"rose and shook herself. ""I've no business to be here. I should be"
with _them_. I was just packing this cart for the market when it
happened. Why did I go away? Oh for shame! I'll go back--to
"_them_..."" And forthwith she turned the dog round and trudged the"
same way they were going.
At last they came opposite the courtyard of the Villa and saw the
lawn and gravel sweep full of helmeted soldiers in green-grey
"uniform, their bodies hung with equipment--bags, great-coats,"
"rolled-up blankets, trench spades, cartridge bandoliers. Vivie"
"jumped down quickly, said to her mother in a low firm voice: ""Leave"
"everything to me. Say as little as possible."" Then to the farmer:"
"""Nous vous remercions infiniment. Vous aurez mille choses à faire"
"chez vous, je n'en doute. Nous réglerons notre compte tout-à"
"l'heure.... Pour le moment, adieu."" She clutched the handbags of"
"""That's the end o' that--that's the end o' that,"" she wound up, slamming"
the door after him. But all the way from the threshold to the bureau she
"kept murmuring to herself: ""I don't care, I don't care . . . I'll be"
like the rest o' the women I've seen. I'll give that Nina Micheltoreña
"cards an' spades. There'll be another hussy around here. There'll be--"""
"The threat was never finished. Instead, with eyes that fairly started"
"out of their sockets, she listened to the sound of a couple of shots,"
the last one exploding so loud and distinct that there was no mistaking
its nearness to the cabin.
"""They've got 'im!"" she cried. ""Well, I don't care--I don't--"" But again"
she did not finish what she intended to say. For at the sound of a heavy
"body falling against the cabin door she flew to it, opened it and,"
"throwing her arms about the sorely-wounded man, dragged him into the"
cabin and placed him in a chair. Quick as lightning she was back at the
door bolting it.
With his eyes Johnson followed her action.
"""Don't lock that door--I'm going out again--out there. Don't bar that"
"door,"" he commanded feebly, struggling to his feet and attempting to"
walk towards it; but he lurched forward and would have fallen to the
"floor had she not caught him. Vainly he strove to break away from her,"
"all the time crying out: ""Don't you see, don't you see, Girl--open the"
"door."" And then again with almost a sob: ""Do you think me a man to hide"
"behind a woman?"" He would have collapsed except for the strong arms that"
held him.
"""I love you an' I'm goin' to save you,"" the Girl murmured while"
"struggling with him. ""You asked me to go away with you; I will when you"
"git out o' this. If you can't save your own soul--"" She stopped and"
quickly went over to the mantel where she took down a bottle of whisky
"inadvertently upon the last occasion it was used, exploded. The man’s"
"arm had been wrenched off, and he was burned terribly. It was a stroke"
of luck that the liner hove in sight at the moment she did. There was
"no chance of extending succour to the injured man on the spot, and he"
would have died before a doctor could have been summoned by boat from
"Ballycastle, nine miles away. The surgeon bound up the man’s injuries,"
"lowered him into his boat, and, on regaining the liner, placed him"
"in the hospital, where he was tended until the vessel’s arrival in"
"Liverpool, where he was landed and placed in hospital."

More remarkable was the accident which happened at the Flannen Islands
light-station in 1900; it remains an unsolved mystery to this day. This
"is one of Scotland’s lonely lights, mounting guard over a group of"
islets fifteen miles off the Hebrides. On December 26 the relief-tender
"approached the station on her usual fortnightly visit, but, to the"
"amazement of those on board, no signs of the keepers or the usual"
"signals were to be seen, while the lantern was not dressed in its"
"daylight garb. The crew landed hurriedly, wondering what was amiss."
They found the lighthouse absolutely deserted; not a sign of any of the
"three keepers was to be seen or heard. They examined the log, and found"
"that the light had not been burning for some days, the last entry being"
"made about 4 a.m. nearly a week previously. The rock was searched, but"
yielded no clue to the mystery of the complete disappearance of the
"Instantly a voice answered, ""I am Idu of the Chagai Levies, friendly"
"to the British Government."""
"I then called out who I was, and, immediately, three fully armed men"
came forward in the darkness.
"I asked them what they were doing there, and the voice that had"
answered me before replied that they were all three members of the
"Chagai Levies, and that they, and about fifty others, had come out to"
fight me.
"""To fight me?"" I exclaimed. ""Whatever for?"""
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned the man who had said his name was Idu, ""we"
"thought you were a German airship."" And he went on to explain that"
for a long time he and his companions had been watching powerful
"lights floating about in the sky, and as they knew that Germans were"
"the only people in the world who had _hawaiijihaz_ or airships, they"
were convinced the lights they had seen belonged to one of these. And
"when it had alighted on the hill in front of them, the majority of"
"his companions had been so terrified that they had run away, and only"
himself and his two comrades had had the bravery to stay where they
were and face the unknown danger.
Then it dawned on me what he was driving at. The flashing electric
"lights of the car, lighting up the distant, rising slopes of the"
"desert, had appeared to these men to come from the sky, and my"
"harmless motor-car the dreaded German airship. Cars, of course, along"
"this route were as great a novelty as airships, and doubtless not one"
of the men in front of me had ever seen one before.
"I reassured them as completely as I could, adding that I was"

"That evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the"
"swing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old Mr."
"Neave felt he was too old for the spring. Spring—warm, eager,"
"restless—was there, waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front"
"of everybody to run up, to blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on"
"his arm. And he couldn’t meet her, no; he couldn’t square up once more"
"and stride off, jaunty as a young man. He was tired and, although the"
"late sun was still shining, curiously cold, with a numbed feeling all"
"over. Quite suddenly he hadn’t the energy, he hadn’t the heart to stand"
this gaiety and bright movement any longer; it confused him. He wanted
"to stand still, to wave it away with his stick, to say, “Be off with"
you!” Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual—tipping his
"wide-awake with his stick—all the people whom he knew, the friends,"
"acquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers. But the gay glance that"
"went with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed to say, “I’m a"
match and more for any of you”—that old Mr. Neave could not manage at
"all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as if he were walking"
through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water. And the
"homeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light carts"
"clattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless,"
defiant indifference that one knows only in dreams....
It had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had
happened. Harold hadn’t come back from lunch until close on four. Where
had he been? What had he been up to? He wasn’t going to let his father
"know. Old Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying"
"end reached, he let the paper fall on his knees, lay back, and took a"
"long pull at his cigar. He was shocked--yes, he supposed he was"
"shocked. He had known the man, and it was shocking to think of his"
"throat being cut; yes, he had known him, and he didn't like to think of"
that. But--The Premier gave a long-drawn sigh of relief. That unknown
murderer's hand had done great things for him. His daughter was safe
"now--anyhow, she was safe. She could never be subject to the degradation"
the dead man had once hinted at; and when he thought of what the man had
"threatened, pity for him died out of Medland's heart. More--although"
Kilshaw no doubt knew something--there was a chance that Benham had kept
"his own counsel, and that his employer would be helpless without his"
"aid. Medland's sanguine mind caught eagerly at the chance, and in a"
moment turned it into a hope--almost a conviction. Then the whole thing
"would go down to the grave with the unlucky man, and not even its"
"spectre survive to trouble him. For if no one had certain knowledge, if"
"there were never more than gossip, growing, as time passed, fainter and"
"fainter from having no food to feed on, would not utter silence follow"
"at last, so that the things that had been might be as if they had never"
been?
"""Well, what do they say about us?"" asked the Treasurer."
"""Oh, nothing much,"" he answered, thrusting the paper behind him with a"
careless air. He did not want to discuss what the paper had told him.
"""What's happened to-day,"" said Daisy, ""ought to make all the difference,"
"oughtn't it, father?"""
"""I hope it will,"" replied the Premier; but, for once in his life, he was"
not thinking most about political affairs.
"told Sir Oliver to go to the devil with his lugubrious and rotten game,"
and dashed away to the solitude of the beach until the luncheon-bell
summoned him back.
"“I'm going by the 3:50,” said he at the luncheon-table."
At three o'clock Stella was free to see him again. He went up to her
room distinctly determined to shut his heart against folly. The sun
had crept round toward the west and flooded the head and shoulders of
"Stellamaris and the dainty bedspread with pale gold, just as it flooded"
the now still and smiling sea. Again paralysis fell upon John. The words
"he was to speak were to him, as well as to her, the words of doom, and"
"he could not utter them. They talked of vain, childish things. Then"
Stellamaris's clock chimed the three-quarters. There are some chimes
"that are brutal, others ironic; but Stellamaris's chimes (the clock was"
"a gift from John himself) were soft, and pealed a soothing mystery, like"
a bell swung in a deep sea-cave.
"It was a quarter to four, and he had missed his train once more. Well,"
"the train could go to--to London, as good a synonym for Tophet as any"
"other. So he stayed, recklessly surrendering himself to the pale, sunlit"
"peace of the sea-chamber, till he was dislodged by Lady Blount."
An attempt to catch a six o'clock train was equally unsuccessful. He did
not return to town that night. Why should a sorely bruised man reject
"the balm that healed? To-morrow he would be stronger and more serene,"
"abler to control the driving force of the Furies, and therefore fitted"
to announce in gentler wise the decrees of destiny. So Risca went to bed
"and slept easier, and the room which Stellamaris had made for him became"
the enchanted bower of a Fair Lady of All Mercy.
In their simple human way Sir Oliver and Lady Blount besought him to
"""I suppose I had better introduce myself to you, Mr. Alwyn""--she said"
"with a condescending and confident air--""Though really we know each"
other so well by reputation that there seems scarcely any necessity for
"it! Of course you have heard of 'Tiger-Lily!'"""
"Villiers gazed at her helplessly,--he had never felt so uncomfortable"
"in all his life. Here was a strange woman, who had actually taken"
"bodily possession of his apartment as though it were her own,--who had"
"settled herself down in his particular pet Louis Quatorze chair,--who"
stared at him with the scrutinizing complacency of a professional
"physiognomist,--and who seemed to think no explanation of her"
"extraordinary conduct was necessary, inasmuch as ""of course"" he,"
"Villiers, had heard of ""TIGER-LILY!"" It was very singular! ... almost"
like madness! ... Perhaps she WAS mad! How could he tell? She had a
"remarkably high, knobby brow,--a brow with an unpleasantly bald"
"appearance, owing to the uncompromising way in which her hair was"
brushed well off it--he had seen such brows before in certain
"""spiritualists"" who believed, or pretended to believe, in the suddenly"
"willed dematerialization of matter, and THEY were mad, he knew, or else"
very foolishly feigning madness!
"Endeavoring to compose his bewildered mind, he fixed glass in eye, and"
"regarded her through it with an inquiring solemnity,--he would have"
"spoken, but before he could utter a word, she went on rapidly:"
"""You are not in the least like the person I imagined you to be! ..."
"However, that doesn't matter. Literary celebrities are always so"
"different to what we expect!"""
"""Pardon me, madam,""--began Villiers politely.. ""You are making a slight"
"error,--my servant probably did not explain. I am not Mr. Alwyn, . . my"
LONG DELAYED SUCCESS
"And when the night was at its darkest, light gradually appeared, and"
after innumerable difficulties had been overcome his Resonant Recorder
"was perfected, which enabled the plant to tell its own story. And in"
the meantime something still more wonderful came to pass. Hitherto all
gates had been barred and he had to produce his passports everywhere. He
now found friends who never asked him for credentials. His time had come
at last. The Royal Society found his new methods most convincing and
honoured him by publication of his researches in the Philosophical
"transactions. And his discoveries, which had so long remained in"
"obscurity, found enthusiastic acceptance."
Though his theories had thus received acceptance from the leading
"scientific men of the Royal Society, there was yet no general conviction"
of the identity of life reactions in plant and animal. No amount of
controversy can remove the tendency of the human mind to follow
precedents. The only thing left was to make the plant itself bear
"witness before the scientific bodies in the West, by means of"
"self-records. At the recommendation of the Minister of Education, and of"
"the Government of Bengal, the Secretary of State sanctioned his"
scientific deputation to Europe and America.
JOURNEY OF INDIAN PLANT ROUND THE WORLD
The special difficulty which he had to contend against lay in the fact
"that the only time during which the plant flourished at all in the West,"
"was in the months of July and August, when the Universities and"
scientific societies were in vacation. The only thing left was to take
the bold step of carrying growing plants from India and trust to human
Everybody understood what he hinted. Sir Robert did not care to depend
on the will of Coxon and his seceders.
"""And what about Coxon and Puttock?"" was the next question."
"""Haven't I been indiscreet enough?"""
"""Well, what are you going to do yourself?"""
"""My duty,"" answered Mr. Kilshaw, with a smile, and the throng, failing"
"to extract any more from him, did at last set about the task of getting"
home to bed in good earnest.
They could rest sooner than the man who occupied so much of their
interest. It had been a busy evening for the defeated Minister; he had
"colleagues to see, letters to write, messages to send, conferences to"
"hold. No doubt there was much to do, and yet Norburn, who watched him"
"closely, doubted whether he did not make work for himself, perhaps as a"
"means of distraction, perhaps as a device for postponing an interview"
"with his daughter. He had seen her for a minute when he came in, and"
told her he would tell her all there was to tell some time that night;
but the moment for it was slow in coming. Norburn had been struck with
"Daisy's composure. She had seen the _Evening Mail_, and, without"
"attempting to discuss the matter with him, she expressed her conviction"
that there could be nothing distressing behind the mysterious paragraph.
Norburn did not know what to say to her. He felt that in a case of this
"sort a girl's mind was a closed book to him. He had himself, on the way"
"back from the House, heard a brief account of the whole matter from the"
"Premier's lips; it seemed to him, in the light of his ideas and"
"theories, a matter of very little moment. He was of course aware how"
"widely the judgment of many would differ from his, and when his mind was"
Us to that place of Joy and Grace
Prepared for us since Adam's fall.
I think there is no doubt that we have made considerable progress in
this matter. Not only do we refrain from telling these highly moral
"(_sic_) stories but we have reached the point of parodying them,"
"in sign of ridicule, as, for instance, in such writing as Belloc's"
"“Cautionary Tales.” These would be a trifle too grim for a timid child,"
but excellent fun for adults.
It should be our study to-day to prove to children that the immediate
"importance to them is not to think of dying and going to Heaven, but"
"of living and--shall we say?--going to College, which is a far better"
preparation for a life to come than the morbid dwelling upon the
possibility of an early death.
"In an article signed “Muriel Harris,” I think, from a copy of the"
"_Tribune_, appeared a delightful article on Sunday Books, from which I"
quote the following:
"“All very good little children died young in the story-books, so that"
unusual goodness must have been the source of considerable anxiety to
affectionate parents. I came across a little old book the other day
called ‘Examples for Youth.’ On the yellow fly-leaf was written in
"childish, carefully sloping hand: ‘Presented to Mary Palmer Junior, by"
"her sister, to be read on Sundays,’ and was dated 1828. The accounts"
"are taken from a work on _Piety Promoted_, and all of them begin with"
unusual piety in early youth and end with the death-bed of the little
"paragon, and his or her dying words.”"
IX.--_Stories containing a mixture of Fairy Tale and Science._ By this
"combination you lose what is essential to each, namely, the fantastic"
ghost-like.  I had wronged her; I felt confident that I had.  All came
"back to me now--that cruel, scandalous denunciation I had uttered in the"
heat of my mad jealousy--the false tale which had struck her dumb by its
"circumstantial accuracy.  Ah! how bitter it all was, now that punishment"
"was upon me!  I remembered how, in the hour of my worldly triumph and of"
her highest hope--at the very moment when she had spoken words of
greater affection to me than she had ever used before--I had made the
"charge against her, and she had fallen back with her young heart crushed"
"within her.  My ring was there, still glittering mockingly upon her dead"
hand.  By the unfounded charge I had made against her I had sinned.  My
"sin at that moment arose from its grave, and barred the way for ever to"
all hope--to all happiness.
"The summer twilight was stealing on apace, and in the silence of the"
room there sounded the roar of life from the boulevard below.  Men were
"crying _Le Soir_ with strident voices, and all Paris was on its way to"
"dine, and afterwards to enjoy itself in idleness upon the terraces of"
the cafes or at those al-fresco variety performances in the Avenue des
"Champs Elysees, where the entrance fee includes a consommation."
"Deane still held my old love's hand, bending in the dim light until his"
"eyes were close to it, watching intently.  But I took no notice, for my"
"eyes were fixed upon that face that had held me in such fascination, and"
had been so admired at those brilliant receptions given by King Leopold
"and the Countess of Flanders.  The doctor stretched forth his hand, and"
of a sudden switched on the electric light.  The next instant I was
startled by his loud ejaculation of surprise.
"""Thank God!"" he cried.  ""She's not dead, after all!"""
"""Not dead!""  I gasped, unable fully to realise his meaning."
And so it was that Johnson decided to pass the night in the Girl's
"canopied bed while she herself, rolled up in a blanket rug before the"
"fire, slept on the floor."
"""This beats a bed any time,"" remarked the Girl, spreading out the rug"
"smoothly; and then, reaching up for the old patchwork, silk quilt that"
"hung from the loft, she added: ""There's one thing--you don't have to"
"make it up in the mornin'."""
"""You're splendid, Girl!"" laughed Johnson. Presently, he saw her quietly"
"closet herself in the cupboard, only to emerge a few minutes later"
dressed for the night. Over her white cambric gown with its coarse lace
"trimming showing at the throat, she wore a red woollen blanket robe held"
"in at the waist by a heavy, twisted, red cord which, to the man who got"
"a glimpse of her as she crossed the room, made her prettier, even, than"
she had seemed at any time yet.
"Quietly, now, the Girl began to put her house in order. All the lights,"
"save the quaintly-shaded lamp that was suspended over the table, were"
"extinguished; that one, after many unsuccessful attempts, was turned"
down so as to give the right minimum of light which would not interfere
with her lover's sleep. Then she went over to the door to make sure that
it was bolted. Outside the wind howled and shrieked and moaned; but
inside the cabin it had never seemed more cosey and secure and peaceful
to her.
"""Now you can talk to me from your bunk an' I'll talk to you from mine,"""
"she said in a sleepy, lazy voice."
Except for a prodigious yawn which came from the Girl there was an
ominous quiet hanging over the place that chilled the man. Sudden sounds
"startled him, and he found it impossible to make any progress with his"
"together apart like old friends. John Mortimer and Etienne, who"
"generally had little to say to each other, conversed freely upon"
wine-growing and the possibility of introducing cotton-spinning into the
South of France. For Etienne was not destitute of a certain Gascon eye
to the main chance.
Rollo alone rode gloomily apart. He was turning over the terms of his
"commission in his mind, and the more he thought, the less was he"
satisfied. It was not alone the desperateness of the venture that
"daunted Rollo, but the difficulty of providing for the Queen-Regent and"
little princess when captured. There were a couple of hundred miles to
ride back to those northern fastnesses where they would be safe; for the
most part without cover and through country swarming with Nationals and
Cristino partisans.
"Riding thus in deep meditation, Rollo, whose gaze was usually so alert,"
did not observe away to the right a couple of horses ridden at speed and
rapidly overtaking their more tired beasts.
"El Sarria, however, did not fail to note them, but, fearing a belated"
"message of recall from General Cabrera, he did not communicate his"
"discovery to his companions, contenting himself with keeping his eye"
upon the approaching riders.
"Rollo was therefore still advancing, his reins flung loosely upon his"
"beast's neck and his whole attitude betokening a melancholy resignation,"
"a couple of lengths before his companions, when a sudden clattering of"
"hoofs startled him. He looked up, and there, on her white mare,"
"well-lathered at girth and bridle, was little Concha Cabezos, sitting"
her panting beast with the grace of the true Andaluse.
Her hair was a little ruffled by the wind. Her cheeks and lips were
"and may you not sell that which is your property? Are not these dogs,"
"the people, your slaves, your property? Yet you stand in cowardly fear"
of a rabble which quakes if you but crook your finger. A like fear of his
subjects cost your father his head. The people will crawl before you if
"you kick them, but let them see that you fear them, and you will learn"
"that there is no cruelty like that of the good people."""
"De Grammont, the French exile, called attention to the French king's"
"successful tyranny, declaring that his master would sell Paris if he"
chose. De Grammont was acting secretly in the French king's interest.
"A weak man easily finds logic to justify the course he desires to take,"
"so Charles turned a deaf ear to Clarendon, and, listening to Castlemain,"
"announced that Dunkirk was for sale. As expected, a strong protest came"
"from the people, but no one is so stubborn as a fool in the wrong, so"
Charles remained firm in his determination.
"Finding that protest would avail nothing, the people of London offered to"
"buy Dunkirk, and began to bid for it against the French king. Louis,"
"knowing that London was a rich city, and believing that its people would"
"run up the price of Dunkirk to an exorbitant figure, took counsel with"
himself--his only adviser--and determined to employ other means than gold
alone to obtain the coveted city.
My first definite knowledge of the French king's new plan to buy Dunkirk
"at his own price came in a letter from Hamilton, which reached me at"
Lilly's house two or three weeks after my return from Dover. Like the
"others, it was written in cipher, but, translated, was as follows:--"
DEAR FRIEND:
"""Your warning letter reached me nearly a week ago, and I thank you for"
"this, in his own words, he ""just lived!  And lived well too, Devil take"
"it, and like one who knew how!"""
"He was a tall, broad-shouldered man of fifty, with a rawlooking face,"
"swollen with drunkenness, and with a dirty yellowish beard. His eyes"
"were large and grey, with an insolent expression of happiness.  He"
"spoke in a bass voice and with a sort of grumbling sound in his throat,"
and he almost always held between his teeth a German china pipe with a
long bowl.  When he was angry the nostrils of his big crooked red nose
"swelled, and his lips trembled, exposing to view two rows of large and"
"wolf-like yellow teeth.  He had long arms, was lame, and always dressed"
"in an old officer's uniform, with a dirty, greasy cap with a red band,"
"a hat without a brim, and ragged felt boots which reached almost to his"
"knees.  In the morning, as a rule, he had a heavy drunken headache, and"
"in the evening he caroused.  However much he drank, he was never drunk,"
and so was always merry.
"In the evenings he received lodgers, sitting on his brickmade bench"
with his pipe in his mouth.
"""Whom have we here?"" he would ask the ragged and tattered object"
"approaching him, who had probably been chucked out of the town for"
"drunkenness, or perhaps for some other reason not quite so simple.  And"
"after the man had answered him, he would say, ""Let me see legal papers"
"in confirmation of your lies.""  And if there were such papers they were"
"shown.  The Captain would then put them in his bosom, seldom taking any"
"interest in them, and would say:"
"""Everything is in order.  Two kopecks for the night, ten kopecks for"
"the week, and thirty kopecks for the month.  Go and get a place for"
"yourself, and see that it is not other people's, or else they will blow"
"you up.  The people that live here are particular."""

"David, the largest interior town of Panama, is the central point of the"
"cattle industry. All around it are woods, or jungles, plentifully"
"interspersed with broad prairies, or llanos, covered with grass, and on"
which no trees grow save here and there a wild fig or a ceibo. Cattle
"graze on the llanos, sleek reddish beasts with spreading horns like our"
Texas cattle. There are no huge herds as on our western ranges. Droves
of from ten to twenty are about the average among the small owners who
rely on the public range for subsistence. The grass is not sufficiently
"nutritious to bring the cattle up to market form, so the small owners"
"sell to the owners of big ranches who maintain potreros, or fattening"
ground sown with better grasses. A range fed steer will fetch $15 to
"$18, and after six or eight months on the potrero it will bring $30 to"
$35 from the cattle shipper at David. Since the cost of feeding a beeve
"for that period is only about one dollar, and as the demand is fairly"
steady the profit of the ranchman is a good one. But like all other
"industries in Panama, this one is pursued in only a retail way. The"
market is great enough to enrich ranchmen who would go into the business
"on a large scale, but for some reason none do."
[Illustration: BOLIVAR PARK AT BOCAS DEL TORO]
Passing from llano to llano the road cuts through the forest which
"towers dense and impenetrable on either side, broken only here and"
there by small clearings made by some native with the indispensable
machete. These in the main are less than four acres. The average
"""I want to see Mr. Jobling, at once,"" Slyne announced to him. And Mr."
"Jobling's ""managing clerk"" looked slowly round, with a snake-like and"
disconcerting effect due to a very long neck and a very low collar.
"""Show Mr. Slyne in immediately, Mullins,"" ordered a pompous voice from"
"within; and Mr. Jobling himself, a blackcoated, portly, important"
"personage there, came bustling out from his private office to welcome"
his visitors.
"""How d'ye do, how d'ye do, Lady Josceline!"" he exclaimed, and cocked an"
arch eyebrow at Sallie's most becoming costume; although the effect he
intended was somewhat impaired by the fact that he was still suffering
"from a black eye, painted over in haste--and by an incompetent artist."
"""I can see now what's been keeping _you_ in Paris!"" he added"
"facetiously, and, having shaken hands with Slyne, who seemed to think"
"that superfluous, turned to receive Captain Dove with the same"
politeness.
"""Phew!"" whistled Mr. Jobling and drew back and stared at the old man."
"""I'd _never_ have recognised you in that rig-out."""
"Captain Dove pulled off a pair of smoked glasses he had been wearing,"
"the better to look him, with offensive intent, in his injured eye. For"
Captain Dove was still enduring much mental as well as physical
discomfort in a disguise which he had only been induced to adopt a
"couple of days before, and after an embittered quarrel with Slyne. The"
stiff white collar round his corded neck was still threatening to choke
him and then cut his throat. He had been infinitely more at his ease in
"his scanty, short-tailed frock-coat and furry top-hat than he was in the"
"somewhat baggy if more becoming black garb he had donned in its place,"
with a soft wide-awake always flapping about his ears.
the signal.
But in the increasing noise of the battle his voice already sounded less
"powerfully than before. A letter to Cardinal Albert of Mayence, 19"
"October 1519, of about the same content as that of Frederick of Saxony"
"written in the preceding spring, was at once circulated by Luther's"
"friends; and by the advocates of conservatism, in spite of the usual"
"protestation, 'I do not know Luther', it was made to serve against"
Erasmus.
It became more and more clear that the mediating and conciliatory
position which Erasmus wished to take up would soon be altogether
"untenable. The inquisitor Jacob Hoogstraten had come from Cologne, where"
"he was a member of the University, to Louvain, to work against Luther"
"there, as he had worked against Reuchlin. On 7 November 1519 the Louvain"
"faculty, following the example of that of Cologne, proceeded to take the"
decisive step: the solemn condemnation of a number of Luther's opinions.
"In future no place could be less suitable to Erasmus than Louvain, the"
citadel of action against reformers. It is surprising that he remained
there another two years.
The expectation that he would be able to speak the conciliating word was
paling. For the rest he failed to see the true proportions. During the
first months of 1520 his attention was almost entirely taken up by his
"own polemics with Lee, a paltry incident in the great revolution. The"
desire to keep aloof got more and more the upper hand of him. In June he
writes to Melanchthon: 'I see that matters begin to look like sedition.
"It is perhaps necessary that scandals occur, but I should prefer not to"
"be the author.' He has, he thinks, by his influence with Wolsey,"
"prevented the burning of Luther's writings in England, which had been"
"ordered. But he was mistaken. The burning had taken place in London, as"
early as 12 May.
We drilled every morning from six o'clock until eight in the fields
outside the New Gate; the others went again at sunset to practise
"their weapons, but I was exempt from this drill, that the women might"
not be left alone. At all times we had our appointed rendezvous in
case of alarm or assault. The Swedish veterans strolled out of the
camp and stood to laugh at our clumsiness. But the excellent order
"which prevailed among them made them favourites, and we let them"
"laugh, and laughed again."
"The Waldgrave, who had long had Duke Bernard's promise, received a"
"regiment of horse, so that he lay in the camp and should have been a"
"contented man, since his strength had come back to him. But to my"
surprise he showed signs of lukewarmness. He seemed little interested
"in the service, and was often at my lady's house in the Ritter"
"Strasse, when he would have been better at his post. At first I set"
"this down to his passion for my lady, and it seemed excusable; but"
within a week I stood convinced that this no longer troubled him. He
"paid scant attention to her, but would sit for hours looking moodily"
into the street. And I--and not I alone--began to watch him closely.
I soon found that Count Hugo was right. The once gallant and splendid
young fellow was a changed man. He was still comely and a brave
"figure, but the spirit in him was quenched. He was nervous, absent,"
irritable. His eyes had a wild look; on strangers he made an
"unfavourable impression. Doubtless, though his wounds had healed,"
there remained some subtle injury that spoiled the man; and often I
"caught my lady looking at him sadly, and knew that I was not the only"
one with cause for mourning.
"But how strange he was we did not know until a certain day, when my"
"lady and I were engaged together over some accounts. It was evening,"
and the three men were away drilling. The house was very quiet.
"""Kyrie Eleison! Christe Eleison! Kyrie Eleison!"""
"A faint cold tremor crept through his veins,--his heart beat"
"violently,--again he vainly strove to open the great door. Was there a"
choir practising inside at this hour of the night? Surely not!
"Then,--from whence had this music its origin? Stooping, he bent his ear"
"to the crevice of the closed portal,--but, as suddenly as they had"
"begun, the harmonies ceased; and all was once more profoundly still."
"Drawing a long, deep breath, he stood for a moment amazed and lost in"
"thought--these sounds, he felt sure, were not of earth but of heaven!"
they had the same ringing sweetness as those he had heard on the Field
"of Ardath! What might they mean to him, here and now? Quick as a flash"
the answer came--DEATH! God had taken pity upon his solitary earth
"wanderings,--and the prayers of Edris had shortened his world-exile and"
"probation! He was to die! and that solemn singing was the warning,--or"
"the promise,--of his approaching end!"
"Yes! it must be so, he decided, as, with a strange, half-sad peace at"
"his heart, he quietly descended the steps of the Dom,-he would perhaps"
"be permitted to finish the work he was at present doing,--and"
"then,--then, the poet-pen would be laid aside forever, chains would be"
"undone, and he would be set at liberty! Such was his fixed idea. Was he"
"glad of the prospect, he asked himself? Yes, and No! For himself he was"
glad; but in these latter days he had come to understand the thousand
"wordless wants and aspirations of mankind,--wants and aspirations to"
which only the Poet can give fitting speech; he had begun to see how
much can be done to cheer and raise and ennoble the world by even ONE
"true, brave, earnest, and unselfish worker,--and he had attained to"
such a height in sympathetic comprehension of the difficulties and
"drawbacks of others, that he had ceased to consider himself at all in"
"the question, either with regard to the Present or the immortal"
"""Bien, m'sieur,"" answered the woman, disappearing and closing the door"
after her.
My object in dismissing her was to make a thorough search of the
"apartment, in order to discover whether any of Yolande's private"
possessions were there.  She had been denounced by Kaye and Anderson as
"a spy, and it occurred to me that I might possibly discover the truth."
But she was dead.  The painful fact seemed absolutely incredible.
"The room was not a large one, but well furnished, with considerable"
"taste and elegance.  There was the broad, silk-covered couch, upon which"
Yolande had sat in the full possession of health and spirits only a
"couple of hours before; the skin rug, upon which her tiny foot had been"
"stretched so coquettishly; the small table, by which she had stood"
supporting herself after I had made the fatal announcement that Wolf was
in Paris.
As I stood there the whole of that strangely dramatic scene occurred to
me.  Yet she was dead--dead!  She had died with her secret in her heart.
"At any moment Dick Deane might arrive, but I desired to be the first to"
"make an examination of the room, and with that object crossed to the"
"little escritoire of inlaid olive-wood, one of those rather gimcrack"
pieces of furniture manufactured along the Ligurian coast for
unsuspecting winter visitors.  It was the only piece of incongruous
"furniture in the room, all the rest being genuine Louis Quatorze."
"One or two letters bearing conspicuous coats-of-arms were lying there,"
but all were notes of a private nature from one or other of her friends.
"One was an invitation to Vichy from the Baronne Deland, wife of the"
"great Paris financier; another, signed ""Rose,"" spoke of the gaiety of"
Cairo and the dances at Shepheard's during the past winter; while a
"And, when they had read, they all looked at him again, not as they had"
"looked before, but, it seemed to him, with a curious wonder, half"
"mocking, half pitying, as one looks at a man who does not know the thing"
that touches him most nearly. He glanced up at the galleries: there too
was the ubiquitous sheet; the Chief Justice and the President of the
"Legislative Council were cheek by jowl over it, and it fell lightly from"
"Lady Eynesford's slim fingers, to be caught at eagerly by Eleanor"
Scaife.
"""What is it?"" he whispered impatiently to Norburn; but his absorbed"
"disciple only bewilderedly murmured ""What?"" and the Premier could not"
pause to tell him.
Now followed what Sir Robert maintained was the greatest feat of oratory
"he had ever witnessed. Gathering his wandering wits together, Medland"
"plunged again whole-heartedly into his speech, and slowly, gradually,"
"almost, it seemed, step by step and man by man, he won back the thoughts"
of his audience. He wrestled with that strange paper rival and overthrew
it. Man after man dropped it; its course was stayed; it fell underfoot
"or fluttered idly down the gangways. The nods ceased, the whispers were"
"hushed, the stir fell and rose no more. Once again he had them, and,"
"inspired by that knowledge, the surest spur of eloquence, there rang"
"from his lips the last burning words, the picture of the vision that"
"ruled his life, the hope for the days that he might not see."
"""Believe!"" he cried, in passionate entreaty, ""believe, and your sons"
"shall surely see!"""
"He sank in his seat, and the last echo of his resonant voice died away."
"First came silence, and then a thunder of applause. Men stood up and"
"waved what they had in their hands, hats or handkerchiefs or papers;"
"women sat with their eyes still on him, or, with a gasp, leant back and"
"good-bye to a caller, when Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as"
"usual, cool, suave, smiling that peculiar little half-smile that women"
found so fascinating.
"Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far; that had been the"
"trouble all along. No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and"
"such lips; it was uncanny. As for his mother, his sisters, and the"
"servants, it was not too much to say they made a young god of him; they"
"worshipped Harold, they forgave him everything; and he had needed some"
forgiving ever since the time when he was thirteen and he had stolen
"his mother’s purse, taken the money, and hidden the purse in the cook’s"
bedroom. Old Mr. Neave struck sharply with his stick upon the pavement
"edge. But it wasn’t only his family who spoiled Harold, he reflected,"
"it was everybody; he had only to look and to smile, and down they went"
before him. So perhaps it wasn’t to be wondered at that he expected the
"office to carry on the tradition. H’m, h’m! But it couldn’t be done. No"
"business—not even a successful, established, big paying concern—could"
be played with. A man had either to put his whole heart and soul into
"it, or it went all to pieces before his eyes...."
And then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole
"thing over to Harold, to retire, and to spend his time enjoying"
himself. Enjoying himself! Old Mr. Neave stopped dead under a group of
ancient cabbage palms outside the Government buildings! Enjoying
himself! The wind of evening shook the dark leaves to a thin airy
"cackle. Sitting at home, twiddling his thumbs, conscious all the while"
"that his life’s work was slipping away, dissolving, disappearing"
"through Harold’s fine fingers, while Harold smiled...."
"“Why will you be so unreasonable, father? There’s absolutely no need"
for you to go to the office. It only makes it very awkward for us when
people persist in saying how tired you’re looking. Here’s this huge
From its budding near the Panama Canal to its finish in the alimentary
canal of its final purchaser the banana has to be handled systematically
and swiftly.
[Illustration: BRINGING HOME THE CROCODILE]
[Illustration: A MORNING’S SHOOTING]
To establish this machinery the United Fruit Company has invested more
"than $190,000,000 in the tropics--doubtless the greatest investment next"
to the Panama Canal made in that Zone. How much of this is properly a
"Panama investment can hardly be told, since for example the Fruit"
Company’s ships which ply to Colon and Bocas del Toro call at other
banana ports as well. These ships are peculiarly attractive in design
"and in their clothing of snowy white, and I do not think there is any"
"American who, seeing them in Caribbean ports, does not wonder at the"
sight of the British flag flying at the stern. His astonishment is not
allayed when he learns that the company has in all more than 100 ships
"of various sizes, and nearly all of British registry. The transfer of"
that fleet alone to American registry would be a notable and most
desirable step.
[Illustration: ON CROCODILE CREEK
Each spot looking like a leaf on the water is the nose of a submerged
saurian]
From officials of the company I learned that they would welcome the
"opportunity to transfer their ships to American registry, except for"
certain requirements of the navigation laws which make such a change
hazardous. Practically all the ownership of the ships is vested in
"Americans, but to fly the British flag is for them a business necessity."
The most angry of them all was Curly Kollock. He had double cause for
"wrath, having received that morning a letter from the very town of"
Lancaster toward which they were striving so hard to push the drive.
"Brief it was, and to the point. He had played the traitor, Bill wrote"
scathingly. There was only one way by which he could rid himself of the
"stigma, and return to the good graces of the gang. He must come at once"
"to a certain house on the outskirts of the town, prepared to place"
himself absolutely in his brother’s hands.
When the younger Kollock read those lines he swore roundly. That even
Bill should dare write in such a manner made him rage. He was no man’s
"slave, and there were bounds beyond which even a brother could step. He"
"was on the point of asking for time off to come to a definite, final"
settlement with the crowd when the attempted shooting occurred. At first
"this cowardly deed only added to his rage, but swiftly in its wake came"
unwonted gravity.
"Disagreeable, even serious, as all those other persecutions had been,"
not one of them held the weight of this last culminating effort to put
Bob Bainbridge out of the running. That Bill was mixed up in it Curly
"had no doubt, and the realization frightened him. He had always looked"
"up to his older brother with admiration and a little awe, and he could"
not bear now to think of him mixed up in anything so contemptible. There
"was the danger involved, too, and altogether the youngster felt as if he"
must see Bill at once and try to make him cut the gang and get away. His
"efforts might have no effect, but there was at least a chance."
"That night--or rather early in the morning, while it was still pitch"
black--he slipped quietly out of camp without a word to any one. He
"reached Lancaster at four in the afternoon, having made most of the"
journey in a scow doing about six miles an hour. Going at once to the
"concern her. The death of her mother had been a stunning shock, and"
"when she crossed over to the hotel--what irony, by the bye, to think"
"she had been born there thirty-nine years ago, in the old inn that"
had preceded the twice rebuilt hotel!--when she crossed the street
"with Minna, it had been with blazing, tearless eyes and the desire"
"to take the hotel manager and his minions by the coat collar, fling"
"_them_ into the street, and assert her right to go up to her room."
"But now her violence was spent and she was a broken, weeping woman"
"as she sat all night by the bedside of her dead mother, holding the"
"cold hand, imprinting kisses on the dead face which was now that of"
a saintly person with nothing of the reprobate in its lineaments.

The burial for various reasons had to take place in the Cemetery of
"St. Josse-ten-Noode, near the shuddery National Shooting Range where"
Edith Cavell and numerous Belgian patriots had recently been
"executed. Minna von Stachelberg left her hospital, with some one"
"else in charge, and insisted on accompanying Vivie to the interment."
"This might have been purely ""laïc""; not on account of any harsh"
dislike to the religious ceremony on Vivie's part; only due to the
fact that she knew no priest or pastor. But there appeared at the
grave-side to make a very suitable and touching discourse and to
"utter one or two heartfelt prayers, a Belgian Baptist minister, a"
relation of Mme. Trouessart.
Waterloo left many curious things behind it. Not only a tea-shop or
"two; but a Nonconformist nucleus, that intermarried, as Sergeant"
"Walker or Walcker had done, with Belgian women and left descendants"
"who in the third generation--and by inherent vigour, thrift,"
matrimony and conversion--had built up quite a numerous
"congregation, which even grew large enough and rich enough to"
"fell down dead upon the stage, and so was carried thence away by"
"his lords and gentlemen, and then the music ceased. Hereby was"
"signified, that as glass by nature holdeth no poison, but is clear"
"and may easily be seen through, ne boweth by any art; so a faithful"
"counsellor holdeth no treason, but is plain and open, ne yieldeth"
"to any indiscreet affection, but giveth wholesome counsel, which"
the ill advised prince refuseth. The delightful gold filled with
"poison betokeneth flattery, which under fair seeming of pleasant"
"words beareth deadly poison, which destroyeth the prince that"
"receiveth it. As befel in the two brethren, Ferrex and Porrex, who,"
"refusing the wholesome advice of grave counsellors, credited these"
"young parasites, and brought to themselves death and destruction"
thereby.
But it is time to set forth the plot in more detail. The importance of
_Gorboduc_ as an example of English 'classical' tragedy prompts us to
"follow it through, scene by scene."
"_Act I, Scene 1._--Queen Videna discovers to her favourite and elder"
"son, Ferrex, the king's intention, grievous in her eyes, of dividing his"
kingdom equally between his two sons. _Scene 2._--King Gorboduc submits
"his plan to the consideration of his three counsellors, whose wise and"
lengthy reasonings he listens to but elects to disregard.
"_Act II, Scene 1._--The division having been carried out, Ferrex, in his"
"part of the kingdom, is prompted by evil counsel to suspect aggressive"
"rivalry from his brother, and decides to collect forces for his own"
defence. _Scene 2._--Ferrex's misguided precautions having been
"maliciously represented to Porrex as directed against his power, that"
prince resolves upon an immediate invasion of his brother's realm.
_Act III._--The news of these counter-moves and of the imminent
you would heed no warnings.  The end should have been plain to you from
"the beginning, an you would not mend your ways.  I told you how it needs"
must be; and now the time has come when you see it for yourself.  Worse
"men are put in the parts that you excelled in, because they can be"
depended upon.  No drunkard can ever become great.  Put that in your
"pipe and smoke it, Lionel Field."""
"At the sound of this new voice, speaking out of the shadows of the"
"ingle-nook, a great hush had fallen upon the room.  Grey leaned forward"
"to obtain a view of the speaker, and the firelight played upon the"
striking features and iron-gray hair of a very remarkable-looking old
"man of leonine aspect, whose voice was of that penetrating quality which"
makes itself heard without being raised; and it was plain that something
"in the personality of the man lifted him above his fellows, for all"
"listened in silence whilst he spoke, and even the arrogant young actor"
looked for the moment abashed.
"""Who is it?"" whispered Grey to the man next him; and the answer came"
"readily, though spoken in a cautious whisper."
"""His name is Jonathan Wylde.  Once he, too, was a famous actor; but long"
"illness crippled his limbs, and he has fallen into poverty.  He is"
"always called the Old Lion, and methinks the name suits him well.  He is"
"a very lion for courage, else would he not dare to rebuke Master Lionel"
"Field.  For he is one who is ready with his fist, or with knife or"
"bludgeon, and it is ill work meeting him when he is in his cups."""
Grey looked with interest and attention at the old man in the shadows;
"but he was leaning back again, and spoke no more.  The talk surged round"
him again from the rest; they spoke of the plays that were being enacted
"at the various theatres, and of those who were playing the various"
_rôles_.  Some of them stood up and rolled forth bits of Congreve’s
The inhabitants of the street were divided into two parties according
"to their sympathies.  One was in favour of Kuvalda, who was thought ""a"
"good soldier, clever, and courageous,"" the other was convinced of the"
"fact that the teacher was ""superior"" to Kuvalda.  The latter's admirers"
"were those who were known to be drunkards, thieves, and murderers, for"
whom the road from beggary to prison was inevitable.  But those who
"respected the teacher were men who still had expectations, still hoped"
"for better things, who were eternally occupied with nothing, and who"
were nearly always hungry.
The nature of the teacher's and Kuvalda's relations towards the street
may be gathered from the following:
Once in the eating-house they were discussing the resolution passed by
"the Corporation regarding the main street, viz., that the inhabitants"
"were to fill up the pits and ditches in the street, and that neither"
manure nor the dead bodies of domestic animals should be used for the
"purpose, but only broken tiles, etc., from the ruins of other houses."
"""Where am I going to get these same broken tiles and bricks?  I could"
"not get sufficient bricks together to build a hen-house,"" plaintively"
"said Mokei Anisimoff, a man who hawked kalaches (a sort of white bread)"
which were baked by his wife.
"""Where can you get broken bricks and lime rubbish?  Take bags with you,"
and go and remove them from the Corporation buildings. They are so old
"that they are of no use to anyone, and you will thus be doing two good"
"deeds; firstly, by repairing the main street; and secondly, by adorning"
"the city with a new Corporation building."""
"""If you want horses get them from the Lord Mayor, and take his three"
"daughters, who seem quite fit for harness. Then destroy the house of"
Edward refuses hot bread at breakfast. His hostess asks whether he
"likes it. “Yes, I am extremely fond of it.” “Why did you refuse it?”"
“Because I know that my papa does not approve of my eating it. Am I to
"disobey a Father and Mother I love so well, and forget my duty, because"
"they are a long way off? I would not touch the cake, were I sure nobody"
"could see me. I myself should know it, and that would be sufficient.”"
"“Nobly replied!” exclaimed Mrs. C. “Act always thus, and you must be"
"happy, for although the whole world should refuse the praise that is"
"due, you must enjoy the approbation of your conscience, which is beyond"
anything else.”
Here is a quotation of the same kind from Mrs. Sherwood:
"“Tender-souled little creatures, desolated by a sense of sin, if"
they did but eat a spoonful of cupboard jam without Mamma's express
"permission.... Would a modern Lucy, jealous of her sister Emily's doll,"
break out thus easily into tearful apology for her guilt?--‘I know
"it is wicked in me to be sorry that Emily is happy, but I feel that"
I cannot help it.’ And would a modern mother retort with heartfelt
"joy?--'My dear child, I am glad you have confessed. Now I shall tell"
you why you feel this wicked sorrow'--proceeding to an account of the
depravity of human nature so unredeemed by comfort for a childish mind
of common intelligence that one can scarcely imagine the interview
ending in anything less tragic than a fit of juvenile hysteria.”
Description of a Good Boy. “A good boy is dutiful to his Father and
"Mother, obedient to his master and loving to his playfellows. He is"
"diligent in learning his book, and takes a pleasure in improving"
himself in everything that is worthy of praise. He rises early in
"the morning, makes himself clean and decent, and says his prayers."
"He loves to hear good advice, is thankful to those who give it and"
"the four turrets, and at the side batteries. Every few minutes they"
put through tests which would have shown up at once any wires that had
been tampered with. After the shore party had cleared out about nine
"o'clock on the Thursday, no officer or man was allowed to leave the"
ship without a special permit from the Commander. This was all dead
"against the sanitary regulations of the harbour, but I had the"
"Admiral's authority to break any rules I pleased. By the way, you two"
ought never to have been allowed on board yesterday afternoon--I saw
"you, though you didn't see me; it was contrary to my orders. I spoke"
to the Admiral pretty sharp last night. 'Who is responsible for the
"ship?' says I. 'You or me?' 'You,' says he. 'I leave it at that,' says"
"I."""
"""One moment, Dawson,"" I put in. ""If the shore party had all gone, how"
"was it that I saw Petty Officer Trehayne in the ship?"""
"""He had orders to stay and keep watch--though he didn't know I was on"
"board myself. Two pairs of police eyes are better than one pair, and"
fifty times better than all the Navy eyes in the ship. Of all the
"simple-minded, unsuspicious beggars in the world, give me a pack of"
naval ratings! I wouldn't have one of them for sentries--that is why
"the fifty emergency Marines were sent for."" Dawson's limitless pride"
"in his old Service, and deep contempt for the mere sailor, had come"
back in full flood with the uniform of his Corps.
"""I started my own sentry duty in the dark corner I told you of as soon"
"as I had seen to the arrangements all over the _Malplaquet_, and I was"
"there, with very few breaks of not more than five minutes each for a"
"bite of food, for twenty-six hours. Two Marine sentries took my place"
"whenever I was away. I had my rifle and bayonet, and stood back in a"
corner of a bulkhead where I couldn't be seen. The hours were awful
long; I stood without hardly moving. All the pins and needles out of
up with a typewriter at which the military clerk sat tapping. The
Colonel's personal luggage had been placed in his bedroom. A soldier
was even sweeping up all traces of the invasion of armed men and
making everything tidy. It all seemed like a horrid dream that was
going to end up happily after all. Presently Vivie would wake up
"completely and there would even be no Oberst, no orderly; only the"
peaceful life of the farm that was going on yesterday. Here a sound
of angry voices interrupted her musings. The cows returning by
themselves from the pasture were being intercepted by soldiers who
were trying to secure them. Vivie in her indignation ran out and
"ordered the soldiers off, in English. To her surprise they obeyed"
"silently, but as they sauntered away to their quarters she was"
saddened at seeing them carrying the bodies of most of the turkeys
and fowls and even the corpse of the poor tailless peacock. They had
waited for sundown to rob the hen-roosts.
Very much disillusioned she ran to the morning room and burst in on
"the Colonel's dictation to his clerk. ""Excuse me, but if you don't"
keep your soldiers in better order you will have very little to eat
whilst you are here. They are killing and carrying off all our
"poultry."""
The Colonel flushed a little at the peremptory way in which she
"spoke, but without replying went out and shouted a lot of orders in"
German. His orderly summoned soldiers from the barn and together
they drove the cows into the cow-sheds. All the Flemish servants
"having disappeared in a panic, the Germans had to milk the cows that"
"evening; and Vivie, assisted by the orderly, cooked the evening"
"meal in the kitchen. He was, like his Colonel, a Saxon, a"
"pleasant-featured, domesticated man, who explained civilly in the"
Thuringian dialect--though to Vivie there could be no discrimination
"between varieties of High German--that the Sachsen folk were ""Eines"
"for company, and a few guineas in our pockets, need not fear the future;"
and I trow it will be well for you to be quit for ever of my Lord
Sandford’s company.  I liked him not greatly for your friend; I hate him
with a goodly hatred since he shows himself your foe.  Shall we turn our
"backs upon him and upon London town, and seek our fortunes with the army"
"over the water, where his Grace of Marlborough will give you welcome?"""
"""I scarce know what the future will bring for me, Dicon,"" was the reply,"
"spoken gravely, yet with a certain listless indifference not lost upon"
"the servant; ""I have made no plans as yet.  Let us see what this day"
"brings forth first."""
"""I wager it will fill our pockets anew with gold!"""
"""I will not touch their gold!"" spoke Grey with eyes that suddenly"
"flashed fire.  ""I have cancelled all my wagers.  I will take nothing at"
their hands. I will ride Don Carlos and ride my best for mine own honour
and that of the good steed I shall bestride; but their money will I not
"touch.  I have done with all that.  Nay, stare not in such amaze, good"
"Dicon.  I have not taken leave of my senses; rather, I trow, I have come"
"to my better mind.  Now get me somewhat to eat here, and then we will to"
"the stables to see my beauty. This match once over, we turn a new page"
"in our life’s story.  Who knows what the next will be?"""
It was not much that Grey could eat.  The three days which had passed
"since he and Lord Sandford had come to an understanding, which was"
"well-nigh a rupture, had left a mark upon him.  Moreover there was a"
"weary ache at his heart which he did not fully understand, and which was"
harder to bear than aught beside.  Dimly he knew that it had some
connection with the Lady Geraldine Adair; but he feared to search too
deeply into that matter.  She was as far removed from him as the moon in
"the heavens, and he believed her plighted to another, and that one a man"
"The Captain's eyes were alight with happiness, and his face red with"
"excitement.  He worked upon Vaviloff's greed, and urging upon him the"
"importance of immediate action in the matter, went away in a very"
joyful and happy frame of mind.
*      *      *      *      *
"In the evening everyone was told of the Captain's discovery, and they"
"all began to discuss Petunikoff's future predicament, painting in vivid"
colours his excitement and astonishment on the day the court messenger
handed him the copy of the summons.  The Captain felt himself quite a
hero.  He was happy and all his friends highly pleased. The heap of
dark and tattered figures that lay in the courtyard made noisy
"demonstrations of pleasure. They all knew the merchant, Petunikoff, who"
"passed them very often, contemptuously turning up his eyes and giving"
them no more attention than he bestowed on the other heaps of rubbish
"lying on the ground.  He was well fed, and that exasperated them still"
more; and now how splendid it was that one of themselves had struck a
hard blow at the selfish merchant's purse!  It gave them all the
greatest pleasure.  The Captain's discovery was a powerful instrument
in their hands.  Every one of them felt keen animosity towards all
"those who were well fed and well dressed, but in some of them this"
feeling was only beginning to develop. Burning interest was felt by
"those ""creatures that once were men"" in the prospective fight between"
"Kuvalda and Petunikoff, which they already saw in imagination."
For a fortnight the inhabitants of the dosshouse awaited the further
"development of events, but Petunikoff never once visited the building."
It was known that he was not in town and that the copy of the petition
had not yet been handed to him.  Kuvalda raged at the delays of the
civil court.  It is improbable that anyone had ever awaited the
merchant with such impatience as did this bare-footed brigade.
"On seeing him, they would come forward from all corners of the"
"court-yard, drunk, or suffering from drunken headache, dishevelled,"
"tattered, miserable, and pitiable.  Then would come the barrel-like,"
"stout Aleksei Maksimovitch Simtsoff, formerly Inspector of Woods and"
"Forests, under the Department of Appendages, but now trading in"
"matches, ink, blacking, and lemons. He was an old man of sixty, in a"
"canvas overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat, the greasy borders of which hid"
"his stout fat red face.  He had a thick white beard, out of which a"
"small red nose turned gaily heavenwards.  He had thick, crimson lips"
"and watery, cynical eyes.  They called him ""Kubar,"" a name which well"
"described his round figure and buzzing speech.  After him, Kanets"
"appeared from some corner--a dark, sad-looking, silent drunkard: then"
"the former governor of the prison, Luka Antonovitch Martyanoff, a man"
"who existed on ""remeshok,"" ""trilistika,"" and ""bankovka,""* and many such"
"cunning games, not much appreciated by the police.  He would throw his"
"hard and oft-scourged body on the grass beside the teacher, and,"
"turning his eyes round and scratching his head, would ask in a hoarse,"
"bass voice, ""May I?"""
"*Note by translator.--Well-known games of chance, played by the lower"
"classes.  The police specially endeavour to stop them, but"
unsuccessfully.
"Then appeared Pavel Solntseff, a man of thirty years of age, suffering"
from consumption.  The ribs of his left side had been broken in a
"quarrel, and the sharp, yellow face, like that of a fox, always wore a"
"malicious smile.  The thin lips, when opened, exposed two rows of"
"decayed black teeth, and the rags on his shoulders swayed backwards and"
forwards as if they were hung on a clothes pole.  They called him
"""Abyedok.""  He hawked brushes and bath brooms of his own manufacture,"
good strong brushes made from a peculiar kind of grass.
own daughter had once belonged to another--father.  He had told the
"lawyer in a measured voice that he would see the fellow damned first, and"
"had directed a deed of separation to be prepared, which should provide"
for the complete payment of Fiorsen's existing debts on condition that he
"left Gyp and the baby in peace.  After telling Gyp this, he took an"
opportunity of going to the extempore nursery and standing by the baby's
"cradle.  Until then, the little creature had only been of interest as"
"part of Gyp; now it had for him an existence of its own--this tiny,"
"dark-eyed creature, lying there, watching him so gravely, clutching his"
"finger.  Suddenly the baby smiled--not a beautiful smile, but it made on"
Winton an indelible impression.
"Wishing first to settle this matter of the deed, he put off going down to"
"Mildenham; but ""not trusting those two scoundrels a yard""--for he never"
failed to bracket Rosek and Fiorsen--he insisted that the baby should not
"go out without two attendants, and that Gyp should not go out alone.  He"
carried precaution to the point of accompanying her to Monsieur Harmost's
"on the Friday afternoon, and expressed a wish to go in and shake hands"
with the old fellow.  It was a queer meeting.  Those two had as great
difficulty in finding anything to say as though they were denizens of
"different planets. And indeed, there ARE two planets on this earth!"
"When, after a minute or so of the friendliest embarrassment, he had"
"retired to wait for her, Gyp sat down to her lesson."
Monsieur Harmost said quietly:
"""Your letter was very kind, my little friend--and your father is very"
"kind.  But, after all, it was a compliment your husband paid me.""  His"
"smile smote Gyp; it seemed to sum up so many resignations.  ""So you stay"
"again with your father!""  And, looking at her very hard with his"
"melancholy brown eyes, ""When will you find your fate, I wonder?"""
of Montaigne. In Erasmus's writings that ideal wish ever recurs in the
"shape of a friendly walk, followed by a meal in a garden-house. It is"
"found as an opening scene of the _Antibarbari_, in the numerous"
"descriptions of meals with Colet, and the numerous _Convivia_ of the"
_Colloquies_. Especially in the _Convivium religiosum_ Erasmus has
"elaborately pictured his dream, and it would be worth while to compare"
"it, on the one hand with Thélème, and on the other with the fantastic"
design of a pleasure garden which Bernard Palissy describes. The little
Dutch eighteenth-century country-seats and garden-houses in which the
national spirit took great delight are the fulfilment of a purely
Erasmian ideal. The host of the _Convivium religiosum_ says: 'To me a
"simple country-house, a nest, is pleasanter than any palace, and, if he"
"be king who lives in freedom and according to his wishes, surely I am"
king here'.
Life's true joy is in virtue and piety. If they are Epicureans who live
"pleasantly, then none are more truly Epicureans than they who live in"
holiness and piety.
The ideal joy of life is also perfectly idyllic in so far that it
requires an aloofness from earthly concerns and contempt for all that is
sordid. It is foolish to be interested in all that happens in the world;
"to pride oneself on one's knowledge of the market, of the King of"
"England's plans, the news from Rome, conditions in Denmark. The sensible"
"old man of the _Colloquium Senile_ has an easy post of honour, a safe"
"mediocrity, he judges no one and nothing and smiles upon all the world."
"Quiet for oneself, surrounded by books--that is of all things most"
desirable.
On the outskirts of this ideal of serenity and harmony numerous flowers
"of aesthetic value blow, such as Erasmus's sense of decorum, his great"
"need of kindly courtesy, his pleasure in gentle and obliging treatment,"
Somehow as she sat there it seemed to Mrs. Warren it was going for
her to be the last hour of fully conscious life--fully conscious and
yet a curious mingling in it of the past and present. She had sat
"here in the middle of the 'seventies with Vivie's father, the young"
"Irish seminarist, her lover for six months. He had a vague interest"
"in botany, and during his convalescence after his typhoid fever,"
"when she was still his nurse, not yet his mistress, she used to"
bring him here to rest and to enjoy the aspect of these ferns and
palms. What a strange variety of men she had known. Some she had
"loved, more or less; some she had exploited frankly. Some--like"
"George Crofts and Baxendale Strangeways--she had feared, though in"
her manner she had tried to conceal her dread of their violence.
"Well! she had taken a lot of money off the rich, but she had never"
plundered the poor. Her greatest conquest--and that when she was a
woman of forty--was the monarch of this very country which now lay
crushed under the Kaiser's heel. For a few months he had taken a
"whimsical liking to her handsome face, well-preserved figure, and"
amusing cockney talk. But he had employed her rather as the mistress
"of his menus plaisirs, as his recruiting agent. He had rewarded her"
handsomely. Now it was all in the dust: her beautiful Villa
Beau-séjour a befouled barrack for German soldiers. She herself a
"homeless woman, repudiated by the respectable British and Americans"
more or less interned in this unhappy city.
Not much more than a year ago she had been one of the most respected
"persons in Brussels, with a large income derived from safe"
investments. Now all she had for certain was something over three
thousand pounds in bank notes that might turn out next month to be
worthless paper. And was she certain even of them? Had Vivie before
"they left the hotel remembered to put some, at least, of this"
"precious sum on her person? Suppose, whilst they were out, looking"
"Painted red, as if with blood, it looked like a cruel machine which,"
"though not working, opened a row of deep, hungry, gaping jaws, as if"
ready to devour and swallow anything.  The grey wooden eating-house of
"Vaviloff, with its bent roof covered with patches, leaned against one"
"of the brick walls of the factory, and seemed as if it were some large"
form of parasite clinging to it.  The Captain was thinking that they
would very soon be making new houses to replace the old building.
"""They will destroy the dosshouse even,"" he reflected.  ""It will be"
"necessary to look out for another, but such a cheap one is not to be"
found.  It seems a great pity to have to leave a place to which one is
"accustomed, though it will be necessary to go, simply because some"
"merchant or other thinks of manufacturing candles and soap.""  And the"
Captain felt that if he could only make the life of such an enemy
"miserable, even temporarily, oh! with what pleasure he would do it!"
"Yesterday, Ivan Andreyevitch Petunikoff was in the dosshouse yard with"
his son and an architect.  They measured the yard and put small wooden
"sticks in various places, which, after the exit of Petunikoff and at"
"the order of the Captain, Meteor took out and threw away.  To the eyes"
of the Captain this merchant appeared small and thin.  He wore a long
"garment like a frock-coat, a velvet cap, and high, well-cleaned boots."
"He had a thin face with prominent cheekbones, a wedge-shaped greyish"
"beard, and a high forehead seamed with wrinkles from beneath which"
"shone two narrow, blinking, and observant grey eyes ... a sharp,"
"gristly nose, a small mouth with thin lips ... altogether his"
"appearance was pious, rapacious, and respectably wicked. ""Cursed"
"cross-bred fox and pig!"" swore the Captain under his breath, recalling"
his first meeting with Petunikoff. The merchant came with one of the
"town councillors to buy the house, and seeing the Captain asked his"
companion:
"""Is this your lodger?"""
"where the _Malplaquet_ was fitting out, and we left the rest to our"
personal charms.
"Cary was right. The Commander was a very fine fellow, an English naval"
officer of the best type. He confirmed the views I had frequently
heard expressed by others of his profession that no hatred exists
between English and German sailors. They leave that to middle-aged
"civilians who write for newspapers. The German Navy, in his opinion,"
"was ""a jolly fine Service,"" worthy in high courage and skill to"
contest with us the supremacy of the seas. He had been through the
China troubles as a lieutenant in the _Monmouth_--afterwards sunk by
"German shot off Coronel--knew von Spee, von Mueller, and other officers"
"of the Pacific Squadron, and spoke of them with enthusiasm. ""They sunk"
some of our ships and we wiped out theirs. That was all in the way of
business. We loved them in peace and we loved them in war. They were
splendidly loyal to us out in China--von Spee actually transferred
some of his ships to the command of our own senior officer so as to
"avoid any clash of control--and when it came to fighting, they fought"
like gentlemen. I grant you that their submarine work against merchant
"ships has been pretty putrid, but I don't believe that was the choice"
of their Navy. They got their orders from rotten civilians like Kaiser
"Bill."" Imagine if you can the bristling moustache of the Supreme War"
Lord could he have heard himself described as a civilian!
"Our guest had commanded a destroyer in the Jutland battle, and assured"
us that the handling of the German battle squadrons had been masterly.
"""They punished us heavily for just so long as they were superior in"
"strength, and then they slipped away before Jellicoe could get his"
blow in. They kept fending us off with torpedo attacks until the night
"came down, and then clean vanished. We got in some return smacks after"
"dark at stragglers, but it was very difficult to say how much damage"
"we did. Not much, I expect. Still it was a good battle, as decisive in"

with the greatest difficulty.

"When heaven gave her a second child, a guard of twice as many men as had"
first stood watch was again set about her; yet everything happened as
"before, only that this time the foster-mother said to her: ""Now you"
"shall grieve as I did when you let the moon slip out!"" The queen wept"
and pleaded--for when the foster-mother was there she could speak--but
without avail. Now the old queen insisted that she be burned. But the
prince once more succeeded in begging her free. When heaven gave her a
"third child, a three-fold guard was set about her. The foster-mother"
"came while the guard slept, took the child, cut its little finger, and"
"rubbed some of the blood on the queen's mouth. ""Now,"" said she, ""you"
"shall grieve just as I did when you let the sun slip out!"" And now the"
"prince could in no way save her, she was to be and should be burned."
"But at the very moment when they were leading her to the stake, the"
foster-mother appeared with all three children; the two older ones she
"led by the hand, the youngest she carried on her arm. She stepped up to"
"the young queen and said: ""Here are your children, for now I give them"
"back to you. I am the Virgin Mary, and the grief that you have felt is"
"the same grief that I felt aforetimes, when you had let the star, the"
moon and the sun slip out. Now you have been punished for that which you
"did, and from now on the power of speech is restored to you!"""
"The happiness which then filled the prince and princess may be imagined,"
"but cannot be described. They lived happily together ever after, and"
from that time forward even the prince's mother was very fond of the
"jealousy swept over him; and when I told him of my resolution, I trow"
"that his suspicions received confirmation.  I did not see it then, but I"
"see it now.  He thought I left him to pursue my ends alone, and,"
"perchance, to seek to win the lady of his choice.  But he spoke nothing"
"of this—only insisted that for this week my engagements should be kept,"
"and that after to-day’s race I might go my own way, an I was so"
resolved.  He was not unkindly; yet there was something strange and
"stern in his bearing and language, and you have seen how his imperious"
temper and will sweep all before them.  I myself was strangely dazed and
something sorrowful.  I scarce do know why my heart was so heavy within
me.  I let him have his way; and you behold what that way has been.  I

"""It is a shame!  Would I could take my horsewhip to him—"""
"""Nay, nay, good Dicon; be not so wroth,"" spoke Grey calmly and quietly."
"""In sooth, I know not that I owe him aught but thanks.  When all is said"
"and done, it was but ill-gotten gain.  I would sooner face life with"
"none of it upon me.  I had a few guineas to start with—well, it was more"
"than a few; yet had I spent my time in London, I should have had but"
"little left by now.  I have learned many lessons, and I shall start"

"he sprang upstairs, three steps at a time, and broke impetuously in"
"upon Alwyn, who, seated at a table covered with papers, looked up with"
a surprised smile at the abrupt fashion of his entrance. In a few
minutes he had disburdened himself of the whole story of the

study of movement in normal and morbid sleep has been contributed by
"Segre ('Contributo alla Conoscenza dei Movimenti del Sonno,' _Archivio di"

"[Footnote 78: This question is, for instance, asked by F. H. Bradley ('On"
"the Failure of Movement in Dreams,' _Mind_, 1894, p. 373). The explanation"
he prefers is that the dream vision is out of relation to the very dimly
"conscious actual position of the body, so that the information necessary"
to complete the idea of the movement is wanting. Only as regards the less
"complicated movements of lips, tongue, or finger, when the motor idea is"
"in harmony with the actual position of the body movements, does movement"
take place. We have no means of distinguishing the real world from the
world of our vision; 'our images thus move naturally to realise themselves
in the world of our real limbs. But the world and its arrangement is for
"the moment out of connection with our ideas, and hence the attempt at"
motion for the most part must fail.' It is quite true that this conflict
"is an important factor in dreaming, but it fails to apply to the large"
number of movements which we dream of actually doing.]
[Footnote 79: The action of some drugs produces a state in this respect
resembling that which prevails in dreams. 'Under the influence of a large
"dose of haschisch,' Professor Stout remarks (_Analytic Psychology_, vol."
"i. p. 14), 'I found myself totally unable to distinguish between what"
"I actually did and saw, and what I merely thought about.' Not only are"
"the motor and sensory activities relatively dormant, but the central"
"activity is perfectly able, and content, to dispense with their services."

"Vivie declined any such propositions. ""I have told you already, and"
"often,"" she said, ""I am deeply grateful for all you have done for"
my mother and me. We might have been in a far more uncomfortable
position but for your kindness. But I cannot in any way associate
myself with the German policy here. I cannot pretend for a moment to
condone what you do in this country. If I were a Belgian woman I
should probably have been shot long ago for assassinating some
Prussian official--I can hardly see von Bissing pass in his
"automobile, as it is, without wishing I had a bomb. But there it is."
"It is no business of mine. As I can't get away, as you won't let us"
"go out of the country--Switzerland, Holland--and as I don't want to"
"go mad by brooding, find something for me to do that will occupy my"
thoughts: and yet not implicate me with the Germans. Can't I go and
help every day in your hospitals? If you'll continue your kindness

you have done for us. I shall _never_ forget I have met _one true
"German gentleman_--if you'll continue to be as kind as before, you"
will simply give instructions that mother is in no way disturbed or
annoyed. There are Germans staying here who are odious beyond
belief. If they meet my mother outside her room they ask her
insulting questions--whether she can give them the addresses
of--of--light women ... you know the sort of thing. I have always
been outspoken with you. All I ask is that mother shall be allowed
"to stay in her own room while I am out, and have her meals served"
there. But the hotel people are beginning to make a fuss about the
"trouble, the lack of waiters. A word from you--And then if my mind"
was at ease about her I could go out and do some good with the poor
people. They are getting very restive in the Marolles quarter--the
"shocking bad bread, the lack of fuel--Most of all I should like to"

and the scene with Imogen and her foster-brothers in the Forest.
It may not be wholly out of place to add here that the children learned
"and repeated these passages themselves, and that I offered them the"
same advice as I do to all Story-tellers. I discussed quite openly
"with them the method I considered best, trying to make them see that"
simplicity of delivery was not only the most beautiful but the most
"effective means to use; and, by the end of a few months, when they"
"had been allowed to experiment and express themselves, they began"
"to see that mere ranting was not force, and that a sense of reserve"
power is infinitely more impressive and inspiring than mere external
presentation.
"I encouraged them to criticise each other for the common good, and"
"sometimes I read a few lines with over-emphasis and too much gesture,"
"which they were at liberty to point out, so that they might avoid the"
same error.
A very good collection of poems for this purpose of narrative is to be
found in:

Published by A. and C. Black.

kindly into the bargain.
"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas"
than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast. And immediately
"after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and"
"he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet"
"been. Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was"
covered with switches; but they were much larger and longer than at the
place where he had first been. And they were much needed; for there were
"a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had"
first seen.
"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred"
"dollars for her, and that without any haggling. But when he had sailed"
"off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast. And the"
"storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in"
"which he had never been. Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the"
table was also covered with switches; but every switch was a yard and a
"half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that"
"they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for"
"there were great, ugly rats by the thousand. Only with toil and trouble"
could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a
"while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats. Then the cat"
"was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace."
They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; and for a
long time he refused; but at last he promised that they should have her
"for three hundred dollars. And they paid him, and thanked him, and"
blessed him into the bargain.
"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the"
"boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him. ""Well, he"

"by the vastness and splendor of the building, natural as it is to do"
so when standing under this matchless dome. The four huge piers which
support the dome are used as shrines for the four great relics of the
"church, viz.: 1. The lance of St. Longinus, the soldier who pierced the"
Saviour's side; 2. A portion of the true cross; 3. The napkin of St.
"Veronica, containing the miraculous impression of our Lord's face; and"
4. The head of the apostle Andrew.
"I did not see these relics myself, as I was in the East when they were"
"exhibited, but on April 11th, the day before Easter, other members of"
"my party did, that is, they saw all of them but Andrew's head, and"
from a letter written me by the youngest of my correspondents in my
"own family, giving not only description, but drawings of the spear"
"head, the cross and the handkerchief in their several frames, I infer"
"that, notwithstanding the great height of the Veronica balcony from"
"which they are exhibited, my young correspondent and his companions"
fared better in the matter of a good view than Fritz in _Chronicles
"of the Schönberg Cotta Family_, who says: ""To-day we gazed on the"

"of the cross. We had looked forward to this sight for days, for seven"

Sandford had hoped that he might then and there break his neck—a thing
which might very well have happened.
"There was a crowd round the spot now, and great horror was expressed by"
"many at sight of the unsuspected well, no voice being louder than Lord"
Sandford’s in proclaiming astonishment and indignation. But Grey took no
"notice of the clamour, only busying himself about his horse; and"
"presently, with some difficulty, the sagacious and docile creature was"
"got out, and it appeared that no limb was broken, though one hock was"
"deeply cut, and one shoulder badly strained."
"Grey stood in silent thought awhile, his hand upon the neck of his"
"favourite, who stood with drooping head and dejected mien, as though"
wondering whether he would ever be whole and sound again.  Dick was
"binding up the wound, his face like a thunder-cloud. A knot of persons"
of all ranks stood watching at a little distance; but Grey had
"courteously waved away all proffers of help, and indicated that he"
desired no attentions.

"should come to my kinsman’s ears, give him what is due in money, and I"
will repay you.  Old Jock Jarvis will be your friend.  He will rejoice
"in your company and give you house-room with him, and it is not so far"

loaves of bread; and I saw with my own eyes a list of a hundred and
"thirty-eight bakehouses. The roar of the ways, choked with soldiers"
"and citizens, the babel of strange tongues, the clamour of bells and"
"trumpets, deafened us. The constant crowding and pushing and halting"
turned our heads. I forgot my grief and my hope too. Who but a madman
would look to find a single face where thousands gazed from the
"windows? or could deem himself important with this swarming, teeming"
hive before him? Steve stared stupidly about him; I rode dazed and
"perplexed. The troopers laughed at us, or promised us greater things"
"when we should see the Swedish Lager outside the town, and"
Wallenstein's great camp arrayed against it. But I noticed that even
"they, as we drew nearer to the heart of the city, fell silent at"
"times, and looked at one another, surprised at the great influx of"
people and the shifting scenes which the streets presented.
"For myself and Steve and the men, we were as good as nought. A house"
in the Ritter-Strasse was assigned to my lady for her quarters--no one
could lodge in the city without the leave of the magistrates; and we
"were glad to get into it and cool our dizzy heads, and look at one"
"another. Count Hugo stayed awhile, standing with my lady and the"
Waldgrave in one of the great oriels that overlooked the street. But a
"mounted messenger, sent on from the Town House, summoned him, and he"
took horse again for the camp. I do not know what we should have done
"without him at entering. The soldiers, who crowded the streets, showed"
"scant respect for names, and would as soon have jostled my lady as a"
citizen's wife; but wherever he came hats were doffed and voices
"lowered, and in the greatest press a way was made for him as by magic."
"For that night we had seen enough. I thought we had seen all, or that"
nothing in my life would ever surprise me again. But next day my lady
went up to the Burg on the hill in the middle of the city to look
"abroad, and took Steve and myself with her. And then I found that I"
"The semi-private, semi-public character of the letters often made them"
compromising. What one could say to a friend in confidence might
"possibly injure when many read it. Erasmus, who never was aware how"
"injuriously he expressed himself, repeatedly gave rise to"
"misunderstanding and estrangement. Manners, so to say, had not yet"
"adapted themselves to the new art of printing, which increased the"
publicity of the written word a thousandfold. Only gradually under this
"new influence was the separation effected between the public word,"
"intended for the press, and the private communication, which remains in"
writing and is read only by the recipient.
"Meanwhile, with the growth of Erasmus's fame, his earlier writings, too,"
had risen in the public estimation. The great success of the
"_Enchiridion militis christiani_ had begun about 1515, when the times"
were much riper for it than eleven years before. 'The _Moria_ is
"embraced as the highest wisdom,' writes John Watson to him in 1516. In"
"the same year we find a word used, for the first time, which expresses"
better than anything else how much Erasmus had become a centre of
"authority: _Erasmiani_. So his German friends called themselves,"
according to Johannes Sapidus. More than a year later Dr. Johannes Eck
"employs the word still in a rather friendly sense, as a generally"
"current term: 'all scholars in Germany are Erasmians,' he says. But"
"Erasmus did not like the word. 'I find nothing in myself', he replies,"
"'why anyone should wish to be an Erasmicus, and, altogether, I hate"
"those party names. We are all followers of Christ, and to His glory we"
"all drudge, each for his part.' But he knows that now the question is:"
for or against him! From the brilliant latinist and the man of wit of
his prime he had become the international pivot on which the
civilization of his age hinged. He could not help beginning to feel
"himself the brain, the heart and the conscience of his times. It might"
even appear to him that he was called to speak the great redeeming word
"or, perhaps, that he had already spoken it. The faith in an easy triumph"
"gradually, very gradually he become conscious that HE WAS NOT"
"ALONE,--another besides himself was in the church,--another, whom it"
was necessary for him to see!
"He could not tell how he first grew to be certain of this,--but he was"
"soon so completely possessed by the idea, that for a moment he dared"
"not raise his eyes, or move! Some invincible force held him there"
"spell-bound, yet trembling in every limb,--and while he thus waited"
"hesitatingly, the great organ woke up in a glory of tuneful"
"utterance,--wave after wave of richest harmony rolled through the"
"stately aisles and ... ""Kyrie eleison! Kyrie eleison!"" rang forth in"
"loud, full, and golden-toned chorus!"
"Lifting his head, he stared wonderingly around him; not a living"
creature was visible in all the spacious width and length of the
"cathedral! His lips parted,--he felt as though he could scarcely"
"breathe,--strong shudders ran through him, and he was penetrated by a"
"pleasing terror that was almost a physical pang,--an agonized"
"entrancement, like death or the desire of love! Presently, mastering"
"himself by a determined effort, he advanced steadily with the absorbed"
air of one who is drawn along by magnetic power ... steadily and slowly
"up the nave, ... and as he went, the music surged more tumultuously"
"among the vaulted arches,--there was a faint echo afar off, as of"
tinkling crystal bells; and at each onward step he gained a new access
"of courage, strength, firmness, and untrammelled ease, till every"
"timorous doubt and fear had fled away, and he stood directly in front"
"of the altar railing, gazing at the enshrined Cross, and seeing for the"
moment nothing save that Divine Symbol alone. And still the organ
"played, and still the voices sang,--he knew these sounds were not of"
"earth, and he also knew that they were intended to convey a meaning to"
"him,--but WHAT meaning?"

simple explanation of what some credulous souls might be inclined to

"miracles to clever imposture, accept this elucidation by all"

"weeks ago, leaving her penniless and on the verge of having another"

"refused to take it, saying she had got a little work to do and"
"could now manage without any help, as there were so many in much"
greater need of help than herself; and she would not take the

NOTE TO DIALOGUE VIII.
Before the preceding pages had been printed two events worth mentioning
here took place. One is the lamented death of Sir Henry Irving. The
other is the public discussion which took place under the auspices of
"the London Shakespeare League, on the best method of presenting"
Shakespeare's plays on the modern stage. On the latter subject perhaps I
may add a word. While in Japan the tendency is to introduce
"women-players into the company of male players, and improvement of"
"scenery is much sought after on European lines, both of which are due to"
"the occidental influence, it is curious to notice that exactly reverse"
"movements, namely the dispensing with the female players and the"
"returning back to the primitive simplicity of stage properties, are"
advocated in England by competent persons with regard to the
representation of Shakespeare. I extract below among others a passage of
the speech of Mr. Bernard Shaw on the occasion of the discussion
"could not make a Burman ill-use his pony if you tried, and I fancy that"
to break these little half-wild ponies to go in cabs in crowded streets
"requires severe treatment. At least, I never knew but one"
"hackney-carriage driver either in Rangoon or Mandalay who was a Burman,"
and he very soon gave it up. He said that the work was too heavy either
"for a pony or a man. I think, perhaps, it was for the safety of the"
"public that he resigned, for his ponies were the very reverse of"
meek--which a native of India says a hackney-carriage pony should
be--and he drove entirely by the light of Nature.
"So all the drivers of gharries, as we call them, are natives of India or"
"half-breeds, and it is amongst them that the work of the Society for the"
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals principally lies. While I was in
"Rangoon I tried a number of cases of over-driving, of using ponies with"
"sore withers and the like. I never tried a Burman. Even in Rangoon,"
"which has become almost Indianized, his natural humanity never left the"
"Burman. As far as Burmans are concerned, the Society for the Prevention"
of Cruelty to Animals need not exist. They are kinder to their animals
than even the members of the Society could be. Instances occur every
day; here is one of the most striking that I remember.
"There is a town in Burma where there are some troops stationed, and"
which is the headquarters of the civil administration of the district.
"It is, or was then, some distance from a railway-station, and it was"
necessary to make some arrangement for the carriage of the mails to and
"from the town and station. The Post-Office called for tenders, and at"
length it was arranged through the civil authorities that a coach should
run once a day each way to carry the mails and passengers. A native of
India agreed to take the contract--for Burmans seldom or never care to
take them--and he was to comply with certain conditions and receive a
certain subsidy.
"the story of the great Hermits who, having listened to the discussion"
of the Monday sitting at the Académie des Sciences (Institut de France)
as to the best way to teach the young how to shoot in the direction
"of mathematical genius, said: “_Cultivez l'imagination, messieurs."
"Tout est là. Si vous voulez des mathématiciens, donnez à vos enfants à"
lire--des Contes de Fées._”
Another important effect of the story is to develop at an early
age sympathy for children of other countries where conditions are
different from our own. There is a book used in American schools
"called “Little Citizens of other Lands,” dealing with the clothes,"
the games and occupations of those little citizens. Stories of this
kind are particularly necessary to prevent the development of insular
"notions, and are a check on that robust form of Philistinism, only"
"too prevalent, alas! among grown-ups, which looks askance at new"
suggestions and makes the withering remark: “How un-English! How
"queer!”--the second comment being, it would seem, a natural corollary"
to the first.[40]
I have so constantly to deal with the question of confusion between
Truth and Fiction in the mind of children that it might be useful
to offer here an example of the way they make the distinction for
themselves.
Mrs. Ewing says on this subject:
“If there are young intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of
"distinguishing between Fancy and Falsehood, it is most desirable to"
"develop in them the power to do so, but, as a rule, in childhood,"
we appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which as elders our
care-clogged memories fail to recall.”
"had been caught in an ambuscade and many of them killed, although the"
Spaniards had at last turned and fled. The pirates killed most of their
"prisoners, but kept a few to be questioned by L'Ollonais so as to find"
some other way to the town. As he could get no information out of these
"men, the Frenchman drew his cutlass and with it cut open the breast of one"
"of the Spaniards, and pulling out his still beating heart he began to bite"
"and gnaw it with his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the other"
"prisoners, ""I will serve you all alike, if you show me not another way."""
"Shortly after this, many of the buccaneers broke away from L'Ollonais and"
"sailed under the command of Moses van Vin, the second in command."
"L'Ollonais, in his big ship, sailed to the coast of Honduras, but ran his"
vessel on a sand-bank and lost her. While building a new but small craft
"on one of the Las Pertas Islands, they cultivated beans and other"
"vegetables, and also wheat, for which they baked bread in portable ovens"
which these French buccaneers carried about with them. It took them six
"months to build their long-boat, and when it was finished it would not"
carry more than half the number of buccaneers. Lots were drawn to settle
who should sail and who remain behind. L'Ollonais steered the boat towards
"Cartagena, but was caught by the Indians, as described by Esquemeling."
"""Here suddenly his ill-fortune assailed him, which of a long time had been"
"reserved for him as a punishment due to the multitude of horrible crimes,"
which in his licentious and wicked life he had committed. For God
"Almighty, the time of His divine justice being now already come, had"
appointed the Indians of Darien to be the instruments and executioners
"thereof."""
"These ""instruments of God,"" having caught L'Ollonais, tore him in pieces"
"alive, throwing his body limb by limb into the fire and his ashes into the"
"air, to the intent ""no trace nor memory might remain of such an infamous"
"inhuman creature."""
"relation between Literature and the Parliament House, if less close"
"than it had been, was more apparent than it is to-day, and"
distinguished Scottish judges and advocates mingled in the afternoon in
"the drawing-room, where she sat in a great arm-chair, with such men as"
Sellar and Stevenson and Grant and Shairp and Tulloch. But her
personality was the supreme bond.
"Those days are over, and with them has passed away much of what"
stimulated one to read in the _Institutes_ or the _Philosophical
Remains_. But for the historian of British philosophy Ferrier
"continues as a prominent figure. He it was who first did, what Stirling"
and Green did again at a stage later on--make a serious appeal to
thoughtful people to follow no longer the shallow rivulets down which
"the teaching of the great German thinkers had trickled to them, but to"
seek the sources. If as a guide to those sources we do not look on him
"to-day as adequate, we are not the less under a deep obligation to him"
for having been the pioneer of later guides. What Ferrier wrote about
"forty years ago has now become readily accessible, and what has been"
got by going there is in process of rapid and complete assimilation.
The opinions which were in 1856 regarded by the authorities of the Free
and United Presbyterian Churches as disqualifying Ferrier for the
"opportunity of influencing the mind of the youth of Edinburgh, from the"
"Chair of Logic and Metaphysics in succession to Sir William Hamilton,"
are regarded by the present generation of Presbyterians as the main
reliable bulwark against the attacks of unbelievers. If one may judge
"by the essays in the recent volume called _Lux Mundi_, the same"
phenomenon displays itself among the young High Church party in
England. The Time-Spirit is fond of revenges.
But even for others than the historians of the movement of Thought the
books of Ferrier remain attractive. There is about them a certain
atmosphere in which everything seems alive and fresh. Their author was
"went to the Island of Hispaniola, and joined the buccaneers there, living"
by hunting wild cattle and drying the flesh or boucan.
"He then sailed for a few voyages as a sailor before the mast, and acted"
"with such ability and courage that the Governor of Tortuga Island,"
"Monsieur de la Place, gave him the command of a vessel and sent him out"
to seek his fortune.
"At first the young buccaneer was very successful, and he took many Spanish"
"ships, but owing to his ferocious treatment of his prisoners he soon won a"
name for cruelty which has never been surpassed. But at the height of this
"success his ship was wrecked in a storm, and, although most of the pirates"
"got ashore, they were at once attacked by a party of Spaniards, and all"
"but L'Ollonais were killed. The captain escaped, after being wounded, by"
smearing blood and sand over his face and hiding himself amongst his dead
"companions. Disguised as a Spaniard he entered the city of Campeachy,"
"where bonfires and other manifestations of public relief were being held,"
to express the joy of the citizens at the news of the death of their
"terror, L'Ollonais."
"Meeting with some French slaves, the fugitive planned with them to escape"
"in the night in a canoe, this being successfully carried out, they"
"eventually arrived back at Tortuga, the pirate stronghold. Here the"
"enterprising captain stole a small vessel, and again started off ""on the"
"account,"" plundering a village called De los Cagos in Cuba. The Governor"
of Havana receiving word of the notorious and apparently resurrected
"pirate's arrival sent a well-armed ship to take him, adding to the ship's"
"company a negro executioner, with orders to hang all the pirate crew with"
"the exception of L'Ollonais, who was to be brought back to Havana alive"
and in chains.
"Instead of the Spaniards taking the Frenchman, the opposite happened, and"
"substantially borne out by Grattan, _Netherlands_, pp. 18, 34;"
"Blok, _Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Volk_, i, 159, 160,"
"305-11, Eng. tr. i, 203-8; Wauters, _Les libertés communales_,"
"1878, pp. 222-30. As is noted by Blok, the status of the peasantry"
"fluctuated, the thirteenth century being one of partial"
"retrogression. Cp. pp. 318, 319, as to the general depression of"
"the peasant class. The great impulse to slavery, as above noted,"
seems to have been given by the Norse pirates in general and the
"later Norman invaders, who, under Godfrey, forced every ""free"""
Frisian to wear a halter. The comparative protection accruing to
slaves of the Church was embraced by multitudes. In the time of the
"Crusades, again, many serfs were sold or mortgaged to the Church by"
the nobles in order to obtain funds for their expedition.
The cities were thus the liberating and civilising forces;[739] and the
application of townsmen's capital to the land was an early influence in
improving rural conditions.[740] But there was no escape from the
fatality of strife in the Teutonic any more than in the ancient Greek or
"in the contemporary Italian world. Flanders, having the large markets of"
"France at hand, developed its clothmaking and other industries more"
"rapidly than the Frisian districts, where weaving was probably earlier"
"carried on;[741] and here serfdom disappeared comparatively early,[742]"
the nobility dwindling through their wars; but the new industrial
"strifes of classes, which grew up everywhere in the familiar fashion,"
naturally matured the sooner in the more advanced civilisation; and
already at the beginning of the fourteenth century we find a resulting
disintegration. The monopoly methods of the trade gilds drove much of
"the weaving industry into the villages; then the Franco-Flemish wars,"
"wherein the townspeople, by expelling the French in despite of the"
"nobility, greatly strengthened their position,[743] nevertheless tended,"
"as did the subsequent civil wars, to drive trade into South Brabant."
feared. He is such a great Nat that it is necessary when you pass his
house to dismount from your pony and walk to a respectful distance. If
"you haughtily ride past, trouble will befall you. A friend of mine"
riding there one day rejected all the advice of his Burmese companions
"and did not dismount, and a few days later he was taken deadly sick of"
"fever. He very nearly died, and had to go away to the Straits for a"
sea-trip to take the fever out of his veins. It was a very near thing
"for him. That was in the Burmese times, of course. After that he always"
dismounted. But all Nats are not so proud nor so much to be feared as
"this one, and it is usually safe to ride past."
Even as I write I am under the shadow of a tree where a Nat used to
"live, and the headman of the village has been telling me all about it."
"This is a Government rest-house on a main road between two stations, and"
is built for Government officials travelling on duty about their
districts. To the west of it is a grand fig-tree of the kind called
"Nyaungbin by the Burmese. It is a very beautiful tree, though now a"
"little bare, for it is just before the rains; but it is a great tree"
"even now, and two months hence it will be glorious. It was never"
"planted, the headman tells me, but came up of itself very many years"
"ago, and when it was grown to full size a Nat came to live in it. The"
"Nat lived in the tree for many years, and took great care of it. No one"
"might injure it or any living creature near it, so jealous was the Nat"
"of his abode. And the villagers built a little Nat-house, such as I have"
"described, under the branches, and offered flowers and water, and all"
things went well with those who did well. But if anyone did ill the Nat
"punished him. If he cut the roots of the tree, the Nat hurt his feet;"
"and if he injured the branches, the Nat injured his arms; and if he cut"
"the trunk, the Nat came down out of the tree, and killed the"
"sacrilegious man right off. There was no running away, because, as you"
"know, the headman said, Nats can go a great deal faster than any man."
"Many men, careless strangers, who camped under the tree and then abused"
starting therefore a few days ahead of the Dobuan uvalaku fleet. I
"rowed over in a dinghy to the big village, and watched the loading and"
"departing of the canoes. There was a bustle in the village, and even a"
few old women could be seen helping the men in their tasks. The large
"canoes were being pushed into the water from their supports, on which"
they were beached. They had been already prepared for the journey
"there, their platforms covered with plaited palm leaves, frames put"
"in their bottoms to support the cargo, boards placed crossways within"
"the canoe to serve as seats for the crew, the mast, rigging and sail"
"laid handy. The loading, however, begins only after the canoe is in"
"water. The large, trough-shaped chunks of sago were put at the bottom,"
"while men and women carefully brought out the big clay pots, stowing"
them away with many precautions in special places in the middle
"(see Plate XLVII). Then, one after the other, the canoes went off,"
paddling round the southern end of the island towards the West. At
"about ten o'clock in the morning, the last canoe disappeared round the"
"promontory, and the village remained practically empty. There was no"
"saying of farewells, not a trace of any emotion on the part of those"
"leaving or those remaining. But it must be remembered that, owing to"
"my presence, no women except one or two old hags, were visible on the"
"shore. All my best informants gone, I intended to move to Nabwageta"
"next morning. At sunset, I made a long excursion in my dinghy round"
"the western shores of Gumasila, and it was on that occasion that I"
discovered all those who had left that morning on the Kula sitting on
"Giyasila beach, in accordance with the Kula custom of a preliminary"
"halt, such as the one on Muwa described in Chapter VII."
"Next morning, I left for the neighbouring island and village of"
"Nabwageta, and only after he saw me safely off, Tovasana and his party"
"left in his canoe, following the others to Vakuta. In Nabwageta, the"
whole community were in the midst of their final preparations for
"departure, for they intended to wait for the Dobuans and sail with"
"attacks upon capital, and encouraged to believe that it is the priest"
who is his true foe. “_Le cléricalisme voilà l’ennemi_” is a
convenient cry. A vague Deism is not dangerous to wealthy
manufacturers; but if the clergy are going to take up Christian
Socialism it is time to be up and doing. So every weapon against the
"creed of Christendom is being taken down and examined, and many an old"
fallacy is refurbished and employed once more. Celsus is disinterred
"from the tomb in which Origen had buried him, and his filthy slander"
of the Blessed Virgin is printed as though it were a new discovery of
historical research. Collins is called into court again as though
"Bentley had never exposed his ignorance, and Hume’s _a priori_ method"
is revived as though it had never been discredited; whilst Strauss and
"Renan are quoted as authorities, as if Westcott and Lightfoot had"
never been known. Shunt the working classes on a new line of rails.
"Set them shrieking against sacramentalists, and swearing at"
"sacerdotalists, and we may quietly arrange our commercial combinations"
and protect our manufacturing interests!
I want to see the seats under the dome of St. Paul’s filled not by
"only the middle-aged middle classes, who for the most part are"
"Christian in creed, but by the young artisans and craftsmen, and the"
"strong politicians who fill the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, and"
crowd the great Assembly Rooms of Birmingham and Liverpool when an
election is drawing near. The timid members of the Episcopate who may
be reminded that “He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he
"that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,” are not our only Bishops."
Occasionally a Prime Minister offers for election and consecration a
man who can reach the minds and consciences of men. Is it too great an
ambition for a storyteller to try to arouse in people’s minds a
"suspicion that after all something may be said for the Catholic Faith,"
and so to bring them to listen to those who know and can teach it?
Each man must do his work with such tools as have come in his way. The
"went on to explain that Mr. Justice Gaunt, by nature a somewhat"
"cross-grained old limb of the law, had been very ill-pleased over being"
"bothered again, and at a moment when most of his colleagues were"
"enjoying a holiday, about any such apparently endless case as that of"
"the Jura succession, which had been cropping up before him, at more or"
"less lengthy intervals, for quite a number of years, and concerning"
"which he had, only a few days before, made an order of court in favour"
of Justin Carthew.
Captain Dove clapped his soft felt hat on his head with a very
devil-may-care expression.
"""Come on, then,"" said he grimly, and Mr. Jobling was not slow to lead"
the way. So that they reached Mr. Justice Gaunt's chambers punctually at
"the hour appointed, and were ushered into his lordship's presence by Mr."
"Spettigrew, the learned counsel retained by Mr. Jobling on Sallie's"
"behalf, a long, lifeless-looking gentleman in a wig and gown and"
spectacles. And his lordship smiled very pleasantly as Sallie raised her
heavy veil at counsel's crafty request.
"""Pray be seated, my dear young lady,"" his lordship begged with fatherly,"
"old-fashioned kindness, and indicated a chair meant for counsel, much"
nearer his own than the rest. Nor did he often take his eyes from her
face throughout the course of a long and convincing dissertation by Mr.
"Spettigrew, on her past history, present position in life, and claims on"
"the future, with some reference to the rival claims of Mr. Justin"
Carthew.
"""And I have full proof to place before you, at once, if you wish it,"
"m'lud,"" concluded Mr. Spettigrew in his most professional drone, ""in"
support of the fact that the lady before you is the lawful daughter of
"the late earl and the countess, his second wife, who died in the desert."
"able to talk. But you must leave this place."" The girl said: ""Then I"
would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without the power of
"speech""--and such she became, but from that time on she was dumb."
"Now when the girl had left her foster-mother, and had wandered for a"
"time, she came to a large, large wood, and no matter how far she went"
"she could not reach its end. When evening came, she climbed into a high"
"tree that stood over a spring, and sat down in its branches to sleep."
"Not far from it stood a king's castle, and early the next morning a"
"serving-maid came from it, to get water from the spring for the prince's"
"tea. And when the serving-maid saw the lovely face in the spring, she"
thought it was her own. At once she threw down her pail and ran back
"home holding her head high, and saying: ""If I am as beautiful as all"
"that, I am too good to carry water in a pail!"" Then another was sent to"
"fetch water, but the same thing happened with her; she, too, came back"
and said she was far too handsome and too good to go to the spring and
"fetch water for the prince. Then the prince went himself, for he wanted"
"to see what it all meant. And when he came to the spring, he also saw"
"the picture, and at once looked up into the tree. And so he saw the"
"lovely maiden who was seated among its branches. He coaxed her down,"
"took her back home with him, and nothing would do but that she must be"
"his bride, because she was so beautiful. But his mother, who was still"
"living, objected: ""She cannot speak,"" said she, ""and, maybe, she"
"belongs to the troll-folk."" But the prince would not be satisfied until"
"he had won her. When, after a time, heaven bestowed a child upon the"
"queen, the prince set a strong guard about her. But suddenly they all"
"fell asleep, and her foster-mother came, cut the child's little finger,"
"rubbed some of the blood over the mouth and hands of the queen, and"
"said: ""Now you shall grieve just as I did when you let the star slip"
"out!"" And with that she disappeared with the child. When those whom the"
"prince had set to keep guard opened their eyes again, they thought that"
"the queen had devoured her child, and the old queen wanted to have her"
chaotic appear the happenings in Nature? Is nature a Cosmos! in which
"the human mind is some day to realise the uniform march of sequence,"
order and law? India through her habit of mind is peculiarly fitted to
"realise the idea of unity, and to see in the phenomenal world an orderly"
universe. This trend of thought led me unconsciously to the dividing
frontiers of different sciences and shaped the course of my work in its
"constant alternations between the theoretical and the practical, from"
the investigation of the inorganic world to that of organised life and
"its multifarious activities of growth, of movement, and even of"
sensation. On looking over a hundred and fifty different lines of
"investigations carried on during the last twenty-three years, I now"
discover in them a natural sequence. The study of Electric Waves led to
the devising of methods for the production of the shortest electric
waves known and these bridged over the gulf between visible and
invisible light; from this followed accurate investigation on the
"optical properties of invisible waves, the determination of the"
"Erasmus, and professor of divinity at Louvain, had, in 1514, in the name"
"of his faculty, rebuked Erasmus in a letter for the audacity of the"
"_Praise of Folly_, his derision of divines and also his temerity in"
correcting the text of the New Testament. Erasmus had defended himself
elaborately. At present war was being waged in a much wider field: for
"or against Reuchlin, the great Hebrew scholar, for whom the authors of"
the _Epistolae obscurorum virorum_ had so sensationally taken up the
cudgels. At Louvain Erasmus was regarded with the same suspicion with
which he distrusted Dorp and the other Louvain divines. He stayed during
"the remainder of 1516 and the first half of 1517 at Antwerp, Brussels"
"and Ghent, often in the house of Peter Gilles. In February 1517, there"
"came tempting offers from France. Budaeus, Cop, Étienne Poncher, Bishop"
"of Paris, wrote to him that the king, the youthful Francis I, would"
"present him with a generous prebend if he would come to Paris. Erasmus,"
"always shy of being tied down, only wrote polite, evasive answers, and"
did not go.

who is believed to have died of the poison which he intended for one
"of his cardinals,"" is thus hit off by Pasquino:"
"""Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum;"
"Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest."""
"Of Innocent X. (1644-'55), Pasquino says, ""Magis amat Olympiam quam"
"Olympium,"" referring to the shameful relations existing between this"
"Pope and his avaricious sister-in-law, Olympia Maidalchini, who made"
it her business to secure the profits of the papacy in hard cash.
"Trollope, in his _Life of Olympia_, says: ""No appointment to office of"
any kind was made except in consideration of a proportionable sum paid
down into her own coffers. This often amounted to three or four years'
revenue of the place to be granted. Bishoprics and benefices were sold
as fast as they became vacant. One story is told of an unlucky disciple
"of Simon, who in treating with the Pope for a valuable see, just fallen"
"vacant, and hearing from her a price at which it might be his, far"
"exceeding all he could command, persuaded the members of his family to"
sell all they had for the purpose of making this profitable investment.
"The price was paid, and the bishopric was given him, but, with a"
"fearful resemblance to the case of Ananias, he died within the year,"
and his ruined family saw the see a second time sold by the insatiable
"and incorrigible Olympia.... During the last year of Innocent's life,"
"Olympia literally hardly ever quitted him. Once a week, we read, she"
"left the Vatican, secretly by night, accompanied by several porters"
"carrying sacks of coins, the proceeds of the week's extortions and"
"sales, to her own palace. And during these short absences she used to"
father had to go forth to see whether he could not find a god-father
to pay for the child's christening. All day long he went from one to
"another; but no one wanted to be the god-father. Toward evening, as he"
"was going home, he met a very lovely lady, who wore the most splendid"
"clothes, and seemed most kind and friendly, and she offered to see that"
"the child was christened, if she might be allowed to keep it afterward."
The man replied that first he must ask his wife. But when he reached
"home and asked her she gave him a flat ""no."" The following day the man"
set out again; but no one wanted to be the god-father if he had to pay
"for the christening himself, and no matter how hard the man begged, it"
"was all of no avail. When he went home that evening, he again met the"
"lovely lady, who looked so gentle, and she made him the same offer as"
"before. The man again told his wife what had happened to him, and added"
"that if he could not find a god-father for his child the following day,"
"they would probably have to let the lady take her, since she seemed to"
"be so kind and friendly. The man then went out for the third time, and"
"found no god-father that day. And so, when he once more met the friendly"
"lady in the evening, he promised to let her have the child, if she would"
see that it was baptized. The following morning the lady came to the
"man's hut, and with her two other men. She then took the child and went"
"to church with it, and it was baptized. Then she took it with her,"
"and the little girl remained with her for several years, and her"
foster-mother was always good and kind to her.
"Now when the girl had grown old enough to make distinctions, and had"
"acquired some sense, it chanced that her foster-mother once wished to"
"take a journey. ""You may go into any room you wish,"" she said to the"
"girl, ""only you are not to go into these three rooms,"" and then she set"
out on her journey. But the girl could not resist opening the door
to the one room a little way--and swish! out flew a star. When her
"foster-mother came home, she was much grieved to find that the star had"
"flown out, and was so annoyed with her foster-child that she threatened"
"outlying district, and she had been the only person in the house that"
"night. She let beds to single men, she said, and the night before two"
"men had arrived, one the worse for drink. They had asked for adjoining"
"rooms. As they went up-stairs, she had heard the one who had been"
"drinking say to the other, ""What are you bringing me here for? This"
"isn't the place for what I want."" His companion, the shorter of the two,"
"whom she thought she would know again, had answered--""All in good time;"
"you go and lie down, and I'll fetch what you want."" Soon after, the"
short one came down and asked if she had any brandy; she gave him a
bottle half full and he went up-stairs again. She heard voices raised as
"if in dispute for a few minutes, and one of them--she could not say"
"which--said something which sounded like ""Well, finish the drink first,"
"and then I'll go."" Silence followed, at least she could not hear any"
"more talking; and presently, it not being her business to spy on"
"gentlemen, she went to bed, and knew nothing more till she woke at"
"seven o'clock. Going up-stairs, she found one door open and the room"
"empty, not the room the two men had been in together, but the other. The"
"second door was locked, and she did not knock; gentlemen often slept"
"late. At half-past ten she ventured to knock, got no answer, knocked"
"again and again, and finally, with the help of the man from next door,"
broke the lock and found the taller of the two men dead on the bed. She
"had at once summoned the police; and that, she concluded, was all she"
"knew about the matter, and she was a respectable, hard-working woman, a"
widow who could produce her marriage certificate in case any person
present desired to inspect it.
The Superintendent listened to her protestations of virtue with an
"ironical smile, told her the police knew her house very well, frightened"
"her wholesomely, took down her very vague description of the missing"
"man, and kept her in custody; but he did not seriously doubt the truth"
"of her story, and, if it were true, the man he wanted was evidently the"
"sober man, the shorter man, who had introduced his friend to the house"
"undergraduates, many of the thirty demies being graduates"
and non-resident. In the year of his matriculation there
"were only ten gentlemen-commoners; thus, as far as"
"undergraduates went, the College was a small one."

"Warwickshire, a well-known genealogist, and the author of"

"It is known that Ferrier took his Bachelor's degree in 1832, and that"
he had by that time managed to acquire a very tolerable knowledge of
"the classics and begun to study philosophy, so that his time could not"
"have been entirely idle. For the rest, he probably passed happily"
"through his years at College, as many others have done before and after"
"him, without allowing more weighty cares to dwell upon his mind."
"Another friend of after days, the late Principal Tulloch, after noting"
the fact that Oxford had not then developed the philosophic spirit
"which in recent years has marked her schools, and which had not then"
"taken root any more than the High Church movement which preceded it,"
"goes on: 'It may be doubted, indeed, whether Oxford exercised any"
definite intellectual influence on Professor Ferrier. He had imbibed
"his love for the Latin poets before he went there, and his devotion to"
Greek philosophy was an after-growth with which he never associated his
Magdalen studies. To one who visited the College with him many years
"afterwards, and to whom he pointed out with admiration its noble walks"
"and trees, his associations with the place seemed to be mainly those of"
amusement. There is reason to think that few of those who knew him at
Magdalen would have afterwards recognised him in the laborious student
"at St. Andrews, who for weeks together would scarcely cross the"
"threshold of his study; and yet to all who knew him well, there was"
nevertheless a clear connection between the gay gownsman and the
hard-working Professor.'
hurled at St. Dominic one day when he found him lying prostrate in
"prayer. This stone is the most conspicuous object in the church, being"
"set up on a pillar about three feet high, right in the middle of the"
nave. Not far away is the marble slab on which the saint was lying at
the time that the formidable missile was thrown. The adversary's aim
"was not good, and the saint was not harmed. The second thing of chief"
"interest here is the Chapel of the Rosary, at the other end of the same"
"aisle in which the marble slab lies, built on the very spot where St."
Dominic had the vision in which he received the rosary from the hands
of the Virgin. The supernatural gift is commemorated in a beautiful
painting by Sassoferato. It is hardly necessary to explain to any of my
readers that a rosary is a string of beads used by Roman Catholics to
keep the count of the number of _Pater-nosters_ and _Ave-Marias_ which
"they repeat, and that this manner of ""vain repetitions"" was first used"
"by the Dominicans among Roman Catholics, though the custom was really"
"borrowed from the Mohammedans and Brahmins, who still use rosaries. The"
"third object is the famous orange tree, now six hundred and seventy"
"years old, which is said to have been brought from Spain and planted"
"in the court here by St. Dominic himself, orange trees having been"
"unknown in Rome before that time, and ""which still lives, and is firmly"
"believed to flourish or fail with the fortunes of the Dominican Order."""
"Ladies are not allowed to approach this tree, so, as there were ladies"
"in our party, we all contented ourselves with a look at it through a"
"window. Hard by, of course, there is a room where things are sold to"
"pilgrims and visitors. There we bought a rosary, the beads of which"
"are made of the fruit of the plant called the Thorn of Christ, with"
"the exception of the bead next to the cross, which is a tiny dried"
orange from St. Dominic's tree. Enclosed in the cross are a little
"piece of the wood of the tree, and some earth from the catacombs where"
"the bodies of Sts. Peter and Paul, and of the holy virgin martyrs,"
"Sts. Agnes and Cecilia, reposed for some time. The printed leaflet"
"which accompanies our purchase tells us that ""these rosaries, when"
twenty years ago. He apparently does not know that some foreign
houses have trusted clerks or travellers all over the country; that
some foreign business men run up to Osaka and Tokio daily; and that
"business journeys to Maidzuru--the great, fortified naval base on"
"the Sea of Japan--Nagoya Sasebo, Hiroshima, and other important"
"centres, are matters of everyday experience now."
In the same number of the same journal is also published an important
"article from the pen of Sir Tollemache Sinclair, Bart., concerning"
Bishop Awdry's letter published in the _Times_. Sir Tollemache strongly
repudiates the accuracy of the bishop's charge of dishonesty and
"immorality against the Japanese, which Sir Tollemache calls the bishop's"
"'utterly erroneous accusations,' basing his contention upon an elaborate"
comparison of the statistical facts of Japan and many other nations
relating to several important subjects having bearing on the question.
"Among other things, he writes:--"
"This clerical censor, who endeavours to find a mote in his Japanese"
"brother's eye, but does not see the beam in his English brother's"
"eye, cut the ground from under his own feet on the subject of the"
"imaginary dishonesty of Japanese traders, for he tells us that a"
house was built for him by Japanese tradesmen admirably without any
"contract, and at a moderate expense; and I should like to know, if"
"any Englishman did the same thing in England, whether he would not"
be unmercifully fleeced. Bishop Awdry says he is a friend of the
"Japanese, but they will probably say to him, after reading his"
"letter, 'Save us from our friends, as to our enemies we will take"
care of them ourselves.'
And he winds up the article with these words:--
What excuse has he to offer for the gross and discreditable and
"Panama and Sawkins, the former wishing to know what the pirates had come"
"there for. To this message Sawkins sent back answer ""that we came to"
"assist the King of Darien, who was the true Lord of Panama and all the"
"country thereabouts. And that since we were come so far, there was no"
reason but that we should have some satisfaction. So that if he pleased to
"send us five hundred pieces of eight for each man, and one thousand for"
"each commander, and not any farther to annoy the Indians, but suffer them"
"to use their own power and liberty, as became the true and natural lords"
"of the country, that then we would desist from all further hostilities,"
"and go away peaceably; otherwise that we should stay there, and get what"
"we could, causing to them what damage was possible."""
"This message was just bluff on Sawkins's part, but having heard that the"
"Bishop of Santa Martha was in the city, Sawkins sent him two loaves of"
"sugar as a present, and reminded the prelate that he had been his prisoner"
"five years before, when Sawkins took that town. Further messengers"
"returned from Panama next day, bringing a gold ring for Sawkins from the"
"well-disposed Bishop, and a message from the Governor, in which he"
"inquired ""from whom we had our commission and to whom he ought to complain"
"for the damage we had already done them?"" To this Sawkins sent back answer"
"""that as yet all his company were not come together; but that when they"
"were come up we would come and visit him at Panama, and bring our"
"commissions on the muzzles of our guns, at which time he should read them"
"as plain as the flame of gunpowder could make them."""
"After lying off Panama for some while without meeting with any plunder,"
"and their victuals running short, the crews began to grumble, and"
"persuaded Sawkins to sail south along the coast. This he did, and,"
"arriving off the town of Puebla Nueva on May 22nd, 1679, Sawkins landed a"
party of sixty men and led them against the town. But the Spaniards had
"been warned in time, and had built up three strong breastworks."
"was again removed by angels during the night, and set down in the"
"Province of Ancona, near the eastern coast of Italy, on the ground"
"of a widow named _Laureta_. Hence the name, _Loretto_, given to the"
town which sprang up around it for the accommodation of the thousands
"of pilgrims who flocked thither, and which is now a place of some six"
"thousand inhabitants, whose principal business is begging and the sale"
"of rosaries, medals and images. In a niche inside the Casa Santa is a"
"small black image of the Virgin and Child, of cedar, attributed, of"
"course, to St. Luke. We did not visit Loretto, but at Bologna we had"
"the satisfaction of seeing a _fac-simile_ of the Casa Santa, with its"
"little window and fireplace, and the replica of St. Luke's handi-work"
"in the niche above. A large number of women, some of them handsomely"
"dressed, were saying their prayers and counting their beads before"
the altar that had been erected in front of these images and the Holy
"House, and a few were kneeling in the narrow space behind the altar,"
"close to the fireplace of the house. As we passed, one of these women,"
"in plainer garb, interrupted her devotions long enough to hold out her"
"hand to us, begging for pennies, but without rising from her knees."
"There was nothing unusual about this, except that this beggar made her"
"appeal to us while actually on her knees to the image of the Virgin,"
for nothing is more common in Italy than for visitors to a Roman
"Catholic church to pass through such ""an avenue of palms"" when leaving"
it.
[Sidenote: The Wonder-working Bones of St. Anne in Canada.]
"I had even seen a few relics, not mere reproductions like that of the"
"Casa Santa at Bologna, but the relics themselves. For instance, three"
"summers ago, when in Quebec, I had made a special trip to the Church"
"of St. Anne Beaupre, some twenty miles below the city, for the purpose"
"of seeing the wonder-working relics of St. Anne, the alleged mother"
of the Virgin Mary--a bit of her finger bone and a bit of her wrist
"Full of a singular light-heartedness, he hummed a soft tune to himself"
"as he moved about his room,--his desire to view the interior of the"
"Cathedral had not abated with sleep, but had rather augmented,--and he"
"resolved to visit it now, while he had the chance of beholding it in"
all the impressive splendor of uncrowded tranquillity. For he knew that
"by the time he was dressed, the first Mass would be over,--the priests"
"and people would be gone,--and he would be alone to enjoy the"
"magnificence of the place in full poet-luxury,--the luxury of silence"
"and solitude. He attired himself quickly, and with a vaguely nervous"
"eagerness,--he was in almost as great a hurry to enter the Dom as he"
had been to arrive at the Field of Ardath! The same feverish impatience
"was upon him--impatience that he was conscious of, yet could not"
"account for,--his fancy busied itself with a whole host of memories,"
"and fragments of half-forgotten love-songs he had written in his youth,"
"came back to him without his wish or will,--songs that he instinctively"
"felt belonged to his Past, when as ""Sah-luma"" he had won golden"
"opinions in Al-Kyris. And though they were but echoes, they seemed this"
"morning to touch him with half-pleasing, half-tender"
"suggestiveness,--two lines especially from the Idyl of Roses he had"
"penned so long,--ah! so very long ago,--came floating through his brain"
"like a message sent from some other world,--"
"""By the pureness of love shall our glory in loving increase,"
"And the roses of passion for us are the lilies of peace."""
"The ""lilies of peace"" and the flowers of Ardath,--the ""roses of"
"passion"" and the love of Edris, these were all mingled almost"
"unconsciously in his thoughts, as with an inexplicable, happy sense of"
"tremulous expectation,--expectation of he knew not what-he went,"
"walking as one in haste, across the broad Platz and ascended the steps"
"of the Cathedral. But the side-entrance was fast shut, as on the"
"previous night,--he therefore made his rapid way round to the great"
Yet in this posture of things there had grown up a burden which
"represented, in the warring commercial State, the persistent principle"
of class parasitism; for at the Peace of Münster (1648) the funded
public debt of the province of Holland alone amounted to nearly
"150,000,000 florins, bearing interest at five per cent.[797] Of this"
"annual charge, the bulk must have gone into the pockets of the wealthier"
"citizens, who had thus secured a mortgage on the entire industry of the"
"nation. All the while, Holland was nominally rich in ""possessions"""
"beyond sea. When, in 1580, Philip annexed Portugal, with which the Dutch"
had hitherto carried on a profitable trade for the eastern products
"brought as tribute to Lisbon, they began to cast about for an Asiatic"
"trade of their own, first seeking vainly for a north-east passage. The"
"need was heightened when in 1586 Philip, who as a rule ignored the"
"presence of Dutch traders in his ports under friendly flags, arrested"
all the Dutch shipping he could lay hands on;[798] and when in 1594 he
"closed to them the port of Lisbon, he forced them to a course which his"
successors bitterly rued. In 1595 they commenced trading by the Cape
"passage to the Indies, and a fleet sent out by Spain to put down their"
enterprise was as usual defeated.[799] Then arose a multitude of
"companies for the East Indian trade, which in 1602 were formed by the"
"government into a great semi-official joint-stock concern, at once"
"commercial and military, reminiscent of the Hanseatic League. The result"
was a long series of settlements and conquests. Amboyna and the Moluccas
"were seized from the Portuguese, now subordinate to Spain; Java, where a"
"factory was founded in 1597, was in the next generation annexed; Henry"
"Hudson, an English pilot in the Dutch Company's service, discovered the"
"Hudson River and Bay in 1609, and founded New Amsterdam about 1624. In"
"1621 was formed the Dutch West India Company, which in fifteen years"
"fitted out 800 ships of trade and war, captured 545 from the Spanish and"
"Portuguese, with cargoes valued at 90,000,000 florins, and conquered the"
greater part of what had been the Portuguese empire in Brazil.
preserved a very large piece of the true cross upon which Christ was
"crucified, brought to Scheyern in 1156 by Count Conrad, the Crusader,"
"who afterwards entered the monastery as lay-brother, and lies buried"
"near the altar upon which the sacred relic is preserved."""
"Also the following passage from his letter of July 12th, written from"
Eichstadt:
"""I remained the guest of Prince Ahrenberg for the night, and early"
"in the morning, accompanied by some Benedictine students, I made a"
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Walburg. Above the altar is the large
silver receptacle into which flows the miraculous oil from her sacred
"relics, which is known the world over."""
[Sidenote: What America Needs is Some Relics.]
"Writing from Vienna, July 20, 1903, concerning the imperial palaces,"
"he says, ""They are awfully big and grand, and cost a lot of good"
"people's money,"" but adds that ""the pride and glory of Vienna"" is the"
"Cathedral, and then exclaims: ""How often have I wished we could have"
"some such church in ----, so that our good people who cannot visit the"
achievements of Catholic life in Europe could form some idea of the
"greatness of the religion of their fathers!"""
One hesitates to differ from so good an authority on such matters as
"this bishop, but really would he not agree, on reflection, that what"
this benighted and decaying country of ours needs to bring it up to a
"level with Italy and Austria and Spain is not a big church, but some"
"relics? Would not some miraculous oil, or some wonder-working bones, or"
"a piece of the true cross, or one of the nails, if placed on exhibition"
"here attract far more attention than a big church, and enable ""our good"
"people who cannot visit the achievements of Catholic life in Europe"""
Need...
"My, my."
Thank you.
My...
My pleasure.
Come and look at it.
What's it like?
Good.
Touch it.
What?
Touch it.
I can't do this.
So many things you can't do.
"You can't swim, you can't run..."
You can't fuck.
"Oh, dear."
How d'you know that?
"But you can, Tony Stonem."
You can fuck me right now.
"- No, I couldn't."
- You want to.
"Hey, fuck you!"
I got hit by a fucking bus.
That fucks you up.
"Well, fuck you right back."
You're just not trying hard enough.
You must be so happy the way you are.
Why do you care if my dick can get hard or not?
This is fucked up beyond words.
Coward.
Fucking coward.
Coward.
Yeah.
I thought you left me.
(sighs)
How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
-We're fine.
We were ambushed.
-Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
-Stop walking around on your leg.
-l'm fine.
What do we do next?
Just tell me what we do now.

Cats.

all part of your illness?
Do you have other similar symptoms?
I have plenty of symptoms.
Look.
I'd like to talk with you.
But not here.
With all that make-up.
I want to talk with you at your home.
I can't.
- Give me your calling code.
I can't see patients outside of work.
- But I'm not a patient.
Listen.
I...
Damn.
The boss.
Your code?
- I have to disconnect.
Give it to me.
- Please.
The boss is calling me.
Give me your code.
- I can't.
I'll file a complaint.
No.
Don't.
- Give me your code or I'll file.
I have enough problems as it is.
He's my friend too.
We really grew on each other.
Thanks.
I am counting on you.
"Don't worry about us, and watch your back."
The baron has hired some butchers to guard the place.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire?
!
Where is the fire?
"The warehouse with medicinal herbs from Ming, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
You must find his journal.
That's the only way to bring the baron down.
He won't store it in an obvious place.
He will keep it very close to him.
That idiot!
You!
Guards!
Guards!
Come quickly!
Guards!
Thief!
That way!
Go now!
Go!
But...
Just go!
I got you covered.
What?
!
Not a prostitute.
I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean.
You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this.
This was shorter.
Because...
That way.
They'll give me back...
Look.
I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on.
It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison.
There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is.
If...
Look.
I have to disconnect.
I'm telling you!
No one owes me money!
I'll break your neck!
What are you staring at?
You don't know me?
You look rough!
But you're a coward!
Just wait till you meet my sister!
Mousy!
What are you doing?
I'm scolding him!
Who is he?
Me.
You're useless.
Have you collected the money?
I've collected...
Some more clothes.
More clothes?
Take off your clothes.
I'll wash them too.
It doesn't matter.
Take them off!
Money?
Where's the money?
"I was chased by dogs, and Biggie threatened to kill me..."
We'll never survive like this!
- But Biggie was tough!
- Why not say that you're scared.
You're a coward!
Admit it!
Wake up!
You fool!
"Yes, sir?"
"Box F, sir."
Right this way.
"Now, all together, boys."
Two pints.
"Oh, oh."
A tip.
"A tip, of course."
"Seven shillings, sir?"
Why...
- Why not?
"You work hard, don't you?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Bless you, sir."
"- You have a family, no doubt."
- Yes.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What the...?
"Oh, what a pity."
"You were thinking of the children, no doubt?"
"Now, have that barmaid bring me some champagne."
- Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
- I don't think you understood me.
- What's all this here?
"- This gent here wants champagne, sir."
Champagne?
"All right, then, bring it, bring it."
- But he wants Ivy to serve it.
- Of course Ivy will serve it.
Go on.
But you're talking to me.
Let's meet at our usual place.
What a fool!
Moloch!
Moloch!
Moloch!
Moloch!
No!
Don't do it!
No!
Be quick!
Run there!
Here she is!
"You didn't expect it, did you?"
I knew that it was not delirium!
I knew it.
You'll tell me everything now!
You'll sign everything off to me!
How much did you get for it?
How much was your price?
You're the one who sold your soul.
You!
You didn't rape me.
You stole my life away.
You killed my son.
He could have lived.
He could have been saved.
But you demolished the hospital.
What did you do it for?
You did it for the sake of your damned mega-center.
Save our children!
Korob is the killer!
You're a beautiful girl.
You know that?
That's what they love around here.
They need girls like you.
"And with me in your corner, you're in like Flynn."
"Thanks a lot for helping, really."
Good.
That's nice.
That's what I like to hear.
I like to be thanked.
No.
"I'm sorry, I don't want to."
Come on.
Get off me.
Don't play hard to get.
Get away.
Get off me!
I don't mind if you don't.
Get back.
Get away!
"Come on, we're gonna trade favors."
Tit for tat.
"You wash my back, I'll wash yours."
Definitely not a funny way to die.
Crockett I though!
t you were off.
Since when has that mattered?
Who's in the bag?
Morty Price.
The comic?
He got a nice slice from a steak knife.
Definitely not a funny way to die.
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
Cash.
Who is this?
No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.
Where'd you spend it?
"Look, man, I just wanted to start over."
Quit the Agency.
Have your drink.
It could have been anybody walk through your door.
Yeah.
But it was you.
Go clean up your mess.
Three minutes.
Start the count.
"No, please, God."
Why did you do that?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
What a shame.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.
"- The fuck, Emerson?"
No loose ends.
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
- Good evening.
Good evening.
Have you eaten?
You want beer?
I put in fee for you.
You want in?
Please do!
- I you peel an apple?
- Useless.
So I bring you an appetizer .
Where is Light?
I go.
Wait!
What?
It's rare that you come .
You work your administrative competition?
What happened to you?
Nothing...
I aim for mayor of the city.
"Even if I fail, I not go into the police."
I understand.
Wait.
The murderer...
What?
What murderer?
"No, nothing."
This type of case will still continue...
Just like your difficulties.
I will not go on again tonight...
Take care of the house.
Young man.
What are you doing?
Pure killing without motive.
Wasn't that our challenge?
And then you go and kill my boss.
You tying to make things easy for them?
"I mean, I like a challenge, but..."
"Well, that was just stupid."
Don't worry.
They have no idea who killed Henry.
What are we gonna do?
We'll go back to basics.
We'll mess up the pattern that they think is emerging.
What do you suggest?
I've got you a double.
Is that OK?
Beats chemo!
Cheers.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
Yes?
Nik?
Did you get the paperwork?
Yes.
I haven't had time to Look at it.
"Nik, I really need you to sign it."
Soon.
Nikki?
I will.
But right now I'm...
"Don't tell me, you're busy."
Yes.
OK.
I'll sign them and send them.
Thanks.
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
I'd be afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.
That's true.
Of course it is.
You're always analyzing everything.
And saying what's good and bad.
"- Oh, you don't?"
- No.
"Well, how would you say it?"
I don't know.
I'd call her up and ask her to a dance.
Or a movie?
"Yeah, or a movie and we'd go and get something to eat."
Or drink?
"No, not any girl I'd propose to."
"Oh, I see."
"Well, go on."
"Well, then when the time came, I guess I'd hold her hand."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Then what would you say?
I'd say:
"""Betty, I'm crazy about you."
"Will you marry me?"""
"Well, let me think."
"Yes, Ed, I guess I will."
"- Well, then we're engaged."
- I think that's what they call it.
Oh.
"- It's swell, isn't it?"
- Yeah.
"Hey, what will your mother say?"
"She'll probably say, ""Thank, heavens. """
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
How you like the sodas?
"- Okay, Nick, take it out of there."
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
Hit it!
"Stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
I didn't factor into this experiment that the stig only knows how to drive fast.
"Eventually, he got bored with the truck, so I took advantage of his window of low-speed driving and gave it my best shot."
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
This is the slowest the stig has ever driven.
Don't let him down.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
The plane threw me.
Come on.
Just like a football.
Throw it!
I'm coming!
Wood:
"All right, that didn't work."
Ferrara:
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
[ Tires screech ]
Yeah!
Yes!
"Aw, come on, you unplugged it!"
You ready?
"Oh, I got it!"
I got it!
"Oh, crap!"
All right.
"Now, listen, we're gonna do it this time."
I feel good about it.
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
"Please God, don't."
Don't fucking take me out.
Please don't.
Please don't take me out.
-It's okay.
-Please don't.
I'm not feeling that.
What's up with the gallop?
The tempo's shit.
-I'm right.
Right?
"-Yep, tempo's shit."
"No, no, no, no."
Let us get into it.
It's gonna have texture.
"Like, you know, like ooze."
Sonic ooze.
Great.
Sonic ooze.
"Okay, baby, how about a horn section?"
"A little Tijuana Brass, maybe?"
I heard Herb's in town.
-Let's not get patronizing.
-That's not patronizing.
That was accommodating.
I was accommodating you.
"Against my better judgment, even."
"-Sweet, that's it."
That's the direction.
-I've overplayed it.
No.
We just gotta straighten out the beat.
You're the one who makes me feel I've made a flop out of this.
"I'm telling you, the only one."
"Say, Jim, that's not bad."
That's good work.
- Have you always been able to draw?
"- Yeah, a little."
Come on.
Let me see you draw me.
Come on.
Let me see if you can get my puss on paper.
Go.
Come on.
A professional tried to draw me once.
He couldn't get me.
Couldn't touch me.
"Well, you shouldn't be hard to do."
"Well, come on."
Let me see you do it.
"How do you want me, full face or sideways?"
Look over there.
You're a cinch.
"You know, the more I see it, the better I like it."
The pan or the picture?
"Oh, why, the picture, of course."
Hm.
"I'm crazy about you, baby."
"You know that, don't you?"
"- Are you, Patsy?"
- Mm-hm.
Gets worse all the time.
It's got me worried.
- Why?
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!
Mr. Ponsonby!
It's his arm.
Get him below.
"Hudson, King!"
Get the captain below!
The captain's been hit!
Take your orders from me!
Ready!
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."

Look.
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."
"[Man singing on radio, indistinct]"
[Humming]
[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
This is about Kitty's social life.
I don't really want to intrude.
"Oh, trust me."
She loves to intrude.
She lives to intrude.
Nonsense.
You know what?
I love mother-daughter teams.
- It's twice as much fun.
- OK.
"Well, she loves contractors."
- Kitty.
"- Nora, I feel so confident in this,"
I'm not gonna charge you for this consultation.
Sit down.
Sit!
Great.
"OK, here's what we're gonna do."
Hey.
So this is really good.
"I would just change ""watchdog"" to ""necessary vigilance."""
Protection over fear?
It's good.
I like it.
Sit down.
I'll go over the whole thing.
"You know, actually, I..."
I kind of have to go.
Is it OK if we run through it tomorrow?
It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
- What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.
That's enough.
"If they are alive, they must be exhausted."
We'll easily catch them.
- We must try to capture them alive.
- Why?
I want to finish them off.
Over here.
I can see them.
Give me that.
Stupid bitches.
- They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.
We can't search all the wrecksl
"Did you see anything, Bosco?"
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.
- We must wait until daybreak.
- We'll find them eventually.
I know how to drive them out.
"Paul, bring your lamp."
"Come here, all of you."
Le Bosco has an idea.
You come down too!
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn them.
Give me your lantern.
Stay here and tell me if you see them.
Bosco!
Then I'll have one more.
Please do!
Your Highness is right.
I'll leave for a bit.
"Perhaps when I'm gone, you'll win your next game of chess."
"Please excuse me, Your Highness."
Please!
Disgusting!
Disgusting!
"What a smart guy, please!"
Please!
"Mr. Law, you want more wine?"
How are you?
Check!
Good move!
Are you alright?
Are you alright?
This wine can stimulate warriors.
I think it's just the opposite.
You want the antidote?
I assume your offer depends on what I offer.
What's your intention?
Wu-tang 8-divine Sword!
"Give me the book, or you'll suffer more."
Check!
"Mr. Law, you have lost!"
Speak!
You'll tell me sooner or later.
Tell us!
What?
Don't be nervous!
You're losing so badly!
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
"You, too."
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
"Well, he came in."
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
-l can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
"This stuff is great, but it's like lead."
"Tell me, where you been?"
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
"Mom, I been working nights."
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and we hit one of them deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
"It reminds me, I need this knife."
- No problem.
Good luck.
Can't push the chair.
- Hey.
LAURA:
"Hey, Johnny."
KELLY:
How was the ski trip?
LAURA:
"Oh, yeah, it was fun."
- You knock them dead?
- I never got you out there.
That was always a big regret for me too.
- Does Greg Medavoy seem off his game?
- Why?
He seems a little depressed.
"- Yeah, he's got a domestic situation."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Do you want to go out for dinner?
"- Sure, what's the occasion?"
- No occasion.
"- Okay, your call."
- Tonight?
- Fine.
- I'll talk to you later.
See you later.
Martinez will be with you at arraignment.
We think you'll get a recognizance release.
He'll see you home.
It's better if you carry me down.
"Yeah, the chair nearly went over coming up."
Let's pick him up.
"All right, now."
"Here, we're gonna start weight training."
First things first...
Squats.
Okay.
That's it.
"Uh, that looks really heavy."
Look.
This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.
"- Yeah, but I can't lift that."
- Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.
Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.
Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.
Look.
You wanna fight like a man?
You gotta train like a man.
"Now, come on."
Gimme a squat.
- Ready.
Go!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Go.
Keep it up.
"- Daddy, I can't."
- It's...
I can't.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up.
I like pain of every kind.
Needles through my nipples.
Needles in my back.
I've had two needle corsets.
"Blows of all kinds, with marks, without marks."
Slaps.
"Verbal humiliation, being scolded."
That sort of thing.
I can free my mind.
totally let go.
And simply enjoy.
Simply be myself.
It's wonderful.
I need it.
Bend over it.
Spread your feet.
As wide as you can.
Nice.
- Do you like whips?
"- Yes, Master Walter."
Count out loud.
- One.
- Good.
Two.
Three.
I met my first husband when I'd just turned 15.
We were together 7 years before we married.
For me the marriage was like a death sentence.
In quotations.
He thought I was his property.
That's how he treated me.
He beat me when he was drunk.
I don't care as long as she's lucky.
Is it too much?
You look great.
Excuse me.
"New girl, new girl."
You're off your mark.
My mark?
Yeah.
"The big ""X"" on the floor."
Look where I'm pointing.
Oh.
90 seconds!
90 seconds?
Wait.
"No, no, no."
I don't have a script.
Excuse me.
I never got a script.
There is no script.
This is the lottery.
"For the love of God, if there was a script, we'd all be rich."
God.
Amateurs.
Captain.
Lieutenant.
How is the investigation going?
"Well, we're just getting started."
"Spoke to the staff, the camera crew, everybody said they left the building after the show."
They usually do.
"Well, somebody was here."
The girl didn't stab herself.
You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail.
My room.
Lie down and rest.
What room is this?
It hurts here.
I can't believe this.
This is my room.
Just lie down and relax.
You were in my dream.
"No, when I was taking a bath."
Really?
Do I look dirty to you?
Think I slept with Changwook?
"No, no."
"Then, what's wrong, huh?"
Because I used to date foreigners?
No.
"Actually, it makes it better."
"When you're dating, it's a turn-on."
It is?
"But to cherish someone in your heart, it can be a problem."
It hurts so much.
"There's no woman here, is there?"
"No, stupid."
Really?
Of course not.
It hurts?
It's nice being with you in the morning.
I don't know what to do.
In my brain there is this illness.
My ex-wife had slept with my friend before we married.
I didn't know that before.
"But then, I found out, and I couldn't forgive her."
"He's got a couple of fractured ribs, maybe his sternum too."
Set up for a chest tube.
Pratt.
"Trauma panel, type and cross four units."
- He could've bagged his spleen.
"- Look, I'll get the other one."
- We need you here.
- We'll be there.
"- Now, Gallant."
- It's cool.
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.
"- Come on, let's go."
- You've got two doctors.
That's enough.
We've got a critical patient who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
- I
- I can't help that guy.
"- This is what we do, all right?"
"Now, get your ass in there."
Come on.
Come on.
"John, it's beautiful."
Absolutely beautiful.
Marriage can be a great thing.
- Can be.
- Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
Biggie was as rough as you're now!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Don't come back without the money!
"""Pochilam"""
Which one is Huang Fei-hung?
- Excuse me...
- I'm the king fu instructor for the navy!
What do you want?
Are you blind?
Just wait a second please.
No!
Please.
Sit here.
Let me examine you.
"Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!"
You want a fight?
That's fine with me.
Stop!
That's no way to treat a patient!
"I as just arranging your seat, Master."
What's wrong with you?
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!
I'm Huang Fei-hung.
I'll examine you.
Let me warn you first.
I've crippled several of my doctors!
Your pulse is weak!
Can you do something about it?
Of course!
No problem!
Back to normal now!
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"""Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."" I wonder what's in there."
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens.
Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
"- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens."
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
"Now, listen."
"What we don't take, we ain't got."
Look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
"All right, whoever's in here, come on out."
"Come on out, I say!"
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids.
I heard them.
Come on out of there.
"Come on, you hoodlums."
You won't get away.
"- Come out, or I'll come in after you."
"- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now."
"Come on, Rocky!"

"Hi, Snowflakes."
"- Hi, Jerry."
- Hello.
What do you hear?
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
Fear of bodily fluids.
I need a break.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
"Okay, I'll get him."
Richard.
Why don't you walk around in those and see how they feel.
- It's Peter.
- Hello?
"Oh, no."
Really?
"Well, did you call your mom?"
"Oh, right."
Damn.
"Well, can you make it through the day, Petey?"
Are you barfing?
Okay.
"Okay, let's see here."
"I don't get off until 6:00, and we are just slammed here."
It's a sale day.
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.
This is why we have neighbors.
"We're part of a community, Peter."
Does your mom make you do that?
"No, this is my own towel."
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.
"See, this is the bath sheet... and this is the hand towel... and this is the washcloth."
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.
"When they hang on the rack, they go like this."
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.
How?
Here's 50.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Hurry up.
There's coffee if you'd like.
Laure!
"Laure, it's Gilou!"
- Calm down!
- How's it going?
"So, who was right?"
You switched your phone off?
"Sorry, I went back to sleep."
"I'm taking a shower, I'm coming."
"- Wait, I'll make some coffee."
- I don't have any left.
I'll see you at the office.
"See you later, then."
"Fuck, just what I didn't want to happen."
"You're entitled to a private life, aren't you?"
I don't know.
What?
How come you don't know?
- Aren't we serious?
"- Yes, we are."
"Anyway, I've got to go."
I'm taking someone in for questioning.
What kind?
The kind of dealer involved in settling scores in a squat.
A guy got hit in the lung by a bullet.
It went through the ceiling.
He is dead?
He'll survive.
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's Yo-Yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
- A sandwich?
- Do you want to make me a sandwich?
honey.
you know I will.
Hey.
what's up?
- How's it going? but it's tomorrow.
set it up.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you can fit it in between your little palettes there?
all right then.
I'll pick you up at noon.
Get your ass back to work.
I need a word with you.
- What is it?
- l need some time off.
nothing like that.
Drake booked another fight.
It's tomorrow.
good.
Of course.
Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.
tell Todd I hope he's feeling better.
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
What are you...?
Nothing.
Oh
"You know, it's okay if you don't wanna be my girlfriend."
You don't have to make stuff up...
- Can't we just keep things the way they are...?
- Yeah.. sure...
Well...
Do you... have to... do anything special?
when you go steady...?
No.
-So everything's the same?
- Yeah...
Okay.
- We can go steady.
- Really?
Yes.
"""I must be gone and live, or stay and die. "" ABBY + OWEN"
"If you play hockey, you play this side!"
"Free skate, this side!"
Everyone careful for holes in ice!
Stay!
Away!
From holes!
I hope you been learning how to swim...
Coz today you're goin' in... go
You must be quick.
"Faster, faster!"
What you think you're gonna do with that...?
I'm gonna... hit you with it...
If you try anything...
Really?
"Well, listen."
"Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up."
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
"I just have to go, is all."
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
"So, you want to go grab some some dinner?"
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We cool?
"Your satellite's on, by the way."
That screen's bad-ass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologize.
Is this going to be every weekend now?
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
I'm not dating...
I know.
I get it.
"What about you, smart guy?"
Did you really think this one through?
"Well, I have a right to display my art."
"Oh, give it up."
I'm gonna have to side with chloe on this one.
I wanted it in my show. it's my best picture.
There's a red dot on it.
Who bought it?
"oh, god. that feels weird."
Nobody bought it.
"I didn't want anyone to have it,"
"So i-i put a ""sold"" sticker on it."
Yeah.
Maybe.
Out of my way!
you!
"Oh, pooh. you're late. sorry you missed all the fun."
Oh!
not really.
I brought my own fun.
"Hello, andrea. come in early tomorrow."
Do you mind?
I want to show you your new office.
i think you're gonna like it.
"If you need to make a copy, it's super convenient."
"Okay, so you don't like practical jokes."
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
and it can lift up to two or three persons.
I can't believe you have to be armed with such things.
Emergency alert!
An armed group of intruders have been spotted at excavation site one.
All defense units and medics are to report immediately!
So they've come.
I'm going to try these babies out right now.
What's going on?
Damn!
He's a monster!
Run for it!
Withdraw!
Why you..!
What happy people!
How dare you act so vulgar!
Spriggan!
Yu Ominae..!
you can't escape!
I leave him to you!
Come back here!
you little traitor?
What?
Major Fatman!
It's a pity Ominae..!
Did you lose your abilities when you joined Arcam?
How come?
How come?
What's wrong with you?
and what we trained you for!
Bastard!
Who the hell are you?
!
- Come on.
"- Oh, my goodness."
Are you getting tired?
You want me to wheel you?
- No!
- All right.
- Absolutely no.
- All right.
This is a big place.
Do you know where you're going?
When we come in the first building - You come into the building -
One second.
Could it be over there?
"- Yes, it must be."
- You think it might be there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause there's more than one entrance.
- But we're gonna look at them all.
"- Well, there's a fence there."
Let's have a look.
Do you see it here?
"- No, not here?"
"- It's downstairs, where you come in."
All right.
Let's go to the other entrance.
I think I know which one you're talking about.
This way.
- I'm thinking it might be along here.
- It's in the entrance.
"Well, let's - let's have a look here."
And he never even told me it was there.
- He didn't tell you?
"- Oh, the setup is all wrong."
I'm bound to wind up behind the eight ball with you.
What do you mean?
"Well, by your standards, I'm a wrong guy."
- You're the sweetest guy in the world.
"- No, you don't know what I mean."
- You don't know my racket.
- I don't care about your racket.
You sure?
"Not now, I don't."
Hello?
Mike.
That guy gets in your hair.
"- Hello, what do you want?"
- I'll tell you.
- You better get down here fast tonight.
- For what?
This Joe is on the loose.
They're stringing with him.
"I'm telling you straight, the guy threw me out."
You're frozen out.
Tell him to get here.
Tell him what he tried to do.
Louis is burned too.
He said Joe tried to hold him up today for cash.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, listen, you tell Louis I'm getting right down there."
"- Yeah, right away."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- What's wrong, Patsy?"
"- Oh, no, nothing."
Nothing at all.
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
"I'm not prying or anything, but as the manager, I should..."
What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."
Miyu.
What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
- All right.
Come here.
All right.
"I'll allow this but if you start making strain noises,"
- we're breaking up.
- We should go.
- I'm sure she's fine.
- She should just move on.
She falls all the time.
What do I care?
What we need to be concerned about is getting that diamond back.
We need someone to kiss Trent.
- Can you do it?
For Candace?
- Oh no...
I'm not into that kind of thing.
"- Yep, that's Trent"
- I'll do it.
I don't like seeing you all torn up like this.
You know what?
You know what we could do to cheer you up?
Let's do that thing where we pretend to be an old couple that's been married for 50 years.
Come on.
"I'm coming for you, stud-muffin."
Hot wheels.
Almost there.
Sweetie...
This usually gets me going.
My heart's just not in it.
Guys.
The fight with Danny is killing him.
I know.
We don't talk to the priest.
Just between us.
Sometimes he says something.
But that's it.
But I'm not the priest.
No.
You're my father.
I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me.
Sometimes I'd like to slap you face!
No.
Better hit me with your belt!
Like Elena's father.
And who's Elena's father?
"A beast, who else."
"Well, let's calm down."
I'm calm.
I assume I was bad at you.
But you were too.
Me?
Why?
You never give up!
You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel.
If he were 15 you'd be so happy.
15 is a much more similar age for you.
That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15.
He seemed nice.
Normal.
Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult?
Then when there's someone older you guys lie?
And you lie to me?
Tell me.
You lie to me.
Get away from the clown car...
- Nate:
"It's gonna be okay, sweetheart."
- You asshole!
She shouldn't have to bear witness to your hate!
You like that?
!
It's the hose of justice!
- The hose of just... oh.
- [Stops spraying]
"Well, obviously, I'm not gonna spray you."
How can you defend him?
"He's a pediatrician, for god sakes."
We trusted him with our children.
"Yeah, so did I, and he's got a very gentle hand."
Don't use us as propaganda!
What are you guys doing over there?
Get in here.
- We're on the right side!
"- No, you're not!"
"Fine, you're gonna have to spray..."
"Dad, I can't believe you sprayed... aah!"
Protestors:
Ohh!
Aah!
Get in here and get changed for the wedding.
What the hell?
!
Seriously!
Aah!
We've got you on camera.
You're gonna regret this.
- No!
- Do you like them?
The Paki had me while I sucked off the black guy.
"By the way, his name is Lamin and he's really nice."
What shall I say at school?
My sister does porn.
- Why?
- Because I can't be a model.
- And I'm sick of school.
- Maybe I can buy up the negatives.
You think everything revolves around you.
"- Sofie, stay here!"
- There are more mags at the kiosk.
Sofie!
One more year.
Then you can do want you want.
Sofie!
"Mum, it's Sofie."
Listen.
Did you hear that?
It was your car.
You'll have to catch the bus to work.
- You fucking whore!
- I'm not a whore.
Fucking three darkies in a porn mag without telling me first!
Smashing up her car would have done the trick.
- You didn't have to do those photos.
- I did it for us.
So we could go to New York.
- Us?
We're through.
"- Don't go, Simon."
"Look, it's a little after 6:00."
I'll catch a ride and see you out there.
Bye.
- John.
- Yeah?
"The Balkans peace council is ""comprised"""
"or ""composed"" of ten members?"
Twelve members.
"Oh, right."
Thanks.
Composed.
What?
A three-block area has been evacuated.
You might wanna avoid that route coming home from work.
"- What do you think, Cy?"
- I'll lead with it.
- Great.
I'll see you Monday.
This'll make them sweat.
It's good.
What?
- I gotta go.
"- Come on, John."
"It'll look bad, my star reporter not showing up at the Christmas party."
I can't.Mary's waiting for me.
"It's a big house, isn't it?"
It's a steal at this price.
That's if you want it.
But we're gonna have to make an offer today.
The owner's highly motivated.
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.Take a look around.
Go down the hall.
What happened?
- A gunshot.
"- Quickly, put her down."
"Nurse, check her blood pressure."
Prepare her for surgery.
Oxygen mask.
How is she?
Blood pressure unstable.
Weak pulse.
Blood pressure low.
- Have you seen a man carrying a child?
- He went to casualty.
- Detain anyone suspicious.
"- Yes, sir!"
Are you related to the patient?
How was she wounded?
"Sir, you can't leave now!"
I have to registeryour name.
Where is he?
I'm an inspector.
Just continue.
"- Right, nurses, ignore them."
- Yes.
Don't disturb the doctor.
Put your guns down.
- What happened?
- There was a gunshot.
- Where?
- Over there.
Get everybody out.
I'll call H.Q
"Your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the forumla.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.
What did you do?
I'm sorry father.
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding and I would go out at the same time.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia!
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than an hour ago.
You hear anything?
No.
Me either.
Easy now.
"You just went to all that trouble to save my life, it would be a shame to kill me."
"Are you alright, Rodney?"
"Yeah, I'm just peachy now."
They attract.
Simply great!
I deeply regret to have called you.
I won't make this mistake again!
A lady has come to see you.
"All right, come"
Didn't I say I'd drop in someday?
And here I am.
You did say.
But I never expected you.
I don't know how to welcome you.
Anybody there?
"Yes, sir?"
What would you have?
Hot or cold?
Any cold drink.
"- Two cold drinks.- l will bring now, sir."
How is your father?
is that Mr Vijay's photograph?
- Yes.
He is my only friend.
Which is why I have kept his photograph.
But the walls in this room are still empty.
Why don't you fill it up with some good photographs?
Shall I ?
"Yes, Mr Daaga?"
What's up?
Don't you wory.
What am I here for?
So what ifyour men are guilty of murder?
I am there to save them.
See this bungalow!
- It's never been about sex.
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.
Having sex now will ruin everything.
You're a very sick man.
Mmm.
"Johnson's been around both leagues, but seems to have found a home here in the Bronx."
He's leading the American league with a 2.34 ERA and 24 strikeouts.
And strike three.
That makes strikeout number 25 for Johnson in this young season.
- I have the game on for you.
- Oh.
Great.
- Some wine?
- I'll wake up with a headache.
- One glass.
"- All right, one glass."
Same score?
This is good.
Sweet.
I normally don't like sweet.
I'm glad you like it.
Do you...
Would you mind terribly if we muted the TV?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
All right.
Would it be all right if I sat down?
- The wine made me warm.
- I can fix that.
- Good game?
- I can't hear.
What do you think?
Excellent!
You're very much appreciated.
You are flattering me.
Of course not!
Look.
"The blind is being touched by you, he is crying."
"Your Honour, if there isn't anything special, I request a rest."
For I have an eye problem.
You see pus from my eyes?
"Jury, have you reached any verdict?"
Yes.
Unanimous?
Yes.
The jury has pleaded the accused guilty.
"As stipulated,"
the accused should be hanged.
Court.
Wait.
Thank you for taking care of me.
This chicken leg is for you.
Sir.
"You kill me, but many many Ho Foons will appear."
Sir.
Wait.
"Your Honour, what punishment Ho Foon should receive?"
He is stipulated to be hanged.
It's alright.
Yan.
Let him down.
What do you want?
You just ordered to hang him.
I sleep just fine.
Ok.
And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So... get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"$10,000 even."
Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30,"
"44, 45 each."
3 pounds should be 48 each.
- Who's short?
- Ok.
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
"I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter, so he's probably still in the sack."
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
This only works when they're scared of you.
Jack off.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"You were after money, the same as i was."
You would've cornered gold if you could've done it.
"I'm broke, too."
I'm right back where i started 10 years ago- right down to my last dollar.
"But i'll get on top, and you'll stay right where you are!"
You belong in the streets!
Get back into the streets!
Get a doctor.
"Yes, sir."
"Take it easy, jim."
The doctor's coming.
You're going to be all right.
Jim!
Jim.
"I'm all right, josie."
"Lie still, jim."
Don't move.
I'll go.
"No, no, no."
"Don't go, luke."
We can't split partners now.
"We're not going to split partners, jim."
"We never have, and we never will."
"Take it easy, boss."
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna pull through.
"Sure, i will."
"You know, it's a great life."
I wouldn't sell this next minute for... for a million dollars.
Nick... i owe you a bet.
We've got to get it back.
Get it back?
It's absolutely a matter of life and death.
"Well, how do I pull the check out of the bank?"
"You know the manager of the bank, don't you?"
Yes.
Tell him you want it back.
"But that's highly irregular, I..."
"Look, get me that check back and I'll give you $5.000."
"Well, I'll try."
"I don't guarantee anything, but I'll try."
I'll be waiting for you in the coffee shop.
"Something else, sir?"
"Another cup of coffee, please."
You've had six.
"Well, make it seven."
"Yes, sir."
Hello?
This is Mr. Sabourin.
Has Mr. O'Hara come back yet?
"No, sir, he hasn't."
"By the way, Mr. Sabourin, Wentworth Drug is up two more points."
Isn't that nice?
"Yes, yes, thank you."
Well?
Let's talk about me.
What do I get?
What do you mean?
$5.000.
"Oh, no."
"No, Mr. Sabourin."
That check was stubbed.
Letting him loose.
Somebody looking for me?
I can smell something burning out here.
Oh you!
Hi!
Having fun?
Keep going.
My turn now.
Call me.
"One apple juice, please."
How rude!
I'm not used to people not turning around to look at me.
So you are one of those silent types.
You come to a party and then stand alone in a corner...
Waiting for a girl.
"What does someone turning to look at you, have to do with your beauty?"
So that means you are interested in me.
Right?
Right.
"Actually, I have come with someone else."
So...
Oh.
I hope he won't mind if I hold your hand?
Or put my hand around your waist?
What happened?
Oh...
You can't dance.
This is a problem tall girls face.
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Let's see.
It didn't seem like you are here with someone else.
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
You!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
How did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
"Cover him, Ria."
Mr. de Vries... you're a doctor.
Mr. Reve!
Calm down.
What a shame we have to meet here.
Tension gauge.
Life takes strange turns.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
That's why matters of life and death interest me.
Bloem!
"Thinking of death I cannot sleep, remember?"
How is he?
How's Herman?
- He's in very bad shape.
- Dead?
Yes.
A friend of yours?
A relative?
The fourth man!
I told him but he wouldn't believe me.
"Doctor, the liver."
"Now Herman can go into a vase too, he can..."
- Enlarged but intact.
- Normal reflexes.
- She's done it again.
- You've had a lucky escape.
But she's done it again the fourth man.
She takes him like a spider a spider also fucks her mate and then devours him... dead!
Quite a shock for you.
"Keep on talking, it'll settle you down."
"She's a spider, a witoh."
She leads men to ruin.
Hey.
Constantino and those trucks are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
"20 minutes, give or take."
"Tell me you have a plan, a really good one."
"Hey, I need to borrow your tank."
It won't fire.
"I told you that, right?"
There's not a single round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
"Uh, the throttle's there on your left."
"And to steer, you're just gonna..."
Hey.
This is not my first time.
Jake.
Good luck out there.
Yeah.
"You, too."
"Any minute now, huh?"
Yeah.
"I'm, uh..."
"You know, he's here, watching."
"You know that, right?"
They still doing the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
"Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop."
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
"Cooper, do not attempt to remove that yourself."
Removing it yourself is extremely dangerous.
"Stop that, that could kill you!"
Just stay calm!
Is that Shou?
Is that Shou?
What's he saying?
What's he saying?
"Okay, Cooper."
We're gonna commence with deactivation.
"Oh, that's great news."
We need you to follow instructions and make it to the access point.
The access point?
Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?
"- Oh, fuck!"
More stairs?
Come on!
- Just one more level.
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Left at the top.
"- Okay, which door?"
- Room at the end.
What is it?
There's gonna be something behind there.
I can feel it.
- Something like...
- Like what?
Some personal fucked-up shit.
Like...
"I don't know, I could feel it digging around in my head."
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No.
It's a laminate.
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.
It looks exactly like it.
But it is like one one-hundredth of the cost.
Oh.
I still wanna go with the real wood.
What?
You can't even tell the difference.
It's not the point.
"Well, what is the point?"
I just...
I don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.
"If you're not wood, don't try and look like wood."
I don't think that it's pretending.
"This is a lie, Ben."
Just be up front and tell people what you really are.
"Okay, you're right."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Maybe we should just go look at the grills and we'll come back.
Okay.
I slept with someone.
- I said...
- I heard you.
You tell me this in Home Depot because you know I hate a public scene.
"No, that is not why I'm telling..."
I knew it.
Mommy just has to have some tests done.
That's all.
There are more schnitzels in the fridge.
I'll make some.
Leave her be.
Have a seat.
I'd rather stand.
Would you like something to drink?
- No.
How's your father?
He's in the hospital.
- What's wrong?
Do you really care?
Yes.
I saw a picture of the musical in the hallway.
You and Dad are embraced.
How idyllic.
"That's all over, Goni."
All the big hits in this theater were his.
His name is on half of the posters in the hallway.
No one can take away the credit for the things he did.
"Yes, but no one's giving him any work either."
Including you.
How old are you?
25.
Why?
Did you know that my son is 21?
"I came to talk about Dad, not your son."
Do you know how long he's out of work?
I know.
You used to be friends.
There are things you don't know.
Your old man gonna be okay with this?
Don't worry about him.
He's fine.
"Yeah, I won't worry about him when he's ripping my fucking dick off."
Do you need me to sign something?
Good.
Relax.
"Look what you're doing with your shoulders, right?"
It's...
- Right?
- Okay.
Don't be wild.
And turn it over.
Nice and relaxed.
"Yeah, we're having fun."
You're not leaving yourself any room.
"So, what is she doing wrong?"
You need to stay back.
You're crowding your punch.
Crowding your punch.
"You come in here, you're not getting the full extension."
Right.
"The first one is here, here, and here."
You know what it's setting up?
"- Look what's coming, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
"If you throw it and you stay there, what's gonna happen?"
"I'm gonna knock you the fuck out, all right?"
Good.
"Come on, move."
Move.
Here I come.
"Oh my God, you're serious!"
So where were we?
What am I wearing?
"Well, nothing, naturally."
Ha!
Ha!
Charles?
Hello?
Charles?
Charles!
Battery!
No!
[ Her screams echoes. ]
[ Amaar is banging his head on the table. ]
I can't believe you built a bomb.
I didn't build a bomb!
I merely collected a bunch of things that look like bomb-making things!
"It was not a crime, just suspicious and very costly."
"- Well, you proved your point."
"- I know, and it breaks my heart!"
"Then why'd you do it, Baber?"
Because I was happy with the way things are!
[ He starts whining. ]
OK!
"Baber, that's what this is about?"
"Look, nothing's going to change!"
The mosque will always be there for you.
It doesn't matter anyway.
"By this time tomorrow,"
We'll be in solitary confinement together.
[ The door opens. ]
OK!
Please leave.
If nothing had happened... there is no need for you to get furious.
Manoj!
Manoj!
"Manoj, open the door!"
Open the door!
Hello!
Where are you going?
You can't leave the place without answering us.
I have no obligations to do so.
I'll tell what I have to tell at the police station.
I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me.
- Auto!
Why is he so adamant?
I don't know.
Start the bike.
Come on.
I'm dead!
"Though I wasn't a super-cop, I was at least called a mediocre one."
"I might lose that even identity now, because of you!"
"Keep going, Panju."
Will you drive recklessly just because you are cop?
Can't you be careful?
Where is your helmet?
"Let's go, Panju."
"Sorry, man."
Idiot.
He went inside!
How do I always find one like this!
Hey!
Inspector Arivazhagan?
What!
?
I'm already married.
No.
You're not.
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
Yeah you said you bought a ring yourself at Woolworth's.
When times got hard he tried to send you back to Wales.
And he's disappointed in you?
He's a stupid bloody fool.
But he's not as much a fool as you.
He changed a name for Christ sake!
Where's your fucking self respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
I know you deserve better.
You?
You're the better!
Catrin I...uh...
Look I think...you must.
And I think...you're a drunk squalid bully.
Quiet!
Hush.
You are speaking of flight lieutenant Lundbeck?
Cha?
You know he didn't have any film roles under orders.
"They told me I would be good for ""Eagle Squadron"" recruitment, Sir."
He's desperate to get back in the air.
Poor boy.
Tea sir?
It's me.
"I'm going, and I'm not gonna fail."
- You're new here.
- It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
Anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
A hook.
Hey.
Come with me.
This...
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
Your sword... how strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
Give me ten hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
(Hook) Ladies.
"In this world, we are slaves to time."
And ours is running out.
"In other words, ticktock."
(Zips sleeve)
I was hoping it'd be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
- A gunshot.
"- Quickly, put her down."
"Nurse, check her blood pressure."
Prepare her for surgery.
Oxygen mask.
How is she?
Blood pressure unstable.
Weak pulse.
Blood pressure low.
- Have you seen a man carrying a child?
- He went to casualty.
- Detain anyone suspicious.
"- Yes, sir!"
Are you related to the patient?
How was she wounded?
"Sir, you can't leave now!"
I have to registeryour name.
Where is he?
I'm an inspector.
Just continue.
"- Right, nurses, ignore them."
- Yes.
Don't disturb the doctor.
Put your guns down.
- What happened?
- There was a gunshot.
- Where?
- Over there.
Get everybody out.
I'll call H.Q
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
.
Otoharada Kuro...
You go end up like me!
DEATH NOTE...
If you're true then kill him!
Creve!
40!
Next to the armed man
- the psychological impact must be such that ...
"- Come on, get out."
"Go, go!"
We just heard a shot
A shot was produced within !
- M .
Mogi!
- The assault!
Launch the assault!
For the moment at the time of the shot the assault was launched
It evacuates a victim
One hostage was released
"The hostage would be the owner of the residence , 36 ."
Is she accompanied the police officer
The two hostages are safe .
"- Chief, are you okay?"
- Good.
- Eh.
- Yes.
What was that shot fire?
A risky shot.
Otoharada was caught pain.
Creve
A sort of spasm?
Put me down!
Put me down!
I can't go!
I've got to stay!
Put me down!
Stop!
Stop this sled!
Whoa!
What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
"- Oh, no, no."
You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Later on you'll thank me.
"I hate you, you beast!"
Let me out of here!
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!"
Whoops!
Ha!
- Let's go!
Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
"It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share."
"You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty."
Can you cook?
"Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook."
Huh.
"Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?"
I'll do nothing to help you.
"I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me."
Want you?
I might know more than you.
That's why I'm not afraid.
Hold up.
I've met other people who talk like you.
They don't have anyone in their lives to care about.
Are you one of those people?
I think your diagnosis has gone too far now.
Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh.
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay.
It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away.
So I got to continue treating you.
Sorry for wasting your time.
"You still have the medicine, right?"
Here.
"Next time if you want to change doctors, you can."
Just inform them at the counter.
Never felt lonely.
"Because I have me, myself to care."
"Damn, so music video of you."
Up yours.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
No.
You sure?
You want to see a doctor?
Damn.
To say sorry
I have to wait another month.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Yoon.
[LAUGHING]
- So you still wanna have coffee?
- Absolutely.
"Oh, great."
"Okay, I really will stop gushing in a minute."
But when we walked out into that parking lot and I saw that you drive a Prius too...
[LAUGHS]
- I almost wept.
- I know.
I'm not alone anymore.
Oh!
"I didn't ask you, though."
"Are you married, or?"
Mm.
Divorced.
Are you kidding me?
That's fantastic!
My marriage was a miserable failure too.
No.
"No, actually we're still really good friends."
Yes.
I'm still really good friends with my ex-husband.
- You're kidding.
"- No, I am not."
- We are the exact same person.
- I know.
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever let your armpit hair grow out just to see how long it'll get?
Eww.
No.
Do you?
No.
-Bail reports.
-Thanks.
Bull.
Right on time.
And in perfect order.
Billie. look how neat that is.
Yeah.
I didn't drool on it or anything.
Look.
Bull.
I'm sorry about what happened in the cafeteria.
It doesn't bother me that you laughed at my rhyme scheme.
You laughed at me.
Oh. come on.
Bull. that isn't you.
You never missed the boat of life.
Besides. there is no boat of life.
It's called a metaphor.
Harry.
A literary device used to illustrate dissatisfaction with my current status in the cosmos.
-Come again?
-My life is poo-poo.
Bull. we all feel like that from time to time. right?
I mean. everyone wants more out of life.
It seems to me like you've got it already.
You're a judge.
You stand for justice.
You're a public defender.
You stand for the underprivileged.
I'm a bailiff.
I stand.
Kind of like cattle.
Are you really gonna show me the bingo prizes?
"Just for you, Goten."
This way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Huh?
What was that?
"Okay, let's open this up."
Right.
Whoa.
Are these all bingo prizes?
Tsk tsk tsk...
"Goten, don't go getting surprised yet."
Click.
What's this?
"Oh, Goten."
Of course it'll hurt if you just rush in and touch it.
"Whoa, that's some tough security...."
Mum's invention.
She says that nobody will find the grand prize when it's in this.
Then we won't be able to see it either...
Don't worry.
"Mum's inventions may be great, but..."
See?
They've always got some sort of flaw.
"Great job, Trunks-kun."
"Okay then, I'll show you the grand prize."
Whoa.
I'm hungry...
"It's your own fault, Pilaf-sama."
We've had nothing but grass to eat for three days.
"That's a harsh diet, even for a dog."
Okay.
Forget I said it.
"-Say, Josiah."
-Yep.
Have you ever thought about marriage?
"Well, animals mate."
"Plants grow, flowers bloom."
Seems to be the natural order of things.
Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural.
Right?
It's not something that's forced on you.
JOSlAH:
Exactly.
Then again...
... couldbethefates sending you a blessing.
BUCK:
Yeah?
Fine wife.
The life of a child.
Most men would live and die for that.
Yeah.
"Well, tell me this."
How do I know that Lucy is the one for me?
"I mean, I hardly know her."
Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it.
"Well, what do you mean?"
Get to know the girl.
Circled back two miles.
Looks like they gave up on us.
Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here.
"If they're smart, that's what they'll do."
He ain't getting away this time.
- I'm open.
- Come on.
Move it around.
- Watch out.
Watch out.
- Hit my blocker.
Hit my blocker.
Can't feel it.
"Okay, put some mustard on this one."
"Yeah, right."
"Come on, man, keep it going."
"Let's do it, man."
Ten bucks for the first one who gets one past my glove.
L'll make it 50.
"Put that puck in the net, or we'll be here all night."
I am not pleased.
Cross!
Cross!
"Move, move!"
"Nice save, my darling."
Come in.
"Mr Mayor, thanks for driving over."
Never miss a practise.
Have you heard?
Newman failed a surprise inspection today.
This report should sway public opinion and clear the way for my purchase of the land.
What about the boys?
"Well, I love kids just as much as anyone, but..."
Excuse me.
"Do I need to install tampon dispensers in the locker room, ladies?"
Hit someone.
But there are...
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This is my home.
It is!
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
You're trouble you know that Cece.
What afraid you're going to fall in love?
OK you have got to stop it with the winks.
She winks?
All the time.
Becca is a winker.
Becca's a wanker?
"No not a wanker, a winker."
She winks.
I only do it to guys I think are cute Ok?
It's for this movie I'm doing it's a character role.
So what are you guys doing afterwards?
Ah home.
I've got to work early in the morning.
"Whoa, whoa lame excuse."
Excuse me can we get six tequila shots please?
Top shelf?

"Oh no, no that is trouble."
I puke.

I have an audition at nine.
I have casting.
I'm free.
I'll stay.
Ok well I'll let you off the hook this one time OK.
There should be a cross passage about three yards from there.
"Tac Team leader, bring that *** down by agent Mei."
Guys...
It's Sara's.
We got a heat source.
"Wherever the reading's coming from, it's not on the blueprints."
Let's go.
"All right, we got something."
It's about five meters down the access shaft.
Hold your 20.
Lin's team will be on the flip side of the shaft in three minutes.
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
Can't read you.
We're going in.
There's our heat source.
That looks like a piece of her dress.
She was here.
Check it out.
Cover!
"Alpha, this is Staging Command."
Do you read me?
Do you read me?

"Kelton, answer me, damn it!"
Monroe!
Where's Kelton?
I couldn't get to him.
There was too much debris.
We can't get through.
Roof collapse.
"I repeat, we cannot get through."
"All right, call in Search and Rescue now."
"Aye, aye, sir."
"On deck, Mr. Pardoe!"
Mr. Crawford!
Mr. Crawford!
- Find the senior midshipman for me.
"- Mr. Kilpatrick, sir?"
- Tell him to see me in the gunroom.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get that hatch open.
Let some air into the magazine.
Did you hear what I said?
Open that hatch.
"But we had it open yesterday, sir."
I don't care if it was.
I'm giving you an order.
Open that hatch!
- Orders is weekly.
"- Stand, you insolent dog!"
Mr. Kilpatrick?
Mr. Scott-Padget wants to see you.
- What's he want?
- I don't know.
He said now.
- Get that hatch open at once.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Sergeant Kneebone."
- Three more.
- I've got seven.
- Only five.
- Good enough.
"Only a few more, and we'll have the whole ship."
"- Now, we write our petition."
Why did you go there?
Don't you get a newspaper at home?
You are changing the topic again.
You can try.
You cannot avoid me.
- Why did you go there?
- Shiv!
What's wrong...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
I am getting married.
Okay?
And he's just the type of guy I want.
"Intense, charming.."
Silent.
Silent in bed as well?
Stop your nonsense and leave!
I am the one talking nonsense?
I am the one talking nonsense?
He's just your type?
He's charming?
What were you doing with me?
What were you doing with me?
"Tell me, what were you doing with me then!"
Tell me something.
Listen... please.
I won't do anything.
Listen to me.
I understand that economics is important.
"I am a banker, I understand."
But doesn't chemistry mean anything?
What happened?
I yawned.
Will be best if I am packing and i'm on my way.
"I think, I was not the wrong one."
"I asked it, you are not sleepy."
"But, he not sleepy, respectable major lord."
Why did he yawn then?
Why you yawned my Lajos?
I don't know.
Only some.
Only some?
Did you yawn because you feel well possibly?
"Yes, major lord."
"Here you go to believe, major lord."
That's right.
"Please make a statement, dear Tót."
What would you do now the with pleasure?
- May I be honest?
- Of course.
Well...
I now the with pleasure...
I would make a box a little.
Yes?
"- And you, Mariska?"
- I too.
- Ágika?
"- I too, of course"
If you insist on him this much...
I do not regret it.
"I ask you for it only, let this not occur repeatedly."
No.
Never again.
Hee hee!
You've bust it.
How fast were you going?
"In the car, it was 124. 9."
"More, and the other side will go."
No.
Ready?
That's it.
'Didn't quite manage it that time. '
I'm not quitting.
I'll have another go.
You better succeed.
One of the strangest things about being over 40 is that you start to want contestants on game shows to win.
"You also start to like game show hosts, even dressed as deck chairs."
Richard Whiteley!
APPLAUSE
Wow.
How are you?
Have a seat.
I've got to be careful with this.
It's back to Bridlington tomorrow.
How much do you get for renting that out?
"Mind you, I'm not one to talk."
Let's be honest - really.
Let's do your career history.
Born up north.
Yorkshire.
Which is fine.
Educated at Cambridge.
Wooh!
Someone has to be.
You were the first person on Channel Four.
Clamp.
Clamp.
Keep steady pressure.
3-0 silks.
3-0 standing by.
More gauze.
Gauze.
- Got it open.
"- Okay, clamp it."
"Here you go, doctor."
- Keep the pressure on.
"- Yes, sir."
Let's get some more gauze in here.
"Okay, she's under."
I want you two stationed right here.
Do not leave unless you hear directly from me.
"Okay, Jack, those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask."
"If you got anything else you want to add, Jack, now would be the time."
"That's my statement, as it is."
"My god, Tony."
Nina tried to commit suicide.
"She jammed her neck into Richards' needle, ruptured an artery."
Where is she now?
She's in the clinic being operated on.
Who's with her?
"Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated."
I saw her go under.
Who's with her now?
"Tony, who's with her?"
!
Damn it!
Which way did she go?
Later I find out it's not.
I've been conned.
- What are my options?
"- Just drop it, right?"
- I'd say so too.
- Aren't there any legal measures?
- I'll look into it.
- I'll treat you to dinner.
Oysters?
- Oysters are just fine.
Call me.
- This weekend.
Mia's got a bag.
- Mia hasn't got a bag of oysters.
- I didn't buy them.
- You get them in a basket.
- You don't catch them in a basket.
"No, but you sell oysters in a basket and clams in a net."
You're confusing them with shrimp.
Way to go!
- Good morning.
"- My, fresh rolls and everything."
- Thanks for a great night.
"- Well, thank you."
You were great.
"It was mind-blowing, Frank."
"- Yes, I performed my magic."
- I've never felt anything like it.
"When you told me flat out, I was hurt, I have to admit."
- But Casper knew this little trick.
- You talked to Casper about it?
Yes.
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- [boys] yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's yo-yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
Hello?
Okay.
We will add numbers to the beginning and end of the old number.
Try all the combinations.
What's this?
"If it were a test, I could skip the questions I can't answer."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
Can you come down to the cashier?
Why?
What happened?
"This way, please."
The alarm went off.
It's almost one o'clock.
Where are you?
I tried.
I tried them all.
None of them worked.
That's impossible.
I am out of here or we'll get caught.
"No, wait."
Try again by putting them at the beginning.
"Ma'am, there was a little misunderstanding."
Please forgive us.
There's no need to apologize.
"Actually, I was kind of in a hurry."
You've wasted my time.
"Come on, baby."
Let's get out of here.
It's not working.
None of it's working.
"Come on Uluc, work your head."
What password would a mathematician use?
"For the sake of my happiness, won't you let me have a month of my life?"
"Please Babuji, give me one month"
Go.
Live it up
My baby
Where's Simran?
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?
I told you to wake up Raj Did you?
No
Open sesame
Do you have the keys to this?
Anybody home?
No one at home
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
"At Robbie's party, no?"
I don't go to parties.
- Great!
"Nor do I, ever"
Your eyes...
What's wrong with my eyes?
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?
My grandmother.
"Like you, her eyes too had hues of yellows and blues"
Keep reading.
I only wanted to find out how you read upside-down
This is the limit!
"Simran, you're here?"
I heard you've missed the train.
"- No, I took it"
I was afraid...
I told them how the world really works.
"How there were predators, how we had to adapt."
"I led them here, under the great ice."
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
"Well, we all have a purpose."
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
"Wait and see, Will."
You wait and see.
[ELEPHANT SEALS GRUNTING]

- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?
"Don't know, but it sure is ugly."
"Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?"
Right.
"Outside, now!"
We are outside.
"- Come on, then."
- No... you come on.
MUMBLE:
Excuse me.
Bryan?
- Huh?
MUMBLE:
Down here.
"Ah, g'day, chief."
What are you doing here?
"Bryan, I need a favor."
A big one.
"For you, champ, anything."
Anyway...
All the comforts.
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.
Do you know the area?
- Is the house yours?
- I wish.
We have fans available if you need them.
- Whose house is it?
- The owner lives in Valencia.
"She hasn't come in years, she's very old..."
- Who rented it last?
- I don't remember.
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.
I was here yesterday and I saw three people enter the house.
"Nice, very pretty."
You're hurting me!
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?
I don't know who rents it.
You rent it and you don't know to who?
I rent it to him by the day.
He calls me right before and puts the money in an account.
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?
Who is he?
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
Nothing.
Do you still have the photographs?
"Yeah, I have everything inside."
"Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me?"
Copy that.
"Be right back, billy."
What are you hoping to find?
We're trying to clear a good man's name.

"These are, uh, these are all from the enright crime scene."
"Okay, let's scan those."
All right.
Let me invert the images.
"All right, there's jesse, there's the house,"
"The front gate, more house."
"What else we got, eric?"
wait a minute.
"Eric, go back."
Go back.
What is he doing?
"Evidence marker number four, eric."
"Number four, that's the cuff link."
That's the missing evidence.
Right.
Who is this?
I don't know.
It isn't cardoza.
It's not jesse.
Who is that?
Let me clean up the flare on his face.
Hitting the highlights.
Clean up some of this mess.
Captain sutter.
- talking about?
"- Your date, Audrey?"
She got a visit from your wife.
Grace cancelled her.
Grace did?
You had no idea?
Do you know how this impacts my business?
Audrey Richardson?
She's one of my most important clients.
"Well, if Grace thought it was a bad idea, then I'm fine with that."
I'll find Audrey someone else.
Rein in your wife.
"I don't put my wife in her ""place."""
This isn't the '50s.
Remember what's at stake here.
"Look around, Adriana."
We are shut down.
The SEC is up our ass.
I am well aware of what's at stake.
Wait.
This is it.
Here.
The location.
It's perfect.
Your office?
Not my office.
A 1950s office.
"A throwback to old traditions, gender roles, where a man could ""rein in his wife."""
With all the sexual role-play that implies.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
"That was inspired, Neil."
And you have a son...
But I'm your wife forever.
"So, when you die.."
The house is for me.
"If not, why would I last this long."
It's better to leave her rest.
-I'm not tired!
Why did you leave the house and came here?
Do you want me to take you home?
-What are you saying?
That would kill her!
Máximo can't be good to me!
Yes..
Take me to my house!
"When you recover, you'll can come back."
"Now, you have to be strong."
-I don't want to be strong.
And you better realize this:
I don't have anything to thank you or your parents for.
It's better to leave her rest.
I was leaving...
-She can't be moved from here!
I suppose...
-She's perfectly fine!
- Máximo!
Come closer to the window.
Have a look.
They say breads are falling again.
Watch out!
Working conflicts.
Pensioner's home.
"Yes, put it through."
"I saw the line of people waiting for the ""Haunted Montecito Tour."""
You want the suite back?
You give me twice what I paid.
Twice?
I'll tell you what I'll give you twice of...

Can I speak with you for a moment?
Excuse us.
What is it?
It's worth it.
Monica.
"You know even dead, that bitch is givin' me a headache."
"I don't know what you want, but don't you try any of that reverse psychology stuff on me again."
It won't work.
"You hear me, Sam?"
Will not work.
Relax.
I have a simple question for you.
"Oh, a simple question?"
"What's this, reverse reverse psychology?"
"[Laughs] Touché, Ms. Marquez."
Touché.
"Okay, l-I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Oh, playing the innocent."
Very clever.
You okay?
"This ghost stuff is getting to you, isn't it?"
Maybe a little.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Anyway, what's the question?"
You copy?
Angie?
Run!
Oh shit.
"Other way, other way."
"Go, go go go."
Go.
Are you okay?
Are you with me?
"No, no no."
I'm okay.
Oh shit.
Shit.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Bye.
I fucking told you she was evil.
"Blair, we um, we need to barricade the doors."
All right?
"We need to barricade the doors, we need to buy some time."
All right?
We gotta keep moving.
"Look, they're calculated killers, okay."
"Blair, look, if someone comes looking for the sheriff..."
They're gonna wanna make sure there aren't any signs that anything happened.
Okay?
"So, that means that, they're gonna have to hide his body, or hide his patrol car, and hide our van."
"Okay, so there's some time."
There's a little bit of time.
Okay?
"Look, that wasn't our last chance."
"There's uh, there's gotta be another way out."
"Here, take off your trunks."
Hold this.
Okay.
And then put on these jogging shorts.
People are watching!
Oh!
Here.
Come on.
Come on.
Drink this very slowly.
Slowly.
"Babs, damn it, turn around."
- I'm your trainer.
- I don't suppose anyone here knows the origin of the marathon.
The Greeks met the Persians in battle...
Sit down.
On a great plain called Marathon.
The Greeks were victorious and sent a runner back to the city with the glorious news.
The distance was that of the modern marathon.
"- Rick, what are you doing?"
"- We need another sock, Coach."
One more sock.
Lacing up shoes.
The young man ran at top speed...
"Shoes, please."
That's too tight!
It's too tight!
"T.C., I'm dry!"
I'm dry!
"He stumbled through the gates of the city, cried out """" Rejoice, rejoice, """

There's a lesson there.
# He sang as if he knew me #
Will.
# In all my dark despair #
We're finished.
# And then he looked right through me # # as if I wasn't there #
"Will, come on."
"Will, we're finished."
"So there I was, killing them softly with my song."
"Or rather, being killed."
"And not that softly, either."
I was singing with my eyes closed.
Was I frightened?
I was petrified.
This was definitely not island living.
# Killing me softly #
# With his song ##
"Thank you, Finsbury."
I'd like to introduce one or two members of the band.
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.
And that's about it.
Let's get off quick.
Get off.
"Marcus, thank you."
For the song.
You were terrific.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
"As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate."
Okay.
How about McDonald's?
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
"Sifu Wong, I propose a toast to your health."
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
"Cheers, everyone."
I'll help myself.
- It's an honor to know you.
- Don't mention it.
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
It looks like I blew my chance to be Sifu Wong's student.
Let's get out of here.
We're like brothers.
We'll find a way.
I've got it!
What?
You have to continue with schemes to show your heroism.
I promise this scheme will work better.
I don't want to be a hero.
You've got to appeal to Sifu's compassion.
"Good, that's the look!"
Let's go!
"- Sifu, we're in trouble!"
- What is it?
"A band of robbers was raiding the bank and Mousy was brave, he stood up to them without thought for his own life."
He beat them.
- What happened next?
- It's bad.
He's severely injured.
Were there any police around?
They disappeared when the robbers arrived.
If you are planning to blow your brains out... ..could you wait till you're out on the high seas?
I just mopped these floors.
I don't need this shit.
you asked me to help you.
And God knows I've tried.
not really if you're not going to talk to me.
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.
You don't wanna talk about that.
Or the booze you're drinking.
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
The ones that aren't healing.
And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.
Ibuprofen.
That was my favorite mug.
Stay out of my shit.
Logan.
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.
{\i1\cH00ffff}Best night ever!

I love you.
I love you.
You're such a doll.
Mr. Logan.
Jesus.
Please.
We need a ride.
Not available.
Call a cab.
Daddy.
Go crazy.
And here's a tiny little schnitzel and I'll take a tiny little bite...
"No, don't eat mine!"
I'm late for rehearsal.
"Go on, go to your rehearsal and don't do us any favors."
I know your assistant director can do the replacement.
"Sure, why not?"
Why don't we let Slava Chaplin do it?
Silkis.
Silkis.
Hello.
Are you Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant.
"Yitzhak, what's going on?"
We have a search warrant.
What are you searching for?
"Goni, go to your room."
Why?
Come in.
Check the bookshelf.
Take a look in the bedroom.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
Don't you think you're out of line?
What do you think you'll find here?
"Tell them to stop, Yitzhak."
You and your damn police have some nerve!
Ora.
There's nothing we can do.
Let them finish.
It's no more invasive than having your ears pierced.

Um...
The signature page...
- Where do I sign?
- Oh.
- Signature.
Yeah.
- There's a page missing.
- Okay.
- Just a moment.
Alright.
I'll just wait... here.
What the fuck?
- All good?
- All good.
What we're working on is an interactive augmented reality system.
- Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.
Oh.
Okay.
Um...
Ow.
Um...
- What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.
- Like Mario Brothers?
- If you like.
"- You're qualified to do this, right?"
- I haven't killed anyone yet.
May I?
Yeah.
Sleep tight.
Good night.
"Good night, Morten."
"Good night, Martin."
It will be fun to see what important thing I forgot.
"Yes, it will be lovely."
"As long as there's food and wine, everything will be fine."
- You're not nervous at all?
"- No, I'm looking at it as a test."
- Of what?
- Anna will marry many times.
The first wedding is always hard.
"With a little luck, it will be okay."
Jørgen...
Jørgen?
Yes?
"- Mother, aren't you in bed?"
- I can't get on line.
Don't speak to me like I'm senile.
Why can't I get online?
There's poker in three minutes.
Why did we have to get that damn wireless network?
But it's working now.
Thank you.
- Sleep tight.
- Don't stay up all night.
Sorry.
- Could we teach her to knock first?
"- I've tried, but she's senile."
Only when she wants to be.
- I'll send her to a home tomorrow.
- Do you promise?
Nothing!
Nothing!
"I tell you I saw them, as clear as I see you now."
The captain's gone completely crazy.
He should be locked up.
He's becoming dangerous.
Everyone seems to know about it.
News travels fast around here.
People are staying indoors.
- There's no way they can know.
- We've said too much.
There's that sailor who saw the girls in the ship cemetery.
"What about Louise, did she see anything?"
Louise?
"Yes, maybe."
She has second sight.

Now open the door.
Good.
Pardon me.
What are we going to do about this Chummy individual?
We can't allow her to sing.
"The minute she opens her mouth, the ushers will open the doors."
"That's where you're wrong, Chowsky she'll be the biggest laugh in the show."
- But she takes it seriously.
- The audience won't.

Put it down.
- Why sir?
Are you trying to con me?
You aren't getting anything.
Put it down
You're getting worked up over nothing.
This is for your profit
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella
Here you are.
A pound extra?
No two.
"Keep it, okay?"
Shameless!
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give India a bad name
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here
I'm off.
I'll keep this
Rev up!
Babuji
What is the matter?
You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel
They call themselves Hindustani!
Blot on India!
Ought to drown themselves
Rascals!
"No shame, no decency."
How to respect their elders... they don't even know.
"Are you sure you're okay, dude?"
"No, I'm not."
"I start thinking, you know, and it makes..."
It makes me so angry.
What am I saying?
Okay.
Were gonna go...
We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.
- Yes!
- And you stay here and eat your eggs.
Have the...
Have...
Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.
"- Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?"
- Can you meet us later?
Meet you later?
Can I meet you later?
- Are you gonna meet us?
"- Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later!"
All right.
"All right, sign here, here and here."
And what is this?
These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured... or killed.
"Oh, we don't care about that."
Sign away.
"- What's the, uh, fighter's name?"
- Clown Baby.
- Clown Ba...
Clown Baby?
- Yeah.
- You mean like a baby clown?
- Not a baby clown.
And it's self conscious.
Conscious of self.
Right.
"I mean, yeah, yeah."
I'm self conscious.
"Which is a good thing, I think."
What do you think?
"Well, I mean, I think it's really good."
I'm all about my work.
And my body is my work.
"So... one might say that... yeah, I'm all about my body."
"But in some respects, that is true, but you're completely missing the point."
And the point is...
I completely missed my point.
"Ok, rewind, reset."
"Uh, look."
I've... got a great vibe between you and me.
Great energy there.
"So, yeah."
Ok.
I get it.
So let's lay the facts down.
"You want to be with me, and vice versa."
That much is clear.
But my work always comes first.
I need to lay that...
down right off the bat.
"Basically, my body comes before you."
He seems perfect.
"Good looking, somewhat single minded, somewhat vain... and not too bright."
No promise of a great romance.
No chance of falling...
"I mean, of course, it needs a lot of work, but wow!"
I think I'm having goose bumps.
Oh!
The minbar can go right there.
And my office can be in that room with the family
- Of angry racoons!
- Yes!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Why is there a team
- With a wrecking ball out front?
"- Like I said, the place is scheduled for demolition."
- [Together]:
Today?
"- Yeah, in 15 minutes or so."
"But don't worry, guys!"
I can find you a place exactly like this...
probably.
- Can't we stop them?
- No.
Only the mayor can stop the demolition now.
- How do you even know that?
- She likes to brag.
"You guys really want this place, don't you?"
- More than anything!
- Huh.
- OK.
You go find Ann and I'll stay here and make sure
- They don't tear it down.
- Brilliant!

I don't know why you let him move in.
He's me brother.
You never know when you'll need bone marrow.
"He's rude, he's ignorant, he's lazy."
Yeah.
How could two brothers be so different?
"Anyway, he's gone."
Moved back in with Donna.
"That's the last we'll see of ""The Troyminator""."
"I had to tell you, at that party the other night in the bathroom, I saw..."
- What?
- What?
You was in the bathroom at the party the other night and you saw...
Saw... that it needed a makeover.
So paint it magnolia.
Put some decking' down.
Sort your taps out.
- Eh?
- Just a fuckin' thought!
Gotta go.
See ya.
What's up with you?
Looks like death row in here.
"Er... yeah, well, better get back in the saddle."
That horse'll be on bricks by now.
I'd best bust a move.
I've got to meet Amanda.
- Who?
- Amanda.
"You know, with weird eyes."
See ya!
"Gonna pop out, get some fags."
I should go.
Hang on.
"You might as well stay for the beginning of ""Saved by the Bell"", if you want."
"Okay, how do I look?"
Good.
How do I look?
"- Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
"- Wait, how much did I weigh at birth?"
I don't know.
It was your birth.
"But you should know, shouldn't you?"
"I mean, if you're my dad."
"Listen, she doesn't suspect that we're not father and son."
She's not going to be trying to catch us out.
When's your birthday?
Quick.
- August 19.
- Okay.
Who's my mum?
Your mum's your mum.
"So you were married to my mum, but now you've split up?"
Yeah.
Whatever.
Does it bother you or me?
"No, I'm comfortable with it."
But I think you still have a few issues.
"It's not funny, okay."
- Only cause you're a...
"- You love her still, don't you?"
- Christ's sake.
- I know you do.
- You love Mummy.
"Dr. Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you.
Die!
She took a blow to the head when it hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard
- That's an order.
Tile?
What happened?
Where's colonel Sheppard?
He went after the creature.
You let him go alone?
"Well, he wanted me to stay with you."
I am fine.
Go.
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?
Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.
Who decides when it's one of those times?
We do.
That's good enough.
Ellia... don't make me do this.
You okay?
Yeah.
She tried feeding on me.
She wasn't going to let us take her back.
Yeah.
I know.

"Look, I know, I'm sorry."
I hate it when people disturb me here too.
It's just this fucking calculus final is killing me.
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.
- You're actually very close.
May I?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
I touched your breast.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
You just go--
Wow.
You're good at this.
Thanks.
"What did you, like, take calculus in high school or something?"
"Actually, my dad taught it to me in sixth grade."
"What, are you like Doogie Howser?"
No.
Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.
I love that show.
What are you working on there?
This is just a poem for my creative writing class.
Please.
Your turn.
- Tired?
- Not really.
Me neither.
These are nice.
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure.
I have some old movies.
"It Happened One Night, Lawrence of Arabia, Now, Voyager?"
How about Lawrence of Arabia?
It's nice and long.
Okay.
Lawrence of Arabia it is.
Just stick it in.
Right.
- Is it over?
- Yeah.
Go to sleep.
Are you just looking or buying?
- I'm not sure yet.
"- So, it seems to be going well."
- Have you?
"- No, and it's made no difference."
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?
I was just telling Henry how sex isn't an issue for us.
"It's much less complicated this way, not to mention sanitary."
It feels so good to be writing again.
I have so many ideas for the new book!
It's coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.
"- It really makes you, like, squirm."
So good.
"- Oh, my God."
- I love Kevin Corrigan.
"Okay, Englewood."
Okay.
"Well, the last bus to Englewood left seven minutes ago."
You see?
She's fine.
Let's go.
"No, just because there was a last bus doesn't mean she was on the last bus."
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.
"- Oh, no."
Don't throw up.
"- Oh, God."
The thing that's too bad is that there were many other throw up scenes in the original and now there's...
"No, I mean, that's a good thing."
- I don't...
"- Remember, there were like...?"
- We shot four other throw-up scenes.
- On the bus.
Remember?
"With the projectile, with the tube hooked up to your face."
Yeah.
- Norah.
- Caro...
"Oh, no."
"This was like a river, a river flowing."
"Oh, God."
And it's so hard to sync it up with your mouth.
- It seemed all so unreal.
But thank you very much.
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready.
Goodbye.
Don't thank us.
Your feet are cold.
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.
It's cold.
I'm cold.
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.
But I dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.
"I see you, Miss Marianne!"
I think I've unearthed a secret.
You are worse than my best pointer.
Is he a butcher.
Baker.
Candlestick maker?
I'll winkle it out of you.
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.
- Give us a clue.
Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.
He's a gentleman?
- They're my roommates.
"- Cece, hi."
"I'm gonna go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess."
"Wait, let's just talk about this, okay?"
"You know, rap it out."
We can't rap it out.
We're not together.
It's not the same.
- Doesn't mean we can't talk.
- Nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.
"No, you gave this to me."
I wanna keep it.
"- Give her her T-shirt, man."
"- No, I don't want to."
And I gave her this hat.
I'm gonna take this back.
- This one?
You want that?
- Yeah.
"Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal."
I dare you.
- You guys look ridiculous.
"- Look, give her the shirt back."
- I bet she worked hard on that jamboree.
"- Yeah, play on words."
- Jamboree.
Jam.
- Jam.
"Girl made a lot of jam, Spence."
You know how time-consuming that can be?
"You need ajar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe..."
- But you fuck like one.
- Chill.
- Did you hear what he said?
Jonas has got a 5 million dollar trust fund.
- Money's not everything.
- It is tonight.
Tommy?
...
Tommy?
- I made a couple of bad investments.
- So we've no more money?
- I took some chances.
- What about this summer?
- I sold the beach house.
- We just asked our friends to come.
- Cancel them.
- We'll be a joke.
The bank wants its money.
Nobody will lend me any.
- Come on.
- We'll never forgive you for this.
- I need your credit cards.
- What will we live on?
You'll have to stop shopping.
He's so way out of line.
I'll call five to tell them granny's fallen ill; you take the rest.
- Who are you calling?
- Philip.
I should do an Anna Nicole Smith.
Marry an 86-year-old billionaire.
She didn't even have to shag him.
And he died right away.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
"Oh, this is the man who saved you."
He's the one.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I want to talk with yuko.
Come on.
Let me show you the place.
It's been a difficult week.
Yeah.
"Campanela, taka, thank you Shelly."
And now our connect at the Mexican boarder has been killed.
Do you know who did it?
I think maybe his wife killed him.
"No, shit."
These things happen.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
"When I was in high school, I used to smuggle a little pot, you know."
Then I would cut him in on the action.
And he still works the boarder.
Sounds promising.
"And the best this is, he doesn't have a wife."
I like you Nick Davis.
I think fate brought you to me.
Well here's to fate.
And to family.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I've offended you?
"No, I was just thinking about something."
Tell me.
"I'm in a hurry, Pierre."
What do you want to know?
"Where have the 40,000 euros come from?"
What are you insinuating?
"I don't know. 40,000 euros were deposited in this account, the firm's account, and they disappeared."
I'm wondering.
This money was sealed.
My client needed to get it back in cash.
I helped him.
That's all.
Why make it go through the firm's account?
You couldn't deposit it in his account directly?
He doesn't have an account.
His banking privilege is suspended.
You don't believe me?
Call him.
"Go ahead, call him!"
You wouldn't take the risk of lying to me.
"I give you my word, all right?"
Arnaud Ledoré?
Hello.
How are you?
Hello.
- Do you remember me?
Do you know Mr Delcourt?
Can we talk to you for two minutes?
Yes.
What about?
It's about Julie.
Julie.
That's enough.
- Who filmed that?
Maddy!
"I can't believe you are doing this, Maddy!"
I didn't bring you here so you could catch it.
"Shannon, relax."
This is for our safety.
You said The Beast is killing animals.
It could easily turn on us if it isn't contained.
"So, what?"
Then you're going to let it go?
"I'm not in the business of caging wild animals, no matter how unusual."
"We put it in here to get a closer look, that's all."
That's cool with me.
That thing has some serious fangs.
Shan.
OK.
I'm sorry.
It's just... it just got real all of a sudden.
"That's why I'm here, Shannon."
To show the world The Beast is real.
OK?
OK.
They'll kill us.
What are you going to say to them?
I don't know but I don't think sorry's going to cut it.
We could go back.
Do you want to?
Look.
Put it on me.
Tell them I made you do it.
"Thanks, but I'll take the blame."
I've earned it.
It's starting.
just... here. look.
[sighs] here. put this on.
- geez. [sighs]
- come on.
- hello?
hello?
who's there?
"[gun pops, thud, baby coos]"
- decorating.
- [sniffs] [gun cocks]
"- nice shot, little man!"
- [laughs]
"- so sorry about the mess, but we were not expecting company."
"- amanda jones, department of children and family services."
quite a place you have here.
do you mind if i look around?
"- oh, absolutely not."
"please, mrs. jones, have a look-see."
[dogs barking in distance]
- yep.
that right there is pure gold.
that's a real lock of constantine's hair -- the lead singer.
god rest his soul.
"yeah, i probably would've sold you one night, harley, just to be with him, hmm?"
why is she jotting that down?
- [sighs]
- where are you going?
- to talk with tim in town.
- what?
now?
"- yeah, i promised uncle bob."
- i'll drive you.
It's very pretty.
It's a gift.
"Don't be surprised, it's nothing special."
You want to reorganize the factory.
It will only be possible... if you're in charge.
Put it in the other room.
A bit further behind.
Djénéba!
We have to see each other less frequently.
Why?
I'm not afraid of gossip.
People stick their noses into other people's business.
Do you mean my husband?
Of course.
You'll regret... the day when... he catches you.
There's nothing to be worried about.
Sure there is!
He's already been divorced four times.
"Right now he loves you, make the best of it."
Enough.
I know what I want.
Don't get angry.
Let's change the subject.
What are you doing on Thursday?
I don't know yet.
What's your plan?
Come over by my house.
I won't be able to.
Sing to Fakoli!
Praise his majesty!
Fakoli's worthy descendant.
Great Griot!
- And the plane wasn't even full.
- See?
How far will that get you?
You can't even take your mistress on a weekend trip.
Nothing.
"All right, fine."
"But tomorrow morning, these people are going to be in my office."
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Send them to me.
I'll explain everything.
"They'll understand, don't worry."
Anything else?
Your appointment is here.
Who is this guy?
Remind me.
Joseph Kay.
Heads up a department at St. Louis.
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?
Something like that.
"""Something like that."""
"""I'm not sure what he wants."""
What's that supposed to mean?
Why send him to me?
- You were recommended.
- By who?
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.
I see.
- Your daughter called.
"- Oh, yeah?"
She left you messages at home and...
I need to...
I don't...
I've got...
I need to go...
Out of my way!
It's a panic attack.
That's all.
What?
It sounds like you're having a panic attack.
"I can't breathe, I can't..."
Maybe it's because you wanna fuck your sister.
What?
Do you want to fuck your sister?
No!
Jesus!
It's just people say panic attacks come from some deeply repressed sexual urges.
You know?
What?
"I was just testing a theory, see."
"Actually, I'm talking shit, cos it turns out a panic attack's just a fuckload of adrenaline mainlining into your heart."
It's just how we deal with danger.
"Fight or flight, they call it."
Right?
I don't know you.
"Are you a fighter or a flighter, Tony Stonem?"
Cos depending on your answer... well...
A lot depends on your answer.
I'll see you around.
"Hi, Effy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
- What are you two up to?
"Nothing, God, don't be such a paranoid freak."
"Party time, princess."
It's time for us to say goodbye.
Like hell.
"We made a deal, Karp."
- Liana's coming.
- She's... she's coming here?
It's a family reunion.
And I'm off to one of my own.
"Farewell, my sweet."
Your generosity will not be forgotten.
It was just an accident.
Motorcycles don't have seat belts.
You could have died.
"If you had died, I'd be alone."
"You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead."
"Emme, I said I'm sorry."
What else do you want me to say?
Huh?
"He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine."
"How are you holding up, Emme?"
Holding what up?
How are you doing with Flynn being hurt?
I'm fine.
He's not going to die.
Did my counselor leave?
"She'll be here in a few minutes, take you back home."
You mean school.
This is my home.
"Yeah, of course it is."
I'm gonna go look for Haydn.
"Say, would your hotel give us a discount on our wedding?"
What's the point?
You'll dump me once you make it big anyway.
Not when we've invested 1.4 million yen in you.
KABUKICHO LOVE HOTEL
"Hey, stop for a sec."
Hello?
I'm leaving.
"Yes, I'll rehearse first, then head to the venue early."
After the show?
Okay.
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, sir."
"Room 302, door is open."
"Room 302, occupied."
Streetwalkers often stand outside.
"If they enter, ask them to leave."
Anything else?
The whole second floor is rented to a porn shoot from 11 AM.
"No need to clean that floor, then."
"Well, until 5 PM."
"Say, Manager, we're almost out of 100 yen coins."
"Oh, hell."
Borrow some from Atlas 2.
"Sato, go there later."
I caught a cold.
"And without insurance, I can't see a doctor."
"Fine, I'll go."
Sorry for the trouble.
I can't lose this time!
- No.
Yeah.
- It was a mustache.
It was a mustache.
"Mom, is there anything else?"
How about my acne or that piano tie I wore to the senior prom?
"Oh, my God."
You were the guy in the piano tie.
I can't believe this is happening.
"Mom, you're killing me."
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm going to make you a bagel.
"If it'll stop the humiliating trip down memory lane, please."
I thought we were being discreet.
You're not dressed.
I'm not naked.
What are you two whispering about down there?
I was just offering Tyler a ride to work today.
"Justin, come on now."
You don't need to feel uncomfortable.
Tyler is welcome to stay over anytime she likes.
You two are old enough to do what you want.
Just stay safe.
- We are.
- All right.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Eat up.
I'm going.
I'm going to get ready for my day.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"There are less spots, doc."
Rash: 31 spots 1 or 2 spots doesn't count as better.
But at least it's less.
Thank you.
Did you do exactly as I told you?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
So what went wrong?
Let me ask you more personal questions.
I need to find out more.
What's your favorite food?
Shrimp dumplings from 7-Eleven.
Your favorite food is from 7-Eleven?
Nothing else to eat at night.
And it tastes good.
They also have rice balls.
Are you joking?
I'm not joking.
They really have them.
"Then on your free days, what do you do?"
Whoa that's hard to answer.
"No, it isn't."
"How about movies, music, the mall, and the beach?"
Nothing?
Everything you said is a waste of time.
How is that entertaining?
"Go to the mall, to do what?"
To buy clothes?
I don't buy any.
You don't buy any clothes at all?
I can still wear my old ones.
I am a parrot of the sea.
A puffin that is no longer the sea.
Do not.
"-Bravo, Loving brought us a strange bird, and told us it was a penguin."
Bravo.
"Thanks, I deserved."
"Sorry people, I'm sorry."
But when I lost my hometown.
I was very lonely and very scared.
"Then I met you, and you believed in me."
Sven ...
It was so good have a family.
Thank you.
And that goes up to heaven.
"Folks, let's try this."
"Come on, everybody together."
Fuck you!
[screams] [groans in pain]
You know now?
"Dad, listen to me."
"Dad, give me a second, would you?"
Please!
I'm doing it all now because you're not focused.
My guys have Angel.
There's nothing to worry about there.
You got to focus.
You have to focus!
He cut my face.
What the fuck you want me to do?
"You're standing in front of a mirror, aren't ya?"
"You didn't have to come here, Dad."
I can take care of this.
You okay?
Can I get you anything?
"[Screaming] Oh, stop!"
"Pick your head up again, and I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
Stay right there.
Okay.
[Engine starting]
[Tires screeching]
[Cheering] Woo!
"All right, all right, all right!"
Good to see our fuckin' guy back.
You scared the shit out of him!
- I can't take these guys.
- And what'd we get?
I can drive this fucking car better than you can.
"What do we get, what we get, what we get, what we get, man?"
"What, what, what?"
Twenties and thirties.
"Oh, hey, I got it."
I got eleven.
"Hey, man, how much money we get?"
Nothin'.
We didn't get anything!
"Sam, you in there?"
You better give me my fucking share.
- Bullshit.
- There's tomorrow.
"Yeah, there's always tomorrow."
There's always tomorrow.
"You pissed, you pissed, and this goes."
It goes.
"Come on, guys, I can't drive with you guys like this!"
Oh no..
"Not all those, but say the name."
- His name..
Signals are not clear Tukaram.
Is this any cell network for the signals not being?
You said all my details continuously like a news reader
Why are you getting struck so now?
"Tell PK, Please tell PK.."
Please..
No..
- Tell that name..
PK please.
Please PK..
- No.. no.
This man kept his mind as an open book.
This lady is hiding in her mind.
"Who is in that first, bloody?"
Is it that dark angle fellow?
Tell..
Who is he?
Tell.
Stay cool..
Mr Tukaram all these should be taken sportive.
"If I take it sportive, my house would become Uppal stadium with her boyfriends."
I'll kill her!
- Don't hit her..
Hey no..no.
I'll kill you all!
"- Okay, boss!"
Where will you go?
No.. no.
Come there!
I'm not sick of you at all.
And wow!
"It's been a good like six months, right?"
What?
Six months?
Then the Ice Land sign is like eight months?
You think we'd only last a year and a half?
I don't know.
I don't want to be presumptuous.
- I don't know if you're married orwhat.
- I'm not.
"Well, I'm separated."
We separated last month.
I was thinking... that Tyrone... was like 20 years away at least.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
"Well, actually I was thinking..."
"Tyrone is, like, when we die of old age."
"And this is, like, our whole life together, this block."
"See, that's perfect."
- Let's do it thatway.
- Okay.
"Well, guess it can't be avoided."
Everyone dies.
I could walk you to your car.
"Maybewe should just be glad... that we lived this long, good life together."
"You know, it's so much more than most people ever get to have."
- Okay.
- Okay.
"- Well, don't be afraid."
- Okay.
- Deal.
And stop bothering me about my hair.
We're interfering with your personal life?
I'm closing it ... relax.
God knows what he'll start thinking in his head now.
"Hey, what happened?"
"- There is nothing wrong, man."
Relax.
- Not that.
What about the booklets?
I've solved that problem.
He'll send them home.
69 Rafet.
It's super.
"Come on, I will take care of this."
It was obvious that something like this would happen.
"I'm telling you, I'll take care of it."
Don't do this.
"Oh, this is bad."
Can you please put yourjacket on?
"Ok, I'm putting my jacket on."
"Wait, I'll end this issue."
What's this guy's name?
Mert!
Yes?
"Hi, this is Zeynep Erez."
I'm Mert's new guidance counselor.
"If you have some time, can I have a word with you?"
Don't feel sad dear.
"If he wants to get divorced, then divorce him."
Don't say it like that dear.
It just hurts.
-Thomas!
"How you, pal?"
How are you?
-Super.
We met in detention.
You have to help me.
What you need?
-Weapons.
-Good.
Explosives.
We will fix it.
Here you are.
Writings from all Garnierovih hearing.
Copies of course.
How did you come to that?
"Maybe gonna sounded pretentious, but I think that the criminal zapisnièar Court weak to me."
-You bet!
"For each hearing There is evidence, the nature of cases, names of parties and attorneys, and here the opinion of the court after vijeæanja."
Excellent!
A country that is so held to archive is not completely lost.
Hello!
Remember me?
What do you want?
-Shut up!
-You are wrong!
I talked Jorkalom.
We know.
"He wanted us to send a message, So we will now and we send it."
What do you say?
Yeah fuck off.
Where are you taking me?
Shut up!
Seeing these people...
Nagasaki...
That day...
I can feel it.
Okay.
"Even if it's okay for you, it's still too short for Clark."
His feet will stick out.
He's the same size as John Wayne.
How about using this to add length?
We did make fools of ourselves.
Don't you think so?
I guess you're right.
I really feel ashamed.
Where's Clark?
He stepped out into the garden with Grandma.
I wonder if it's all right.
I wonder if they can communicate.
I think it's all right.
They seem to be talking just fine.
I am terribly sorry for not knowing about Uncle.
I'm really sorry.
That's all right.
You were born and live in Nagasaki.
And still... we didn't realize it.
That was wrong of us.
We were wrong.
That's all right.
My father told me...
"""Clark, go..."
"""and do whatever you can for your aunt. """
That's what he said.
That's all right.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.
If you're just going to give it away...
"If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike."
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I like to report a hit-and-run.
I'm still gonna need to record your statement.
"Later, right now I just want to..."
Just want to sleep.
Who are you?
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
No!
Trevor?
You still got a half-hour.
I could fix you some eggs.
I'm tired.
But thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on, guys."
Keep it moving.
"Yessuh, Mistah Tucker!"
Mutha-Fucker.
Why's this machine down?
Maintenance.
Takes seven minutes to power-up that mill.
"Where am I gonna make up that seven minutes, Miller?"
- From your paycheck?
"- Back off, Tucker."
You know it's against regulations.
- Was this where you got carsick?
- I think it was.
- What do you mean?
- Pete got really bad...
"Well, on this night we were towing the Yugo, and I was facing the Yugo."
So I was driving backwards outside.
It was about 15 degrees.
And you had some bad food.
It smelled like gasoline.
And I think I ate some bad flan.
- Yeah.
- Bad what?
"You know, it's the old bad flan."
- Flan?
- Yeah.
You never had flan?
Flan like the pannacotta kind of flan?
It's like the Mexican dessert.
It's just like lard.
- It's just like caramel flavored lard.
"- No, it's not."
- It's like custard.
- It's cream.
"- Yeah, it's delicious."
- It's a damn flan.
- I'm not saying that it's not good.
"- Okay, so did you get all...?"
"I threw up on the process trailer, is what happened."
- You did.
- And I didn't finish the day.
"Christo Morse, our AD, saved me."
He directed the last quarter of the day.
Because they're more...
There are not so many cliques and...
- Why are you telling me?
- Would you like a glass of water?
"Helene, come here."
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because we have to decide.
"You don't need me any more, Helene."
"Everything is taken care of now, right?"
Anna and the boys...
I'll just slow you all down.
- Stop.
- No.
I'm the only one stopping for now.
I just mean...
Do you think you and Jacob will get together?
Do you?
Stop it.
I would like to know.
I just didn't want you to see me...
like this.
"This is only the beginning, Helene."
It will get worse from now on.
- Can you manage?
- Yes.
I'm so damned pathetic...
I don't want to...
I don't want to die!
"I don't, Helene."
"I don't want to, damn it!"
I don't want to die!
I don't!
"Or did your father send you to detain us, while he flees to Russia?"
- Ha ha!
It was a joke!
Put that thing away!
Where is my father?
I could go take a look.
It's best if we all go together.
"No, we're all staying here!"
I've been preparing this evening for weeks.
"- I won't allow you to ruin my event, just because you've gone crazy."
- What do you want?
Just tell me exactly what it is!
What?
Yes!
What!
?
To go to Sweden.
To Sweden?
He wants to go to Sweden.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
Give Bulle a call.
He drives up there tonight.
He could pick him up.
"And get Angie, she can take over from here."
You will allow me to let someone take over.
I have to take care of my bar.
Tell me...
Couldn't we break off the pieces and move them?
We can't.
That's how the world champions would do it.
Fine then.
The knight goes from G5 to E6.
we can book an open fight.
that's when we're all gonna get paid.
Hell yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Cheers.
- All right.
man?
Where's your punk friend of my sister's?
Huh?
How would I know?
I'm gonna ask you one more time nicely.
I told you-- l don't know.
all right? I don't have anything to do with your beef with Brandon.
Shut up.
Shut up!
Tell your friend to stay the fuck away from my sister.
You understand?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
You make sure he gets the message.
You got that?
clean your tools ever?
Can you hand me a socket wrench?
is this it?
What is this?
Does this look like a socket wrench?
I don't know what that is.
wrench.
It's a socket wrench.
How about I just sock you with this-- this giant hammer?
I thought you were sweet when I met you.
You want to make me a sandwich instead?
Empty.
Empty?
- [exhales] - [horns honking]
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"[victor] sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself
And walk along the ledge.
"[Letha] Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
[wires crackling]
Look what you've done.
[exhales sharply]
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- [Letha] sickle!
We've already begun to evacuate the plant.
"Tony's here, all right."
Get me down.
"Thank you, thank you."
"Now, where are you going?"
In there.
"Oh, no."
You can't go beyond this point without IDs.
Tony!
- Tia!
- I knew it.
She'll spoil everything.
I can just taste that money.
We cannot let her take it away from us.
Tony!
"Tony, from this moment you will no longer hear Tia."
She cannot break through my power of control.
- Acknowledge.
"- Tony, what's wrong?"
"It's me, your sister."
Try to remember me.
Acknowledge.
Tony?
"- Yes, sir."
- Get those kids.
She'll use some of those molecules on us.
"I'll take care of her before she gets a chance, you get them."
I can't get through.
I don't know what they've done to his mind.
We've got to find the emergency cooling system ourselves.
How do you spell cooling?
Come on.
I think I'm in love already.
Gah!
That would have been a clean 50 from the both of you.
Excuse me.
Which one of you is Dr. William Blunt?
I am.
Is there a problem?
I'm afraid there is.
I need to talk to you about my father.
Arthur Waverly.
You might have noticed we're playing a round of golf here.
"You have a question, call my office."
I'm sure...
That's not how this is gonna work.
We're gonna talk about my father.
We're gonna do it right now.
"Hey, buddy."
This isn't the time.
Maybe you should tell your friends to take a walk.
"It's okay, guys."
Just give us a minute.
I'll see you at the clubhouse.
"Look, I don't know what you think that I could tell you, but..."
How sick is my father?
He has stage four.
It doesn't look good.
That's one.
One what?
I understand that you sent him to Argentina.
I'd like to know why.
I can't discuss private medical records.
That's two.
"What are you thinking, Walter?"
"Hey, guys."
The footage from the abduction has been downloaded.
"Also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum..."
- ...with some kind of weird writing in it.
- They think it was his?
"Well, they don't know, but Agent Broyles is sending it over."
OLIVIA:
Have we ID'd the victim?
ASTRID:
"No, not yet."
OLIVIA:
"Wait a minute, Astrid."
Can you zoom it?
Now freeze it.
"Peter, that isn't him."
That's a different guy.
There's more than one Observer.
Stop.
Hold on.
What just happened right there?
Was he hit?
Who are these people?
- Please don't hurt me.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?
- Please let me go.
- Please let me go.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Do you want me to stay?
I can sleep on the couch.
I've done it before.
"No, I have to learn to be alone."
Hello.
"- Hello, everyone."
- Good morning.
Washing her hair?
What do you think?
- How was the night?
- Normal.
"Give me that, I'll do it."
I'm off.
- So long.
"- Bye, Matilde."
It's so hot!
We should cut her hair.
Cut it short.
It's more practical and comfortable.
We'll leave it like it was when she arrived here.
So it won't look different if she awakes.
"After four years in a coma, it would be a miracle."
I believe in miracles.
And so should you.
- Why me?
- Because you really need them.
"One could happen to you, and you wouldn't even realize."
"God, it's so hot!"
I bought something in the drugstore to help stop the perspiration stains on my uniform.
Your armpits don't sweat but the rest...
- do you understand?
- Right.
We're here to find out what Gene Hansen was doing the night he died.
I got it.
"If you suspect someone, don't accuse them."
Don't let on that you suspect.
Okay?
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
You come directly to me.
- Do you understand?
"- Okay, okay, can we just go in now?"
All right.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Don't you think we should go in separately?
You don't think I fit in?
"Yeah, sure, narc."
"Okay, you take the customers."
Don't let on that we know each other.
What?
So what are you serving?
This is a private club.
"It's okay, Wynter."
This is Vicki Nelson.
She's doing some work for me.
She'll have some questions for you.
Please feel free to give her any assistance that she needs.
Taking a walk on the dark side are we?
"Unfortunately, I live there."
How long did you know Gene?
Since eighth grade.
Drama club.
Did you ever have a day when just everything went wrong?
Take your things and go in there and change.
Thank you.
"If you have any trouble with your buttons, just sing out."
(TRAIN HORN BLARING)
(THUNDER CRACKING)
Oh!
"Are you all right, Wilbur?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
There's nothing to be frightened of.
It's just the storm that woke you up.
You mustn't be afraid of thunder and lightning.
I'm not afraid.
"Oh, yes, you are."
All youngsters are.
"Why, I was terrified when I was your age."
I used to crawl in with my little brother.
"Remember, I'm only your nephew."
(THUNDER RUMBLING) This going to be a bad one.
"Just hang on to me tight, Willy."
I...
"I'm all right, really."
Just rest your head against my shoulder.
I can't do that.
Your husband wouldn't like that.
I have no husband.
"I'm not married, either."
I hope not.
And I'm glad you're not married.
Why?
Should I tell you?
Yes.
Come to our house to eat.
She's right.
You ought to quit being such a stranger.
"Now, I'd like to propose a toast."
- To Vince Hardy.
- The best Captain of Homicide ever.
Vince Hardy.
How about we drink to my mother?
"She was a Hardy, too."
"And Jimmy, let's drink to him."
It'd be fitting here by the river.
Uncle Vince is dead.
"They're dead, too."
Drink to Jimmy!
- That's enough!
"- No, It's not enough, damn it!"
- Let go of me.
I'm all right.
- You don't belong here.
"- Me and you, Eddie."
- Anytime.
The best day of the year.
Better than Christmas!
- Are these policemen all relatives?
"- No, they're just criminals."
How did they end up on the force?
"Part of some nationwide negative gene pool, I guess."
"- Don't do that, okay?"
- What?
That thing where you're not really talking to me.
- That's not the answer.
- It'll do till the answer turns up.
"You are hopeless, child."
You know that?
Completely hopeless. [yawns]
Any sign of them?
"No, Your Majesty."
We searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
Keep looking.
"Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored."
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
"Yes, sire."
"[Triton] Oh, what have I done?"
What have I done?
Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.
- Oh!
[Chatter]
[Clucking]
"Oh, Judy!"
Yo!
Flounder!
Any kissing?
"No, not yet."
"Well, they'd better get crackin'!"
[Whinnies]
[Flounder] Move over.
Move your big feathers.
I can't see a thing.
[Scuttle] Nothing is happening.
"Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once."
OK.
"All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation."
"Come, let's sleep."
"No, I'll not come."
"Come Prakash, it'll be warm."
"You mean, are you that type?"
Yuck!
Our 'friendship' is broken.
Oh broken!
"What type are you, man?"
My patient likes to undress himself and I like to undress others.
Don't you wear brief?
Door is locked!
How come I got stuck here?
"Prakash, come."
Your cheeks are like sausages.
Bommali!
I'll not leave you.
Mother Jejamma!
You've to save me!
Mother!
Did you show him stars?
"I didn't show him anything, in fact he showed me everything."
They are not ordinary people.
What happened?
Asking me what had happened?
One sleeps without any clothes and another doesn't like others wearing clothes.
"I beg you dear, please shift me from that room."
- Why?
They are other 'type' of people.
Yuck!
What the hell are you saying?
"Stay with them for a night, you'll know it."
He's a sex maniac!
"It's late, why do you come?"
"Miss Shui, Chan Mon-gut is a real creep."
"I've followed him for decades, he treats me badly too."
Don't you think he will be nice to you instead?
Any other thing else?
Miss Shui...
You are old enough to get married.
Take this piece ofjade.
Come on.
Go in and get some clothes.
"Follow me to Hong Kong, will you?"
You...
No?
"It's a long road to Hong Kong, take this piece ofjade with you."
"If you meet the bandits, you still have something valuable, thus they won't kill you."
"It's late, better go now."
Take care.
Master.
Where is the guy who sold this piece ofjade?
"None of my business, I don't know shooting."
I didn't kill!
I didn't kill...
I didn't kill!
Go!
I am innocent!
Go in.
Foreigner?
You murderer!
"Uncle, what did he scold me?"
No...
Help!
Are you going to torture me?
That's platinum.
"Oh, no wonder it looks so different."
"Well, there's nothing wrong with your watch, sir."
"You have 11:00, too."
"Yeah, but it should be five minutes past eleven."
"I always set my watch, you know, five minutes fast."
"You know, you're always racing against time 24 hours a day."
"Excuse me, sir, are those men members of your crew?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
They're with us all the time.
Good.
I think I'll have a word with them.
Thank you very much for everything.
"Excuse me, sir."
"Lieutenant Columbo, LAPD."
I wonder if I can have a word with you?
MAN 1:
"We're gonna have the hotel in the shot, right?"
MAN 2:
Everything.
"On the master, right?"
"In the master, right."
Okay.
This is where...
He comes up right here.
Can I ask you this?
What now?
This is just the way we discussed it.
This we do on stage...
"This is on stage three, right?"
Right.
And you felt as if they were coming after you?
- And I started to run...
- But?
And then...
I don't know what happened.
You did something.
I think so.
GUARD:
"This way, folks."
Come down this way as quickly as you can.
SECOND GUARD:
"All right, folks, calmly."
This way.
"Quickly as you can, please move down."
Just follow them.
Thank you.
Right through the barricades there.
That's right.
Do you wanna know what I'm worried about?
I wanna know who's gonna feed my cats.
We'll all be out of here soon.
You'll be home to feed them yourself.
And what if that doesn't happen?
"Relax, Dorothy."
The aliens'll feed 'em.
"Yeah, they're old friends of your cats, right?"
What?
What are you looking at?
"You really think if you're cruel enough to other people, all your own misery will go away?"
No.
Just keeps my mind off it for a while.
RAY:
I can still race!
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.
- McQueen made it!
- What?
He's not pitting!
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go!
Get me back out there!
McQueen's not going into the pits!
The rookie fired his crew chief.
The third this season!
- Says he likes working alone.
"- Go, go!"
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
"Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up."
"Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!"
"Come on, come on, come on!"
We need tires now!
"Come on, let's go!"
"- No, no, no, no!"
"No tires, just gas!"
- What?
"You need tires, you idiot!"
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Right.
No tires again.
"That's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's workin' for him."
He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
"This is it, Darrell."
One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
He's got it in the bag.
[sighs]
But look at me now.
"Mom, lie down for a while."
The Sergeant will come back later.
I just remembered something.
"That's more like it, Mrs. Slocum."
I sent my black taffeta to the cleaners... and it's never gonna be back in time for that meeting at the women's club.
[sighs]
I'll be back.
"Really, Sergeant."
My mother's a wonderful woman.
She just suffers from overacting.
That's the understatement of the year.
"Oh, mercy."
You must be that detective.
"Say, I got a few ideas about that murder."
I'll bet you have.
[scoffs]
Well.
"Where's your mother, honey?"
"Mrs. Armstedder, take it easy."
She's really had a rough day.
"There you are, Lottie."
"Boy, do you look a mess."
"Well, come on, honey, refreshments."
We got a lot of talking to do.
Now.
Oh.
Move over.
Isn't this exciting?
Look at that.
"""Baby-sitter questioned in murder."""
Appreciate it.
"Ooh, it's cold."
You think you could just pick this shit up tomorrow?
- Ma'am.
"- Yes, ma'am."
"Oh, God."
"Fuck you, America."
You have 14 new voice memos.
"Oh, my God."
"Mike, some old golfer died."
Do I need to say something?
Next memo.
"Kent, I just got your document."
I have no idea what any of this means.
Next memo.
"Oh, okay, Kent."
"I just found the glossary, so ignore that last message."
Next memo.
"Ted, I've just read the glossory."
I have no idea of any of it means.
That's why I included the second glossory.
Next memo.
"Mike, is it pissing you off I'm leaving all these messages?"
Yes.
Next memo.
"Good, because it's pissing me off you're not answering any of these messages."
Next memo.
How do you leave a memo in your sleep?
- See you.
- Next memo.
"Mike, were you at work today?"
I don't remember seeing you.
"Your satellite is on, by the way."
That screen is badass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologise.
Is this gonna be every weekend now?
No.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
"But I am earning double time, so there's a bright side."
So when the laziest boy in the world wakes up tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said bye.
And tell him to let them air-dry this time.
I don't want him banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
I mean...
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
And everybody is gonna be there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I couldn't never understand why you don't want to introduce us to each other.
Why won't you invite him to our house?
What does Garik have to do with it?
Don't interrupt me!
I'm fed up with it!
I got interested.
"I started gathering information about Garik, his family and work."
I found some data.
Come and look.
He's gone.
He died the next year after your graduation.
He died almost 30 years ago.
Your best friend died.
You could have invented something more convincing and not use such cruel lie.
I'm leaving.
I can't live like this any longer.
I'm so scared with you!
- Hello?
- Hello?
"Hi, old man!"
Garik!
Is that you?
It's me.
Who else could it be?
What's wrong with your voice?
- Aren't you dead?
- What?
Who is dead?
Are you drunk again?
You're dead.
Well...
You died and I went crazy.
"Okay, you guys."
"Well, this has just been wonderful."
"I am just gonna get my scooter and be on my way, so..."
[ Car beeping ]
"Thank you, guys."
I hope you have a great night.
[ Car beeping ]
Wow.
Get a room.
Wood:
"I did such a good job setting the mood for this guy, he was too busy getting busy to give me a tip."
"So I still only had $20, and I hoped Adam hadn't been doing any better."
Andrew #2:
I'm gonna throw this out to you right now.
Ferrara:
Go ahead.
"40 bucks, burnout right now, extra tip."
Do it.
You know what?
I work for you.
You work for me.
[ Tires screech ]
"Oh, I like it when you drink."
[ Laughs ] Hee-hee!
Nice work.
That was fun.
That was really fun.
That was [Bleep] Fun.
"All right, dude."
Ferrara:
Where else can you drive cool cars and get paid for doing a burnout?
"$40 richer, I headed back into the city for my next pick-up."
"- Just take it easy, take-take it easy."
"- Justin, don't!"
- Don't what?
Do this?
This is what happens when people don't follow orders.
"Luke, chairs, bring them."
Do it!
"Justin, I don't know what it is you think we've done but really, you've got this wrong, all wrong."
We haven't done anything.
- You need to stop this.
"- Gemma, quiet."
Eleanor!
Gemma!
Take a seat.
"This is it, isn't it?"
This is why we're here?
I said take a seat.
Luke!
Their hands.
Bind them.
"No phone calls, people."
Use some bloody common sense.
"Luke, bring over the other chairs."
Snap to it!
Then collect up their car keys and their mobile phones.
There's a lock box on the workbench.
Chris...
"I know you're waiting, mate."
Picking the right moment.
This is not that moment.
I'm quicker than you and I've got a gun.
"And, uh, I absolutely won't miss."
"Okay, ma'am, I need you back here too."
RAY:
"Hey, why don't you just tell us what we did, all right?"
BILL:
Keep your hands on the car!
All right.
"Okay, now, ma'am... (GUNSHOT)"
"Damn, goddamn right!"
"Yes, baby, yes, you motherfucker!"
Let's go.
Get into the car.
"Come on, now."
You motherfucker!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Hey Pluto, man, we're going the wrong goddamn way, man."
We're going back toward town.
Turn the goddamn car around.
Did I kill that man back there?
"Yes, baby, but you did a good job, don't worry about it."
I think I killed that man.
"Pluto, what the fuck are you doing, man?"
We're going the wrong goddamn way.
Turn the fucking car around.
PLUTO:
The car's been ID'd.
"The car's been ID'd, right?"
So we got to get rid of it.
"Yes, you killed him, goddamn it!"
You killed him.
Would you fucking turn the car around?
It will be stolen before the cops know.
We're going the wrong fucking way.
- Hello!
- See you down in the ring!
I've seen that party!
Everything's under control!
Much action around here?
Even money now!
Nelson by a knockout!
How about putting up a double sawbuck for me?
- I better get going!
"- See you after a while, Little Boy!"
All the fight news and pictures!
All the fight news and pictures here!
"Hi, Stoke!"
"You'll take him, Stoke!"
You'll take him!
All the fight news and pictures!
All the fight news and pictures!
Get your Knockout here!
"Now, remember, stay away from him!"
- Slug with him and he'll murder you!
- I know what to do!
"That's right, Stoke, relax!"
Fight your own fight!
"Remember, take it easy for two heats!"
Then you can finish him!
- That's the set-up!
"- Okay, Danny!"
Okay!
Ladies and gentlemen!
"The next and final bout of the evening, four rounds!"
"In this corner, at 194 pounds!"
!
Like every day of my life.
So why haven't you?
I don't know.
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's-- I'm scared.
- Scared?
- Yeah.
You?
You're like the most confident person I've ever met.
It's very scary.
where would I go?
What would I do?
Anything you wanted to.
close your eyes.
Trust me.
They're closed. do anything.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
I'm right where l want to be.
You know what's funny?
When I was a kid I used to have the map of the world above my bed.
l would just point at various places-- close my eyes and just point.
And I promised myself that I would go visit those places.
And now I'm older and I'm still here in this small little town and I've never visited those places.
the funny thing is you actually got out. you followed a dream.
I really admire that.
You make it sound romantic.
It is.
Isn't it?
My dad-- he's a real son of a bitch.
you cut some down and bundle it up for her.
they'll have me to deal with.
Tell the men that.
All of this in one day?
!
The man who owned the field was very kind.
He let me take all that I wanted.
And then he invited me to eat with him.
I think the others were very surprised.
Who was it?
What was his name?
Boaz.
Boaz?
You know him?
he is my nearest kinsman.
then... then he must marry you.
Get up for the Rams.!
"In the second half, Arthur tries to pick up where he left off."
Penetration move by Agee.
Slapped out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.
"Ooh, and a nice fake and a score."
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat... pressing the tempo against the tired Commandos.
You're not in the offense at all.
You're just out there playing individual basketball.
Completely.
"hey, hey, guys."
No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going.
Remember?
"Let's go, Marshall!"
Let's go!
Sarah and Tommy and Kevin.
- But understand...
- Justin and Kitty?
- They don't know.
"- Oh, God."
I didn't want this to be like the affair.
"I didn't want it to fester under the surface, haunting us."
Come on.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
Where are you going?
- What are you doing?
- To find Kitty and Justin.
- Wait.
Please.
- No.
"There will be no more lies, Saul."
No more.
I won't stand for it.
"Nora, wait."
Are you sure?
How do we know Holly's telling the truth?
"As much as I'd like to, I don't think we can ignore the obvious."
"So, what are we supposed to say?"
"""Wow, we have a sister now""?"
"Justin, you don't have to say or do anything you don't want to."
This is just going to take time for us all.
So what?
Dad made Holly a beneficiary of the land because of Rebecca?
I don't know.
But I suspect that's part of it.
- Did he know that he was her father?
- You got it.
We picked up a paramedic call.
What happened?
- He saved my brother.
He's a doctor.
"- Here, let's roll on this."
We're at the scene of an incredible rescue.
It appears that a doctor has saved a little boy from drowning.
"We got it, doc."
Call Mercy.
- Mercy's not a Level 1trauma center.
- It's the nearest treatment facility.
This boy needs a surgeon.
Probably an ICU.
We gotta follow station protocol.
- What's your transport time?
"- In this weather, maybe 12 minutes."
- Where's your pilot?
"- Hey, Jimmy!"
Over here!
"- Sorry, doc."
We got to move.
"- Wait, wait."
We're losing time.
- What's your flight time to County ER?
-15 minutes.
- Will you take us?
- We're not medically equipped.
"- He's hypothermic, needs special care."
- Mercy is closer.
- Then he dies because there's no ICU.
- Or else he dies in a news chopper.
I've never once thought of you as a monster!
Then why didn't you tell me about your family?
!
I hear your family was murdered by a Methuselah.
And that you dirtied your own hands exacting revenge on him!
It's not like that!
That was-
That was...
"Back then, I..."
So it's true...
Your Lordship...
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!
How did things turn out this way?
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!
What do I do?
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!
Is that-
Your-
What a dilemma.
I never expected you to come all the way out here...
"Stay quiet, okay?"
I'll let go.
Seth-chan!
"What on earth are you doing, dressed like that?"
!
Shh!
This is the Moldova family mausoleum.
The Duchess of Moldova's funeral is about to take place.
In the presence of the empress.
Good.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
We're about to get started.
Have a seat.
Please.
So we can get out of here.
"Anna and everyone, we are required to be here on time."
We have a lot of work to do and it's not fair to the others if we're late.
"Yes, it won't happen again."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I thought it might be helpful today if we watch the confession again.
Why?
And I don't know how it happened.
I don't.
"Danny, come into my office, please."
I heard about what happened last night.
That was crazy.
Must've been a horrible thing to discover.
First time I've seen a dead body.
It was shocking.
I bet.
I bet.
Did the police give you any trouble?
"Because if they did, I can take care of it."
You know I've got you covered.
"Thank you, Henry."
"No, I think I'm good."
She'd been dead for a couple of hours.
Ruled me out as a suspect.
"And she had a history of abuse, so they're pretty confident it was an OD."
- Did you bring back my photo?
"- Oh, no."
I'm not done with it yet.
I'm still in the brainstorming stage.
"Well, if you get stuck, you should enlist Michael."
He's got creativity just rolling off of him.
"Yeah, I always work alone."
I'm a solo artist.
Of course.
She's still brainstorming.
Yeah.
It's like this complicated process that-
"So, tell Ellen about the shoe guy."
Did you go back to the store?
Yeah.
And turns out he's a killer of children.
"So, oh, well."
What?
"Why does he say ""the tall one""?"
- Because he wants me to do it.
- He's crazy.
You'd leave teeth marks all over it.
You'd choke on it.
He could see that I have a sensuous mouth.
This is crazy.
Someone should call in the authorities.
"Obviously, I would do it better."
We need an impartial authority.
"Hey, Peter!"
Peter Swersey.
"We are going to giveyou a ""jimmy ha-ha."""
- Do you know what that is?
"Oh, well, this is just great!"
That didn't go so well.
"I'm not pointing any fingers, but do you ever put that thing on vibrate?"
- Good morning.
"- Yeah, right."
"Dad, Dad, Dad."
Come on.
"We can either discuss this as adults, or you can act like a child."
"""...or you can act like a child."""
Which is it gonna be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Ike Cortez.
Manhattan Monthly.
- Alex Rose.
"Well, let's dive on in."
Feel free to ask me anything.
Great.
"Okay, first question."
You work for your dad.
Does that ever get awkward?
No.
Never.
Next question.
"If there's one guy Alex Rose could date right now, who would it be?"
Don't you have anything on there about hobbies or something?
I don't care if you're seeing him!
I just want to know what's going on.
Really?
You don't care if I'm seeing him?
"Well, of course I care, but I can't come barging in here yelling"
"""I have mixed feelings!"""
"Can you tell him, again, that I am trying to reach him?"
Of course.
Goodbye.
"Hey, thanks for meeting me here."
"Well, I thought we better speak face to face."
"Why, what is it?"
I checked the Brandeis account.
And?
"The Manovich money, the 30 million..."
It was in the account until a few days ago.
What do you mean?
It's gone.
Gone!
But that means that someone had to take it.
After Constantine died.
All of it?
Yes.
"If Constantine didn't take it, then..."
Christos!
He's the only one who had access to it.
What do you want to do?
I'm going to get some answers.
"Ok, cash or card?"
Cash.
Wouldn't want my husband to find out.
"No, those are going in the back."
You take all of those in the back.
"This is good, good, good."
I like all this.
"You know bushes, it's here is the important part."
"It's like, here,we want them, this is what they see, the rest is..."
Who looks back here?
In a train.
What were you trafficking?
Myself.
You're a simpleton?
"Can you say ""virgin"" for a man?"
Not for long.
I'm hurting.
I'm bleeding!
"No, you're coming."
I'm the one who's bleeding.
"You're wet, when I want you!"
"Léo, don't wait for me."
"Forget the address, forget everything."
Mickey's okay.
Anyway.
I'd like...
I can't...
Yes?
We don't give handouts.
Autographs and postcards via mail exclusively.
Hungry?
The ladies are sleeping.
No noises please.
Come into the kitchen.
"Coffee, chocolate, tea?"
"From where I come from, we're force-fed all of your disasters."
"Floods, wars, famines, terrorist attacks, kid soldiers..."
"We shrug off propaganda, we want proof;"
"once we have it, we don't know who we are anymore."
But darling...
"In the Kingdom of the Blind, the one-eyed suffers."
So don't look.
[Sighs]
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"[Gasps] No, i-it's better that I know... who they really are."
"Martha, I-I've never... been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"[Sniffles] I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
- A very important job.
- [Sighs]
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
I don't understand it all... but there are a lot of leaks coming out... we think... of your office.
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
[Sniffles]
You are.
What?
"No, no."
No way.
I'm not gonna be a factor in that decision.
You know that there's no way for us to have a normal relationship.
"- You can forget about it, right?"
- OK.
There is a personal cost when you run for president.
"But as far as we're concerned, there's no reason why you and I can't be a normal couple."
How?
"Well, uh, for starters, we could try and sleep in a little bit."
- Is that what normal couples do?
- Mm-hmm.
What about this?
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's normal."
- That cannot be good thing.
"- No, no."
It's gearing up.
- Just give it a few minutes.
"- Wow, Holly."
It sounds like it's in its final death throes.
"No, no."
That's impossible.
It's brand new.
No.
My condolences.
Maybe we better read the manual.
- OK.
- How's your Italian?
L.A. Sucks.
I spent one hour on the 110 and I missed breakfast with Caitlin.
"Sorry, I didn't realize you had a guest."
"Should we take notes, or will there be handouts?"
There'll be handouts.
Now as I was saying...
"I'm gonna take notes anyway, just to be safe."
Brought a fresh notebook.
"Oh, boy."
What?
Is that who you were in school?
You were that person?
What person?
"""ms."
"Rinsky, should we take notes?"""
"You know, the suck-up, the goody-goody, the narc."
"Well, if we have to be here, mike,"
"I want to make the most of it,"
"And actually, I was very cool in school."
Okay.
I was.
Okay.
I was.
Am I gonna have to separate you two?
Please.
"Let's face it, to teenagers, old people are like"
Alien life forms from a faraway galaxy
They don't really want to visit.
How are things going in school?
You're... yo in...
"What, the second grade now?"
Uh-huh.
Eighth.
"I'm actually working on a really big science project right now,"
So that's why we have to leave
Oh.
"You made my favorite, mommy."
Alan?
I thought you were dead.
I am.
What's it like?
Lovely.
"Come with me, and I'll tell you all about it."
"Oh, wait."
Not yet.
There were lots of doors.
And... and...
Each door led to a different loved one from my life.
My mother.
Mom.
"And my brother, who died last year."
I-I moved easily from room to room.
"And I knew that there were many more rooms ahead that, in time, I would get to."
I wanted to go through those doors.
"Makes no sense, but..."
I feel that I will be going through them...
Soon.
And...
I'm looking forward to it.
Gosh.
"You have any more of that, uh... psilocybin lying around?"
- You serious?
- I want to see my mom.
You're just as likely to see zombies.
"- Well, I would love to see zombies."
- I knew you would.
"Don't you ever, you know, want to ha a spiritual experience?"
That's quite good.
"Well, I don't know, it was very catty."
Hmm.
"Now if you want to ask me any questions, you can ask me through your animal."
Do I have to speak in the animal language?
That's what I said.
"""Why were you at Simon Cowell's house?"""
I went to see Simon Cowell.
"""What was it about?"""
"Can we stop asking the same question, please?"
"Yes, sorry."
This is a place of respite and I wish to meditate.
"Now, I will offer you guys the chance to join me if you'd so like to."
Would you like to?
"Yes, we'd love to."
Take a seat.
Of course.
Love to.
"Meditation, have you done it before, Dermot?"
Right.
Now I sense that you two are searching for answers on the outside.
Yes.
PHONE RINGS
Whose phone is that?
That's not my phone.
It's not my phone.
I gave Philip my phone.
It's coming from you.
Why can I hear it coming from this direction?
It's not my phone...
It's coming from here!
What's going...?
I have aliens at home.
"So relax nicely, don't think about anything."
Life is beautiful.
You don't understand!
-I can't go any further.
-I know.
"-Life is beautiful, isn't it?"
-But I really have two aliens at home.
-A visit from another planet.
"-Well, great!"
"So you will rest at our place, and when you get out of here, you'll be as fit as a fiddle, won't you?"
-Doctor?
-Yes?
-We are full.
We are full.
So you won't rest at our place.
"But you'll go and rest in nature, and you'll be as fit as a squirell."
"Sister, write down."
Nature is the best doctor.
"Doctor, haven't you had enough of us yet?"
No?
-Don't you feel tired?
-Let me see.
You look bad.
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I'm only a bit overworked."
"Cursed, fucking job!"
Where are you screwing around?
!
"-What's the matter, boss?"
-Watch your language!
Fuck watching my language!
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.
"- Lf not mine, whose?"
"- Lf not now, when?"
Were you just talking about me?
"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
You told her?
She's not your wife.
"If I told you, you would've given it away."
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
"- No, but he would have read your face."
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?
No.
Hey.
"Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?
- Why?
You don't wear glasses.
- I know.
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.
"I have to say, as a glasses- wearer, I take exception to that."
That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
"Yeah, I've considered that."
"Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?"
He's having a two-day book signing at Walden's.
"You know, we had a really bad breakup."
[Sighs] You mind if I...
Record this?
"Oh, this is not an interview."
We're just gonna have a talk.
- I record everything.
- I'd rather you not.
Thank you.
I want to apologize.
- You really don't have to.
"- No, I do."
I reacted emotionally to your article.
That was a mistake.
"You know, these people are my family."
"I'd kill for them, but I shouldn't have said what I said about you."
Or my father's cunt?
[Chuckling] Your your father's cunt.
Got a little personal.
"Well, you got a little personal, too."
- I don't think so.
- No?
Came after me.
"Came after my gym, my fighters."
You came after my son.
How is that not personal?
I write about MMA.
That's all fair game.
"Yeah, but your tone..."
You came after me.
How so?
"Well, you were writing shit that wasn't fact."
"Well, um, Nate lost his fight."
Ryan looked like anything but a champ.
- Where the hell is he?
I wish that I had a friend like you.
"You will, one ofthese days."
Drop your guns!
Your right hand still works?
Well enough.
It's still fast and accurate.
You've got no way out.
Why are you doing this?
"You tell me, what's the alternative?"
- Where's the money?
- Give it to me!
I'm one step ahead.
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?
Maybe I'm no longer a professional.
I wish I could start all over again.
It's a pity...
- Give me the cash.
- Where isJeffrey?
Give me the money first.
We owe it to him.
Hypocrite!
Do all killers have a sense of honor?
The world has changed.
Honor is now a dirty word.
"Sidney, sometimes I think you're not human."
You're more like a dog.
At least we have one thing in common:
We both use guns for a living.
But our motivations are different.
Right?
In some ways dogs are superior to men.
It's what marriage is all about.
I know.
I read it on the back of a matchbox.
"Basil, sometimes..."
"Seriously, Sybil, do you remember when we were first... manacled together?"
We used to laugh quite a lot.
"Yes, but not at the same time, Basil."
That's true.
"That was a warning, I guess."
"Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?"
"Zoom! ""What was that?"" ""That was your life, mate."""
"""Oh."
That was quick.
"Do I get another?"""
"""Sorry, mate, that's your lot."""
Basil.
Back to the world of dreams.
"Yes, dear?"
What are we going to do?
Give it another 15 years?
- About the money.
Do you...
"- Aw, she's left it in her room, or eaten it or something."
We'll get Manuel to go through the room.
Polly can check the lounge...
- I saw Polly with money just now.
"- Well, there you are."
"Quite a bit, too."
She was counting it in here.
"Well, it's probably hers."
"No, she's been very short lately."
I'll ask her...
I decided to find out.
- How much is she on the rim f or?
- Sixteen thousand.
Let's see what I can do with the same numbers.
Did you ride in on the killing?
Her horse stumbled.
Give me the 7-11 dice.
They're all 7-11 dice.
It depends on the player's talent.
- Not the luck?
- l was returning your compliment.
"You shoot honestly, we give you honest dice."
Open up the table.
"You won't mind if I watch, I hope."
"Not at all, if you think you can take it."
- What's the limit?
"- For Mrs. Chandler, no limit."
We shoot 2000.
- Seven.
- Seven the winner.
- The 4000 rides.
"- Ad infinitum, if you wish."
Eleven the winner.
"7-11, your system, Dusty."
"Once more, and we're even."
- We'd better stop with what we have.
"- No, we'll get even."
The house will change the dice.
"That's your privilege, f riend."
That squares you with the house.
You think there's something wrong?
"I never think when I gamble, I just feel."
I don't even know where to start.
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.
"Just to get away and make, you know, all the memories that I can... while I can."
And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just...
But not on this.
"You know, I just..."
I'll deal with it.
"I'll deal with it when I get back, you know."
I'll just...
"You're a good guy, Cooper."
Call your mum.
"Zero, zero, one, nine, three, nine, two, nine."
"No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night because I'm in..."
And how long does that take?
Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.
"Oh, my God."
Mm-hmm.
"Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story for a second hook-up ever?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, my God."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Alright.
Don't forget your bag.
"The bag, yep, my bag."
Alright.
You are a top bird.
"I don't know what that means, but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it."
I got a plan.
Yeah.
It's odd jobs.
Okay.
The first letter's a B.
A. It's an A.
I think it's gonna tell us who A is.
D?
B-A-D.
Bad.
That's the whole message?
Bad?
- What's it supposed to mean?
- It means you got punked.
Toby doesn't trust us.
I don't blame him.
I don't think he'd mess with us like this.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of.
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
"This might be a joke, but it could be real."
"Look, either way, Toby's not the enemy."
"You know what, guys?"
I'm gonna go.
What was that all about?
How should I know?
Doesn't look like very much.
"Well, it's all we have."
The rest is gone.
"Mom, Mrs. Potter doesn't need that money anymore."
"No, but we can't keep it."
"No, not keep it but I don't know, maybe we could give it to somebody who needs it."
I love you for thinking that but I just want this nightmare to be over.
I'm putting the money back in the safe deposit box.
What is left of it.
- I'll see you tonight.
- We're not all bumpkins.
So I'm not under arrest?
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.
No breaking and entering.
You've had trouble with him before?
Gordy and Denise?
No.
They're good people.
Things have just been a little strange around here lately.
You still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night.
I don't know.
Where am I?
Think you could show me where we are on the map here?
We're right on the state line.
With Ohio.
- What time did you leave DC?
1:00 in the morning.
"If I was doing 80 the whole way, it would've taken me six hours to get here."
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.
"By the way, don't worry about your pal the governor."
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
Okay.
"Thanks, Eddie."
- So?
"- It's running fine, Mr. Klein."
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?
Strange.
"- All right, what do I owe you?"
You've created a life for yourself and a totally new path.
It's wonderful.
"I wish you good luck, Michael, and hope you visit us soon."
- I will.
"- Goodbye, Michael."
"Boy, you really knocked it out of the park in there."
I quit.
Seriously?
- Oh!
How'd it go?
- Great.
I quit.
Can you give me a ride to the airport?
Sure.
- You quit?
- I'll get my things.
"I didn't get what you meant at first, about me being afraid of something else, but I get it now and I know what it is."
Did you plan all this?
involved...
"Well, there was a certain amount of planning"
"No, it was instinct."
He's good.
- He's like a brain detective.
- What was the epiphany?
I don't wanna say it till I know I'm right.
I guess this is the end.
Of?
Therapy.
"I mean, you got me where I needed to be."
You literally drove me there.
"Well, therapy's never really over, remember?"
"Well, not for me, maybe, but..."
I didn't know his body was there!
I told you.
I followed you to apologise.
- I believe you.
- It's true!
Of course.
The transfer linkage you asked for.
About time.
Any news from the search parties?
No.
"No, there won't be."
"It was an unlikely idea, keeping out of sight for the length of time this ship has been in flight."
Not really possible.
I agree.
So who do you think it is?
- Mandrian.
- Why?
Instinct.
I discount Dr Kendall.
I thought you mistrusted instinct?
"I do, so I am probably wrong."
"It could be him I told you I heard him quarrelling with Sara, didn't I?"
"Sonheim makes me uneasy, too."
He would be next on my list.
The answer is here.
If only we could see it.
I knew you'd be here.
[DISTANT METEOR IMPACTS]
How far are we in now?
Halfway I can't be sure.
The detectors are swamped.
The force wall's eating into our power reserves.
- Philip!
"- Stay away from me, you murderous..."
"- Philip, no!"
- Tell him you did it for him.
I did it for you.
She was going to destroy you.
Have you fired.
"Your own daughter, that's how much you loved him."
My daughter.
"I killed her for, for you."
My savior.
My Siegfried.
Please don't leave me.
What would I want you for?
Look at you.
A mad cow.
Philip!
Phil...
Philip.
What's gonna happen to me?
"- Come on, Gillian."
- Who's gonna look after me?
It'll be the taxpayers of the state of New York who'll be taking care of her.
She's only got three years left to live.
"You're not gonna throw the book at her, are you?"
I'm sure she'll be receptive to a plea that lands her in the Bedford prison hospital.
You think any of those tears are for her daughter?
"Yeah, me neither."
"Um, did I not mention to you my new philosophy?"
Of saying yes.
Does that mean you want me to...
Okay.
Bye.
I wish there was more we could do.
"Honey, you're his lawyer, not his guardian."
I know.
"I know, I know."
In the morning I'll take him to Child Service.
What kind of mother just abandons her child?
What happens if they don't find her?
He'll go into the system.
Foster care till he's 18.
"I mean, they'll try and place him, but...at his age, it'll be impossible."
You know what I was thinking?
"I think that this being your last night and all, we should do something special."
I don't know what.
Possibly get a couple of tattoos or some hookers and lose out virginity.
Ok ?
"Okay, dude, I don't know."
There's a shark movie at the IMAX.
If that's what you're into.
I just want to take it easy.
How was your swim?
It was great.
What's that?
It's a model home.
I build them.
"Well, the real ones, not that one."
Can you build me one?
Sorry.
Bad joke.
So...
"last supper, huh?"
I've done nothing wrong!

I'm sorry.
I wish I'd come to see you sooner.
Big Brother!
Did you come to see me?
You'd better hurry or you'll miss your plane.
No.
I've decided not to go.
But what about your work?
"Shinjiro, you go and see how Grandma is doing."
Is something the matter with Grandma?
There's something strange!
Grandma is sleeping.
Snoring up a storm!
How is she?
"She ate some rice porridge, but she's asleep again."
"Shall we go to bed, too?"
It looks like we're going to have some rain.
Shall we close the sliding doors?
Grandma!
The bomb!
"What's the matter, Grandma?"
Grandma!
What's going on?
It's the bomb!
"You two, quick!"
Put this over you.
This is best for the bomb!
There're many who survived because they were wearing something white!
"The sooner, the better."
Let's take her to the hospital right away!
She's sound asleep now.
Maybe we should leave her as she is a little longer.
Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?
Gotta make your personal appearance.
No.
No!
"No, no, no, no!"
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Lightning McQueen here.
"And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!"
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze.
Wow!
Look at that shine!
Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me!
Ka-chow!
I met this car from Swampscott.
He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.
You could see his dirty undercarriage.
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.
They did give you your big break.
"Besides, it's in your contract."
"Oh, will you stop, please?"
Just go get hooked up.
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
"But remember, all that salt and grime..."
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
"Hey, look!"
There he is!
Our almost champ!
Madame Sand!
"Oh, what a great honour you do my humble salon!"
"delighted to meet you, Baroness."
"I'm looking for my publisher, Monsieur BuIoz."
"He's in the salon with the others, but you'II have to wait to go in."
I've so longed to meet you!
I knew your father when he was young.
- really?
- Yes.
We girls were enraged when we heard he'd married that dancer.
- You mean my mother?
- Oh... of course.
- Is she still living?
- Yes.
- But she's ill now.
- How sad.
And what a tragedy your father died so young.
The Count de Saxe.
So dashing.
Those idiots!
Excuse me.
Not yet!
(Baroness mutters angrily)
(souIfuI piano passage)
Madame Sand!
Is it true that you're writing a memoir?
"- Do you pray, Baroness?"
"- If you must know, I'm secretly devout."
- Do you ever hear an answer?
- To my prayers?
"well, no."
There... is the answer.
"Morning, girls."
Someone had a late night.
What time did the cat drag you in?
I didn't exactly get dragged out.
"Molly, you didn't."
What can I say?
Jimmy is very persuasive.
And nimble.
"You got a guy, peggy?"
I'm afraid I'm married to my work at the moment.
What about mr.
Fancy?
"You know, the guy I've seen around the automat..."
"Nice suit, nice car, nice shoulders."
"Oh, no."
No.
He's just a colleague.
"Good day, ladies."
Early bird and all that.
"Ah, miss carter, please sit."
This will only be a moment.
"In 1925, the great harry houdini"
Performed at this very building.
"Ugh, houdini."
That's never good.
Women stood spellbound and watched
"As he escaped from handcuffs,"
"Straight jackets, steamer trunks."
But the one trick he could not pull off
Was ascending the stairs.
"It's a simple rule, ladies."
No men above the first floor.
"I'm all right, thanks."
Just...
I'm all right.
"Built in 1972, then demolished the following year before being rebuilt in 85, the Bulwer-Lytton building is a classic example of the late modernist, post-Bauhaus development from humanist rationalist impulses from utility."
"Inspired by Alvar Aalto's signature style, the building is built..."
Psst!
In here.
Come in here.
"... Social interaction and the hyper relevance of volume as, er..."
I wanna talk to you.
"Come here, then."
What are you doing?
The idea is to walk across the room.
The room's full of shit.
This is a lab.
It's an experiment.
Come here.
For fuck's sake.
Fuck.
"Oh, shit!"
Bollocks.
Well done.
Well done?
"You got here, though."
What do you want from me?
Hey!
Who's in there?
Over here!
Better run.
Hey!
Stop!
"Come back here, you!"
"This is called ""Act like a Man""!"
The way you throw dart could be exhausting
It's my fault!
If only I knew you carried so many rusted tins
I'll kill you fast!
"Now you're prepared, it'd be a bit harder"
"You're so smart, you can learn from me... in such a short time"
Now it's my turn!
Finished?
Killed?
That's what you taught me
Act like a Man
Fan San is killed suddenly
Who possibly can kill him?
"Dad, could it be a hero... who wants to deliver justice for us all?"
Hero?
I smell trouble!
That's right.
Now that someone is killed
Don't know how he will torture us again
"Gao, running around again?"
Where've you been?
I went to pee!
Pee again!
You pee all day long
Kidney failure?
How do you know?
How dare you!
T easing me!
"No, I'm not"
"Y es, you are!"
"You are, too"
"- Remember, bust them, you buy them."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Hey, you know what you're doing?"
- We're running out of fuel.
- You're lying.
"The aircraft was topped off to tour Honolulu, not island hop."
"Take a look, you see that?"
That's ten minutes max.
- It's 15 to Molokai.
"- Look, just find a way, all right?"
"Spoke to Honolulu approach, your bird is 6 miles east-southeast heading towards Molokai."
"Okay, copy that."
"Chin, over there."
They should be in that direction.
Got them.
About three miles east.
Don't lose them.
I'm coming around.
- What's going on?
- What do you think is going on?
"All right, here we go."
"Everyone, hang on."
This is gonna get ugly.
- They just went down.
- Yeah.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Got a single gunshot wound.
He's dead.
Family's gone.
He took them hostage.
"Look, just let my wife and my son go, I'll do..."
"None of you are going anywhere till I get off this island, all right?"
"No, I'm fine."
I'm fine.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
"OK, but we could really use your help with the new mosque, and we were hoping that you'd changed your mind."
Yeah.
It's just that I can't do something I don't believe in.
"Well, you obviously haven't totally lost your faith,"
- You're eating turkey bacon.
- The thing is...
- Ah!
Spit it out!
Spit it out!
- What?
You have lots.
It's not turkey bacon.
Sorry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
[ sigh ]
That's wine.
Kidding!
[ sigh ]
Stupid answering machine!
"Where are you, Charles Thorne?"
"Guess who had bacon this morning, real bacon?"
- I did.
"- No, I did."
I've finally took that last step away from my old life.
"Sarah, I love you, but your religious crisis is getting in the way of my real crisis."
"Well, then I guess you don't want half my BLT."
"Hell, yeah!"
Less dork... more pork.
This one looks more like a prison than a mosque.
Get a room!
I know you and I are history.
I just hope that we can reconnect on some level.
Maybe even be friends.
Yes!
(MUSIC PLAYS)
"I believe in you, Fiona."
(MUSIC PLAYS)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
"Here, boy."
There we go.
"Come on, Barry."
(PHONE RINGS)
Constable John.
Sorry?
There's a what?
"""without the classic distraction maneuver"
"""known as the 'bait and switch.'"
"""The key is picking the appropriate unsuspecting target."""
So we're really gonna do this?
"I mean, I want to find her, man."
"I really do, but... this guy and his family?"
- That'll make us just as bad as...
- Ava.
"You know, one of those books said you can't cheat an honest man."
"Yeah, I read that."
I still don't get it.
"- Hey, thank you."
- You're welcome.
"It's like there are people who set themselves up to be taken because they're, you know, greedy or selfish or mean."
You know what?
We need some ground rules.
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.
Are you off-duty?
"I had laryngitis, remember?"
I was sick this whole time.
You didn't sound like you during this.
- During this stuff?
"- Yeah, during all this stuff."
"Aaron Yoo was really driving that van, by the way."
Confidently.
- It doesn't sound like I have laryngitis.
- I don't think you sound that different.
"It's because Self, our PA from heaven, used to bring me hot beverages."
- We miss you.
- I love Self.
- you two might get stuck.
Having some trouble?
"Hey, I bet that wasn't looped."
I was with Jonny...
I was with Jonny during that moment.
ADR.
Whatever.
"I'm not trying to show off, I'm just saying."
You know what though?
This is bad because I'm loving watching this and not saying anything interesting.
Don't look at it.
"- Yeah, look away."
- I can't look away.
"Hey, I think I should..."
- This was freezing.
- This is from cold.
- This awkward...
Delicious.
"High time, where've you been, Duke?"
"It didn't work, did it."
Elisa doesn't want me.
What did you think?
I told you so.
Save me!
"Help me, gracious witch!"
"Stop moaning, she's not the only Elisa around."
I said I'd choose a Lady for your palace myself.
Get up.
"My, you're heavy."
I wonder are you worthy of her?
"Call me Elisa, I don't mind."
What?
You?
Never!
No?
That's all right.
I can be the mistress here without you around.
You and your precious servant'll clean the place all day and every day for 100 years.
And I want everything to shine and sparkle!
That's what I get for my my tragic love!
"I know everything, move and fast or I'll turn you into six ugly green dwarfs."
No.
"Your Grace, you too?"
You're as heavy as a sack of grouts!
Come quickly!
"They'll haunt the castle at nights, they don't know yet!"
- But this is our...
-Elisa's!
They locked it up!
My memory is like a 70-year-old granny's.
I always leave my phone in the office once or twice a day.
I'm one of the better cases.
One of my colleagues has a neck brace for her phone.
What?
You said that we don't have enough time.
Let's use it wisely.
Is something wrong?
"I know you could be angry, but you shouldn't be this mad."
What's wrong?
Did you order steak?
They are cold.
-It's ok.
"-Leave them, I'll order again."
I can see stars already.
-I said leave them.
-You said there's no time.
Let's just eat.
Sit!
There's salad.
"Bread, plenty to eat."
"Oh yeah, I should drink wine first."
When you called me stupid my stomach got upset.
Even stupid people get shocked from that.
Did you know that I was stupid now?
"This isn't the first time you were called ""stupid."""
"That ""stupid"" was different from ""stupid"" before."
Aren't you going to drink?
You have to drive?
So do I.
A glass will be ok within an hour.
It shows.
"You'll find out what's wrong, won't you?"
- You said you could.
"- Sure, my love."
"And you've always got me, in case of need."
Or did you want us both?
"No, I'm not like that."
Not the one and the other.
- lt's more either/or.
- Either/or?
What are you two either/or-ing?
"Gerard asked me about my morning, and I have to work."
"It's either working, or neglecting the salon."
Working?
Today?
I've taken the whole damned week off for you!
"It's just this morning, sweetheart."
Monday mornings I have to see my salesmen. I'll be froe this afternoon.
That's great!
I'll be bored to tears meanwhile.
- Do something with Gerard.
- He's here to work too!
So I don't work this morning.
Yes... show him around.
Or talk to him.
Perhaps he'll write about us.
Then we'll be in a book.
What's the use of being in a book?
You know what?
Take the car.
I don't need it anyway.
Shall we?
I have to get to the meeting.
Absolutely authentic.
And the staircase came from Switzerland.
Ah!
Do you like it?
I know this house.
I have been often here when Jimmy Edwards owned it.
The banker.
It brought him lots of luck.
He made millions.
I'll take it.
"You'll never be sorry, Mr. Sabourin."
Isn't this a rather large house for you?
"Oh, I don't know."
In Europe I lived in a palace for some time.
So did I.
But when the king was unfaithful...
I moved.
You know the price is $300.000 furnished.
I'll give you a fairly substantial deposit.
$5.000 in cash.
I'll sigh the rest of the papers tomorrow.
"You really make up your mind fast, don't you?"
"Oh, you!"
"Yes, sir?"
Who do you work for?
"No one, sir."
Now that you have bought the house.
You're working for me now.
"Thank you, sir."
I want dinner for two tonight.
The best you can get.
"Get a cook, maid, anything you want."
See what they say.
- I don't have time.
What do you want?
Something I don't know.
They were tortured.
Were they raped?
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.
"If you catch me younger, I make you a hero."
It's a very rare film.
Not a common brand.
Imported.
I don't think many people around here use a roll like that.
I can find out who does.
But I want the photos of their cadavers.
From the autopsy.
I have a family.
I have to put food on the table.
Does your family know what you do?
My family thinks I'm the next Truman Capote.
He's an American writer.
Never mind.
Find out.
"I've seen your partner too, but I don't remember where."
Do you know if he ever worked in Vallecas?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I found my daughters' bankbook.
My husband had it hidden in the car.
We found this in the glove compartment of your car.
"What's going on, Rodrigo?"
Let me go...!
Hurry up!
He looks like a drug-addict.
He probably did this to get some money!
"Yes, but he really does look like you."
"If you were not here, I would have been fooled."
"Yes, this is the Commissioner!"
He's not the real Mr. Hiroshima!
- You mean him?
- We were just tipped-off.
is that so?
- lt's came from a reliable source.
- ls that so?
"Sir, do we need to take action?"
Wait till I come back.
Your Excellency!
"I'll be right back, don't go away!"
You must stay for my wedding party.
"Notify all the guards, without my orders,"
No one is permitted to leave the house.
Yes Sir!
"Excepting myself, of course."
"Yoyo, you're done!"
Did you say something?
"Ridiculous, you're dumb."
Dangerous situations can do miracles.
Who are you?
I am woman!
"You must be crazy, you're a man, how come...?"
Listen:
I am woman!
I am woman too.
He's just sabotaging himself.
He's sabotaging this account that would mean so much to us and... I can't even say anything--
"Oh God, Patty."
What would I do?
"I mean, how would I survive?"
"Camille, Camille, it's okay, honey, you're going to be okay."
"No, you don't understand, I need him. I'm not like you."
"Wait, wait, what am I like?"
"I didn't mean that, I just mean I need him, I really need Andy to live."
This is incredible.
Right. I'm sorry that...
H i.
We can go downstairs.
"No, lt's fine. I was just..."
- l should probably go.
- No.
"No, don't go."
"- So, your room is..."
- A mess.
Different from the last time I saw it.
"Okay, well, I'm going."
I'm on hold.
"Rosenfeld, I got to call him back."
Good morning.
How long have you been up?
A while.
You can have the first shower if you want.
"That's okay, you go ahead."
There's nothing edible in here.
"Don't be ridiculous, sweetie."
That things crammed full of stuff.
Let me look.
Thank goodness. I'm famished.
I forgot to have lunch today.
Make sure you get double cheese.
And get some of those little tomatoes daddy likes.
- Daddy can't be disturbed!
- What?
He's lying down upstairs.
"Here, get a large."
"Graham, what happened?"
is it Andy?
Nothing happened.
Do you feel all right?
Are you coming down... I just want to lie here.
How was your meeting with Rosenfeld?
It went okay.
Did you feel like you made all your points?
"Look. I want to tell you, and I will tell you how the meeting went... but I really just can't talk about it, now!"
Okay?
You know it's okay.
We'll live.
"You know I mean... we don't have to have this account, I mean the important thing is... I'm really sorry."
I have to get out of here.
- What?
- l can't breathe.
Graham!
"If you didn't land this account, that's okay."
Please!
"J ust let it be, okay?"
- l can't...
- You can't what?
What is wrong?
- Where are you going?
It's just a riot!
"And what's that, Nina?"
Do you smoke?
!
- Drop it now!
"- Come on, mama!"
- Give it to me!
"- Stop it, mama!"
I know what I'm doing!
"Here, you may have it!"
Did I give birth to you for you to smoke that filth?
"Will you shut up, please?"
"- Nina, hurry, the telephone!"
- What do you care?
- Maybe it's for me?
- Who can call you?
Perhaps there's someone.
"Stop it, you've just arrived."
Hello?
- Do you have a rag?
"- I'll do it later, mom."
I'm listening.
Are you going to play the silent game?
"Well, as you wish."
He wouldn't answer?
"No, he wouldn't answer."
"Nina, I see Stasik is still into his snags, making sculptures."
Good for him.
"- Remember Kolia, the Pioneer leader?"
"- Yes, I do."
"I just finished packing, was about to go to the station, and here he comes carrying all kinds of roots and knolls and some weird stumps."
"Here, Aunt Marusya, take them to your son-in-law."
Exactly!
Everything about her is an action replay of my wife!
My heart says that too!
Get me my Laxmi!
Please!
"If Aunt gets to know of this, she'd be really offended."
Not at all!
D'you know what she threw at me today?
This!
The box?
That would break my head!
She threw a rose at me!
Did that fall on you?
"On my heart, actually."
Now look; suppose you're walking down the street...
But I'm standing here.
Just suppose so!
And a crow flying overhead drops excrement on your head.
Just suppose so!
"Will you fall for the crow, too?"
What a rotten joke!
"A crow and Laxmi, eh?"
I'll throw you out!
Just listen...
She's terribly angry with Durgaprasad which is why she threw the rose at you.
Durgaprasad?
Now who the hell is that?
I'm trapped...
"Her brother-in-law, eh?"
Not her brother-in-law.
He's her husband.
She said she was alone!
How long have you known my mother?
About a year.
How did you meet her?
We just kind of met.
Are you going to see her again?
I hope so.
Would you like that?
I guess so.
"Hey, you wanna know a secret?"
What?
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?
Made me realise what a wonderful mother I had.
You will realise that too some day.
What's that?
Monster ride.
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What's that mean?
"Well, a route is a road you take when you're on a long journey."
Can we go in?
"Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother."
What for?
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Ride here if you dare!
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Look like someone had a bad crack up.
"Fill her up, cowboy."
"We wouldn't be eating in there anytime soon, Nicolas?"
"Eww, look at that."
You should close your eyes.
Jesus!
"- Boy, this is one heck of a ride."
Sounds like a real mystery.
Does it?
"Anyway, in the end he finds this very thin string that links everything."
I think that might be hard to get across.
People only believe in things that are very sound.
"But that string, even if he finds it, well, it's something like a soul."
There is nothing bodily.
"It's very, very light."
Damn it.
Not interesting?
It's interesting.
I don't quite get it.
But you have a way with words.
I like people who are eloquent.
I don't trust anyone who can't logically explain himself.
Really?
- What the hell?
- So adorable.
- What's his name?
- Dori.
"You're Dori, huh?"
You're so cute.
- How old is he?
- He's eight months now.
"You're eight, are you?"
"- Sorry, but we got to go."
"- No, I'm sorry."
"Bye, Dori."
Scared?
"Yeah, I've been bitten once, and never been near a dog since."
What's there to be afraid of?
He's so lovely.
It's just hard not to feel that everybody is when you' re lying in the street with a cop's foot to the back of your neck.
I've never seen it like this.
"It's okay, there will be a later bus."
Yeah.
"That's not your music, that's Abby's."
She always liked that noise.
I'm getting used to it.
There's an accident up ahead.
"Sit tight, we'll keep you posted."
- Thank
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Well...
"- Thank you for this, John."
- I know it's a huge inconvenience.
- It's no problem.
I'm sorry for getting so upset.
I hate being so pathetic.
Just the idea of going home alone and waiting...
- Eric will turn up.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, but I worry about both of them."
Abby's good.
"You know, we' re both good."
You don't have to worry about that.
She told me.
She told me you might get married.
- Is that what she said?
"- No, she told me you proposed."
"I know she's work, it runs in the family, but she's so worth it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, God."
Patti Nyholm.
"- Well, look at you."
- And you.
Poster child for Motherhood Today.
"You have no changing tables in the restroom, Will."
- It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
"- Yep, doing our part to suppress the birth rate."
"So, I need some legal advice on my contract."
"Oh, my God, wait."
You can't practice law any more.
What was I thinking?
"No, thank you."
"I'll be right out, Michael."
This'll take a few minutes.
"That must be really hard on you, Will, just sitting around watching all these lawyers while you're, what, surfing the Web?"
- Clipping coupons?
"- What's up, Patti?"
- A lawsuit.
- Really?
Which one?
A new one.
"It'll be great being on opposite sides again, dusting it up..."
"Oh, wait."
Darn it.
You're not a lawyer any more.
I keep forgetting.
So sorry I'm late.
Here's my lawyer now.
"Ms. Nyholm, I believe you know everybody."
I think I do.
Hello.
"Listen to me, there's no cash with me."
They took the bag with them when they¡ª
"Asshole, I saw them leave."
No bag.
Get it.Now.
Ok.
"We have security cameras in here, you know."
You don't got shit.
"You're running an illegal joint under the table and off the books, asshole."
- Nice and easy.
- Ok.
"Ok, take the money out of the bag."
Put it down so I can see it.
And you're gonna put it back in.
Very slowly.
"If you play your cards right,"
"I'm going to leave quietly, and you're not going to tell anybody about this, because reporting a robbery of unreported income would be insane."
As would doing anything other than what I just told you.
Right.
- How much of this should--
- Just keep it coming.
Putting it right here.
Nice.
Shit.
Just take the money.
Can you hear me?
Hey.
Hey.
Jesus christ.
"You want to be a hero, asshole?"
You want to be a goddamn hero?
Guess I do.
Your things just flew out the window.
What?
You're part of the scenery.
"The air passes through, filling your entire body."
It flows out your finger tips.
Breathe with your toes to get the air into your toes.
The energy flowing in your toes fills you with vitality.
Your toes are laughing.
Good.
You're like air.
A cool breeze permeates your body.
You see a vision of divine beauty.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Who did this?
The Freemasons?
Are you from a bat lodge or something?
Leave me alone.
"Guys, I need help!"
Don't touch her!
"There's some wacko here, Peku!"
Are you fucking crazy or what?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Somebody was crying for help.
"The bride was tied up, her clothes all torn."
"I tried to help, but the Devil and Dracula attacked me."
Then they all just disappeared.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
- Eddie.
Search him!
"Oh, my books, they're coming loose."
"Say, that ain't a bad-looking doll, that one in the middle."
- The one with the pretzel legs.
"- He means you, Laury."
"- Why, the fresh..."
"- Don't be so smart-alecky, Rocky Sullivan."
- Go on.
"Beat it, pigtails."
"- Trying to show off, ain't you?"
"- Scram, before I wipe the street with you."
- You better wipe your nose first.
- Is that so?
I'll fix you.
- You better scram.
You know the Rocky.
- Come on.
"- Leave me alone, I can handle him."
Wait till I get down there.
I'll fix you.
- I'll slap you down.
- Oh!
"Why, you, you..."
Shut up.
Come on.
"Let's get out of here, dig up some corn."
"You won't get away with that, Rocky."
I'll get even someday.
You just wait.
"Say, maybe this winter we can hop a freight to Florida."
"They say you can go swimming there, even in January."
"Sure, we can even hop one to California if we wanted to."
"Look here, ""Rubelin Coal Company, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."""
Cut it out!
Stop being a clown.
"He just got here, I'd Iike to see you in his shoes, if they treated you Iike that."
"Mattia and I grew up together, he's a good kid."
- But he can't insult me.
- He has an Oedipus complex.
personal problems can't be dumped on others.
You won't really report him!
I can't let it slip by.
It's like he's still a kid.
"Go along, I'II lock up."
"And tell Mr. VoIpe I'm sleeping at my house, even on the floor."
Mr. Director!
Where are you going?
- Home.
- It's the otherway.
We'II take you there.
- What'II you do to me?
- We'II take you home.
- See you tomorrow.
"- No, we gotta take you inside."
help!
What were you thinking?
Who's there?
- What's happened?
- Why are you here?
"Don't be afraid, we wanted to surprise you."
Each of us gave something.
"It's make-shift, but it's okay for a start."
It's wonderful.
It's beautiful.
"It's so nice of all of you, even pictures!"
"Look, there's a hotel across the road there."
"We could grab a room, really thrash this thing out."
(Laughs) It's not gonna happen.
No?
"Come on, well, why do you call?"
Why do you...
Why do you keep dropping in?
"Fine, I won't."
"No, I'm not saying that."
I'm just saying why?
Why?
I don't know.
And I can't stay.
"Oh, well, this has been a cracker day for me."
I'm only trying to get an innocent man off murder charges.
"I'm happy for the distraction, yeah."
I thought everyone you defended was guilty.
Do you remember that long weekend we spent together?
"Yeah, yes."
Son Of Astor paid for it.
Came in ten to one.
"I had you for four beautiful days, all to myself."
In the Margaret River.
"And I really slept there, didn't I?"
"Yes, you did."
"Yeah, it was pretty much all you did, actually."
Snuggled up and snoozed.
I didn't mind.
They had in-house porn.
Call me anytime.
It's looking a bit messy.
"Ah, Sal."
"Well, it wasn't just that."
"When we met, it was like fate brought us together."
Now what's it doing?
I'm not a big believer in fate.
"Yeah, well, I hate fate."
"Oh, let's not make it mad, though."
I can't believe this.
I'm gonna take the car to go get some coffee with this guy.
What?
I'll be back soon.
"He's really, reay nice."
And he likes my hat.
Okay.
"- So, you're happy."
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
It's all good.
"I mean, Yonk's a lot older, so we're into different stuff, and-and we have different friends."
"And he's away a lot, promoting the Yonk Allen Barbeque Grill."
Okay.
"But, I mean, how cool is it?"
I'm married to Yonk Allen.
It's-it's awesome.
"Yeah, I mean, he was a huge football star, so, you know, he... got hit in the head a lot."
"But he takes really good care of me, and he's very sweet."
"Sometimes mean, but-but mostly sweet."
"Well, yeah, that's - that's just like your dad."
- Yes.
- Yes.
"Hey, babe."
Time to go to the airport.
I'll be right there.
Badly.
"Well, we see."
"Lack of appetite, weakness, diminution of weight, asthenia, you feel nauseous, vomits."
And a pretty coloration bronzes.
Disease of Addison.
You know that you have much luck?
Only there are a case each ten thousands.
One each ten thousands.
Disease of Addison.
It hears?
you know that when I am in critical moment me...?
-You.
You.
The stomach.
"-Ah, very well, thanks."
"Yours no, cretino."
The one of the patient.
"Ah, yes."
"Professor, he does not think that he is embarrassed?"
It seems to you the moment for joking?
Cretino.
"It feels, feels."
You see it?
It is aerophagia.
Who has been?
"I will take you to all before the Academic Senate,"
I will cause that they expel to you...
"By charity, Cicchirini, we do not begin, will have been the echo."
"Make me case, you will not regret..."
Damn Ah... is.
"-Sir, want to come in?"
"-Yes, thanks."
Because this property is sold.
And any trespasser will be executed.
You get that baby.
Yes.
Excuse me Vishal.
But our film's just begun.
Oh!
Let the film's begun... then the hero's got to hold the heroine's hand.
Leave my hand Vishal.
Oh so sweet.
Or else?
Move.
Move.
Move.
I hit him.
Watch out.
Shiv are you okay?
Ankita this is a big problem.
The real problem will start when brother finds out.
Come on.
Come on keep walking.
Why bring us here sir?
I tried explaining nicely but you wouldn't listen.
If you go against Minister Pradhan and... roam around like a big oaf you'll be put down like a dog.
There's just one way to save yourselves.
Kill me and escape.
Don't try to run from death.
People have a wrong notion about death.
Its life that makes you suffer.
Garbage cleared.
My record's also cleared.
Mr. Pradhan your job's done.
"- I love you too, sweetie."
What's up...?
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?
You missed her talent show.
"No, I didn't miss it."
"That's, like, next Thursday."
"No, it was last Thursday."
It was on the school calendar.
What did she do?
She was a flag twirler.
That's a talent?
"She practised for like six weeks, John."
She thought you were gonna be there.
It would've been really nice to have a bit of a reminder.
"- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John."
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.
"Look, I'm just-"
- I'm trying.
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.
"It's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?"
Have a good day.
Are you mad at me?
Just tell me.
Will you be on that all day long?
"""Yes."" Well, that sucks, because, you know, I thought you would want this, but..."
- Lame.
You don't even know what it is.
Do you really think a bribe's gonna work?
Yeah.
I'm hoping so.
"- We're both adults here, John."
"♪ Weaving the good life for you, sugar ♪"

[sighs]
"So, what can I do for you?"
"Well, I really need to talk to Topher in person."
- I called a bunch of times.
- Yeah.
He didn't know what it was about.
The hotel.
We had a deal.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
I got the good people of Venice to support the hotel development.
You remember.
"Come on, man."
You were there.
"And in exchange, Topher was gonna... well, I think I was gonna get a house."
[chuckles] A house?
Topher promised you a house?
"Well, not in so-- I know that that's what he meant."
"Look, all you did was... placate a community pressure group."
It was just PR.
[faint chiming]
You know what?
Why don't we just call it an even ten thou and we won't darken each other's doors again?
That's not gonna happen.
"Hey, I went to bat for you guys."
Okay?
I betrayed--
I upset a lot of good people who trusted me.
It's not right to do that and get nothing in return.
You owe me.
-But it's a scientist.
-And what's his name?
-Doctor Yansky.
Hallo.
This is attendant Zero.
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
I repeat.
"This is attendant zero, barrier 173."
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
You caused this.
What a mission!
-You are an interplanetary bungler.
-Let it go.
"Look, everybody drives, but we are going on foot."
This way we will never look like people.
-And would you like it?
"-Well... they are better, prettier."
Look at me.
Never in my life have I looked better.
"In contrast to it, out there at home, how do we look?"
It's better not to speak about it!
The ridiculous antennae.
Horror!
"I'm telling you, I'm considering whether or not to stay like this."
All right.
Normally we look hideous.
That's a fact.
On the other hand we can travel where we want.
Yoohoo!
Come for a ride!
All over space.
And that's a fact too.
"Marcus Zerbib, you know him?"
He wasn't a friend.
You two were in business.
Some nasty gossips say he snitched on you 4 years ago.
The guys he snitched on would fill the phone book.
"But only you could gun him down in cold blood, during a leave from jail."
Would I waste him when I have 2 weeks left to do?
"What's wrong, Leo?"
"- Nothing, why?"
- Don't kid me.
"You're lost, I can tell."
"I'm in deep shit, and I can't discuss it."
Not even with me?
Not even with you.
- Where were you that night?
- With a cop.
HQ's finest cop.
"We met at ""Swann's"""
"at 1 AM, we chewed the fat till 5 AM, then he dropped me at my hotel."
OK?
His name?
Vrinks.
I'll need your boys.
What for?
We located the van gang.
How'd you get the tip?
Know a man called Silien?
Why?
Says he was with you when Zerbib died.
"If he says so, must be true."
Could I have that in writing?
Investigating murders now?
"Yeah, tell me about it."
That's my wife Olivia.
"Awesome, bone structure."
- She's lovely.
- Glad you think so.
We were hoping you'd join us for a drink back at our place.
"And your wife, is she okay with that?"
"My wife is an Erinys, a Fury."
I wouldn't flirt if she didn't give me say so.
"In fact, you're her choice, and I wholeheartedly agree."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"Girl, are you a Succubus or a succu-bust?"
A rebound screw is the greatest way to get over a guy.
-It's just science.
- I told you.
I never cared that much about Dyson anyway.
My place.
Let's go.
It's coming ...
We're gonna need a safe word.
Gold star for Kenzi.
Rebound sex was exactly what I needed.
Why do you look like you're not at all sharing this monster hangover?
What can I say?
"For me, sexual healing is a literal thing."
I hate you.
And there's no strings attached.
- That was the best idea you ever had.
- You're very welcome.
And you're back.
Congratulations!
She's a great...
Yes.
I've heard so much about you.
- Likewise about you.
- We all ought to...
"Had I known you were this good-looking,"
I'd have answered the ad for myself.
Congratulations.
She's the best.
"If I were a man, I'd be all over her."
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll both be very fascinating to watch.
"Rose, isn't it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years?"
- I know what you mean.
- I can't believe it.
And the dust!
This place needs a good cleaning.
We'll take care of that.
I made room for your books.
Need any help?
Everything's put in its place.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.
To sleep...
"In order to sleep, you go to the bed for sleeping."
- Unless you want to do something else.
- What?
I wasn't going to say anything.
Do you want the bathroom first?
"- No, I can wait."
"- No, you go."
Like you give a fuck.
- You never even asked me why.
- Because I don't care.
Think you're the only one who's ever screwed up?
"Well, boo-hoo-hoo, Tommy."
"Life sometimes sucks and that's that, but not all of us have so much self-pity we need to kill ourselves."
How the fuck would you know?
With your head stuck up your arse all day!
How the fuck would I know?
"'Cause I'm standing on a bridge in the middle of fuck knows where, covered in cow shit, fighting a fat, old Irishman dressed in a kimono."
And all because his daughter hates him and seems to quite like me.
Come on.
Budge up.
"Come on, now."
Come on.
Here.
For fuck's sake.
Hey!
Where are you going?
"Eh, Paul, wait!"
"Wait, you fucker."
Wait for me.
- You can forget about tomorrow.
- Good.
- Find some other poor fucker.
I won't be there.
- So?
- Fuck you!
"- No, fuck you!"
"Tommy, you're an arsehole."
Tommy?
"That's so childish, mate."
Helen:
Okay.
Are you really serious about this?
"I told your dad, Grandpa was gone, but now you coming into our lives and digging up this case, well, that was the last time"
"Dad and Duval were ever civil to each other, so now I think he might still be here."
"Just holding on, something left to do."
All right.
Come on.
Both of you.
Fingers on.
[Sighs]
Thank you.
Close your eyes.
"Sheriff James Pritchard, if you are here, make your presence known."
James Pritchard.
Are you with us?
[Door slams]
You.
Outside.
Right now.
[Door opens]
They sure do this a lot.
Maybe they like it.
"When we were kids, your grandpa would take your dad out there when he was in trouble."
I can't imagine Dad in trouble.
Yeah.
They'd stand there just... like that.
Duval:
Why are you here?
I told you to stay away from my house.
You'd only come if you had leverage.
I'd only come?
"- Hello, Jeanne."
- Hello.
May I ask why you're in such a good mood?
We're happy to see our favourite manager.
Good.
You'll smile less when you see the Décopril figures.
We'll have to be more... aggressive and tenacious!
Danou wants you.
- Now?
- It's urgent.
- Sounds like trouble up there.
- I'll go.
Get started.
"HIS SPRING, HER WINTER"
Come in.
"Hello, Jeanne."
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat.
Sit down.
"I'm listening, Maillet."
I'll be straight.
The parent company's made a decision.
"Staff at the south-west branch is being reduced, and..."
"- ""And""?"
- 10 jobs are going.
- That many?
"- Yes, 10."
"Under the circumstances, it's the only way to keep the branch running after the heavy losses, due to generic drugs."
"""Heavy losses""."
"Don't exaggerate, Hugues."
Latest results aren't...
Right.
"She's, um-- she's doing all right."
Thanks for asking.
"Now, who's gonna bring me back some candy?"
- I will!
- Yeah!
"Hey, tell your mom you get to eat as much as you can fit in your mouth."
- [Laughs]
- Right.
You guys have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
See you when you get back.
- Look at you.
- Restaurant tricks.
Impressive.
[Marching band music] 25 members...
Look at these chumps.
"Are you kidding, man?"
Parade detail is great.
"Peter Mills, hold your arm up."
Now keep it there for five hours.
That's what being in the parade is.
"Mills, the shriners-- they throw out candy-- you clean up, man."
"Now, listen, I know you guys are gonna give me crap for this."
Go on.
[Sighs]
I want to start a podcast.
What the hell's that?
"Well, when I record myself being equal parts charming and brilliant, and then I put it up on iTunes, and people subscribe, and they follow me."
A mute would be better at that than you.
[Laughter]
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
John!
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
$%#!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
John?
"Yes, but..."
"Don't bother about us, lvy, dear."
"- Oh, Marcia!"
- Oh.
For Miss Ivy Peterson.
"Thanks, governor."
Look.
Fifty pounds.
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?
He must have sent it for what he's done.
"No, not him."
"He's too mean, he is."
"Oh, I don't know."
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.
"Yes, that's it."
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.
"Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can."
"And then, then he'll follow me."
"And just when I think that I've got free, he'll..."
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it.
"Oh, if I could only do it I'd go down to the river."
"Oh, lvy."
"It's her nerves, that's what."
She ought to see a doctor.
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.
I know because I saw it there.
What's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head?
"What's the sense of my taking a trip, acquiring art and culture if you're not going to pay attention?"
Binding over boyfriend is key.
- Here's some water.
"- Great, she'll need some."
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I have some mints.
I'll leave them here.
"I'm okay, I just..."
- I gotta get back to work.
"- No, you go home."
I'll put you in a cab.
Here you go.
"- She's sick, buddy."
Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?
Listen.
"Go home, cuddle up and get some rest."
Youve gotta take better care.
You're working too hard.
- Come on.
"- Thank you so much, Paul."
"See you on Monday on Romeo and Juliette, okay?"
Slamming into the windshield won't win you any... model contract.
This is Resin... telling you to buckle up because safety is so in fashion...
What?
"I can see the dresses have arrived for Juliette... beautiful, sensuous, feminine."
"Thanks, Dianne, you are a goddess."
"Remember, child:"
Life is love and love is life.
"Whining, yet charming."
New York subway in the summer.
Meteorology: 112 degrees.
If I didn't know better....
"-We're off the record here, Albert."
-We're off the record?
It's Tony.
What?
Am I wrong?
Honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
Exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack Ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on line to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'll wait in the car.
"Well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
Really?
That is so sweet.
"Also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
You'll cripple her!
She was swimming when I came.
Swimming?
Don't cry.
- The yokel.
What is it you want?
"I'm a miller's apprentice, I'm looking for work."
I mean for a roof over my head...
Where did you work last?
Here and there and everywhere!
"I know who he is, Froggy!"
"I heard you need a helper, so I came."
"We do, but are you any good?"
You don't look like a hard worker to me.
But I am!
And I can sing and dance!
"It's him, I smellt him, it's him!"
- You wait!
- You...
Haven't we met before?
You look familiar.
Impossible.
"We have a new helper, what do you think?"
"Why, daddy?"
I can get my work done.
I don't want a stranger around.
"Beautiful E- er, you'd work herself to death you need a helper I can do all sons of things,"
you won't be sorry.
All right.
We'll give him a try.
"There's plenty to do, even with our two helpmates."
"A devil and watersprite, like in every real mill."
- He doesn't know about it?
- No.
- He's my old friend.
- Right.
I need you to help to talk her out of it.
Just like a breast intervention.
How am I supposed to bring this up?
That's okay.
I'll think of something.
You always think of something.
I don't know.
Is everything else good in your life?
- Be honest with me.
- Hmm?
"For the first time in over a quarter of a century, tell me something that's really bugging you."
I have nothing to confide.
You have experienced a lot you have not shared.
"You've mentioned this to me that I don't confide in you,"
- and there's nothing to confide.
- You haven't confided in me
- in your entire life.
- How could you say...
- Hey!
- Hi!
- Hey.
- Uncle Richard!
Look at you from top to bottom.
"What a doll, huh?"
"- Oh, baby."
- Hi.
This is my fake niece Kim.
Larry David.
Mom taught me.
Your mother was a great student.
She'd be...
I want to go back to the circus.
I want to go home.
Let's get Quico out of bed.
I'll take you to the beach.
"No, I want to go home."
Eat your bread.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Do you see anything?
I'mjust looking.
"Maria, when you're back in the circus someday, can you take me along?"
I want to see you walk the tightrope.
"Look, Marcia."
I made this for you.
It's beautiful.
It used to be my favorite toy.
"Whenever it rained hard, I set it in the water to watch it float down the gutter."
I stared as it floated away.
Take me to the circus.
What about your mother?
She can't tell me what to do anymore.
Going back still scares me.
Maybe it's best if I keep as a painter.
You're an artist.
You belong in the circus.
"Young man, I regret to inform you that this love will not last."
"How do you know, mom?"
Have you ever truly loved someone?
"Mom, dad!"
Anything I can do?
"No, thanks, Frank."
[GUNFIRE]
They'll be blasting it open pretty soon.
"Stacey, the riot's a bust."
Get back in your cell while there's still a chance.
"No, won't do me no good now, kid."
"I still got that Limpy rap hanging over me, even though it was-- [EXPLOSION]"
It wasn't my job.
I wouldn't appear against you.
I know it.
"It's no use, Frank."
This is the last roundup for Stacey.
[GUNSHOTS]
But there's still that unfinished business of yours to take care of.
It's still okay.
Where's Polecat?
Over there.
I wanna talk to him.
Didn't I tell ya I had a surprise for ya?
Come on.
I ain't got no time to waste.
"Funny, just an hour ago, I had 199 years."
And now I ain't got no time at all.
I'll get the rat.
[GUNSHOTS]
We got an affidavit from Shake Edwards before I came back in here.
What about those guys who framed me?
Did you get them?
Yeah.
"Well, rat."
So it caught up with you.
"Russian, Polish, I've got no idea."
Everybody's having a good time.
How did he get this off the wall?
I think the girls will hold out for quite a while.
"Let's do ""Russian Nights"" then."
We could do whatever we want.
They're really good!
"Good then, we'll have ""Russian nights""."
It doesn't exist?
There is no quiz show.
But you showed it to me?
That was just a starting point.
The starting point was good.
What a night!
"If you ask me, I personally prefer classical music."
You've been pouring the beer really well lately.
Lately?
I'm serious.
I'm heading out.
Then of course there are the fjords.
Wasn't that Norway?
They're everywhere up there.
Everywhere?
Everywhere.
"It's all one big fjord up there, if you ask me."
"Green, green, green."
And water.
Really.
You can believe it.
"Lucy, I just need five minutes of your time for my new client."
"Oh, my gosh, she look ridiculous."
"Lawrence, I hate to be blunt."
"Maybe it's my age or my inability to be coy anymore in my life, but are you gay?"
"I mean, it's fine."
I have a son who's gay and I am a proud member of PFLAG.
- Are you... disappointed?
- No.
I'm curious.
I'm...
Why...?
Why date women?
I love women!
"I love their companionship, their friendship."
"I just want someone to go to museums, parties, take dancing."
Does that sound pathetic?
No.
"No, it sounds very familiar."
"If you want to call it a night, I'd understand."
"No, Lawrence."
Absolutely not.
We haven't eaten.
I'm starving to death.
You want to share an order of edamame with me?
- What time did you tell the sitter?
"- Twelve, latest."
It's 10:30 now.
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, God!"
Is that vomit?
I don't want to get close enough to confirm or deny.
This is the worst date night ever.
It's Betsy.
"Hey Betsy, what's up?"
"They're cops,jody."
What is she doing here?
I called her.
She should know what's going on.
"Well,it's coming out of your profits,bob."
"Wait a minute,jody."
That sisal's expensive.
"You need to calm down,mrs.Carvell."
Calm down?
I just found a dead guy in the living room and I am losing money every day.
"Ohand my father just died of leukemia, so don't you tell me to calm down."
"I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe we should rub some vick's under our noses."
I don't think we'll find a body.
Hope not.
Hate that.
Nothing?
"Well,whatever lance corporal finn was planning on putting in here, he didn't get a chance to."
"Mcgee,give me your flashlight."
You didn't bring your own?
It's too heavy.It pulls my pants down.
Now close the door.
To the right.To the right.
Yeah.
"Just,more to the left.More to the left."
-Okay.
"-Okay,hold it."
Yeah.
too small to hold a body.
Big enough to hold a head.
Is that what I think it is?
"Oh,yes."
Gold.
"I know it's rough, man."
"I get it, you know?"
"He's your best friend and all, and you miss him like hell."
"But know this, he will never apologize to you."
- And he will never say that you're right.
"- I appreciate the concern, George."
I really do.
It's funny.
I always thought you didn't like me.
"Point is, you gotta stay strong."
We can't enable.
We gotta wait until the right time to let a person like that back in our life.
[yelps] Oh!
Shit!
[mutters] Fuck.
[knocking on door]
- Hi!
"- Hey, man."
"What's up, man?"
"Come on in, I was about to put a pot of coffee--"
"Oh, buddy, are you all right?"
You look a little torn up.
Yeah.
First time I've been in town and just-- kind of a lot of feelings and--
"Like, a big hole's opened up."
"Yeah, I guess."
You want some tape or something for that?
"Oh, yeah."
"No, if by ""something"" you mean a clean pair of pants?"
- I didn't realize we were winking.
"- Yeah, dude, we're winking."
Oh!
And you know it.
"You see, that's where you're wrong, mr."
Enright.
"So, what are you saying?"
You going to do a better job than the world-famous lapd?
If any of these crime scene photos would have shown
"Who took that cuff link,"
I think someone would have noticed by now.
Somebody did notice.
"Eric, take a look at this."
It's the same lady in every one of these photos.
Yes.
Watch this.
"Bang, bang, bang."
That's her again.
She's got...
She's got a camera.
"Eric, she can help us."
"h, in a city as big as l.A.,"
How are we going to find one girl?
This is how.
She's got a press pass.
Olivia burch.
Excuse me.
Captain sutter.
"Enjoying your lunch, lieutenant?"
"Yes, as a matter of fact we are."
"We're doing what we came to los angeles to do, captain."
Then you know you're wasting your time.
That's called clean police work.
Are you suggesting I'm not clean?
"I guess we're about to find out, captain."
Wait!
Those beautiful days of childhood.
"50 years later, the Nobel laureate Adam Bernau wrote in Volume One of the Memoirs, page 63, ""I was dreaming about discoveries that could improve the life of the entire human race."""
I'd like to emphasize that I don't agree.
It's pointless.
There is no other way.
Get ready...
We're going.
Helicopter!
Maximum alert!
"This is gonna cost you a lot, pal!"
- Where do you think that car was?
- There.
"I saw it, but then it drove off that way."
And what happened to the hut?
It just collapsed all by itself?
Look!
Rum!
It's worse than that.
It's brandy.
- But I... please...
- We know!
I'm impressed!
"The car only used up 30% energy,"
Instead of the allowed 70%.
Thanks to you!
- I'll remember that!
"- And you wanted to return, remember?"
"- Well, yeah."
"I'll never forgive you, you understand?"
Unless...
"So, what is it?"
In what way?
"Well, you know, she and I would get going, and, uh, you know, there was never any middle ground."
It just would always end up being an all-out war.
And it never accomplished anything.
"It would just end up leading... well, you know where it led."
You lost her.
Are you afraid that you might lose Erica?
I don't know.
I--I don't understand.
"I mean, I don't even know what that was in there."
I was not a good father.
"And I'm aware of that,"
But I am a good therapist.
"Yes, but even the best therapists miss things."
What?
"Just tell me, then."
What is the connection here?
"You know, why am I having the same fight with Erica"
That I used to have with my daughter?
Only one way to find out.
Stop it!
Sarah.
Let go of me!
Sarah!
"Forget it, dad, I'm never coming home!"
"Sarah, wait."
Wait!
I just wanna talk to you.
"Yeah, well, you never listen to me."
There's no point.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
"This time, I will listen."
"- No, that was..."
"- I love ""Dawson's Creek."""
Listen to me.
I'm so happy.
And I think I just got worried that this part wouldn't work.
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen this in a while.
"Emma, I can't wait to see this."
"I know, but things are different, you know?"
They're a little wider and longer.
You think this isn't different?
"- Come on, man."
"- Look at this, look at this."
That wasn't there before.
That's something to grab onto.
Get your hands in there.
"Get a hold of that, see?"
"- All right, all right."
- How about this...
This mole here?
"That's new, that's interesting."
You should get that checked out.
"And, I'm sorry, check out these chicken legs, right?"
I'm just going straight chicken leg situations.
It's a two-piece meal.
"So yeah, it's different."
"But have you ever thought that it might be... much, much better?"

"Mags, mark and I did it!"
We did the sex!
We're talking about the perfect dream of a school.
- Okay.
- Animals instead of science.
Chickens and mice and iguanas.
"This is pretend, right?"
"No, angel, this is real."
I am going to find you a school with trees and frogs and eggs to gather.
"And maybe just a little bit of math, because you do need that, too."
"But... not too much, okay?"
It's Auntie Mara.
Can I say hello?
Of course.
"I miss you, Auntie Mara."
"I miss you to smithereens, little one."
Are they torturing you to make me do an interview?
With hot needles.
"Tell them three minutes, no questions about Tom, and, I'll call it an exclusive, tell the rest of the world to suck eggs."
- Mommy!
Language!
- Acceptable!
Borderline.
I'm on my way.
- But after I make these cookies.
"- Okay, bye."
This tough cookie.
You...
Maybe we should just eat the batter.
That's my favorite part.
What do you think?
"Hey, Ruby Tuesday."
It's me.
Come in.
Does anybody want coffee?
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.
Would you like cappuccinos?
"Greg, why don't you help me?"
- Why don't you put the coffee on?
- I made dinner.
You put it on.
"I've raised two daughters, buried a husband, I've made my coffee."
Alone at last.
I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.
- Oh.
You've been seeing a lot of my daughter.
I hope you don't mind my asking...
What are your intentions?
My intentions?
What a lovely meal!
You're a good cook.
- I didn't oversell myself?
"- Not at all, but the trouble..."
Of course I had to go to that trouble.
It was your birthday.
"What are friends for, but to give each other presents and stuff..."
Happy birthday.
Open it up!
I really hope you like it.
- Dice?
- They once were dice.
"- Now, they're cuff links with..."
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing without Jeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care of Jenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
This hallowed home of ours... we hold sacred
Here we dreamt our dreams
Like a prayer in a temple
Like a ray from the skies
Here we find succor
"Yes, sir."
What are those things?
What?
Those things moving up and down.
Oil rigs.
"When those things are moving up and down, it means times are good."
Looks like times are good.
Shoot.
We must have left some of them back in Florida.
Left what?
I packed a couple of boxes with socks and things.
I could've sworn --
"Jimmy, did you find that one box?"
"Oh, no."
"It's okay, Mom."
"Don't worry, honey."
We'll find it.
I've never known a boy to get so upset about losing his socks.
His glove was in there.
His what?
His glove was in there.
"Oh, quit moping and grab a box."
Did you hear me?
There are more important things in life than baseball.
"The sooner you figure that out, the better."
"This Lee Ivaco-cocus guy,"
"I guarantee you, within two years, three years tops, he's gonna run that company right out of business."
"Ain't that right, young man?"
Eileen?
Eileen!
I guess she gone to lunch.
"Help you find something, son?"
You're fine?
You haven't seen Violet since she got home.
"You live with her for six months, now you won't even pick up a clean shirt?"
You won't talk about it.
Like you talk about you getting fired?
"I'm doing my job, Cooper..."
the one I have left.
My problems aren't getting in the way of that.
I have a patient.
"Echo is now a grand old matriarch, her crossed tusks make her unmistakable."
Hello.
"Violet, you're there."
Yeah.
"Well, that's how the telephone works."
You call people.
They answer.
You speak.
Right.
"Uh, look, I was just calling to remind you that if Lucas can't sleep, give him the sheep toy."
"And he likes the rain sound, but not the whale calls."
"Uh, well, nobody likes the whale calls."
They're eerie.
You're checking up on me.
Yeah.
I was hoping you'd be out.
"Well, Lucas is sleeping now, so, uh, I better go."
You know what they say...
sleep while the baby sleeps.
The Larsens?
My Larsens?
Yeah.
"Well, my Larsens now."
"I think about my father, about my mother."
I'm searching in the mud.
- Don't you want to look at me?
- It's difficult.
Tough day?
Was it easier with the gangster's woman?
It was just a reflex.
She loved me.
So one has to be in love to reflect?
It's better for the other one.
- The neighbor?
- Up above.
Do you mean God?
Could it be just the two of us for two minutes?
It'd be too sad.
"But everything's sad, open your eyes!"
I can't see.
"I can see into, but not..."
"And how am I, into?"
Young.
Would you like to visit?
"I can be just as cheap a tart as your tramp, you know!"
No you can't.
You enjoy that?
"You really are fucked up, friend of a friend!"
It's André!
"André, meet my friend of a friend, Léo."
André is a man on the move.
"He's moving in Mom, who's moving him up."
"Forget sweet talk, when it comes to whoring, I'm his bet."
"""But once in America, what will we do?"
"""Monsieur de la Fayette will provide you with instructions!"""
We'll be moving the patients out as quickly as we can.
There is no bomb.
It's Haskell DeBray.
This is how he works.
I will not leave her side.
Come along now.
Hey!
Second floor!
The cops want to talk to you!
What do you want?
- Where's DeBray?
- I don't know.
"He came by to say hello, and then he took off."
That's not his apartment?
Why would I be in his apartment?
Should I sing you a lullaby?
Like your little boy never heard from you?
Help!
Help!
No!
Why don't you talk to her?
Why don't you find out why she's been stalking me?
"Why were you at the hospital, Mrs. Price?"
I'm a news producer.
I go where the story is.
Is he clear to go?
"Yeah, I'll discharge him."
Good.
"In that case, Haskell DeBray, you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Mimi Halderman."
You have the right to remain silent...
I have no plans to remain silent.
But I'll only talk to one person.
"Dale, Baby."
What you do here?
Wow let me guess...
Baby's mama?
Did you just call me a baby?
Baby she didn't just call me a baby now did she?
What?
Don't screw with me slut!
Excuse me?
You don't know her do you JP?
Yeah baby.
This is Dale.
Not anymore you don't.
Bye bye.
This is my first bitch slap but seeing the look on her Botoxed face.
You deserve him!
"Totally makes it worth it,"
I like!
And he's going to put me in his next movie.
But isn't he kind of old?
Aren't you going to have to you know...
Do him?
Probably.
Oh God!
If I have to stand here and listen to this bimbo yap about the blowjob she'll have to give to get a movie part.
I'll pee in my pants.
Um excuse me...
We're in line.
"Um, actually you're at the mirror which doesn't really constitute the line."
Well just go... fine.
I'll give you my number and then you know maybe we can hang out sometime?
You gonna give me your number?
No soldiers or militiamen.
- And the people who live here?
- They've fled.
The bastards' last visit must have convinced them to find a better place.
I'm picking up radio messages about troop movement along the border.
All right.
Drive on.
- I'm sorry that we have to say goodbye now.
- We'll meet again.
"- Goodbye, Mariá."
- Goodbye.
- Come on.
- I want to stay with Mariá.
No.
You're going with Padre Julio.
You're staying with him for a while.
"As soon as this war is over, we'll be together again."
I promise.
"Come on, Pablito."
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Don't drink so much Communion wine.
- We have a lot to do.
- It might be a small regiment.
They get scared when you say boo!
They're cowards.
Something must have happened.
They were talking about Ramírez.
It must be important.
Listen for as long as you can.
See you at the pass.
"You should go to Alexanderplatz, this is no place for trading."
"Do you wanna go to another pub, Franz?"
Please?
Stay calm.
Just wait and see!
Buy this really genuine piece!
Why does the wealthy man in the west wear a bow and the yobbo doesn't?
Ladies and gentlemen!
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Come closer!
Guys do you want me to sing the tie song?
Maybe Mr Biederkopf will now sing something for us.
"Alright, alright."
What could we sing?
"Band, what tunes can you play?"
"How about... ""Ich hatte einen Kameraden""?"
Who do you think we are?
A new pub for Mr Biberkopf.
What's up?
"The Mister seeks a new pub, this one isn't swell enough."
- Get off the table!
- Says who?
Me!
I'll pay for the glasses.
"Well Biberkopf, there was no need to terrify my customers."
"Come on Cilly, I know what's going on here."
- Let's go this way!
"- No, we go this way."
"Come on please, let's go this way."
- No!
We'll go this way.
"Come on, let's go!"
Now.
"I can't, sweetheart, we've got a plane to catch."
"Oh, every time we're close, I feel something good is about to happen."
You've got to be...
You said you didn't want to see my face or hear my voice.
I can't think in there.
"Well, it wasn't my voice."
I thought you'd keep him in check.
I thought I could depend on you.
"- Well, Cari told Bob..."
- That she's going to Brazil...
Please.
"Jon, please."
I'm two cases short.
What?
You gotta be kidding.
You know that baby food was on the way to the lab.
It was contaminated with botulism.
I know.
I probably lost them when I got this.
I gotta make a phone call.
Four were crouched behind their car.
"It was just me and my bike against four men, two. 45s and two sawed-offs."
"I pulled my gun, grabbed my mike and called for backup."
Then they opened fire.
I was hit by a bullet.
"Oh, I hurt real bad."
I went down.
I got up and I got hit on this side...
"Oh, you girls..."
I was speaking very low.
Baker.
What do you say?
Sit down.
"- How they treating you, Rocky?"
- Like a prince.
I get three square meals and real butter on my bread.
What a life.
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad.
Just a few stitches.
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?
"Rocky, I've been worrying about this all last night."
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
"- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?"
Now get this.
"You got away, didn't you?"
Okay.
I wanna be a sucker.
"But, Rocky, maybe if they thought I was in on it, they'd go easier on you."
In a pig's eye.
"Just because you can run faster, you don't gotta eat yourself."
"- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky."
"- Look, so they send me up."
So what?
What've I got to lose?
The old man's got troubles enough without me.
Forget it.
"I got caught, and you got away."
"But you, Rocky."
"Supposing I was the one who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet."
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?
(ALL SCREAMING)
Lady.
"Hey, lady, you okay?"
(SOBBING)
"Yeah, they're gone, it's okay."
How can I ever thank...
You're one of them!
(SCREAMING)
"Not her type, I guess."
Maybe it's the eyes.
Or the fangs.
Well?
I'm feeling so...
NOAH:
I see.
Sunlight has no effect on you.
Extraordinary.
So you're a Daywalker. I never really thought they existed.
I'm a human being.
BLADE:
Why did you help me?
"Well, it's not every vampire that would apologize to his victims."
You were there?
"Well, after all, lam a vampire hunter."
I know their feeding grounds.
I hate this.
Every day I have to live with these cravings is a day too long.
But I've got a score to settle before I can leave this world behind.
Must be important for you to prolong a life you so detest.
Have you ever come across or heard of a vampire known as the Man with Four Fangs?
"No, I can't say that I have."
He killed my mother.
Then I get to come too - it's in the rules.
Hit me.
"Your honour, there have now been two very similar murders and I think it's quite probable they were both committed by the same person."
We agree.
Hm?
"Oh, good."
"Yeah, it's pretty obvious the Crim did this too."
Let's charge him...
For murder!
Two time.
You have a good point.
How can he have a point?
Crim was in jail at the time of the murder?
You have a good point.
"Yeah, I have a good point."
How can Crim have done it?
"It's called shape shifting, your honour."
Something that's pretty darn easy to do.
"In fact, in the big city we do it all the time."
No they don't.
That's crazy.
"Yeah, look, I'm getting taller,"
I'm getting shorter.
"I'm getting taller, I'm getting shorter."
I'm getting shorter.
He's just standing on his toes.
I'm getting taller.
He's standing on his toes.
Ohhh...
"Counsellors, you have both made very compelling arguments."
He didn't.
So let me deliberate.
Let's get back to the 'Beast'!
How will I benefit if I succeed?
You'll become a nameless hero.
I said how will I benefit?
The League of Nations will thank you!
What benefit is that to me?
The whole world will love you!
That means I don't benefit at all!
More than that.
There's half a million!
- Japanese Yen?
- American dollar!
American dollar?
Where do I find the American?
Cafe Casablanca.
Take him to Room 44 here.
What does he look like?
Wearing a white suit and a pink rose.
"When you see him, just say:"
You want woman?
Worth's half a million.
"And he'll reply, 'Get some sort of toys'!"
Good. I'll go first!
"- Hold on, I'll go first!"
- Why?
So that I don't have to pay.
Tips?
"Book says don't give anything today, especially tips."
What a miser!
White suit and pink rose?
What a coincidence!
"Mister, you want woman?"
Driven.
So let's meet up tonight.
9PM.
Alright.
I am really in a hurry.
See you bro.
Okay.
"This work is from my friend, Lisa."
She's having a gallery exhibition in New York.
Extremely urgent.
And this is part of her exhibition.
It's installation art.
And it needs some retouching.
Everything needs to be done quickly.
It's so urgent that I thought of you first.
"On this planet, no one but you could finish it in time."
Day 1
You have 2 weeks.
But you must send an update every day.
And Lisa will give you her feedback right the way.
No problem.
Kai.
"But this job, you must do solo."
Because she is very paranoid about her work leaking.
"If you can do this job, the Shibuya job Jerd did will pale in comparison."
"When you're done, let's go to New York together."
Day 2
"Yes, Peng?"
I sent you the feedback for the previous lot already.
Is this lot done?
Not yet.
Why are you so slow?
"All right, y'all, it's almost time for the mele, the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
The special blend.
"Yes, this is a magical drink."
You know what?
I'm gonna go get a good spot for the show.
Do you guys wanna come?
"No, no, we're good here."
Okay.
You're fine?
Okay.
And then there was two.
"Listen, I want you to come back with me."
I'm not going back to the other side with you.
"I'm gonna stay right here, get my celebration on and get another margarita made up in my face."
I came a long way to find you.
"Well, I know you ain't come to get a drink."
You damn sure ain't come to dance.
So what'd you follow me here for?
No.
I did.
"I came here to drink, party, scratch records, do it all!"
Do it...
It's just...
Just...
Just...
You know?
What am I saying?
I don't want to do any of those things.
Truth is that I'm exhausted just saying them.
"All right, y'all, it's time for the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
"Cynthia, hi."
Excuse me.
You've seen that old knife Eric always has?
Maybe.
"Certainly, as far as weapons go, it's worthless."
"When I look at him, I wonder why is he trying to survive as long as he can?"
I have a feeling I might understand.
There's no need to ask.
The job of the hunter is not to protect.
But he exists to protect someone.
Who are you trying to protect by going after him?
Good Lord.
The coffee's gone ice cold.
I'm a silly old fool.
Forgive me for going on like that.
"How about a cup, young lady?"
"My special blend's pretty good, you know."
Go on.
It will do you good.
"Stop calling me ""young lady."""
The name's Makoto.
"All right, fair enough."
"As long as you promise not to call me a boring, old cont."
What is that?
I have no idea!
What is it?
Why all the ruckus?
MAN:
Mandurugo.
"Mandurugo, what are they?"
Winged vampires native to the Philippines.
Aim for the heart!
Make each shot count!
These silver bullets aren't cheap!
"Oh, good for you."
Not really what I expected.
"Well, who is, huh?"
"You, for example."
No one had you down for such a cunt.
I see.
"90,000 Euros for this gentleman here, 95!"
95 thousand Euros here!
"Now, do I see one hundred thousand Euros?"
Get it out!
One hundred thousand Euros!
One hundred thousand Euros!
Gone to the man in the fine spectacles and now to the most coveted soprano in the world!
You got him to talk yet?
It won't be long now.
Mrs. Clios...
Are we nearly there?
We'll wait until the Service gates open.
Enter the property from both sides.
Hello.
Are you crying?
No.
So?
Boy trouble?
Not exactly.
Why don't you come back to the party?
Your brother's doing a very fine job.
I just lost out a dance with a beautiful woman.
"Maybe, I could have one with you."
"No, thank you."
Hmm.
"Well, surely there is something we can do to cheer you up."
- What will I break?
- The head.
Now go to the shrine and pray.
- Shall I pray for something for you?
- Go ahead.
- Shall I pray for a wife for you?
- A wife?
All right.
Even if the wife is 60 years old she should have wealth amounting to one-fourth of 56 crore rupees!
56 crores?
is that all?
Move it now!
Come on!
You speak as if you are a King!
"Do you know, Pooja?"
First you will have to meet my brother at home.
"If my brother approve of you, it will mean everything's okay!"
What if your brother doesn't approve?
"Then you look for another boy, and I will look for another girl."
You are so scared of your brother?
I am not scared. I adore him!
You don't realize what a big person my brother is!
- 6 feet 2 inches.
- l am not talking of his height.
- His chest is 42 inches.
Right?
- You are right!
"I have flicked this jacket from him. lt's great, isn't it?"
That's why it's so loose-fitting on you.
- What did you say?
Loose-fitting?
- Yes!
"-Yeah, right."
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.
"""Have your ex-wife move in."
"That wouldn't be awkward."""
"Imagine, I go away for a few days.."
and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.
"So, what'd you tell him?"
You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in?
She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
"Plus, she got me taffy."
-Really?
I've never had any.
-Ever?
My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will.
I want to butter her up first.
"I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff."
When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
"If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady."
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?
Is it gum?
Is it food?
What's the deal?
"Oh, it's nice."
May I try a pink one?
So I just have to plan the perfect night.
"Hey, what's the best date you ever had?"
"But with some sound advice and the proper introduction, who knows?"
I'll tell you one thing.
You've got the right product.
"Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big of bunch, you are on to something special."
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Full for thought, yeah?"
"So, if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make,"
Better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
"That's yours, right?"
What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
"Yeah, another one right over there."
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on.
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just wanna get high."
- I need your help.
- Oh.
You're not gonna handle this one on your own?
"You just couldn't help yourself, could you?"
"Sadly, no."
"Take Doug back to the loft, lock him down tight."
"- You can handle that, right?"
- Have I ever let you down?
"- Be careful, Fi."
"- Don't worry, Michael."
I never let my guard down.
What the hell do you mean you can't get ahold of her?
She doesn't have some kind of-
Yeah?
All right.
"Well, keep trying."
"Mike, she's in some kind of a meeting with a new client that just called this morning."
"I mean, it might be nothin'."
"It's not gonna be nothin', Sam."
- Hello.
"- Michael, if I had known... you were this much fun to work with..."
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'm glad one of us is having fun.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress, are you?"
"Michael, my son."
I'm afraid.
"Please, Michael."
Please.
- You changed.
- This is more my style.
"Oh, for crying out loud."
I'm not gonna shoot you here.
Agreeing to have sex with someone you haven't even met.
"Grace, what's going on?"
Where are you?
"Uh, at a hair salon."
"In fact, I-I have to go."
Bye.
"- It's Neil, right?"
"- Yes, Neil."
"Oh, he is gorgeous."
"Strong chin, warm eyes."
Whew.
I can almost taste him.
Adriana never sent anyone to meet me before.
Why now?
"Oh, it's just something we do for our most valued clients to ensure you have the most enjoyable experience."
I'm flattered.
"So give me a sense of what you're looking for, and how you envision your night with Neil."
Do you mean like the perfect date?
Sure.
Let's start there.
I want to fall in love.
It's not just about the sex.
It's about the before.
And the after.
"Lying there in messy sheets, drinking him in while he tells charming stories."
Running fingers through his hair as he soaks in a steaming hot bath.
You know.
Yes.
I think I do.
"This one, Adriana says is one of her best."
So I hear.
Neil.
Is that what I'm doing with Erica?
Making her decisions for her?
What do you think?
You can't deny the fact that Kai...
He has become a distraction.
Maybe he has.
But why does that preclude him from being a necessary part of Erica's journey?
Especially if she wants him to be?
How did you know when--when I was ready?
You knew.
And you let me know.
Thank you.
Fred?
Hey.
Cheers.
"So, what do they do to doctors who crash and burn?"
Same thing they do to doctors who quit.
I heard about that.
Yeah.
"Uh, not my finest moment."
Mmm.
"You know, this thing that we do, it's not easy."
No kidding.
I can't reach him.
I've tried everything I can think of.
Sometimes you need a little help.
I did.
"Yeah, well, no one's offered."
"Well, consider this an offer."
"Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna change anything,"
"But if you wanted me to,"
I'd be happy to give it a try.
"Think of island white as, um..."
Heroin on steroids.
Okay.
The bidding for U.S. distribution has now started.
"Ricardo Stancati, you're the casino's high roller."
You bid first.
What's your offer?
Charlie.
Angels have landed.
I've notified the Bahamian police.
"They're en route, but they're at least an hour away."
"From the satellite feed of the island,"
I've identified eight armed personnel.
Use extreme caution.
You need to find Bosley and Amanda.
"We won't let you down, Charlie."
"- Good luck, angels."
"- Thanks, Charlie."
"Thanks, Charlie."
"Thanks, Charlie."
Come on.
Nice house.
Being a bad guy certainly has its perks.
I spot one guard.
There could be more inside.
Let's go say hello.
"Well, here it is."
"What's the matter, Mr. Stancati?"
Make an offer.
That's why you're here.
Maybe his employers can't afford to pay.
I don't have that problem.
They sing the song too slow.
Slow?
"There are horses and a carriage, so they should sing it faster."
I'll handle it.
"It's a big problem, Daddy."
"I promise I'll handle this big problem, Goni."
Now can I have a good-night hug?
Daddy.
Get up.
What's wrong?
Your pills.
"Get up, do your exercises."
What did we say?
"10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the evening."
Well?
"Okay, okay."
Any messages for me?
"Someone called in the evening, but I said you were performing."
They didn't leave a message on your cell phone?
I didn't check.
It was a guy.
Goni.
You must have 5 minutes to sit with your father.
How many performances do you have this month?
"Three, four."
But I'm just an understudy.
I'm sure you're a better pianist than the one you substitute for.
How do you know?
I know.
Is it enough for the rent?
I put all your pills in the plastic box.
Goni.
This is probably just a somewhat hilarious misunderstanding.
- Yes!
- This isn't what's important.
What's important right now is that we have to go to the old schoolhouse before it's too late.
"[ pigeon cooing ] Well, I can't really tell you how you got that rash if I don't have more information."
"It was about two weeks ago and my old college buddy was in town, and..."
Oh!
"OK, OK."
- I don't want to hear that.
- All right.
"So guys, we're going to tear this place down now, or what?"
Oh!
No!
Go back to the rash.
"You were saying, ""two weeks ago... ""?"
"Yeah, my old college buddy, hadn't seen him in a while..."
"- No demolition today, boys."
- But why?
This is the future site of the new Mercy mosque.
Yes!
"You totally saved the day, Ann!"
Mayors!
[ A cell phone rings. ]
Oh!
Oh!
"Hey there, hot stuff!"
Oh!
Hang on.
"Rayyan, Amaar just got arrested for having a bomb."
Ha!
Ha!
Very funny.
I don't know about not telling Emma.
If I don't...
What if Miguel is right?
You said you don't want to stress Emma out.
You let me know if you find anything out.
"Maggie, hold up."
I trust Miguel.
He'll get this sorted out.
"Like deciding not to tell Emma, and then, swapping glances like you're teenage boys"
- getting away with things again?
- That's not what just happened.
"Look, I've raised Emma on my own since you left."
"I've made mistakes, but I didn't have any help."
- That's not fair.
You know I had to leave.
"- Now, you're back, and you think that you and Emma almost being killed"
"No, listen."
I
-Pragmatic.
"No, I did."
"No, you are."
I'm a realist.
-You are scared.
-I'm not afraid.
It is not our first time.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
-OK. -unhappy Himself.
"I'm just very, very unhappy."
You're so...
"You are so wonderful, and you're so..."
"The sensitive and romantic, and..."
"You know my rule about technology, Sleet!"
Give it to me!
I'm sorry...
"Dermot, give it to me!"
It wasn't my...
"I don't care if it's yours, you're not having it in my fucking dojo!"
I'm sorry.
Sorry if we've offended you.
And I don't like Simon Cowell trying to get rid of this place to turn it into telephone towers.
I'm not having it!
I've told him I will defend my sanctuary to the death and I'll say the same thing to you now.
"Seriously, the total lack of respect..."
SLEET YELLS Konichiwa!
"What, what is this?"
What is this?
These are our power stances.
"I get this, this is not powerful at all."
"I know, it's weird."
He...
Get out of here!
I hate you!
OK.
"Just back out, Dermot, slowly."
Back out.
Slowly back out.
"Leave me in peace, this is my haven!"
You are now a suspect in the murder of Simon Cowell.
"I don't care, I'm glad he's dead."
"He's not dead, he's been kidnapped."
I was trying to fool you.
"Oh, shit!"
"Thank you, Philip."
"If Hayes gets wind of this, we could have a firefight on our hands."
Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation.
He seems like a reasonable man.
That'd be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the armory?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
They'll side with us.
But Hayes posted two MACO there.
Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
Hold it.
Sorry.
That's going to leave a bruise.
All right.
Here with me.
We won't get to the bridge this way.
Captain!
"Captain, it's Trip!"
You shouldn't have weapons in here.
Go ahead.
"Major, Corporal Chang's been found unconscious in T'Pol's quarters."
Where's T'Pol?
"Not here, sir."
Hayes to the Armory.
"Armory, respond."
Stand down!
"You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?"
Tell them to stand down.
The captain relieved you of duty.
Same reason I never wear mine.
-What?
"-Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
You mean like a rave?
Is it still a rave if you don't roll?
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
-Want me to get you one?
-Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"It's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
(JACKSON groaning)
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says, ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"""
"is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
-Why do you wanna know?
-I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that you could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
"Well, tell me if this feels like an answer."
No.
Jackson?
In here.
-ls something wrong?
You bought stock with a bad check.
That's fraud.
People go to prison for things like that.
Never mind the sermon.
Have you got the check?
Let's talk about a better arrangement.
Alright.
Call your shots.
And so I can.
I'm now your junior partner.
An interest in the business to be mutually agreed on.
What if I say no?
Then you don't get the check.
You've got a deal.
It's lucky the bank teller was a girl I've known for several years.
"You know, a man called Thornston Weblin once said business is the art of getting something for nothing."
Yes?
Hello.
Is Mr. Sabourin here?
"Yes, he is, madam."
I'm Mrs. Ryan.
He's expecting me.
"You know, the only thing I don't like about this painting is the face."
"Oh, well, we'll have the face changed for you."
Hello.
Hello.
This is Miss Howell of the real estate office.
Mrs. Ryan.
How do you do?
What is this all about?
"I'm buying this house, if you approve."
Louis XIV?
I will have to do something.
"- No, brother."
We have lost everything.
AII we have got is you.
"If anything happens to you, then where will we go?"
With whose support will we live?
"Sometimes I feel, you all have the same.."
..mother but you and your brothers are so different!
This is the difference between family and strangers.
Some family members become strangers..
..and some strangers become ourfamiIy.
Like our Krishna.
Wonder where he will be.
What must he be doing?
You all are looking for me and I..
..I was waiting for you all over here.
Is it so?
"Keep this in your pocket, Peter."
Now I will open this lock only after..
Take this.
Hey.. hey what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey..
No!
-Who is it?
Who is it?
Oh!
Brother..
"I beg of you, I appeal to you.."
..if you want I can even take you to a doctor.
But I swear you should stop having these dreams.
- What are you doing?
I got a 12-year-old with hypothermia.
I gotta warm him up.
- I'm doing my best.
What's our ETA?
- About three minutes.
"Seeing a rescue in action, live from Chopper Five."
Stay with us as Dr. Doug Ross struggles to save the life of this child.
What are you doing?
How's he doing?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
"Malik, we need heated saline IVs."
Warm up half a dozen to 106 degrees.
"Wendy, get heated blankets and a mattress."
"Jerry, tell Benton we may need him down here."
- Heated peritoneal lavage?
"- Yeah, that's right."
"Come on, let's go!"
Can you warm him up now?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
- Why's the monitor doing that?
- He's got runs of abnormal heartbeats.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stabilize his rhythm.
Come on.
He's in V-fib!
- Come on.
"- What are those paddles for, Dr. Ross?"
Stabilize his beat.
They didn 't charge the battery!
"- Oh, my God."
- God!
I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom.
To get some aspirin... and I happened.
To look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... }where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
Denver 9.
99 they will die.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
Help!
"Over here, Indy!"
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move it!
Help me!
You can't do this to me!
I'm an American!
Indy!
Indiana Jones!
"Help me, Jones!"
Jones!
Marion!
Indy!
Marion...
Dr. Jones.
You looking for me?
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other."
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
"- [Knocking, Door Opening]"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Um, are you ready for us yet, Doctor?"
It's...
It's a little after 8:00.
"Zucco work back here, Mr. Morgan?"
When he's not out delivering.
"Hey, come on."
What's all this about?
What about shotgun shells?
Do you carry them?
"Well, years ago."
"Hey, maybe I still got a couple."
You want me to take a look?
"No, no, no."
"We have our man coming down from Explosive, and he'll check it out."
We'll just wait for him.
You mind if I look around down here?
"No, go ahead."
All right.
Thank you.
Here we go again.
So Samuels calls me in his office today.
You know what he wants?
He wants to know if I'm interested in a promotion.
"Well, that's great."
No!
"Now, wait a minute!"
You know what he really is interested in?
"- Well, not necessarily."
"- That's better than being totally ignored, isn't it?"
"[Neva Shouting] Your problems and my problems are so far apart, we can't even talk to each other."
The League of Nations will thank you!
"What I said was, how will I benefit?"
The entire human race will be grateful!
That means I won't benefit at all.
"Oh, there's US$500,000 too!"
"US$500,000?"
We'll share it fifty-fifty.
"For the human race, for the world, I will help you."
Come what may!
What do I have to do?
You have to steal a Formula.
Where from?
From Fat Pig's house!
What?
You want me to steal from my boss!
You want me to lose my job?
I'll get my provident fund in 20 years' time!
"Do you want that in 20 days, you will be enjoying California's sunshine."
Inspector!
What is it?
The Commissioner and his family will be going out tomorrow.
He wants you to tighten up security.
No problem.
Tell him to go in peace.
I will take charge personally.
I'll stand guard tonight.
You come as the burglar.
Then we'll be able to get it.
"Over here, get in."
Hurry!
Yoyo looks great.
Beginning to take after me!
Jeremy won't be coming.
I cancelled him.
"Neil, it's just a night out, and we need to try new things."
"Yes, but you deserve a better escort than Jeremy."
You deserve the very best.
You were right.
We need to start over.
Like we're meeting for the very first time.
Get out.
Sorry?
I said get out.
"If this is a date, then you shouldn't be in my bedroom when I'm getting dressed."
"Oh, hello."
You must be Grace.
- And you must be?
- Neil.
Neil Truman.
"You're a little early, Neil Truman."
Come on in.
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.
My husband and I bought it a long time ago.
You're married?
Does that shock you?
That a married woman would want to have sex with a stranger?
"Oh, I'm not here to judge."
Only to give you a night of pleasure that you'll never forget.
"Well, we better get started then."
Ahem.
Typically I receive the envelope before we begin the evening.
- The envelope?
Nothing is hidden in here.
And neither can one drink too much.
Sparkle as if you were in our house.
"Enough, what are you doing?"
What they all do.
"We are going, just relax."
-Let it all come out.
-Are you crazy.
"Enough, I feel so ashamed."
"No way, Francesca."
I know that you'll like it.
Can't you feel how wet you are?
"Let yourself go, Francesca."
This is an opportunity to play it for real.
Don't be afraid my love.
I am here.
Where are we going?
Get up Francesca.
Swap places.
We are going to another room.
But as in a mirror it all returned to be seen.
"Apparently... reserved and adaptable, but in reality the whoring of it all."
But seeing Paolo being possessed by another woman made me crazy with jealousy.
But this jealousy also made me cazy with lust and desire.
Yes Paolo!
I am enjoying it!
I like it!
"Me too, Francesca. me too!"
Yes my love
- I do too.
And it was so shameful.
-You were once?
This is history.
Do as you will.
"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...
It's beautiful!
Indy?
"Don't look, Marion!"
Keep your eyes shut!
Marion.
"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you."
And we trust you found the settlement satisfactory.
"Oh, the money's fine."
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen, I guess that just about wraps it up."
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
- Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
I missed it.
I left him with mama before he was two years old.
So that means I've missed four of his birthdays.
So we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about...
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
"I bet Bonnie would be surprised if she knew she had a half-brother over in nigger town, though."
"You know, you really should have some of our baby's cake."
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
Here.
Goddamn it!
I told you I don't want any.
This what you want?
What are you doing?
"This is what you want, isn't it?"
"Come on, cut it out."
Cut it out.
Cut it out!
Goddamn it!
Why did you ever fuck with me?
"Me and my brother's daddy was white, did you know that?"
"Of course, we never knew him."
He had another family.
But that's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.
"And I guess you figured since I kind of look white, you can fuck me."
What the hell.
I just want to let you know that my confessional is open all week long.
"I'll be there if you need to speak about anything or talk, get things off your mind."
And I um...
I don't mean to have to do this.
It's kind of required.
This is a crisis prevention helpline if you need to talk to somebody about anything.
And this is a poison control.
Probably might need that.
I don't know.
The good news is we have singles night on Tuesdays down in the basement.
We like to dance around.
It's a lot of fun.
I married the church but I dance and look.
"And if anyone has lifestyle changes they might want to reconsider, they can just, oh, come to my office."
"Thank you, Father."
You're welcome.
Thank you.
That's not him.
He's gone.
Let's go see mommy and daddy.
Ok.
"Look, Katie."
It's a bride!
It's a bride!
Come on!
"I'm gonna be a bride one day, too."
This is what my dress is gonna look like.
Like it?
Yes.
Very pretty.
Thanks.
Today's my first communion.
It ain't worth it.
I'd have done it for a tanner.
(Laughs)
Your moustache...
"Oh, yes, sir."
"I got the creeping alopecia, sir."
"It crept all over my lip, it did, sir."
"Yes, sir."
- Fetch Mrs Ransom.
"- Yes, sir."
I'm sure Mrs Ransom was after local colour for one of her romances.
Local colour is one thing.
Asking a publican for a Mickey Finn is another.
- I don't know Mr Finn.
"- Knock-out drops, sir."
Drugs.
"Oh, my goodness!"
"Then hurling abuse at a police officer, and giving a false name."
"- ""Lotus Blossom."""
- Good gracious.
- She had been drinking.
"- Oh, never."
"No, Mumsie is totally teetotal."
"She was on port and lemon tonight, miss."
"Well, I'm sure she's very sorry indeed."
She's been under stress...
I shall write to my MP!
"You haven't heard the last of this, not by a long chalk!"
- Flora!
- Sit down.
Masquerading as civilians.
That oaf who arrested me hadn't even shaved!
What you need to do is focus on yourself.
Ok?
"So, please, sit."
No.
No?
"This is my therapy, and I should be allowed to decide what we talk about."
"Erica, just drop it."
Ok?
You're not his doctor.
This is not your problem.
"No, because his doctor is mia, and Kai is out there drowning, and you are acting like you don't even care."
You could talk to him.
No.
Yes.
You could get through to him.
You and I are not gonna discuss this any further.
"You know, unlike Dr. Fred,"
I don't become involved in the lives of other patients.
That's a rule?
That's my rule.
Fine.
We are not doing this today.
"Erica, come back."
Open the door.
"Come back and sit down in the chair, please."
Open the door!
Everything ok?
We had a disagreement.
"It wasn't our first, won't be our last."
"Well, disagreements are a normal part of the process."
This was different.
This felt like... the fights that I used to have with Sarah.
"It is true that I missed you all day long in that bed, it was endless."
"I tried to forget everything in sleeping, but I couldn't."
Do you know what I kept thinking about ?
about that day that we spent here together.
It was a great day !
Simon !
"Simon, are you alright ?"
"Yes, I'm ok !"
"Are you hungry, Babette ?"
I'm starving !
It's smells good !
What did you make?
It's pork with honney and curry.
That's the curry I can smell.
I've got a bottle of Bordeau.
That sounds great !
It will go well with the meat.
Remind me to buy you some place mats.
You haven't got much tableware.
"You know that Simon couldnt care less, and I hate shopping."
"Never mind, you're such a good cook."
I like it !
You'll have to give me the recipe.
What's wrong ?
I have something to tell you.
I have to leave again.
I am sailing back for work in a few days time.
Just like this.
Yes !
Five weeks.
We are sailing to south Africa.
It is the last time I am leaving for so long.
No.
"No, i guess it's just time for me to get out."
Nick.
"Jim, don't let him go!"
"If you're doing this for me, it's wrong!"
Don't worry.
He'll be back tomorrow.
"Just come from the gold exchange, boss."
It's buzzing over there like a hornet's nest.
"You know, i'm going to put a scare into washington till they padlock that treasury."
"There she goes, up again."
"You know, gold's jumped 4 points since you started buying it."
Jim.
"Oh, josie!"
You're just in time to see the fireworks start.
"Jim, where's nick?"
"In his office, i guess."
Haven't you seen him yet?
I've been waiting all day for him to come through that door.
It's not so far to come.
"But it's not so far to go, either."
"I'm sorry, josie, i can't do it."
"Please, boss."
"Jim, you've got to do it."
Do it for my sake.
"Hello, nick."
"Hello, jim."
Gold's just hit 125.
It's not too late if you still want to come in.
It's not too late for you to get out.
"Stop fooling with gunpowder, jim."
I won't stop until it hits 200.
646.
- And 5 more.
- Here is another 20.
Plus 3.
The change they gave me when I bought the fur coats.
And you said it wasn't a good idea to buy them.
- Mr. Dürchlich?
"- Well, yes."
"You use the pencil as a phone, but still, you don't have the money for the hotel."
What can I say?
Nice prospects.
"Well, we'll surely cover the rest somehow."
How much are you still missing?
- 54.
- That's nothing.
That's right!
-You've got to do it someday.
"-Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's called marriage.
-Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
-I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But... don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
"Betty, you're the only girl I've ever wanted."
Rodney...
"Rodney, not that way..."
What good is life if I go through it not having guts to do it my way?
Rodney... I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
Are there glasses?
- But of course.
Everything's supplied.
"- Oh, dear."
- What?
"Well, I was just thinking of Mother."
"This afternoon, she tried to tell me what happens on a wedding night."
She's a bit late.
What did you say?
"I said she was a bit late, didn't I?"
Henry?
Mr Faber?
What are you doing?
It's all right.
It's... just for the station.
Classified work regarding the trains.
I shouldn't really be telling you.
"- Please, listen to me."
- No.
Trust me.
- You're a spy.
- Stop struggling.
"Listen to me, please."
"Last night, the Luftwaffe's main target was again London."
Considerable damage was done to residential and industrial areas...
"David, be careful."
You're not in your Spitfire yet.
"Dearly beloved brethren, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."
He gives us the sheep and we... give him back the bones.
"Lucy, I think I've offended your mother again."
"I'm right here, David."
You may address me directly.
He picked up your brother because... you were crying.
He saw my distress and offered me money.
He said it was a good family.
"Oh, God!"
What have I done?
You survived.
Made a home for me.
You did what you had to do.
I don't blame you.
You should've told me.
I know.
"Can you remember his name, the lawyer?"
Why?
"Somebody killed him, Mother."
He was trying to come home.
They killed him.
"Alain, please."
Can you remember his name?
Etienne St. Denis.
He had an office in Place Pigalie in Paris.
Parents always lie to their children... to prepare them for the way they'll be treated later by the government.
Maybe I'm wasting my time.
"But if I don't go now, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
What do you gain?
You only open old wounds.
The lawyer can't bring him back.
My brother was adopted.
"If I can find his family, I can learn about him."
Kind of get to know him.
The lawyer's office is on the sixth floor.
"Remember, I'll do the talking."
Okay?
You didn't do anything.
You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure! rambling on like a lunatic.
So much easier for you.
Easier?
Jesus!
nothing!
please be like the rest of the world blaming someone else for your boring shit.
I'm such a giant disappointment.
You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we're doing?
what are we doing?
Hmm?
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.
I see that.
there are others.
Does that mean nothing to you?
means nothing to me.
Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books.
What are you talking about?
will you?
Take out two pills and give them to him.
- Logan!
Logan!
- Give 'em to him.
Now!
I wanna see it.
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...
Motherfucking auto-trucks.
Logan.
And you're screaming at a machine. huh?
She can learn to be better.
better than me?
"Sorry, but don't mention that I was here."
You're fleeing?
Or your family will fall apart and you won't be a detective anymore.
They've been hiding for 15 years.
It's like being imprisoned.
"They've already atoned, let them go."
A crime is a crime.
What we did may be a crime to our families.
"Those are our civil affairs, not the police's problem."
"You're impossible, we're finished."
Wait...
But I'm a detective.
"Don't worry about me, I'm sure I'll be out in two years."
So wait for me.
"In two years, come pick me up at prison."
Open up!
We'll be okay.
What're you doing?
Hurry and open up!
Where's Suzuki San?
"Last I saw, she was delivering sushi."
Wasn't that a while ago?
"Room 405, right?"
I'll go check on her.
"Hello, front desk."
Mind coming up?
Is something wrong?
"Just come up, hurry."
"Alright Betty, time for a walk."
Like you're digging deep.
Sir?
You're becoming the earth...
"Really, really bad mistake!"
My lawyer just flew in.
Vogel will get me off.
"Oh, and there's super cop."
"God, you're so good, huh?"
You're really good.
Come around and watch a movie sometime.
"Where was the missing cuff link found,"
That it couldn't be recovered two years ago?
I'm unable to comment on that at this time.
Suffice it to say that mr.
Cardoza's name
And reputation has been cleared.
"Well, that door's not going to open itself."
Thank you.
Lieutenant.
"You know, uh,"
Tony enright is never going to see
The inside of a prison cell.
"Don't be too sure, mr."
Vogel.
"Actually, I'm dead sure."
I want you out of miami.
Have you come to wish me bon voyage?
"By the way, if you're ever in the emirates,"
Don't bother to call.
"Don't worry, I'll get the door."
Thank you.
"You would have done the same for me, jesse."
"Zeltzer, did you fix the lighting in scene 4?"
"Okay, people, please concentrate."
Right?
"You heard it too, right?"
You think I'm deaf?
But why did you say you didn't hear?
What point is there in me fanning the flames?
You could see the team manager's eyelashes trembling.
"It's possible she could've mistaken herself for a moment, but why did she have to get angry?"
That's the first time I've seen the team manager act like that.
I was so shocked.
"Yeah, it was a bit unexpected."
Oh yeah.
I got an email asking me to call.
Let me have the phone.
"All right, I'll send it to you by phone."
It's not coming out well.
You're so sensitive.
"That's right, I'm sensitive."
Who is it?
The person who unexpectedly got angry.
Oh no...
You heard?
You think I'm deaf?
We weren't talking behind your back.
"Yes, you were."
"Yeah, Oppa?"
Are you okay?
Of course.
Did you eat lunch?
I just ate some noodles and am getting back to work.
"You're really okay, right?"
Has he called you?
He hasn't called since the day before yesterday.
Cover page?
Manoj.
Why is he sobbing like this?
How many shocks in the truth can he bear to hear in a day?
He will be normal in a while.
You left him to sob alone?
- What do you want me to do?
He is crying by himself.
You should be the one to console him.
Go.
- Not again!
"So, she has been selectively cheating blind men."
They have to be blind...
They must believe her stories.
Must be ready to give the money she asks.
She targets those people.
in the name of love...
And made a clean sweep.
"If my instincts are right, even now... she should be cheating someone..."
Call Priya.
Priya...
Where are you?
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire."
"You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass."
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire"
"You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually."
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"I've to say as far as the home front goes, we can't let it look as if she rather have the American."
Oh!
That will be the teat.
"Teat or no teat, what all parties need... is a morally clean, romantically satisfying resolution."
Well perhaps if Mrs.Cole could carry on her good work with Hilliard on set.
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent!
Excellent!
Stick to the side...slowly forward.
Two steps.
Look to the side.
No.
Left side's the camera.
The good side.
"Mr.Ducard. Thank you, please...if you don't mind Ducard."
And...
Johnnie is hit!
Keep it in rear view please.
Thank you.
Could you move please?
Trying to get big boy up there.
Sorry.
Tea.
Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I played it rather convincing, don't you think?"
Yeah!
You did!
"Say, are...are those walkcakes?"
Like to know when it's ready.
It's very much on it's way.
Sir is calling.
Must be the wife's massage.
Today I'm on duty.
Otherwise someone like you has never been spared by me.
Get his information and let him go.
You came out to be intelligent.
You don't look like one.
But you are.
But How did you put the gun in my bag?
I'm shocked.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were looking on your left your left.
I came slowly...
"but that bag of yours, it was in the left."
"Here is your gun, and listen."
You met me here.
Don't meet me there.
Understood?
"I don't take help, not even from my father."
You know my nature.
But I know your nature.
Your size is 52 but you wear 48.
"How do you know, Sir?"
"If it was 52, wouldn't you be adjusting again and again."
"Okay, tell me which room is under my name."
"Your name, Sir?"
Laxminarayan.
Okay
Listen.
A letter is suppose to arrive on my name.
"One minute, let me check."
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
"Two in the neck, four in the back."
Or was stabbed three times.
Look at the pattern.
"Two, two, and two."
Three times...
With a pair of scissors.
"Yes, that's possible."
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
"- Spur of the moment, not planned."
- Plus...
The mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would've seen that."
So she was running when she left the building.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
"I guess you can say that there were 12 million people with a motive, myself included."
This was the Lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What's what?
On her fingertips.
He wanted me to come up there with him.
You didn't go.
- You did the right thing.
"- No, I didn't."
He had no business there without a ghost.
"That should have been me, plus backups."
But Eddie was such a hothead...
I mean the kind that never cools off.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
"This one it set Tino up for the max, 10 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer...
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State Parole Officer.
Better pay and pension.
- Nicer surroundings.
- Think so?
"How was, um..."
"""I... am... fine."""
Okay.
I guess that clears that up.
"Back to work, people."
As you were.
"Yeah, we'll talk..."
Nice post-it.
"Yeah, well, the last thing I need are people feeling sorry for me."
Is there any thing else?
'Cause I have a few weeks of work to catch up on.
Nothing.
"Well, just... the Campbell interview's this afternoon."
"- You ready or, uh-- - yeah, I can handle it, Jimmy."
Who's this?
Does it really matter?
And... these?
"It's your future, dude."
"You know, I didn't want you coming back to an office full of..."
Marjorie.
Nice.
- You want to talk about it?
"- No, I'm good."
- 'Cause I'm here if you want to.
- I know you are.
"Thanks, Jimmy."
Thank you.
"Okay, uh..."
"This is officially now, uh, an M.F.Z.--"
A Marjorie Free Zone.
"So we're rolling out the teaser campaign 2 weeks before the 21st, which is the hard date the game actually hits the stores, and the web site goes live with online, tv and trade pub print being our tent poles."
We also are doing game rental inserts.
He will notice
Where 's your corset?
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.
But you are not properly dressed
"Who is to say what is ""proper""?"
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""was wearing a codfish on your head, would you wear it?"
Alice ...
"For me, a corset is like a codfish"
"Please, not today."
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
"It's always the same, ever since I can remember"
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
"Now, can you manage to smile?"
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive
"Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you ."
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4?
Now everything I've been rushed through
- I am sorry.
"- Oh, nevermind."
Forgive my wife.
What is his name?
Just write it down!
I don't know.
You know that.
I've told you this story so many times.
"You know he would've loved you, but..."
"What is his name, for christ's sakes?"
!
Go to your room!
That is not okay!
Have you ever tried to look him up?
No.
"He told me that his name was saxon banks,"
Like mr.
"Banks, the dad in ""mary poppins."""
Mm-hmm.
"But i googled him afterwards, and..."
We met in a bar.
"He was funny and sexy,"
And we were both pleasantly drunk.
We got a hotel room that overlooked the ocean.
It was beautiful and romantic.
"Ahem, and then he..."
Changed.
What do you mean he changed?
He became extremely aggressive.
It was like he was operating
Some piece of machinery or something.
It was just so rote.
"I tried to resist, but..."
He was way bigger than i was.
I eventually just stopped resisting because...
What a Christmas treat...
What a treat!
..if you would bust some moves to give us a...
CHEERING
"I mean, guys, anything."
"What tempo would suit you, Rhys?"
You want upbeat.
They can do upbeat.
They do nuclear.
They go very fast.
Have you got any Jive Bunny and the mastermixes?
There he goes.
FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYS
Wow!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thank you!
Are you on medication?
LAUGHTER No.
Everybody loves Flight of the Conchords and I loved Murray.
Your character was sublime.
Will we see more of him?
Well...
I would love to say yes and I certainly can't say no.
I'd hate to think he wouldn't be done again.
Was it something that the boys...?
Do you need half an hour to catch your breath?
"Well, you saw what I just did!"
I did that and then straight away with another question!
"""Tell us about your mother."""
All right.
"The Conchords, it started off for most audiences here as a radio show."
Yeah.
The dog... just Greta.
She was in the bathroom.
"Well, what was she doing?"
That's the funny thing.
She was pulling the curling iron out of the water by the cord.
"Boy, that's some smart dog."
Maybe she heard the girl scream when the curler hit the water.
I guess that's what happened.
"God, I don't know."
[Siren wailing]
There's something more.
What?
How did the dog get in?
"She was locked out, I'm sure."
"Well, maybe... maybe the girl let her in."
No.
She was in the tub.
I remember Monique slumped down under the water.
Eyes were still open.
Oh?
"Well, she's propped up against the end of the tub now."
"Well, I pulled her up from under the water."
"I was hoping she was still breathing, but she wasn't."
But who is she?
What was she doing here?
"Monique Berger, a friend."
She lives across the street.
They're working on the plumbing system.
[Siren wailing]
Anything else I should do?
"No, just stay in there and see they"
Don't make a mess of things.
(PANTING)
Christina!
Christina!
"(STRUGGLING) Tris, help me."
Tris!
(CHRISTINA PANTING)
It's okay.
We removed this from the body of the suicide.
Marlene.
Her name was Marlene.
I'm sorry.
Marlene.
It's a very sophisticated sim serum injector.
It also has a radio transmitter in its head.
How do we get them out?
I don't know.
This tech was built to defend itself.
This tendril wraps around the nearest major artery.
Try to remove them and they kill the host.
(ALL MURMURING)
CHRISTINA:
So what do we do?
Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disks before we do anything else.
EDGAR:
Or we could do the logical thing.
And we hand her over.
Nobody knows about this alliance.
We have to protect that advantage.
"If we hand Tris over now, might buy us some time."
(ALL AGREEING)
FOUR:
I think it's a good idea.
[Horn blows]
[Horn blows]
2 of diamonds.
2 no trumps.
3 spades.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
"3 spades it is, then."
"Ahh, I can't help you much, I'm afraid."
"Ahh, for God's sake."
How much longer can they keep us here?
"Till after tea, anyway."
"Arthur, you think you should be working after everything that's happened?"
"No, no."
I have to keep busy.
"Yes, of course."
You and I have business to discuss about your late wife's affairs.
What?
Seems we're going to be in partnership.
"That's not-- when the Germans arrive, the high command, we'll be able to put them up here at the hotel."
We're near enough to the coast.
They won't arrive.
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
You do know that the Belgians have capitulated?
Yes.
I'm going to be tougher with him.
I promise.
Huh.
It's weird.
I just have this vague feeling of you actually being a good mother.
I hate you!
"I hate you, I hate you!"
I hate you!
"Reese, this is crazy."
You've been staring at that damn thing for four days.
We're getting rid of it.
No!
Wait!
I finally have an idea.
What is it?
I'll have it in a second!
Just wait!
"It's over, Reese."
"Once the board's gone, things should go back to normal."
Did you know that the Newmans put a statue of a naked guy on their front lawn a week ago?
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
No!
We are not getting rid of this!
"Reese, what is the big deal?"
What is so special about this board?
I think it's my last time.
Last time for what?
For anything stupid and reckless and fun.
"Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now, but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says,"
"""That's dangerous, that's stupid."
"You're gonna hurt yourself."""
"And the old voice, the one that says,"
"Yeah, yeah."
Hannah's response:
"""Nobody's perfect,"
"But this guy's a super, super jerk""."
Oh man.
My mom watches Leno.
Well if it makes you feel any better.
"Both Miley and Hannah love their ""super, super jerk""."
Well I'm glad you think this is funny.
But you're not the one who's a talk show punch line?
You're a cute punch line.
"Oh Jesse, come on!"
Oh come on Jesse.
I know it's my fault but...
"Okay this is where you say ""No it's not your fault honey."
"We're in this together""."
Let me try it again.
Jesse I know it's my fault but...
Your turn.
"Doesn't have to be ""honey""."
"Could be ""lamb chop cupcake..."""
Miley.
Oh come on.
You can do better than that.
You don't get it.
"Everybody in America knows me as the super, super jerk."
Who broke Hannah Montana's heart?
Everybody?
"Now come on, you're being a little dramatic."
I mean the people that know you and love you don't feel that way.
[Cell phone buzzing]
Really?
I know how much that stuff meant to her.
How is she doing?
"Come on, monica."
You know your mother.
I mean not good at all.
I don't even know what to say to her.
"I've been helping her with the house while taking care of my bills,"
But there's only so much i can do.
I mean she was making more than me.
i really hate to see her like this.
"Know what, dad?"
I forgot...
I need to go make a phone call.
Can you watch my bag?
"- Baby, just use my phone."
- There's probably no service.
"Sure enough, she's right."
Hmm.
Hoo.
"How was your run, regina?"
"It was good, mother."
"Well, any other time it'd be ""mama."""
"You still mad, but that's okay."
- You'll get over it.
"- Mama, i really don't wanna go through this again."
"You know, your nagging is getting real old."
"Now before you go storming off to your room like usual,"
Do you mind getting the door this time?
It's your shift.
I've already done mine.
oh god.
I don't know why you're making me come over here and do this.
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money, and... well, you know, kids -- They can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?
They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.
Dirk the jerk.
"And after what happened to his mother, he..."
His mother?
"Yeah, Jane, my wife."
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you -- you watch somebody die slow, waste away to nothing... it does things to a person."
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He... he wouldn't talk about her.
Not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"Well, we'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. McGregor."
"Um, you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's..."
That's nice.
Where do you keep that?

* The clothes that you wear

How big's the party?
You got no right to make fun of me.
"I got a disorder, diagnosed by a legitimate doctor."
I got inside several different people.
"- Me, Mary Maude..."
- I met her.
JM...
"There are others, I don't know."
Let's get the department shrink to ride shotgun for Frank.
Are you kidding?
"Look at the way he's smiling, he's having a ball."
Tell JMJ I wanna talk to her.
"If you want to talk to JMJ, you have got to call her."
- What the hell is he doing?
- Watch and wait.
"Well, tell JMJ that I'd like to see her."
I don't talk to her.
"Whatever he's doing, it's inappropriate."
Can't you see he's playing her game?
- I only know she's in here.
- She's faking.
They don't know about me.
I am the dominant.
He'll trip her up.
- The dominant?
- That's what they call it.
"I know about the others, but they don't know about each other."
"You know JMJ, but you can't talk to her?"
Who cares?
He just came to finish off the relationship with Grandma.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Thank you.
Why didn't you tell us... about Uncle?
I wish I had known.
When we found out... about Uncle... we all cried.
"Looking at Nagasaki, it's hard to believe this is where the bomb was dropped."
"People do forget everything, and so quickly, too."
But I will never forget!
"Say, let's go back there once more."
"You mean, that school?"
Yes.
Let's go to Grandpa's place.
Where is Nagasaki?
We can't see it yet.
It's on the other side of that mountain.
I wonder what happened to the children?
They didn't want to meet Clark.
That's for sure.
It's all our fault.
Our... stupidity.
But Clark...
We didn't think that.
"Clark, is there any place that you would like to see in Nagasaki?"
"Yes, there is."
"So, we'll go to the hotel, and then..."
I don't need a hotel.
I'm going to stay at Aunty's place.
"Before that, there's a place I'd like to see."
The place where Uncle died.
Would you bid a half?
75.
Got a dollar.
How about going on for a half?
$1.50.
Would you bid $2?
Did I hear $2?
I got $2 right over here.
"Thank you, sir."
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company for $2.
Could I see that bill of sale?
"Thank you, son."
You consider this an actual bill of sale?
"I'm just the auctioneer, sir."
The bill of sale's been sworn to.
"Well, whoever swore to it... was a liar and a cow thief."
Those cows belong to John Coble of the Wood River Cattle Company.
Who the hell are you?
Stock detective.
What's a stock detective?
Me.
"You may call yourself some kind of stock detective... but I'm a deputy sheriff, and I'm the law here."
Lock these men up.
I'll file the charges.
"Nobody's going to jail, unless you start some trouble."
I see.
"I'll tell you what, Horn."
I'm gonna kill you.
You ain't gonna kill nobody.
"If he don't, I will."
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...
We need to talk to the Civil Guard.
Have them step up surveillance at the Point.
We have to find whoever owns that heroin.
I'll take the river.
I'll take Quini.
HUNTING LODGE FOR RENT
Yes.
"Okay, thanks a lot."
Marina's at her house.
Her mother says she's fine.
The Civil Guard is mixed up in all of this.
Someone's tipping them off.
The whole town smokes American tobacco and there's not a single butt on any of the boats.
They have to get by on something between harvests.
Go in.
Sit there.
- I'm fine standing.
"- Sit, damn it."
What were you doing at the hunting lodge earlier?
I was with my girlfriend.
Wanna hear the details?
"Yes, I do."
Nobody ever explained it to you?
- Who's the man in the hat?
- What man?
"The guy who went in after you, before I got my head bashed in."
Nobody came in.
"I told you, we were alone."
"You want my blood, is that it?"
"Call the doctor, I'll wait."
Too bad you didn't bring your pajamas.
You're sleeping here.
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go... and... all I could see... was black... and all I could feel was the darkness above me... and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
"And then I heard this voice, like somebody whispering in my ear."
"""Wake up, number 37""."
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright... flash.
Lightning.
Something... encircles me.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch... catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
You questioning my professional competence?
He sure looks bad.
"He's dying, poor old thing."
- Can't even eat anymore.
- What seems to be wrong?
"I'm not the best doctor in the world, but I'm the best one without a license."
"My diagnosis is plague, tuberculosis, old age and no hope."
He's tired.
Bone tired.
SOLDIER:
The captain's in there!
Check the damage in the dispensary!
"Everything's all right here, colonel!"
"A near miss, but nobody hurt."
- I think they've stopped.
"- Yes, sir."
This is the usual procedure.
About every other night.
Harassment.
It's pretty good shooting.
"Commo bunker, the dispensary, the team house."
It's a sure thing that they have eyes inside our camp.
MacDANIEL:
Check your gear.
Commo bunker was hit.
"Lieutenant Green, form a recon patrol, ASAP!"
GREEN:
"Petersen, come with me."
MacDANIEL:
Who is it?
"Lt's the captain, sir."
Better move him out of there.
I want Danny to spend more time with my son.
He made plans with him and now he's trying to pull out.
"And guys ""pulling out"" is why I have a kid in my first place."
"Okay, fine, I'll do it."
But it's not fair.
You asked me right in the middle of sex.
"I was like... ""Ah, ah, ah... oh, okay, I'll take your son to Dave  Busters."
"Okay, quick announcement."
It's a new year and I wanted to shake things up a little bit.
So I decided to dye my hair red
- But then I chickened out.
"- Thank God, because red hair is the worst."
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
Ta-da!
You like it?
I love it.
I love it.
It is beautiful.
It is great.
Like a bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
It's like your whole head's on fire!
"Love you, fire head!"
Now all we have to do is fill in the gaps.
I'm buying it.
Down payment.
"Call it rent, call it what you like, but I am not leaving London."
- Hmm!
- Sorry.
Bad night.
"Buckley, Parfitt, meeting now."
"Maybe we could find out who it is, at least."
"You know, check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something."
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
Guess which ones.
No.
"So, there was only one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
I knew him.
How did he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
That's where...
Right where the chick got swirleyed to death.
Exactly.
"So, what?"
This ghost is possessing nerds?
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.
"- Thanks, Sam."
- Great school.
I don't care.
"Three years, and I'm out of here."
I'm going to Michigan State.
They got the best vet program in the country.
You like animals?
They're a lot nicer than people.
"So tonight I'm thinking you, me, a bucket of popcorn, extra butter."
"Mm, kinky."
- What's your problem?
- You think I have lost it?
Think about it.
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?
I mean why is Zak coming after a boring banker?
Hold on a second!
Who's boring?
"I'm a crowd puller, okay?"
- Everybody knows that.
It's nothing new.
"- Shiv, this is not funny!"
What is not funny?
I'm not being funny!
What are you saying?
All of this is connected.
Okay?
"In fact, even the comet..."
"All of this has happened before, Shiv."
You have to believe this.
I have to believe this!
"What...what...what are you saying, baby?"
"You are an educated, English speaking, modern girl who lives in Europe."
You make chocolates!
Why are you saying such strange things?
"What do I do, I don't have any proof."
"- Hey baby, what are you doing?"
- Just a second!
"Baby, you cannot use sex to make me believe."
I'm reminding you of your birthmark.
"Just think, why do you have it?"
This is where Zak had attacked you.
"God bless einstein,"
But i had to boost his theory just a little.
Case in point.
"Well, look like i won't be using that tesseracter."
This is confusing for me.
"So much about me was lost,"
So much forgotten.
"Well, then, why don't you tell me"
What you do remember?
"I remember it made me happy to be here,"
"On this ship,"
With you.
"On the other hand,"
"Andromeda, rommie, doyle... i don't even know what to call myself."
I'll tell you what.
Why don't i just call you... friend.
[Footsteps]
Shall we paddle?
I'd rather not.
I'm going to.
Oh!
[Laughs]
Is it cold?
"Hey, Ursula, stop it!"
Oh!
[Laughs]
"No, please, I beg you, don't."
[Man on radio]:
"White, Dover, Thames, Humber, Heligoland."
"South-to-southwest gales spreading from the west, with rain and moderate or poor visibility."
Storms are imminent.
They were tight for space.
"You see, we got about 210 cubic feet, so we can move around."
"If you ever go up there again, will you take me along?"
Ha-ha-ha.
What for?
First missionary on Mars.
"Tell me, was it public relations you did for the Gestapo or community relations?"
-I'm Swiss.
"-Yes, of course."
"And you never went bowling with Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh?"
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
-It's a red brick wing.
-Saint Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
He has black hair.
He's very intense looking.
Who's that?
-Damien Karras.
-Karras?
"That's his office, back of Saint Mike's."
He's our-
- Our psychiatric counselor.
"He had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Cunting Hun.
"Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig."
Stop it!
We are going nowhere.
"Until we've got fingers again, obviously."
Great!
You've done a really good job.
It's very... secure.
Thanks.
"And don't worry, it unlocks just as easily as it locks."
"Oh, no."
Ah...
Kidding.
I'm kidding.
I was just...
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- He doesn't say much.
- That's Steve.
He takes a while to warm up to new people.
"So, who are you exactly?"
I'm you.
I thought you looked familiar.
"12 years ago, I was the kid no-one believed."
I'm...
I saw something too.
"An animal, a creature, really."
"I was walking where I'd walked 100 times before and for some reason that day, there it was."
I've never seen anything like it before or since.
You never saw it again?
But I knew what I'd seen.
"For a while, I tried to convince other people I'd seen it, too."
I don't need to tell you how that went.
My parents practically measured me for my own strait jacket.
I know how it feels when the people you rely on most don't believe you.
And you won't be going anywhere.
We'll see about the television.
All right?
"I'm very pleased that you like Dr. Travers, darling."
I did too.
"Well, he said he'd stop by in a couple of days to see how I'm feeling."
Good.
"And I will tell you exactly what he's going to say, that your husband is taking very good care of you."
I'll be right back.
- What did you do?
- Oh.
The antibiotics Dr. Travers gave me.
Let me help you.
He should've given me clumsy pills instead.
Better take this before I forget.
"- Gerard, I'll be coming down for breakfast at 7:15 tomorrow morning."
Tell Mrs. Gunnerson it will be the usual.
That's right.
Thank you.
Good night.
"Oh, here, darling."
"Oh, thank you."
To my beautiful wife.
Alexis.
"It's late, very late."
There's nothing more that you can do tonight.
Let's go home.
"I want to stay here, Dex."
You're tired.
You can come back tomorrow.
"Yes, I know, but I want to stay and talk to Galen's doctors."
Even if it means spending the night?
"- Good morning, Miss."
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
"Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?"
Walk march!
Forward!
"Party, halt!"
"Sgt. Ballantine, take charge."
"Go inside, dear."
I'll be right with you.
"All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon."
"- Naik, what about this?"
"- He just came back, Sergeant sahib."
"Come here, you."
"Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this."
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
"- Please, sahib."
"You stole the elephant, didn't you?"
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
"Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?"
"- Yes, sahib."
- That's all!
Take him away!
"You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!"
"Wait a minute, Mac."
Okay.
It's...
Order an abdominal M.R.I. and a urine catecholamine.
It's just a hunch.
Okay.
Oh.
I almost killed you with an educational rattle.
Sorry.
I didn't knock in case you were sleeping.
I just came to get Cooper's clothes.
"Yeah, and to check up on me, make sure I'm not crazy."
I know the drill.
"What, you want to hold the baby?"
Do I look like someone who wants to hold a baby?
I'm wearing silk.
Are you breast-feeding?
No.
"No, I'm not."
"You know, a lot of women don't breast-feed."
I don't need to breast-feed.
L...
like I should feel bad about it?
I...
"I am so sick of people trying to make me feel like what I feel isn't what I should feel, if that makes any sense."
No.
"No, Charlotte, I'm not breast-feeding, okay?"
What you do with your boobs is your business.
"I only ask because you look like you need a martini, and if you're not breast-feeding, you can have a martini."
You want a martini?
Yeah.
Please.
Naomi.
Yihong Brothel?
I must get that ill-gotten money
Have some tea!
"My lord, aren't you wasting this good wine?"
What a pity?
Not at all!
Nothing like Chinese dates soaked in wine
It's like paradise!
Such a big man and he's still sucking breasts
Looks like it's so pleasurable
Heavenly!
Look at the way he waggles his tongue
This is so embarrassing
What's so embarrassing about that?
Don't come if you're broke
This is so wonderful!
"Master Zhou, you've had your pleasure!"
"Let's play the money game, how's that?"
Good!
Come!
Come!
All of you!
Let's get everybody out!
These are all for you!
Coming!
Coming!
Only those fast enough will get reward!
Let's start the game!
You can have it if you get it
"If you drop it, it's not yours!"
You dropped it!
Stupid!
I want you out of here.
"And from now on, I don't want anybody going to his tavern,"
I don't want anybody eating his food.
"Spit that out, Johnson."
"I brought this from home, sir."
I said spit it out.
I think he meant into a napkin.
- I'm going to go.
- Good.
And take these lousy sandwiches with you.
"Those are my gym clothes, sir."
I'm really glad we could have dinner.
"Me, too."
You okay?
You seem a little nervous.
"No,"
I'm not nervous.
Just a little hopped up from the pepper shrimp.
"Alex, I get it."
You're afraid someone will see us together and tell your father.
I'm not afraid.
It's just there's nothing to tell him.
Okay.
"But I can tell my friends about you, right?"
Tell them what exactly?
"What, are you kidding?"
I kissed one of Manhattan's Ten Most Eligible Singles.
"That's only happened to me, like, three or four times."
"Hey, let's walk this way."
What?
I think I see the mail-room guy from my office.
"Sorry, I just feel like everyone's staring at us."
- Where's the cook?
- Eating at Rosie's!
[ All Chanting ] Kill the cook.
Kill the cook!
Kill the cook!
See what you've done?
"Father, you'd better talk to them."
- Not without a whip and a chair.
- I don't blame you.
This place is a cat's whisker from loco.
- [ Chanting Continues ]
- I'll take care of this.
"Okay, hold it."
Hold it down!
"Hold it down, everybody!"
"I was hoping we could keep this a secret, but I guess now's the time to tell you."
[ Clamoring ]
My associate and I have been planning a big surprise dinner party for tomorrow night.
"Oh, yeah?"
What kind of a party?
That's the surprise.
But I guarantee you... it will be spectacularly unforgettable.
Well it better be!
It better be!
What kind of a lamebrain scheme are you two hatching?
"- Oh-ho, Colonel, that would spoil the surprise."
"- Let's go, Beej."
This I gotta see.
Don't forget-- unforgettable.
"- You don't have a thing in mind, do you?"
- Even less than that.
David?
Keep going.
"[Man On TV] You're in a very small, select group of guys."
What is it that makes you successful... and all the others knocking on the doors not so successful?
[Man #2] I'm not so sure.
"As i travel, i see television guys who would make good game show hosts."
- But i don't tell 'em.
- [Laughter]
"To me, a game show host is the icing on the cake."
But the format is the cake.
No one -
[Man Talking]
I'll love you till the day i die.
Yes!
And again.
"[Man] At 2.15 that afternoon, Johnny Clay -"
"[TV Continues, Faint]"
- He's expecting me.
- Come in.
I don't know why I did it.
It all unraveled and then one thing happened after another.
Jesus.
"I'm still in shock, boss."
"I'm in so much trouble, Larry."
No man becomes wise without stepping on the soil of fools.
Right.
Right!
But I never claimed to be a -
That's good.
Where did you get that?
Is that from the Bible?
It's from this play I wrote in eighth grade about Evel Knievel.
- Oh.
Captain hunt.
There's one thing wrong with your ultimatum-
We can outmaneuver you in every way.
"Beka, seal the cockpit."
"Here we are,"
The revolt of the androids.
You knew it was coming.
I never got the memo.
"Harper... i was expecting a hangover, just not so soon."
"There's so much pain, harper,"
Just like in my nightmares.
"Yeah, listen, about that... we'll talk about it later."
"Right now,"
Dylan and your friends onandromedaneed us.
Argent?
He's gone there?
I believe so.
"And, harper,"
"When he kissed me, i knew"
"It wasn't love, like he said."
That's a mighty human thing to feel.
"But there's something else, harper."
"He also called me ""andromeda,"""
"And for the first time in my life, i knew... i know who i am."
"I am a warship,"
And i don't like running away from a fight.
Looks like you're going to get your chance.
Behind you.
"Back off, boys."
Beautiful but bad.
"My god, i am such a genius."
"It's still my job to protect you, harper."
He used to make me and brother fight in the backyard every day.
He would come home and drink a beer and watch us beat the shit out of each other.
And one day we just decided--
Why fight each other?
Why fight for free?
So we just left.
What else is going on in that head of yours?
I don't know.
I just can't help thinking that I should have been there for him.
I should have been there for Frankie.
What could you have done?
just been there.
I wake up Why the hell didn't I go with him?
I should have fucking went with him.
And then maybe that would have been you too.
Yeah.
But it haunts me.
I hear him calling my name just like when we were kids.
And I'm not there.
I loved my brother Frankie. especially around the old man.
Have you forgiven him?
I just--
I'm not afraid of him anymore.
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna stay here?
Would you stay here for me?
what's up?
I understand.
Saturday?
Okay.
yeah.
all right.
What if they come in?
I don't see why I can't piss here.
Because I do not want to see piss coming out the end of your cock.
- I could sit down and do it.
- What?
I do that sometimes.
"You know, for a treat."
"Oh, fuck, just get on with it then."
- Are you going yet?
"- I can't, you're putting me off."
"- Shit, who's that?"
- Northwood?
- Who is it?
- It's obviously me.
What is happening in here?
- Has Charlotte sorted it?
- No.
I've sorted it though.
- What have you done?
- My mum's gonna pick us up.
What?
"- Oh, this is tragic."
- Called your mom!
Your mum is coming to rescue us from the toilet of an under-18 disco because we're being bullied by 12-year-olds?
No-one must ever know about this.
"Si, go outside and take your beating from this child, and then we can leave."
I'd have taken him down if it weren't for Northwood.
How were you going to take him down?
Spunk in his eyes?
"Oh, shit."
What if Carli finds out about me and that girl?
"Oh, no!"
Attack!
Good dog...
"Oh, it likes eating buns!"
Shit!
"Oh, the thief is crying for catching thief!"
It's Fong who touched Miss Shiu's ass!
"Now, the truth is found!"
He can't imagine that the dog which is trained by him... will betray him because of my righteousness and its conscience!
It turns to charge against its master!
What a righteous dog!
Let's clap for it.
Lysee is a good dog.
Lysee is a good dog!
We've found a good dog named Lysee in China.
"Miss, do you want to talk to me?"
I'm sorry to make a mistake.
"I am so ignorant that,"
I was almost cheated by that bastard.
"By the way, you owe me something, huh?"
I wish to have chance to pay for it.
This is my student Foon.
Brother Foon.
He likes you so much.
"Master, you are disgusting!"
But you need not fall for him.
"Well, 3 pm tomorrow, come to my home on time."
Let's discuss what you'd pay for it.
What do you think?
I'll be there on time.
Let's go!
Let's go!
"Master, we've found it."
Did all that happen when you came to get the keys?
No.
We go back a long time.
I fucked it up.
And?
It's getting too complicated.
I've decided to move out.
"Don't worry, I'll cover you for the rent."
But that's unfair.
I didn't know about you and Anna.
- You're not to blame.
- Can I stay here tonight?
I can't sleep if I have to be alone.
No hanky-panky.
Scout's honour!
"I have to go, Sophie."
Sophie's sweet caress showed me I had to break the vicious circle.
"If not, -"
- Johan and I would end up like Pierre and Sophie.
"Lonely, bitter,   spitting harsh words at each other."
I understand.
Forever seeking comfort in strangers.
(cheerful pop music)
(bluesy rock guitar)
So much for wanting to break the vicious circle.
"If Camilla was a trap, he'd walked right into it."
Told you his odds were low.
"I was never, ever going to expose myself like this again."
(nightmare music)
(Anna sobbing)
Are you OK?
Come on.
Linda Farrell.
- Why do you smell like dope?
- I've been with a patient.
- We're hooked up to Mount Sinai?
- Beating the crap out of them.
- What are you doing?
- Playing Doom II.
- How long does it take to play?
- Months.
I've done thoracotomies that were less bloody.
He doesn't understand the educational value.
"Die, bastard."
Die.
Come on!
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.
I knew you'd come.
"- Sweetie, of course we would."
- I want to go home.
Your daughter will be in the hospital at least several days.
Excuse me.
- Will both of you stay with me?
"- Of course, sweetheart."
"And, Daddy will you come back to live with us?"
- Well....
- We'll talk about that later.
How could you let her ride her bike in the rain?
- Don't blame me for this.
- Who else let her do it?
I'm doing the best I can.
If you spent more time with her and less at the office with Sarah--
The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
Are you building a case to keep Brandon away from me?
No.
What are you... ?
Then why are you pumping Dani for information?
"You know I fell off the wagon, why not just come to me, Stef?"
I wasn't pumping Dani for...
"You didn't just drink, Mike, you got into a fight."
- You had blood on your hands.
- So what?
You afraid I'm gonna hurt Brandon or something?
"No, Mike, I'm worried about you."
I'm fine.
Ok?
- I'm getting it together.
- Where'd the blood come from?
It's stupid.
I got into a fight.
At the bar.
"Some guy was bothering the waitress, and..."
I must have broke his nose.
It was bleeding like crazy.
So you did...
So you didn't see Ana that night?
Is that what this is about?
You think it was her blood?
"You were so mad at her, Mike."
"Which is why I stayed away, just like we talked about."
"Yeah, you didn't talk to her?"
You didn't see her at all?
You didn't try and scare her off so she wouldn't turn Brandon in... ?
"Stef, I swear."
"I did not talk to Ana,"
Lance Corporal James Finn.
Stationed at Quantico.
Went UA when his unit was shipped to Iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
DUCKY:
"It won't be far, McGee."
"Had the trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay, I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to sketch itself.
Ow!
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney, Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes, Doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene, or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh, you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Although the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"Oh, geez!"
Hello.
Sorry...
Nicrophorus americanus.
"Also known as ""the carrion beetle."""
"In here, you little monkey."
Yes.
A reminder that Shakespeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
Only place I didn't try was the men's room.
- You try Munch's cell?
- Yeah.
No answer.
"You know, Dr. Swan had to make sure Kyle and the donor were okay."
Maybe there's a problem.
Come on.
What the hell is going on here?
"Casey, take Ms. Solwey out to the car."
Leave her out of this!
We didn't drag her into this.
"John, relax."
Relax.
Why'd you bring her here?
Amy's next on the transplant list.
That kidney would've been hers anyway.
"You're doing what we're trying to stop, John."
That kidney was bought and sold.
So let's just throw it away.
She dies.
I know that you care about her.
But you can't do this.
- If that was your son in there...
- It's not my son in there.
We're not talking about my son.
"When you collar James McGovern, you tell him your son's life is worth more than Kyle's."
"I gotta collar you, John."
You arranged this.
Novak saw you here.
You don't think Swan gonna give you up to get himself a better deal?
Why would I do that?
Did he ask you to put that kidney in Amy Solwey?
Give me 10 000 won.
How can there be a woman like you?
I'm not paying you.
You're not?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Wow!
Look at all these checks.
You don't need to tip.
Then...
I'm taking exactly 10 000 Won.
"I wish there was a subway station nearby, so I can change my clothes."
My hand phone!
I'm waiting for a phone call.
You...
Are you jealous?
Always asking me about my sponsor.
"If you're talking about money, I also have a lot of money."
I can surpass that old man completely.
The police have been secretly taking good care of him.
And he gives them a lot of bribes.
Bribes?
"The construction will receive bribes, we need some connection from inside, all the staff members take bribes."
Did you see it?
Did you see them taking money?
Hello.
There is a lady here asking for you to come to the parking lot.
She said her hand phone is in your car.
"Ah, she's crazy."
I don't know that woman.
I was the 10 000 Won person from earlier.
"Bye, dad."
"Hey, I already know where I'm going to hang this."
Dad?
Yeah.
"What, Sarah?"
What is it?
I don't think I wanna go.
"Hey, what is this?"
What're you trying to do here?
I just came to say hello.
No need to get testy.
You and I both know I cannot change Sarah's path.
I can't influence her to make a different decision.
"I can't this, I can't that."
"It's all about you, isn't it?"
What?
Wonder why that is.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"Where's Sarah in this equation, Tom?"
You're not making the choice.
She is.
"Come on, that is pure semantics, and you know it."
The only reason that she's changing her mind is because I'm a different person.
"So, you know what?"
"Actually, yes, it has everything to do with me."
"Hey, dad, what's going on?"
Nothing.
"Oh, I was just describing to the officer about my wallet, my lost wallet."
"So, thank you, officer."
"Well, we'll be sure to put every resource we have on this, just for you."
Let's go.
Marjorie?
I travels promptly if I notice that I embarrass you in anything.
I travels promptly if I notice that I embarrass you in anything.
You think of yourself only.
"And...and you do not think about the colds, the big famishing winter coming."
- And...the wind will blow.
- And the partisans come then.
"-There is a knife in their belt, there is a knife in their mouth."
- And what there will be with our Gyula?
- Daddy...
- My sweet good Lajos.
Will be so good...major lord?
Yeah.
"To dream better one neither maybe, dear Tót."
"If a snake gobbles up himself, /what is a curio/ remain his after a snake greatness space?"
- Hello Lajos.
- Here the fire chief!
- Hurray the fire chief!
- Daddy do not bellow!
- Hurray fire chief!
- Shut up!
And the major lord!
Hurray major lord!
It is not necessary to support me.
Stop!
Airplane!
Get down!
He sleeps.
Go away.
Go children.
Go.
You.
Major lord!
- You may.
- Now we're talking.
I'll start here.
This is good.
Can you tell me why grandma married the 4 of them?
Mrs. Maria Cecilia always liked to pick her husbands.
She also liked to boss them around.
She was so bossy that they all left.
"The one she really, truly loved was the one over there, with the mustache."
Maybe because he was the one who picked her.
"Soon enough, she got bossy."
"Told him to get rid of the mustache and told him to stop working, which he didn't like."
"When he left her, he said:"
"""I'll come back when you quit bossing me around!"""
Mrs. Maria Cecilia got really sad.
"She decided that from that point on, she'd care only for her granddaughter."
"Only her, and no one else."
Me?
- You.
Can I have some more?
- Sure.
Are you okay?
Wake up!
Say something!
Wake up!
Grandma!
Say something.
"What's the matter, darling?"
My present died.
- How come?
- She ate too much.
"She never had enough to eat, but there was too much here."
I can't believe it.
-She--
-You don't think a psychiatrist...?
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"-Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
-Yeah.
So in the meantime try not to worry.
How?
"The edema affected her brain, you understand?"
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, talking to the radio."
-You should've called me when it happened.
-Listen.
Regular hospital not gonna put up with that.
"We give her a shot and bring her here until the doctors fix up her leg, then we take her right out."
"Two or three months and she's out, good as new."
-Miss?
-Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.
-Are you a relative?
"-Yes, I am her brother."
He is her son.
Just a minute.
"You know, it's funny."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of there."
"You go in, Dimmy."
I'll wait for you outside.
"Instead of feeling sad thinking about silly past, I'm peaceful  happy now."
You bloody!
Sister!
What's this?
Have you gone mad?
Why are you bringing to our home?
What's your game?
My plan is...
Are you playing games?
May I tell you?
You fool!
Who are you?
Are you trying to play with me in India and my brother-in-law here?
Has he forgotten the past?
Is that why he didn't recognise me?
Hey Kick!
Now I got you in my hands.
"Give me some of your revenge, allow me to stay with him,"
I'll make him see stars in day time.
"One small request, don't tell anyone here about our story in India."
You too don't tell anyone about our plan.
Have you lost your memory?
Now I'll give you kick of the life.
Sleeping like a log.
I'll give him the shock of his life.
What's it Prakash?
Unable to sleep.
"Come, sleep."
- What happened?
- What's that?
This...
I hate any cloth on my body when I sleep except this blanket.
"Well, the hit I can take."
"It's the not swinging back, that's what bothers me."
"Standing up for the truth the way you did,"
It's what I've been telling the American people
I'm gonna do for them.
That's why I'm in this.
"John, I don't know what to say."
Stop trying to argue yourself out of a job.
What's up?
"Royo, it's me,"
Aisha.
It's about the deal.
"Isaac ain't gonna bitch out, is he?"
You said this was happening.
He's still in.
"But listen up,"
"I know you ain't down with the split, never have been."
- Maybe I can do better.
- You?
Money ain't coming in like it was.
"That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together."
"If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears."
You still there?
I'm here.
"Well, I'm still listening."
Good.
"Okay, he's got it."
"Oh, no."
- What?
- Locke signed in downstairs.
He was just bumped up to head of field ops.
He has a debrief scheduled with Mullins.
"You can see that, right?"
"Yeah, I mean, you're obviously upset about what happened."
"I am upset, Luke."
I'm very upset.
I don't have to play these games.
Of course not.
This is fucking fucked up.
"It's what you said, Chris."
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"" It's what you said to Felix!"
What are you trying to say?
- That I sent the postcard?
"- Well, I know I didn't send it."
"You bitch, you're gonna set me up, aren't you?"
- You're gonna tell him about the fight.
"- Calm down, Chris."
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Chris!
Shut the hell up.
That arsehole is going to get us killed!
He says he didn't send it.
"He said, ""Truth or Dare, bitch."""
Did you?
It's not a secret.
Other people heard.
They could've passed it on.
"Yeah, but you're the one that said it."
So what if I said it?
Why the fuck would I write on a postcard for Christ's sake?
"- It's because I chucked you, isn't it?"
- What?
I said it was 'cause of the way you treated Felix.
I said that was why I was dumping you.
"She's a fraud, Brian."
A fraud!
She didn't write any of her songs.
"Well, so, that's the case with a lot of singers."
It's a very common industry practice.
"Well, then you're all a bunch of frauds, aren't you?"
A bunch of frauds and charlatans.
You want to be a puppet?
"Then sing for your life, puppet."
Come on.
♪ Spread your tiny wings and fly away!

(muffled singing)
"Come on, Anne, sing along."
You know it.
"You didn't write it, but you know it, bitch."
STEWIE AND ANNE:

"Hey, Meg, you here for the expired hot dogs?"
"No, Carl, I'm looking for Chris."
I've looked everywhere and I can't find him.
"Uh, I haven't seen him but I'll keep an eye out."
(knocking on glass)
"Hey, bozos, what do you think of this?"
(laughing):
"I did, I did it!"
You're crazy man.
You're so crazy.
"(gunfire, men shouting on TV)"
I thought I told you to clean up in here?
And why aren't you dressed?
Where are you going?
We have some business in town.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
- I trust that you'll keep an eye on things?
- So I'm the babysitter now.
"Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another."
- So you say.
"- I'll watch things, Miss Pearl."
"Thank you, Harper."
"I'm thinking nothing huge, dinner at the Grill, maybe a late movie..."
A double date?
"Two pair, out on a Friday night, coupled."
"Yeah, a double date."
- You think that's a good idea?
- Why not?
"You know, we all haven't gone out before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us."
"The couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt and me and I just think it's important that we get over it."
I don't know.
"You know what, I think that sounds like a great idea."
- You do?
"- Yeah, yeah."
A nice evening out with friends.
"Sounds fun, as in fun."
Hm?
- A double date it is.
- Okay.
Heh.
So we will see you tonight.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
"Ha, ha."
The band is too loud.
"Ten minutes, Yuri."
Ten minutes.
All I asked was that you hold Mikhail... for ten minutes.
Is that a long time?
No.
That is a very short time.
How long can you hold your breath?
"I know a fellow in Odessa once who could hold his breath... for five minutes, 33 seconds."
Did Mikhail talk to anyone while he was here?
"Nicholas, please."
The man is trying to speak.
He was talking... to her.
"So, what did you and Mikhail talk about?"
I told him he had a phone call.
The caviar is fresh tonight.
Did I tell you what a pretty girl you are?
"Let me ask you something, sweetheart."
Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you lie to me?
I will never lie to you.
"Because if you lie to me, pretty girl... you won't be pretty anymore."
Get back to work.
All she needs is a good f-
What are you doing over there?
"Oh, Mikhail, I missed you."
You're so tense.
I'll help loosen you up.
What's this?
You playing hard to get?
Is this a game?
Fine.
Have it your way.
"Okay, Tony."
I never should have doubted you.
"Well, you didn't."
You're helping me.
"No, I-I mean before-- when you said... this guy was suspicious."
I just thought I knew him.
I still don't know why.
Grab his arm.
What?
"Yeah, just don't touch his skin."
Oh.
Perfect.
Bandage?
Right here.
Okay...
I can't get over your... speed.
"You used to spend months researching, analyzing, planning-- now you just... go."
"Jake, I'm still the same person."
The same person having a conversation over a dead body.
"You guys know I'm still here, right?"
Any luck on those prints?
"Uh, yeah."
"We got one, McGee."
Sending it straight to Abby.
Is that what I think it is?
Low-tech but effective.
Who's lead officer on this wing?
Uh...
"I'm real sorry, Lieutenant."
I don't know how we missed that.
"Well, the good news is, there are other cameras pointed in this direction-- we just have to look at that footage."
Restrooms stay closed until we can an M.E. here.
"- Oh, no worries."
"- Ok, uh..."
"You know, there's something I wanted to ask you, something Brandon told me about the night before he was attacked."
Mike was drinking?
Yeah.
"He had a little slip, but he's been sober ever since, going to meetings every day."
"Oh, that's great."
Good for him.
Brandon said that he was in a fight.
"Yeah, I guess so."
He blacked out so he didn't really remember anything.
"Oh, gosh..."
But there was blood on his hands when you found him?
That's...
A little.
He was fine.
- Was it his blood?
- Stef.
"If you have questions about Mike's sobriety, you have to ask him."
Of course.
Of course I should.
You're right.
Sorry.
Thank you so much for the coffee.
Appreciate it.
"All right, Jude, just keep your eye on the ball, buddy."
Takes a little getting used to.
"Just hang in there, kid."
"Um, you might wanna hang on to the bat a little tighter too."
"Here, grab another one, all right?"
"Hey, Connor, let's go, come on."
"Throw a token in there, let's see what you got."
You're Marta Kozlenko.
He was my father?
I lured my father to his death?
It wasn't your fault.
"He wanted it to look like a kidnapping, not a defection."
Somehow the KGB got onto us.
"We'll go to Zurich, first thing in the morning."
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
For what?
For all of this.
"Maybe if I hadn't called you or taken you out of your life, maybe..."
It would've happened anyway.
Whoever's after us needs my numbers too and you weren't just part of the job.
"I've always cared about you, I always will."
Marta.
Alright we have to get outta here.
What's wrong?
Police are downstairs.
We made the paper.
(speaking German)
(speaking German)
You speak English?
We need you to drive us to Zurich.
We're not gonna hurt you.
But my deliveries.
I have customers.
Today we're you're only customers.
Don't even think about it.
"Thank you, Jann."
I hope we didn't cause you too much trouble.
"Appreciate it if you can, uh, wait a couple hours before calling' the police."
Okay.
The police said the safe was locked.
The old man held out on the fucking guy.
As plain as day.
"Carlos, you want another helping?"
Carlos?
Carlos?
- You want more ham?
"- Oh no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
See you in a couple of days.
"Mickey, wait."
"Carlos, there's someone I want you to see."
Let's go.
"Come on, help me clean up."
Sean:
"Six months ago he came to me and asked for a loan, to stay afloat."
He shouldn't have been in that position.
I shouldn't have given it to him.
"The thing is, this is not a small loan, 25 grand."
Yeah.
Come on.
"There's a bodega on every corner of the Heights, Carlos."
What makes Eddie's profitable?
Eddie!
Why is Eddie in debt?
Eddie.
"If he sells the place, I get my money back, and I'm not forced to have this conversation."
We both know he ain't gonna sell it.
We both know he ain't gonna be able to work it for quite some time... if ever!
"The way I see out of this, for all of us... is you take over."
"The bodega, it's a cash cow."
"Erica, you were right to be upset."
Really?
Yeah.
"And also, to answer your question, when are you allowed to decide what we talk about?"
When you're ready.
"And apparently, that's now."
So...
Let's talk about Kai.
Ok.
"Ok, what's the catch?"
No catch.
Sit.
Please.
"Well, he... he is withdrawing from everything,"
And I feel like it's my fault.
Why?
Because you told him that you felt something for him?
"And he thinks that changes everything, and I told him it doesn't have to, but he--he doesn't listen."
"And you think that he's wrong-- that after your confession, that you can continue to be just friends."
Yes.
Because I made it very clear to him that--
That you were not breaking up with Ethan.
Right.
I know.
What?
It's funny.
"You know, a year ago, you and I couldn't have this conversation."
"You know, I would have shut it down and, uh, you would have dropped it."
You would've done as you were told.
Heh.
Yeah.
Things are different now.
It'd be better to say I was the subject.
Clara wanted to talk about me...
And boy she talked...
Did she say you were selfish?
That's what she always say.
If you think she's right..
-She's right about that.
I don't know exactly what selfish means.
Someone who loves himself more than others.
"Yeah, but that happens to everyone."
Some of them realizes and others don't.
Did she just say that?
No.
She talked more about...
I don't know!
I remember it was getting dark..
And I started crying.
I don't know if Clara noticed that.
Did you cry?
I've never seen you crying.
Clara talked and talked...
And she was making an image of me that I couldn't recognize.
Has this happened to you before?
Yes.
No.
That couldn't happen to you.
Why do you ask me then?
Clara said everything was over.
That it'd be better if we don't try it again.
That everything became an useless effort.
And what did you say?
I didn't speak much.
"Where are you getting cold, eh?"
-Mishanya!
- Leave me alone!
I awfully respect you.
Judge foryourself.
What makes a man happy during the war?
-What?
- Look.
"To stay awayfrom bullets, to have a good nap and a hearty meal."
-Yes.To receive a letter.
- That's true.
-Stepa!
-What?
-What do you think...
"- l'm not thinking now, I'm drinking tea."
-There is no happiness at war.
"- Nobody has asked foryour opinion, man."
You are too young.
I'm leaving in 30 minutes.Will you take a bath?
Then get ready.
"No, I'm not going to take a bath."
I'm no bloody Onegin.
What?
Can you tell me for sure when we are going out on a mission?
Does your ex-con soul long for some action?
You can not even kill a hen and you talk about missions.
I had no knife then.
"When I'm armed, I'll do anything."
-Stepa!
-What?
Could you demonstrate to him how prisoners are taken?
OK. I'll pretend to be a sentinel... and you'll attack me from behind.
"Do not stand so, do something!"
Say something.
Tell him I feel ...
Wait!
I have tried to something.
"Call someone, right?"
"Why do not you write in: 'complaints and suggestions. """
"Silent, we are in trouble!"
Problems?
Crocodiles are good speakers!
"Addons Max, you're breaking the rules."
"This time to visit your friend, Allan."
What is ...
Asshole.
Addons I tell you what just seen was real.
"Addons Breaking the rules again, and I assure you kill someone else."
Addons It's time to play.
You killed an innocent man.
in cold blood for no reason!
Addons I disagree.
Involve friends when you break the rules.
"Addons And I will continue to kill more people who have no sin, if it does not follow them."
Addons Thank you for your cooperation.
Do you think that it is false?
I do not know ...
God ...
Lake Casino.
We in Ireland should not be in here.
We have in the Atlantic.
What does it mean?
That our destiny is not New York.
What are you doing?
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky I do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
"I don't know if it's my old ears, or the subway underneath."
- Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
- He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury..."
I heard about that.
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't want to hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
- Why?
- Because he's my boy.
"There's oil under that vacant lot, Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politic me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President you're going to forget who got you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... and I happened to look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
What?
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
ORWELL:
Trouble in the dream team?
(BANG)
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
Come on!
ANNA:
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
"That's a good thing, eh?"
"No, thin like you're not eating properly."
Oh.
"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we going to do this now?
- Good night for a date.
- Our tenth anniversary.
- How do you know it was a date?
I just wanted to see you.
"I haven't asked you anything about whether or not you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to, Harry, cos I just can't."
He's a friend.
- Oh...
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"That's very convenient for him, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
- What?
Aren't you?
What happened all of a sudden?
I'm scared.
"I'm afraid of losing you, too."
But you're doing all you can to lose me.
Doborobon.
I was waiting for you.
- They released me.
- Isn't it too soon?
"Yes, but I insisted."
"Goodbye, Donna."
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
Did you speak to him?
What did he say?
Nothing.
"I just remembered how you once told me,"
"""Doborobon, it's a shame that your life is like water."
"""Clear, tasteless and odorless."
Change a little.
"Surprise yourself."""
But I never believed in that.
"People never really change, Mom."
They just start lying to themselves.
"You can go now, Morn."
I promise I won't bother you any more.
I just wish you could come here for a moment and explain to us why you did all this.
"Well, now I'm in your house."
I have a lot of spare time so I'm pondering.
I'll probably understand something in the end.
"Previously, on ""Satisfaction""..."
- Who's in the conference room?
Ok.
I'll have Sgt. Whitfield search the Zumwalt house for a similar hourglass.
It's Hotch.
Ellie Zumwalt is out of surgery and awake.
Thank you.
"We appreciate you talking to us, Mrs. Zumwalt."
We know this is a difficult time.
"My husband is dead, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
We're very sorry.
What about Josie?
Is my daughter all right?
We're hopeful.
That's why it's important that you tell us everything you can about what happened.
"I was asleep, and then there was a scream."
It was Josie.
"I woke up, but my eyes wouldn't open."
Josie kept screaming.
"And every time I went to where I thought she was, the scream came from somewhere else."
"We realize you couldn't see well, but could you make out any features about this man?"
No.
He--he wore something on his face.
"They were like, um,"
"I don't know, glasses."
Like eyeglasses?
"No, no."
Bigger than that.
"More like, um, like goggles."
That's all I could make out.
Did he speak?
Only at the end.
Eleven.
"She sparks every time, she does."
"That rifle does you credit, Hagman."
"Thank you, Mr Sharpe."
Oil sir
The secret is not to spare the oil.
So General Wellesley says.
Aye.
Ow!
Damn knee!
"Old leg wound, Hagman."
Rain plays the devil with it.
Aye.
Brown paper and paraffin oil is the only cure for a contrary leg.
I has a contrary arm on account of an argument with a French hussar...
"Oh, bugger it!"
...which we had at the Battle of Vimieiro.
"And which argument he lost, on account of me blowing his head off his neck."
But it do itch fierce of a rainy day.
And I find nothing work s so well as paraffin oil and best brown paper.
- Aye.
"- Oh, aye."

"She's beautiful, is she not?"
Yes.
You never loved a woman?
No.
Not after I paid for it.
So she's like no woman you ever met?
I think you should try to forget her.
"Because, you see she's no longer a woman."
She was the best student in Salamanca.
You know that photo that you sent me?
I dug around and apparently Shou Saito took out a patent for a computer brain interface last year.
How are you real?
I don't...
"Okay, fuck."
I don't...
They brought you here!
"You are, you're real, and they brought you here, and they're trying to fuck with me."
"Nice try, good try."
I get it.
It's part of the test.
His patent got rejected outright.
"They said it was insane, it was dangerous."
Wow.
Really?
How much are they paying you?
Honestly.
Cos you're killing it right now.
- Have they given you something?
"- Sorry, I thought you were fake."
"But now I know you're real, I'm being a really terrible host."
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.
"- Cooper, what I want to do is..."
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.
- Cooper!
"- Sonja, relax, okay?"
Give it up.
"I know, the jig's up, okay?"
Let it go.
"Look, Cooper, there's more."
Five people have disappeared in the past year.
"Yes, okay."
Thank you.
"You've seen the girl, now let's make this thing happen."
Jacob wants me to stay with her.
"He doesn't care about the money, he wants his daughter."
And he wants to remember who she is.
Where's the injection gun?
"Oh yes, this is vintage Jacob."
Always loves a chess game.
And always three moves ahead.
I have it.
It stays here.
It's the only way he'll give you his numbers.
You'll meet him at Fraumunster Church.
And what stops me from killing you right now?
Because you're a smart man.
"You're gonna meet Jacob, he'll call, you'll have us released and after that, you'll have the numbers and Jacob."
"You may have lost your memory Marta, but, uh, you still have balls."
"If you haven't heard from me in an hour, kill them both."
She really needs to go to the bathroom.
Do I look like I fucking care?
Just tell me where it is.
Fuck.
The end of the corridor.

"Oh, shit."
I'll walk.

Hey.

"- hi, uncle bob."
"Guys, this is too much."
What's too much?
Let's just get it together and chill out a little.
"Excuse me, I don't mean to disturb you."
My name's Dave.
Hi.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
That's a great name.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Do you have a cell phone I could use?
Why?
Someone's got to call God and let him know one of his angels is missing.
"Wow, that is the worst line I've ever heard."
"Well, what do you want from me?"
I've been out of the game for a while.
I've been slumming it with a really hot redhead.
Now you're getting closer.
"Dave, if you're here to be an olive branch for Jason,"
I am not gonna talk about it tonight.
"I'm not here to talk about anything,"
I just want to see my wife.
Let's go.
I can't just leave these two.
I think they'll survive.
We sure will.
They are so lucky.
Now this next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"Everybody, up!"
"Let's keep this party going, y'all!"
"Maybe we ought to wait by the exit, so when people come out, you know..."
"The search party looked for you for three days, but they had to turn back because of the aftershocks."
[Groans]
"You could hear them, couldn't you?"
[Moaning sadly]
"I cannot imagine the pain, the feeling of abandonment."
"But, Ian, killing is not the answer."
"[Moans, huffs]"
Stay back.
We have it under control.
"Ian, please."
Come with us.
We can get you help.
[Whimpers]
"Ian, no, please."

I can't imagine what it took to survive an injury like that.

Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
It was the noise.
It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
Poor thing.
Perhaps.
"But I cannot Sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
No.
"Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
Thank you.

What kind of disease is it?
I-I don't know.
Elka?
"You know, I'm, I'm happy to lie to win, but I-I don't wanna lose my hair or anything."

"Ah, luckily, this disease hasn't affected my wit."
"Oh, that's will."
My baby's here.
"Hi, honey!"

It's good to see you.
"- Good to see you, sweetie."

She's tethered!
Someone is hiding her here.
"Travis most likely, sir."
Alright.
You must have stumbled upon her lair.
You approached her.
"She felt threatened, so she attacked you."
Should I bring her back to the cells?
"No, no."
The Toronto Asylum under Dr. Ogden's care will be best.
Right.
"Do you think she's the killer, sir?"
Certainly seems capable of it.
I'd have to agree.
Alright.
(Fen grunting)
"Fen, I'm going to put you to sleep for a little while."
(indistinct chatter)
(Dr. Ogden exhales.)
My goodness!
Hard to believe it's the same girl.
Her persona was very much exaggerated.
Her hair and body unwashed...
That's quite a scar.
Yes.
From an animal attack some years ago.
Mr. Travis claims that she was mauled by a wolf.
"It's quite possible, William."
Her teeth have been deliberately filed down into points.
I took an impression.
It matches our victim's bite mark.
Open up!
- Where is he?
- Calm down.
- Wes!
Get down here.
"- Hollis, he's asleep."
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- You think this was my idea?
CPS just dumped him on me.
- And you need to start getting your shit together.
I can't keep playing babysitter for you.
- I can take care of my boys.
"- I'm just taking Wes for a little while, that's all."
- I can take care of my kids.
- Really?
Can you?
"Rebecca would be so heartbroken, and you know it."
She loved those boys way too much to see you abandon them the way you did.
- You told them?
That's what this is about?
You told that caseworker?
- Back up.
"Back up, Hollis."
I didn't say a damn word.
Just calm down.

The Oracle's words stand as a warning.
A prophecy.
Sparta will fall.
All of Greece will fall.
And Persian fire will reduce Athens to cinder.
"For Athens is a pile of stone and wood... and cloth and dust and, as dust, will vanish into the wind."
Only the Athenians themselves exist.
And the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable.
Only the Athenians exist.
And only stout wooden ships can save them.
Wooden ships and a tidal wave of heroes' blood.

"I work for my dad, and I don't have much time for a social life."
"But the other day,"
I met a guy named Scott who owns this bar.
I'm not here to flirt.
What's gonna happen next?
You gonna ask me to dinner?
"No, I..."
It's all right.
I always get hit on when I wear this T-shirt.
- Think my eyes are up here.
- I wa...
I-I...
"For the record, I wasn't looking."
And the only reason I was in his bar is because our biggest client wants to buy it from him.
"So, I took Scott to dinner, but just to talk business."
"Okay, we got a little distracted."
"Meanwhile, there's this other guy from the office,"
Stephen.
That's him.
My dad would love it if I were with him.
"I mean, Stephen's a nice guy, but there's not a lot of passion between us."
Back to Scott.
"Precisely, as he has no memory, he says nothing."
It's better.
"Go, now."
I have to open my shop at 9 am.
Let's go!
Go and have the stew from last night warmed up.
It will be better when we have the new Mexican paper.
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Montparnasse, quick!"
"Yes, sir."
Good morning.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"Come, I've already ordered."
I read your article yesterday.
"If my brother is alive, can I see him?"
I never wrote he was alive.
I just assumed he was.
"In fact, I worked deductively."
"At last, he's alive or not?"
"In reality, since last night, I'm... sure he is dead."
I even have proof.
I found this medallion in the sewers that serve the courthouse.
It's horrible.
Is it the medallion he always carried with him?
Yes.
I gave it to him.
"It is the effigy of St. Jacques, his patron saint."
I brought it back from a pilgrimage to Compostela.
Why weren't you more clear in your article?
You are right.
I should've speak to you before writing it.
Ok.
"Let's wait 2, 3 weeks."
All right.
"And the lies she's been telling, that's part of it, huh?"
Lies?
"Like saying her bed's shaking, that stuff?"
"Have you ever known your daughter to swear, to use obscenities?"
"No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar...
"Similar to things like her lying, it's uncharacteristic for her--"
I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her..."
Goddamn cunt.
I can't believe it.
Oh.
"Now, she-- you don't think a psychiatrist?"
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
Ok.
"So, in the meantime, try not to worry."
- All right.
"Bye, Mom."
I left a wake up call for 9.
Do you want something to eat?
You mean this is one of those basement breakfast places?
I don't know how long we can keep doing this.
"Well, it won't be long."
- You'd go back to your foster parents?
- Not a chance.
But I've saved up enough to get out to Arizona.
I have a friend in Flagstaff.
You gonna miss me?
"It was nice knowing when something goes bump in the night, it's you."
What have you got to be afraid of?
Forgot this.
Honey?
Put on gloves if you're gonna do the dishes.
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't do this anymore.
"Last night after I left, I felt awful."
I'm sorry for what I did and what almost happened.
I should have figured it out.
At least I should have listened to you.
"Yeah, well, it was terrible but all I could think about was my mom."
I'm sorry.
I was so mean.
"- Well, I had it coming."
- No.
I was thinking.
A could have given that ticket to mom but they made you do it to make it hurt more.
- Bye.
No way.
My mom will already be on my last nerve.

The last thing that I need...
Hi!
We are so happy that you are with us.
I like your track suit.
"I must say, you are very beautiful."
I like your size.
"Okay, that was creepy."
It's no less creepy than you hitting on my mom.
You're not sure.
"I'm sure, Lena."
I know.
I feel them.
"- Oh, Saul."
- We close the shop today.
I don't know how he keeps pullin' that mess off.
"- Yeah, well, neither does he."
- Hm?
"It's all in the subconscious, TC."
- Haven't you heard of body language?
- Body language?
The body can tell you all kinds of stuff without you even knowing.
"You don't believe me, huh?"
You see the way he's lowering' his head?
"The body's saying he's vulnerable, and the ladies love it."
Watch.
"Any second now, she'll throw her arms around his neck and bury her head right in his chest."
Huh!
"Well, for a guy that don't know what he's doin', he sure do it good."
Wuh-oh.
"Hey, she got a little body language of her own."
"Yeah, well, that's obvious."
"- Thanks for the coffee, Rick."
- OK.
"Take care, TC."
"Shouldn't have lowered your head, boy."
Shouldn't have lowered my head?
"Why is it when I find out what people hire me to find out, they take it out on me?"
"I don't know but, here, put some ice on it."
That's very funny.
"Hey, Saul."

"You know, you just can't come walking in to somebody's motorhome like this."
"Sorry, Mike."

Yeah.
"Hey, what's the matter, Billy?"
Never mind.
Is it mike?
Do you like him more than Dad?
"Billy, I like them both in different ways."
"I'll always have strong feelings for your dad 'cause he gave me you, didn't he?"
"Yeah, well, Dad's better looking, and he's smarter."
"Well, Mike's real smart too, he really is."
Are you going to marry him?
I don't know.
"A whole lot depends on you, partner."
"If you do, we have to move to Arizona, and I'll miss my friends, and I'll never see Dad."
"Well, you'll see your father."
"He'll come down all the time and you can go up and visit him, really."
"You like him, don't you?"
"Yeah, I do."
"Billy, just promise me that you'll give Mike a chance."
"I mean, that's all he wants."
"Well, I'll try."
That's all I wanted to hear.
I love you.
"Okay, if that means that Jackson could use a few thousand hours of therapy, I could've told you that myself."
What if...
It has something to do with his parents?
His real parents.
"Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?"
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Ah...
Ow!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
- So what happened?
- I don't know.
There was a short-circuit...
- I can't believe that.
- Suri.
Wait.
Suri.
- It cut out.
- What cut out?
There was a short
- Ben just told me.
Everything went down.
Why weren't you honest with me?
I looked like an idiot in there.
- I'm sorry.
"- How am I supposed to do my job, knowing you were at the casino the night Lau died?"
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet, once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I've got to where I am, Harry."
Everything I've learnt has come from you these two years but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me.
Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn't be quite sure who was interviewing who.
"Yeah, you have to think the way they do."
- Should be quite easy for you.
- You'd be a smart arse if you were smart.
Trouble in the dream team?
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
What?
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
It's a pet scheme of mine.
- A recreation spot for the kids.
"- Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?"
"No, it's for the big fellas too."
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's helped to keep the kids from becoming...
Hoodlums like me?
- You've cost me a lot of prayer.
- I've been in kind of a retreat myself.
- Yes.
Will you be here for some time?
- Depends.
I got a little business to attend.
- I gotta find a place to live.
- Get a room here in the parish.
- Not a bad idea.
No place like home.
"- Yes, and it's great to have you home."
- I came back to take a look at your kisser.
- Stick around and take a lot of them.
This is Maggione's.
Go in and get a furnished room.
"Remember her, don't you?"
Took a lot of good lead pipe out of that cellar.
Church is just around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.
- See you at Mass Sunday?
- Sure.
I'll help you with your collection.
- It's a deal.
- Fair enough.
- Mrs. Maggione at home?
- What do you want?
You can read my mind!
You really understand me.
You talk in such a romantic way!
"It's late, let's go to bed."
That's good.
You first.
"No, you first..."
Come on!
"No, I mean, I dare not, I really dare not."
"Come on, just give me some face."
"No, I..."
"Alright, I'll listen to you."
I think my husband doesn't like me any more.
"We have married for 7 years, and I went to Britain for one year."
He didn't look at my eyes when he talked to me.
"I can't help, so I didn't look at his eyes when I talked to him too."
"Foon, he sent me to university and wanted me to study law, actually, I studied something else."
What's that?
Fashion design.
What kind of subject is it?
Needlework.
Woo!
What a wonderful world.
The world has changed a lot!
Even needlework can be a subject in the university!
So you should go out to see the world.
You've rung my bell!
A man should fight for his future!
I think I should go somewhere!
"Maybe the nearest city, Hong Kong."
Are you going to Hong Kong?
"Yes, Master."
"Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up."
"I'll take her, Jake."
Yeah?
"Thanks, Peyton."
Glad to.
"Alright, gather around."
Where's Nathan?
"Tim, you're his girlfriend, where is he?"
"I don't know, coach."
He was at school today.
Alright.
I've got some offensive sets worked out here.
Line up at the low stacks.
So I had an idea.
Okay.
Remember when I read that Steinberg book?
Steinbeck.
"Yeah, that guy."
And then you did something that I wanted.
"Oh yeah, yeah."
"Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded?"
But in a fun way.
I'm thinking we should try that again.
"Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first."
"Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you."
And I want you to know... almost everything about me.
"- What's going on, Brooke?"
- Nothing.
I just...
"I want to know you better, Luke."
"So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along, and then we trade."
Are you busy after practice tomorrow?
How is that thing?
"If somebody, like, does a little flick to it,"
Will it-- blow on that sign and see if it blows over.
[Blowing]
MAN:
Did you guys dig deep?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"The astrological signs are down,"
But the signs are up.
Cold pizza after 10 hours of straight shooting.
It was cold pizza.
INTERVIEWER:
"Well, if you'll remember, the first five hours"
"Today, we didn't shoot at all."
It wasn't your fault.
"Yeah, but food is not determined,"
"Like, by how footage we shoot."
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]
It's usually determined by how long the day goes by.
INTERVIEWER:
"How's the experience been so far, Mike?"
"It fucking sucks, man. [laughs]"
"I'm sleeping bad, losing 20 pounds a week."
MAN:
"Oh, that's not [inaudible]."
"Yeah, actually, I need to lose the weight."
So it's all right.
INTERVIEWER:
So you love Troma?
I love Troma.
I'm excited to do the next one.
[Laughter]
Me.
... who has dedicated his entire life...
How would you like to be lmogene's godfather?
... to himself.
You must be joking.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"The thing is, a person's life is like a TV show."
"Oh, my God."
- Can I come in?
- No.
"I was the star of ""The Will Show""."
"And ""The Will Show"" wasn't an ensemble drama."
You will end up childless and alone.
"Both fingers crossed, yeah."
And then something terrible happened.
Something I'd tried to avoid all my life.
"This year, Will's life is going to change."
"Alone, bad."
"Friend, good."
He's reaching out.
I want to go out with her.
- I'd like her to be my girlfriend.
- Brilliant!
"Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
He fancies you.
He told me.
"From the producers of ""Meet the Parents""."
I think I killed a duck.
"Jesus, what a family."
I was in some strange territory.
Was I frightened?
So if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
From your Valentine's bitch.
PS:
"And on my face."""
"That's my favourite, I like the way she remembered the face."
It's funny how all these cards seem to be in the same handwriting.
Your admirers are either very young or have severe learning difficulties.
Which is possible.
The handwriting's bad cos they were strumming one out as they wrote 'em.
Not you writing with your left hand?
You're just jealous cos I got loads and you got none.
- I got a card.
- If it's your nan it doesn't count.
- I didn't get any then.
- I did get a card.
A proper one.
- Total bollocks.
I have an infarct.
-An infarct?
-A ass infarct.
-A ass infarct?
-You are really vulgar.
It is an infarct ass.
-Its a joke.
You do not get upset.
"-No, clear that no."
If it passes a ass not it I can watch?
"We go, you make the peace."
-I do not want.
-It is truth what they say?
-What?
That you have chosen Medicine to study the birds.
Then it had to make Veterinary medicine?
no?
"Not them birds, ""love birds"","
Those that flies around the asses.
It is a old fashioned joke.
"We go, boys."
Prof. Cicchirini he is on the verge of arriving.
"You hear, you who you know everything to it, I can bathe if I have diarrhoea?"
"Yes, if you have much."
"We go, it is behind schedule."
I always have much.
"Italy, Italia."
"Land of saints, poets, navigators."
"You goes, never had said it to me."
"Good, I first do not try to be."
"You hear, Moroni, you cannot be here, if you sees Prof. him Ciotti, trouble is armed."
"It does not matter to me, I assume the risk."

We have reached course delta red 2.
"New heading locked in, all systems functioning."

[DOOR OPENING]
"Ah, come on in."
I could do with some company.
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.
I'll just finish marking up this.
"There it is, look."
Circling every two minutes.
- When did you pick it up?
- Just before I called you.
It's circling all the time?
Yes.
Zen says it's a Mark Three Galaxy Class cruiser.
Galaxy Class?
"That's outer planets manufacture, isn't it?"
"Right, but Mark Three went out of production at least fifty years ago."
Getting any signals from them?
"No, she's as quiet as a grave."
Probably guidance control systems
That ship's in trouble.
It's the only thing that makes any sense.
- You think so?
- Mmm.
"All right, we'd better take a look at her."
"Zen, abort course programs."
Take us in to 200 spacials and match vectors.
"Okay,first batch of gold purchased nine months ago and paid for with a money order."
-The second batch... -that was abby.
She was searching non-standard databases with the thirdoman's dna.
She got a hit on a bone marrow donor bank.
Pull it up.
That's not what I expected.
Her father died of leukemia.
Pick her up.
Take dinozzo with you.
You interrogated her and didn't pick up she had sex with finn?
"It was an interview,not an interrogation-- and excuse me if my brain didn't go to the sex place."
Mine would.
I'm sure tt's why you have a leg up on other investigators.
See?
"You say ""leg up,"" i instantly went to the sex place."
hey!
"Whoa,whoa,whoa!"
"Hey,stop!"
stop!
"I'm sorry,I need to go."
I have a showing... at ncis.
What's going on?
Hey.Hey!
Stop pointing a gun at my fe.
She tried to rat on us.
-She means rabbit.
-Rabbit.
Yes.
I was in a hurry for a showing.
Are you arresting her?
Taking her to ncis to answer a few questions.
"Well,I'm coming too."
- Throw things at him!
"- Stop, or I'll arrest you all!"
You watch it!
- What about my theatre?
- Reporting for duty!
Moron!
- What about my theatre?
- Moron!
"Friend, tell me if you see anyone who looks suspicious."
There's a monetary reward.
Useless bum!
"Koon, there's a murderer with a painted face."
He might be in the troupe.
You must watch out.
Really?
- Where is he?
"- In this mess, who knows?"
We just recruited someone.
He has a funny walk and...
"OK, I'm coming."
"When the show's finished, look for me front of house."
I'll tell you.
I hate people from Bo Chi Lam.
Now you're their prime suspect.
We can work together.
You help me to...
"If you're successful, I'll pay for your trip to Nan Yang."
You won't have to worry about the police for the rest of your life.
But I'm afraid that you're no match for Wong Fei-hung.
LONGEVITY
"Congratulations, congratulations!"
- Have another drink!
Immediately?
I hate to trouble you... but there's something I want you to find out.
I heard there's someone who works different kind of jobs.
They say this person even works as a replacement driver at night.
Agent.
"Agent, chief, minister..."
Don't you have internet access?
Just go online and search.
What are you doing?
Why don't you drink more?
I know something more exciting than drinking.
Let's leave.
Do you still have a fever?
Yes.
"If your condition changes, just contact me at anytime."
Good.
Thanks for your hard work.
Get into the car first.
Are you the replacement driver?
Yes.
The call sounded really urgent.
Take us to the Ecstasy Hotel by Doosan intersection.
"Yes, sir."
Wait a second!
Miss Kim Mi Hee.
Let's have a little talk.
Do you know him?
"No, this is the first time I've met him."
How do you know my name?
I'm from the Seoul District...
I didn't bring it!
"Anyway, there's something we need to talk about."
"- You make up for that, then!"
-
- Hmm?
-
- Don't know what you mean.
-
- Listening to the gossip!
I can't help overhearing a certain amount.
Over--over--overhearing?
!
Your lugs were f--flapping about like radar!
There was me with me arms windmilling about trying to persuade you to m--make a sale.
"Oh, is that what you were doing?"
Making a sail for your windmill.
A sail for your w...
Aghh!
Ow!
-
"- Now, you're g--g--going to get on with it."
-
- What are you doing with that lad's ear?
It's the only place to handle s--small dogs and errand boys.
"With due regard to the conventions, where else would I take hold of an errand boy?"
Poor lad!
You've made it all red.
-
- It feels longer.
Is it longer?
-
- You leave him alone.
"He's got very shapely, delicate, small ears."
"""Delicate""?"
(Rings)
Lord Meldrum's residence.
Yes.
"Yes, I see."
I will inform her ladyship without delay.
(* Waltz on gramophone)
(Knock at door)
Come in.
"- Excuse me, my lady."
- Shh.
They're on their honeymoon.
lsn't it romantic?
The manager of the pet department at Harrods has just telephoned.
"Apparently, it is very difficult to tell the sex of a parrot."
I'm sure parrots don't make a mistake.
"The manager did, my lady."
He sent you another male parrot.
Really?
"Oh, dear."
"Well, they seem to be managing all right."
"Here you are, Mrs Lipton."
It's the last one.
Oh.
Perhaps I...
I better purée some tomatoes and put them in.
"Ooh, don't use real tomatoes, you'll spoil it."
"Who is coming, exactly?"
"Well, there's Mr Foster the works manager,"
"Mr Barnes the foreman, and that Scotch chap who's the union secretary."
I hope he doesn't make a scene.
"Always envious, those sort of people."
(Ivy) Ooh.
"It sucks, sixth grade!"
"Feet off the bed, please."
Okay.
Feet off.
"Oh, the heinie bounce."
Good choice.
"Very cute, Harriet, very cute."
"The neighbors will ask me,"
"""What happened to Harriet Welsch?"""
"""I don't know,"" I'll answer."
"""Such a shame."
"""She disappeared without a trace."
"And she was so adorable."""
"How long have you been with me, Golly?"
Since you were born.
"11 years and 12,000 tomato sandwiches ago."
"And you'll never leave me, right?"
"Well, I won't leave you ""leave you,"" Harriet, but, you know, one day you're going to be big enough."
"And well... well, big enough to take care of yourself."
And when that day comes you won't need me and I'll be gone.
But you know what?
That day is not today.
"And now, it's time for bed."
Are Mom and Dad tucking me in?
No.
They're at a very fancy party and I bet they're thinking about you right now.
Really.
"Listen, I think I can hear 'em."
Harriet... listen to everything Golly says to you.
"We're drinking champagne and eating caviar, Harriet."
Come on.
Let's go to bed.
Let me see it.
That's a nice one.
Yeah.
That takes me back.
"Believe it or not, I used to have Marcus's job."
I wasn't a bad enforcer.
I had my own style.
"You know, I used warm-up bats."
"They gave me a little extra ""pop."""
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
There was this one time- God Almighty-
"I was supposed to ""kneecap"" a guy."
Standard boilerplate stuff.
"I'd done it a hundred times, right?"
"Only this time, I take a swing, I hit him-Bam!"
And the bat breaks.
It sends a sliver of wood right into the guy's junk.
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)
You should have heard him.
He was screaming like a cat.
"I swear to God, as I heard the paramedics take him away-"
They said that one of his testicles had swollen to the size of a grapefruit.
You imagine that?
That pain?
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Messy.
"Messy, unfortunate work."
"In my position, there's only one thing worse than a guy who can't make good on bets."
And that's a guy who never loses bets.
(CLOCK TICKING)
I mean television...
- What's all this?
"First of all, I think this place is great."
Really?
- Really.
"- Yeah, I think so too."
I mean it's exotic.
Right?
For example what's been done with money.
Pretty funny.
"- It's a hole in the wall, but it's alive."
- Perhaps it's best if Mr. Harmann and I sit down and consider what to do next.
"Coincidentally, my name is Harmann too."
"Yes, but coincidentally, she doesn't mean you."
"Alright then, good luck with that."
I'll be in my office.
"If anyone wants a coffee or something, just let me know."
Thanks.
Shit.
"I'm an idiot, I could be doing something completely different."
Like what?
Like earning money for instance.
Instead I'm sitting here in this shitty hotel with it's shitty rooms.
It's not shitty here.
You're beautiful.
Shut up!
I hope you like your new room and that you would recommend us to others.
We will do our best to ensure...
That's alright Tom.
- ... so that your stay is as pleasant as possible.
Yes I...
What should I say now?
Leave for Pondi right away.
Stay there in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Room will be booked.
I'll send you the details over there.
Remember I want this car any how.
It's a gift for my wife.
"Sir, Which wife?"
One who's Bandra or the one who's in Varli?
Why is he so angry?
Laila always checks the car thoroughly before she buys is to sell.
"Madam, My car!"
"This car of yours, I can't sell it."
Nobody can sell it now.
We are from the ICUC Bank.
"Madam, You took a loan of 2500000 for this show room of yours."
And you haven't paid your installments since ten months.
Actually we are here to give you a notice.
What notice?
"If you don't pay in 5 days, we'll take all of your cars."
You can't do this.
We can do it Madam because we are scoundrels and bastards.
I'll call the police.
We are the police.
We work part time with the bank.
"Okay Ma'am, Have a good day."
Brother.
Give size 40 in this material.
What are you doing?
I'm taking out sister's bra.
"Shut up, Son of bra."
If not Bra then what?
Pajama?
"Don't tell the Vanderploots, they'll kick us out of the club."
"Richard, you know what I mean."
It was just a...
It was a surprise.
"I mean, we had so much stuff in common."
Yeah.
"You vacuumed once, didn't you?"
"Yeah, it was a long time ago."
She borrowed the Flintstones' vacuum.
It was an elephant on a stick.
- Yeah.
- You know what?
You guys should talk.
I've been in both of your bathrooms.
It's like a poodle lives under your toilet.
"Okay, look, sorry."
We're just trying to understand what the issue is.
There is no issue.
And you know damn well what the issue is.
I am not a snob.
I don't care about anything except what's in a person's heart.
"To me, she's just a person."
A very nice Portuguese person.
- That is a weird coincidence.
- I know.
"I mean, you don't hear about Portugal for, like, what, 30 years?"
"- And suddenly, you can't get away from it."
- Yeah.
"Wait, you don't wanna be friends because she's a maid?"
"No, I have to be friends with her."
You're gonna be friends with her because she's a maid?
"No, I wanna be friends."
Sometimes it's hilarious.
Like every time we hear that Drake gets in a fight.
"You're like, ""Dude, you're not a fighter."
"You're a stalker, that's what the hell you are."""
Listen to his lyrics.
Listen to his lyrics and tell me the man not a stalker.
He be... ¶ I can't get over you.
¶ You left your mark on me
"I'm like, ""What, you got 'em in the basement or something?"""
"He's just driving around in a random white van just picking up innocent women just,"
"""Oh, yeah, she looks good."""
"""Yeah."
"""Motherfucker!"
"""Yeah."
"""Get in the car, get in the car, bitch!"
"Get in the car!"""
"¶ Just hold on, we going home ¶"
I like Drake though.
"He's just so soft though, man."
"That's my dude, man, but it's just,"
"""Oh."
Motherfucker.
"""Worse, worse."""
"""Oh."
"Yeah."""
"""What I just said was so deep."
"It was just, 'Oh."
"Oh.'"""
Sounds like someone hit him in the neck with a dart.
"""Oh."
"""Oh, yeah, they hit me, bitch."
"Ambulance, come here, come here, come here."""
You nearly did.
- Shut up.
What was that?
"Nothing, I'm sorry."
"- We should begin, Dad."
"Okay, let's begin."
Sorry I can't stay.
You're all invited to the reception.
"Yitzhak, please come."
"I think the reading should be done ""mis en scene""."
Which means?
"Which means,"
"Monsieur Laroire, please come over here."
This is your clinic.
You're straightening the diplomas on the wall.
The wall is here.
"You're a plastic surgeon, you have diplomas, you took a lot of courses, straighten the courses."
"Mademoiselle Principale, please come over here."
Over here.
"Open the door, come in, and close the door behind you."
"Read, please."
"I don't have the text, I..."
"Not only did you not read the text at home, you think you know it by heart."
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor..."
Wait.
There's no point in just yelling at her.
You're in love with her.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur off the Canarsie Line?
- Are you crazy?
A spur is $ 120 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps we can't afford it."
"Then, you'll have to forget the whole thing."
I love the second act opener.
Then you won't want to miss it.
"""This Was a Real Nice Clambake."""
I'm building up my IOU's with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop or I won't support him for reelection.
And the off-ramp?
Next year.
- It's already in my budget.
- Next year's too far.
"You're only a boss, Frank."
I'm the fucking mayor.
Mayors rule.
BankExchange.
My way or the highway.
The bank called him right away.
"What do you know about this guy, Stan-- ?"
Whatever his name is.
Why are you putting John in the middle of this?
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Shut up.
I'm asking him.
"I gave him the envelope, because she didn't wanna see him."
WEXLER:
Ever seen him before?
- This guy is a bug.
He's not the type you'd remember.
You people must think I'm too sick to notice 1 5 grand.
I still know what's going on around here.
The cancer's spread all over.
"My liver, my spine."
I'll get maybe a couple of months to live.
- What?
A couple of months?
- A couple of months!
That's the report I got!
That's what I got!
"And then, John I get called about this check."
"Do you understand now about the check, Jimmy?"
She gave it to him for what?
High school dues?
Because he owed money to a bookmaker.
WEXLER:
"So suddenly, she gave it to him because they were in the high school yearbook together."
- You want some soup?
- I don't care.
I don't care.
Mistress.
My Juliet?
"Oh, still fast asleep?"
"Come, lady."
"Come, lamb."
It's time to wake.
"Well, you'll profit from a few hours dreams."
"Tonight, Count Paris will have other plans."
"But if your marriage will not let you rest, just wait ten years."
You'll sleep all you want.
"Heavens, how sound you slumber."
I must needs wake you.
Lady.
Lady!
"Oh, no!"
"Come, is my bride ready to go to church?"
"Ready to go, but never to return."
"My son... the night before your wedding day, your wife was stolen from you."
What?
Are you saying she is dead?
Flower as she was...
Death is now my heir.
My daughter he has married.
I will die and leave him all.
"Life, living, all is Death's."
This day had promised all my happiness... and now it shows me such a sight as this?
"Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!"
The worst that ever dawned.
Most woeful day.
Never was so black a day as this.
"I am divorced... wronged... hated... killed by Death, but Death is my future."
He holds all I love.
Everything's cold cold cold.
"...can only destroy itself, with bourgeoise means, bourgeoise sets, bourgeoise costumes, bourgeoise acting, the bourgeoise at the bidding of the Revolution, in the name of wrecked humanity."
Their souls melted into one...
"the universal soul, it's me."
In me human consciousness blends into the animal instinct.
And I can live each and every existence through me.
This stuff sounds decadent.
"Alone in the universe, my spirit remains..."
She's fresh.
Simon's ham... she'll get you.
"It's beautiful, what she says."
I want the book.
Let go!
Did she get you?
Who got me?
Who got you?
You did.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
"You, I love you."
Maybe it would be useful to remove your pantaloons if you want to see the light.
Do you want me to?
Why?
Because people normally do it for me.
I can also tie up your feet.
Why?
"Because, usually I'm the one they tie up."
And why that?
Because usually I'm the ridiculous one.
I see.
I tell you what.
Let's you and I discuss what I have to tell you first.
And then we can both interrogate Ward Fowler.
"You see, as Lieutenant Lucerne,"
I have a rather unpleasant idea taking shape in my mind.
Brandy?
"Thank you, sir."
"What might that be, sir?"
"Well, that might be..."
"And I'm speaking strictly as Lucerne, of course."
Of course.
"It just might be, unlikely as it may seem, it just might conceivably be"
Ward Fowler is the man we're after.
You mean the murderer?
Exactly.
No.
Yes.
I know this comes as a shock to you.
But let's think about it.
Let's examine the possibilities.
"Well, if you say so, sir, but I don't see where there could be possibly a motive."
Why would Ward Fowler wanna kill Claire Daley?
It's Claire Daley who made him famous.
That's what I was wondering and then
I got to thinking about the IOUs.
"Oh, did you, sir?"
Yes.
Oddly enough I did.
"I'm speaking as Lucerne, of course."
"Yes, of course."
Half a million dollars in IOUs.
"Again, Mark, that picture makes me really uncomfortable."
"Good, go with that."
Why does it make you uncomfortable?
"Because I've never seen it before, and I don't know where you got it."
I'm sensing anger.
Let's give it a place to go.
Rip out a few sets on the muscle-maker.
No.
Break something.
Just don't break anything that's...
You know what?
Just break my nose.
"Look, Mark,"
"I can't give you what you're looking for, because the things that I'm feeling I can't put into words."
And that's the problem with people.
"We want to use words, and words are dumb."
You know how the grizzly bear processes loss?
"Yeah, I think they go to sleep for like six months, and nobody bothers them."
"The grizzly bear climbs to the top of the nearest hill, and it roars, Neal."
"Neal, this is your hill."
"Yeah, I am not going to..."
Yah!
"Oh, that feels so good."
Hoo-ah!
"My friend, you have lost your she-bear."
And I am not going to stop until I hear you roar.
Naa-ah!
Ah.
Ah.
Ow.
"Ah, oh, no."
"Uck, oh, no."
Don't worry.
I'm fine now.
Going through all that without a father made me realize
That I don't need one.
I understand that I've lost the right
"To be a father to you, but..."
If there's any way that we can get to know each other...
On your terms...
"Serena may want a relationship with you,"
But I don't.
"Serena, stop it!"
You can't do that.
"The room was on loan, and I'm taking it back."
And I don't care if I did leave it in the closet.
"Borrowing without asking is stealing, Jenny."
"Dad, tell her to stop!"
"Uh, Serena, please."
I think it's great
"That you're moving back in, but this is Jenny's room now."
All her things are here.
You can stay in Chuck's old room.
No way.
That room is haunted by Chuck's depravity.
Jenny can take it.
I'm sure it wouldn't bother you.
"Okay, what-what's going on with you two?"
Nothing.
Fine.
Whatever.
Serena can have her old room back.
"All right, that's ridiculous."
"Serena, I'll have Laryssa make up Chuck's bed for you."
"Uncle, the work has not been done."
The work has not been done?
You didn't get the plates?
- We didn't.
"- What say, Pakia...?"
You said that your information is very accurate.
"Yes, Uncle."
The plates were in Kania's godown.
The thing is...
Kania got to know about our imminent arrival much before.
We were only 2.
And they were 50.
They surrounded us from all sides.
We forgot the plates and somehow saved our lives.
"What say, Baba?"
It doesn't matter if you didn't get the plates.
I can sacrifice thousands of plates in the names of tigers like you.
I will deal with Kania later.
"How could you, Baba?"
He's lying.
- Here are the plates.
- How wonderful!
Bravo!
- l knew.
- What do you mean?
I know both of you since the past 15 years.
"And in the 15 years, it has never happened that you didn't execute an assignment successfully."
- Uncle...about me...
- l remember...
I remember.
This idiot says that you should involve him in business.
- What do you feel?
I will find Phillip's killer.
She won't.
She's been two steps behind me this whole time.
Behind you?
I got to Austin first.
And I got to the knife.
"And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon, thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,"
I have the address to the prop master's cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs.
You see?
I am close.
Okay.
And may the best detective win.
Don't worry.
I will.
You realize she picked your pocket.
"Oh, yes."
Whose address is on that piece of paper?
It's a casting director my mother wanted to have a meeting with.
Hmm.
Kendall is going to be mad when she finds out.
Like I'm scared of her.
She is a master of Krav Maga.
And she is deadly with a sniper rifle from a mile and a half.
Good luck.
I could not sleep last night.
I kept having nightmares that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown.
Please tell me you found out more.
"Okay, relax."
I spoke with Tyler's ex.
He does not have a clown fetish.
[Sighs]
[Exhales] But...
"In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a church zone."
That fine was never paid.
"And since then, that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City."
For 16 years I pursued him only to see him give me the slip time and time again.
I've never got a clean look at his face but he's become my white whale.
"Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday."
"But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again."
I like that eye patch.
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.
- You can't park in this city.
- Hey.
"George, you know that company I work for?"
They own the parking lot around the corner.
"- Oh, that's a Kinney lot?"
- Yeah.
There's a space opening and I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.
"It'd be, like, 50 a month."
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.
Okay.
Thanks.
"I got lunch, all right?"
Still owe me a secret.
"All right, there is something I haven't told you."
- Yeah?
- But you can't tell Jerry.
"What do you think, I tell Jerry everything?"
It's not like he's my wife.
Okay.
tomorrow afternoon's edition.
Just in time for the congressman to make his statement... and just in time for it to stick in the minds of Americans over the weekend.
Wh...
What's the source?
Where'd they get the story?
- Unnamed sources close to the investigation.
- I see.
Al.
- Al!
- Yes?
"We can, um..."
Let's...
"Let's dot the I's, cross the T's on this one later."
"All right, thank you."
"I, uh..."
I think I have some self-righteous indignation coming my way.
"Well, is there any truth whatsoever to the story?"
- There will be an investigation.
- She's gonna have the truth on her side.
- She's gonna deny it and make us all look like fools.
- Let her.
Let her deny just that part of the story.
- Hold here.
- What?
Oh.
That's all right.
I can do that myself.
Yeah.
Thank you.
- America Live is not in the circus business.
- Pete's always fair.
Should I hear anything in this?
Where you going?
To tell gibbs.
What do you think?
I'm glad the glass is bullet-proof.
"excuse me,uh,could I have a word?"
With you?
Workin it's related and important.
She's telling the truth.
God put the body there?
No.
Someone who was playing god.
She didn't bury him.
Your gut telling you this?
"I've been watching her.She feels guilt, empathy,remorse."
That doesn't fit the psychological profile.
"She's deceitful,conniving,an adulterous, which does."
I'm trying to give you my professional opinion.
Then tell me after I have finished interrogating the suspect.
"Timothy,do you have a moment?"
"Uh,actually,I'm watching jody carvell's husband."
"Yes,I know--"
I want to have a word with M.
Sure.
And for you to tape it with that new cell phone yours.
Tape you?
"No,no,no,no.Not me.Him."
"Surreptitiously,of course."
Of course.
"-Here you go,Mr. Carvell."
-Thank you.
"Uh,this is our medical examiner,Dr. Mallard."
"Uh,call me ducky."
- Yeah.
So...
"I mean, what do you think?"
"You think it's a myth, Nathaniel?"
What's your explanation?
"Is it hard being alone, Mom, so much in your life?"
Yes.
I always wondered why you didn't find someone else to share your life with you.
"Well, I'm kind of a romantic fatalist."
"Somebody comes along, you know, and I'm kind of a loner too."
- Nathaniel?
- Yeah.
Come in.
- What?
- Lightning.
I know.
I'll come in.
Do you miss him still?
Sometimes.
"But not a great, great deal."
You don't think about him as much as you used to?
No.
Is that shocking?
"Before taking off for India and Bangladesh,"
I finally went back into Lou's old office.
"As it turns out, one of the men who used to work for him has the place now."
It was exciting times.
"I must say, it was exciting being here."
I was...
I can't say there were ever times when I was...
I never quit because of anger.
I never quit because of frustration.
"Yes, we can."
Tell me about your children.
"My girl, Mariana, she's six."
She loves racing cars.
Anything to do with speed.
"And Lucas, he..."
He has dark masses of curly hair and his eyes are... like two bright shining stars.
Sorry.
So Karp packed up his Mexican operation?
We don't know where he is now.
He was moving lots of stuff.
"Supplies, heavy duty equipment."
"Crazy stunt, but no infection."
You are all good.
"Thanks, Doc."
"When I was at Karp's compound,"
I saw something being hauled in on a giant flatbed.
"It was long, metallic, cylindrical, like a submarine."
It was massive.
A missile?
Yes.
Full report on my desk by morning.
I want my dad released.
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain.
"However, I will allow continued access to your father."
He's been surprisingly cooperative since you two have been talking.
Dad?
You don't look so good.
What's happened?
I didn't think I'd see you again.
Finnerman keeps us guessing.
She came to see me.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We can come and visit as much as we want to.
But I want to stay here.
Everything is so good here now.
I don't want to live there.
You don't like people there.
You said so yourself.
"Yes, but you..."
But then we won't see each other.
You can come and visit.
- You want to go out and play?
- Yes.
Then go.

"Previously on ""What about Brian"""
He still won't tell me who he did it with.
I'm just gonna miss... seeing you.
Mostly what I feel is just afraid--
Afraid that I'm gonna hurt it or be the wrong sort of mother.
You are gonna be a great mother.
You're my best friend.
"You always have been, and you know the rules--"
"Never let a girl come between us, right?"
I know about you and Marjorie.
You think I wanted to fall in love with her?
You think I wanted to kiss her?
It just happened.
You guys shouldn't get married.
You can't marry Adam because I want you to marry me.
"So his DNA is at a murder scene... and he's not the victim, so what does that leave?"
Is he a witness or is he just someone who happens to be there?
I'm gonna double-check the results.
"I'm gonna triple check them, okay?"
There's a possibility that the DNA is old.
20 years!
"I'm saying it's possible, okay?"
He may not have been there.
"Mark, just think about it."
It's Jesse!
- I know.
"- It means he's alive, yeah?"
"Yeah I know, you're right."
"I know, I know..."
"It's what we always wanted, isn't it?"
"Oh man, it doesn't make any sense to me."
"What am I gonna tell my Mum, Dad?"
"Nothing, not yet, okay?"
"Look, I shouldn't even be talking to you guys."
I could get fired.
Sorry.
This thing could end up being public.
I mean it's the sort of thing the papers have been all over.
"Yeah well, if it comes to that we'll let them know."
But don't you think there's someone else we should tell?
Someone who was with us that day.
Pru?
Come on.
"Dad, I wanna ask you something."
Do you remember him?
"This is Jesse, Dad."
You remember he went missing as a young boy?
Why did you cry again?
"Oh you know, the money I lent to Suh Yeon, her last payment came in yesterday."
I checked my bank account on the way home from the sauna.
There were 4 zeros after 2.
My eyes started dropping tears and my heart was broken.
I couldn't stop.
"My God, can you imagine how hard it must have been for her to pay all that back?"
"You know, just going to work must be hard enough."
"But imagine her getting all stressed out, staying up all night in front of her computer."
And the only Aunt she has isn't well off either.
And I just had to take that money back.
Why is your cooking getting saltier?
-Hello!
"-Oh hi, did you need anything?"
I'm sorry.
How do I get to Yang Pyung from here?
I missed the exit.
You came quite far away.
Turn left here and go 5km.
Yi Jung Pyo is there.
And if you turn right and keep going it will be there.
Thank you!
-Hold on.
-Huh?
This.
Thank you!
Thank you!
I'm sorry!
I won't even make excuses.
I'll just die!
What happened?
I think I'm becoming stupid.
Of course I'm sure.
The mayor's wife left a letter.
"Wait, what about the film?"
You promise me you'll destroy it?
"Previously on ""Death Comes to Town"":"
That's a brooch?
And why do we need a camera again?
For my investigation.
"Marnie, I need to know who really killed the Mayor."
"But if Shuckton is going to continue to grow or even survive, we need to bring in some new money."
What's that?
You want a kiss?
"Well, if that's what you want."
"Oh yeah, Shuckton, I still got it."
I'm your soul taker!
I got it.
Two for two.
I got two souls.
I'm your man.
"Oh yeah, I still got- Ahhhh!"
Ohhh.
Shit.
"And now the sad, freaking news."
It appears that one of our own has become the story.
"Heather Weather was killed yesterday, which leaves us to wonder, who could have killed this aging bright light."
"What, you don't like the picture?"
I picked it out myself.
"Ma'am, can I talk to you for a minute?"
I've live on the air here.
We have some questions regarding your involvement in the case that you're reporting.
Levon!
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
He's not here.
I hope nothing will happen to him.
-It doesn't look safe here.
"-Well, it's quiet instead."
"If I'm not wrong, it's such a sharp, frosty silence."
I would say even a dry silence.
Personally I'm more suited to the silence on Jupiter.
The silence there was so fizzy.
"-I'm not wrong, am I?"
-Yeah.
"On Jupiter it was fizzy, but sometimes deep and sublime."
"While on Ganimed the silence was kind of dark blue, lazy, blending together."
-Am I right?
Do you remember?
-Of course.
Only I don't remember what the silence blended together with.
With a morning cock-crow.
But on Oberon the silence there was something wicked.
-The nicest silence is on our planet.
-That's right.
Such a silence I haven't heard anywhere else yet.
The evenings in front of the bunker...
It's such a silence.
"Hallo, Doctor!"
Quiet!
You are in a reserved area.
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
Is that what you tell yourself?
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Scott...
"Scott, I'm fine."
"Scott, I'm fine!"
Scott!
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
(FAST-PACED music playing)
(GRUNTS)
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
adrian:
What the hell's going on?
She took what she needed from me to survive... until I perfected the serum.
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry.
She never fed on anyone after that?
No.
All right.
"Teyla, ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here."
"Colonel, the retrovirus is acting quickly."
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects,"
"If you bring her back alive, but I doubt she'll cooperate."
She's also stronger and faster than any wraith I've ever seen.
Great.
All this time... we thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us... and I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Addict's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you.
"No, it was a mistake doing it."
And poor Barney.
How is he?
"Doesn't, won't and can't ever know, OK?"
"Wendy, it's over, alright?"
I've learned a very big lesson.
Fuzz!
How hot is your English teacher!
Mr Bartrop made it pretty clear he's at the end of his patience with you.
No-one takes Bartrop seriously.
We do.
(Mobile phone rings) And you must.
"Sorry, work."
He is the principal of a school that your father and I spent a fortune on.
"Isn't that right, Cleave?"
"No, ten units, Race Four, Charlemagne's Pride."
Cleave!
Yes!
"Yeah, a fortune."
"An absolute fortune, mate."
"No, 15 units."
Only to the station.
"You're a really clever boy, Fuzz darling."
If you just knuckle down...
"Tell him, Cleave."
To win.
When have you heard me back a place...
"Most important years in your life, mate."
Why don't you just buy your lunch like everyone else?
"Because there is a perfectly good, cold roast lamb in the fridge."
So is this how it's going to be now?
A permanent cone of silence until one of us dies?
"Yeah, that's what I'm doin'."
"Uh, where's the powder room?"
He ain't got one of them.
My bathroom is right through there.
Thanks.
"Rick, I want you to check a... a light blue sedan for me."
License number 5567 A.
It's a... a government vehicle or a rental.
"And the driver, well, he's, uh, early 20s, blond..."
"Yeah, government type."
Yeah.
"Uh, thanks."
What are you doing?
The Iron Man contest.
"Oh, no, T.C."
No way.
I told you.
I am not entering that.
Don't start again.
Not even to save Island Hoppers?
"I mean, I figure what I need is better promotion, better advertising."
"What could be better than to have the company name... in front of the public in a big, fancy..."
"Oh, I see."
You're entering the race.
Did I hear somebody mention a race?
"Oh, yeah."
It's the Iron Man.
It's a big event with men and women if you're into competitive suicide.
"See, first you swim five miles in rough water."
Then you run a complete 26 mile marathon.
"Then, finally, the people who are still alive, they bicycle a hundred miles."
T.C. here is gonna enter.
"I am a bear, not a cow."
"You hairy daisies, you think yourhairwill save you."
At least we look like real men.
Ever heard about Scottish drags?
They weartrousers like you.
Save yourbullshit for your cook book!
Being a real man doesn't mean you can't be polite.
Are you fertilizing the fur on yourshoulders?
You're all dying fora real man... and when you find one...
- Get the fuck out of here!
Right now.
"- Look, I was just trying to say..."
"Ah, of course."
Yourhairy ass doesn't get fucked.
What the hell?
Just leave the poor boy alone.
"Come on, it is yourturn."
"Wait here, I'll come back and wax yourshoulders."
What have I done wrong?

"Son of a bitch, he screwed up my show."
Why do you pity these people?
This ZENNE is a really great dancer.
AZENNE?
Amale belly dancer?
What's that got to do with yourwork.
I am just interested.
"Perhaps, you want to do art photography."
I could arrange an exhibition.
It should be easy with all your awards.
I don't know.
Stop blaming yourself.
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"

Emergency signal from Fred.
"What happened last night... you didn't have a choice, Phillip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan --
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to DC for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett -
- Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"- Yeah, he was one of the best."
"- Yes, he was --"
"I miss him, too."

But tonight we proved that American drive and know how is still number one.
Tonight we drink from our enemies cup.
We eat from our enemies table.
And we celebrate in his most proud room.
Tonight the victory is complete.
Go clean these.

How?
How did you hear of us?
From all the big cases that you do.
"Mr. Trott,i don't deserve to go to jail."
I need you to take my case.
We don't take walk-Ins.

You just don't let it walk out and go to geragos.

"Plus,i've already talked to ann,and i've heard her story."

"She had to kill him,"
Or he would have killed her.
And i've also done a background check.
She has no criminal record.
We can win this thing on self-Defense.
We'll take your case.
We will?

Wow.
I wish we had been closer the last few years.
"Well, it would have been awkward, considering my mother and your mother were not so friendly."
Yeah.
Think they'll ever be friends?
Yeah.
I do.
My mother is clearly not interested in being with my father anymore.
How's that going?
"For you, I mean?"
Is it weird?
"Uh, yeah."
(CHUCKLES)
"Yeah, it is."
"But you know, she should be who she is, too, and I just have to get used to that."
Do you think your dad and my mom will ever get married?
Think we'll ever be sisters?
I wouldn't mind.
I always kind of wanted a sister.
I always wanted a nice sister.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Let me get that.
"Ugh, she better not have come back."
(SIGHS)
RICKY:
Who is it?
And it took a lot.
Aunt Edi we've driven around this block a million times.
Do you see your old house or not?
Not.
I think we need to go back to Wheeler's market
And make left this time.
That's it!
That's my house!
"That's a taco stand, aunt Edie."
We need to go back to wheel market
And take a left this time.
"Any of these look like your house, aunt Edie?"
Look for the boy who brings the ice.
He'll know.
"Well, thanks to that new high-speed internet we tried free for 90 days."
The principal did get my e-mail and called to say
She wanted to meet mike and me as soon as we got off work.
Hi.
We're the Hecks.
We're here to see principal Larimer.
"Oh, you're Brick's parents."
He has ms.
"Rinsky, doesn't he?"
Isn't she the best?
I just love her.
Really?
I just love my family members.
I think it's a really overused word.
"Aunt Edie, are you sure this is the right yard?"
How many holes are we gonna be digging here?
This is crazy!
I found this weird bone.
"I'm gonna say ""Jesus wept."" We gonna be right out of here."
- He knows how you...
- He gonna talk about Jesus for 20 minutes.
"He know he wept, okay?"
He did the weeping.
Let me get this bread.
[Laughing]
"All right, we gotta get her to the doctor."
What are we still doing here?
"Um, you know what?"
I got my niece and nephew to the dentist last week with some cookies.
I probably still have some.
Yeah?
What kind are they?
Mint Milano.
"She only likes Chips Ahoy, unfortunately."
"Well, how would your mom handle it?"
"Well, she would just eat the Milanos."
Or the Chips Ahoy.
"No, I mean how would your mom handle your grandmother?"
"Oh, she wouldn't put up with this, she'd just put her foot down."
"- Hit me, hit me."
"- Well, why don't you try that?"
"Oh, she's my grandmother."
I don't want to do that.
"Plus, she doesn't respect me because she thinks I'm an idiot clown."
"Well, you could... you could make her respect you."
"I mean, that's what your mom does."
"Maybe be a little forceful with her, and tell her we gotta get out of here."
"Yeah, you can do it."
- What's that?
"- Um, high five."
"Have anything to do with the ""Gossip Girl"" blast?"
¶ science will just have to... ¶
Is it true?
Are you dealing?
¶ all right ¶
"I was,"
"When I was dating Damien, yeah."
"But, no, not anymore."
This could so easily get back to dad.
I I think it'd be better if he heard it from you.
Are you insane?
I
"- I mean, you and I both know that's a suicide mission."
Look...
"If you want him to have faith in you, Jenny,"
Maybe you need to have a little faith in him.
¶ how many times can this be repeated?
¶
"Yeah, all right."
I'll go see if I can dig out a dress from my old closet.
"Maybe I can catch him at the gala-you know,"
"Big crowd, lots of witnesses."
Oh.
"Uh, is everything okay with you and Vanessa?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, at least I think it is."
It's been hard to say lately.
"Maybe you need to have a little faith, too."
"¶ all right, given our history, what can you expect?"
¶
It's great to see you again.
"You, too."
Bye-bye.
"Hey, Danny."
"Listen, I'm telling you there's something not right about those two."
You mean something besides the fact that they believe in ghosts?
I don't know.
"Just check 'em out, all right?"
I already did.
"Neither one of them has so much as a speeding ticket, much less a criminal record."
You don't think the guy that lost the money clip was in with them or something?
Could be.
I'll look into it.
"Yeah, because there's something strange."
"I just got this... this feeling, you know, that something's not right."
"Maybe it's like a sixth sense, I think."
Mr. Harpel.
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were supposed to meet at Opus.
My mistake.
Nice dress.
"Oh, thank you."
"Samantha Marquez, I presume."
Logan.
Paul Logan.
At last we meet.
Excuse us for a moment.
[Clears Throat]
"[Sam] I'm not sure how they do things where you're from, but here, stealing people's clients is considered bad form."
Stealing?
"Far as I know, Harpel was never your client."
Mmm.
Right.
-Fuck your mother.
"His car was stolen by some Puerto Ricans.They took his cell phone, too."
I don't know what to do.
I already packed a suitcase for my aunt's in Daytona.
Take it easy.
Don't do something you'll regret.
Three weeks before their wedding.
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.
"You can hire someone to do an intervention, apparently."
"Girls, come on."
We're a family here.
Now I gotta spell it out for you?
Take it easy.
Let me figure out how to handle this.
"Please, don't hurt him."
...fight plan will win out.
At this stage the fight is getting closer because....
Why am I always having to come here?
"-How are you doing, man?"
-Did we come at a bad time?
The decorating ideas.
You want to come in?
I'm sorry for the mess.
"Please, this is nothing."
"So, there is a page from Metropolitan Home."
"Now, wait till you see how a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room."
You want something?
Something to drink?
We gotta go.
If you've got a cup of coffee.
"-He loved that little man, by the way."
-Gobbetto.
"It's ancient history, man."
"Hey, I still feel bad."
"I mean, I heard where you ended up."
Community college ?
You trying to rub my nose in it ?
"Hey, I'm saying it's my bad."
Yeah ?
"Dude, tell me something I don't know."
My net worth is like ten times his.
I was looking forward to rubbing that in his face at the picnic.
"Don't go far, Mr. Banks."
Right this way.
So what now ?
Check with Dr. Talcott in DNA.
"See if our murder weapon is telling us anything, would you ?"
Yup.
"The reunion murder, right ?"
Yeah.
"Uh, is there any non-victim blood on our champagne bottle ?"
"No, but I did find something else, though."
There's something in the blood.
Any idea what it could be ?
"Whatever it is, it's underneath the blood."
So it was stuck on the bottle before it was used as a weapon.
"Yeah, I gotta get this to Trace."
Thanks.
That from the Bob Keaton murder ?
Dusting powder.
All they got was smudges.
Dusting powder...
"Eric, here's what I want you to do."
"Let's stay focused on this powder, okay ?"
Okay.
Okay.
Here.
Your fee.
But if you ditch me
I won't want my money back
but something else in return.
Is this even worth it?
"It's 4 am already and you are not sleeping yet, Boss?"
You should have joined us for dinner.
"Because you didn't go, Aey and Chai kept clinking glasses with me."
They sent their regards to you too.
Look.
There are a lot of them.
Gosh they wrote on me like I was a notebook.
"Don't be sad, microdick"
"- Hey, Marcia, how are you doing?"
- All right.
- Can we come in and talk?
- Yeah.
"Hi, puppies!"
'Marcia's been a little bit difficult to speak to.
"'She, I think, is embarrassed a little bit about her family's past."
"'And so, she's hidden a lot of information from us.'"
"So I know growing up, your family didn't have a lot to eat."
- Yeah.
Were there ever times when you didn't have running water and electricity?
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times.
SHE COUGHS
"DOG BARKS So, when growing up, the drugs in the house were weed and cocaine, right?"
Right.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Well, plus some of your other outstanding attributes."
Please.
Please!
Tell Miss Mancuso to talk to me.
This is Mike.
I'll be right down.
Two guys throwing' at Bella Petto.
"Look, man, read the sign."
"Read the freakin' sign, all right."
"Look, I am here."
"Get up, read the sign because-"
What is the problem?
That douche bag took a chair I reserved.
I left my magazine and sunblock on the table.
Only thing that reserves a chair is a towel.
"You don't know jack, pal."
"Sir, there are plenty of other lounges available."
"Okay, I get it."
"Uh, first of all, give it another 30 minutes."
There'll be 10 more just like her out here.
Trust me on this.
Looks like your brother from another mother beat you to it.
"So what you gonna do, hmm?"
"Relax, sit back and enjoy the Bella Petto experience."
"Believe me, there is nothing more important than asset management."
"And I mean that, really."
"Listen, why don't you- Why don't you call me?"
Okay?
Thanks.
All right.
You setting up shop here?
...including Lora del Rio and other towns.
The situation is becoming very serious.
Similar incidents are taking place as they had in recent years in the Andalusian countryside.
Damn!
Are you okay?
These are Joaquin Varela's blood test results.
Quini.
His blood type doesn't match the one we're looking for.
I remind you this is a democracy.
"Next time you want to arrest someone, you ask me first."
This country isn't what it was.
The harvest is soon and people are nervous.
Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.
You're not going to school today?
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
I went to a movie.
With who?
- With some friends.
- What friends?
"One moment, I'll be right back."
Who were you with yesterday at the hunting lodge?
"Who was the man in the hat, Marina?"
What man?
Aren't you a little hot in that sweater?
I'm sick.
How did you hurt yourself?
- What?
- Your wrist.
My watch gives me a rash.
"- This way, Mrs Dashwood."
- My dear Colonel.
- I found your mother starting out herself.
She had determined to come on her own account.
- Mama!
"- Oh, my love!"
My love!
Thank God.
"Oh, thank the dear Lord who has given you back to me."
"Oh, I was so frightened."
"I had no news, you see."
I expected you home and you had not come.
Let me look at you.
"Oh, how thin you are."
"Well, I shall feed you up."
You will have all your favourite things.
"I am very thirsty, Mama."
We must let her rest.
She is still very weak.
"You go to sleep now, Marianne."
Mama is with you.
She will not go away.
"You need sleep too, my dear."
I can see that.
This is my place now.
"Colonel, I cannot find words to acknowledge what we owe to you, or to thank you adequately."
The glimpse I had of your sister is sufficient thanks... not that I need any.
"If ever a man deserved his heart's desire, it is you, Colonel."
"At last, we are alone."
"Oh, my dear Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness."
Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.
He told me so himself.
Who better than a former Time Master?
And any of you who'd like to join me.
I should stay and help you with Darhk.
And get justice for Laurel.
"That's happening, honey, with or with out you."
I promise.
"Uh, listen, I-I can't pretend to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds important."
So is family.
I wasn't going to go the first time.
Then Laurel convinced me.
And now I'm going to do this for her.
"Well, she'd be proud of you."
How do you know?
'Cause I am.
What German lone word literally means
"- ""the desire to hike""?"
- Wanderlust.
A word which could also be used to describe that look in your eye.
- What look in my eye?
"- Martin, we've been married for 28 years, and you're still a lousy liar."
Now about this new sabbatical.
I decided to decline the invitation.
But...
I think you should.
I-I think...
I think it's important...
"Clarissa, I'm not leaving you."
That's final.
"- Hey, Gray."
- What are you...
"I'm so glad that you could make it, Jax."
What are you up to?
- Shut up.
How do you like the new you?
Did I interrupt the procedure?
Can Henry not talk yet?
"- No, he can't."
No.
"- Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here... might have rebuilt you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
"Nice to meet you, Timothy."
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Yeah.
Would you please be so kind to describe them to better Henry's understanding of how good he looks now?
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the... below the elbow and the...
the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a football-sized dent...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"Um, the skull was dented in and there was this, um... his eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shred to pieces."
Just about right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little strenuous.
Stay close.
Henry!
Hurry up!
Close it.
"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
Maybe buy some time.
Willhebe abletogetthisextremely volatile situation under control.
Muriel Walker's here.
"Thousands are gathering, leaving candles and ﬂowers.."
at the doors of the U. S..
We've got movement.
We've got movement at the Federal Reserve.
"Stenz, do you hear me?"
Confirming they're loading the money.
Let's wrap this up.
"Stenz, we're wasting our time here."
"Walker, are you sure they're down here?"
Did I spend 15 goddamn years running this place or did you?
!
This guy is losing it.
What do we care if he gets the president?
We made a deal.
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.
Walker has cancer.
His doctors gave him less than three months.
He has a golfballsized tumor on his frontal lobe.
Jesus Christ.
I think he's on a suicide mission.
You ready?
Yes.
What do you think you're doing?
If anybody can talk him down..
"it's her, trust me."
A little birdie told me you're finally moving the money.
Martin?
"I had to tell them about the tumor, Martin."
Gil's been down at the nursing home with your mother.
"Obviously, they're gonna call you, but I said...."
"You know, I felt I should be the one to...."
I suppose we can't say we haven't been expecting it.
For some time now she'd been gradually winding down.
-And at least it was peaceful.
"-Oh, no."
I just wish we could've been there.
"So, what were her last words?"
Do you remember?
Her last words were....
"Actually, yes, I do."
She said the two of you deserved each other.
Ah.
"Anyway, I'll just, you know."
I'm just really sorry.
"So, what sort of fruit does he like on his cereal?"
Bananas?
He's not keen.
I know what you mean.
"There's always those long stringy bits down the side, aren't there, you can't bring yourself to eat."
Why is that?
"Oh, no."
God.
-What's happening?
-It's those two guys from school.
Gary and Jamie.
Oh?
They look nice.
"Yeah, except watch how they completely ignore me because I'm about as interesting to them as a fly."
Bet they don't even say hello.
"-Hey, Julie, you all right?"
"Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max."
There's two things the Slop won't do.
Alert the proper authorities of my flight pattern or step foot in Texas.
I'll drop you here.
"When I agreed to follow you cross-country to chase your ex-boyfriend,"
"I didn't realize I'd be thrown out of a plane, scavenging for my belongings and fighting a snake for my favorite pants."
"You can have them, sir!"
Ah!
Found my toothbrush.
"Max, that's disgusting."
"Oh, you're right."
This isn't mine.
"Ah, found a purse..."
Under this syringe.
Anything in there?
"Uh... nah, pretty tapped out, which is too bad 'cause you could use a two-day heroin nap."
I meant my bag.
Look what else survived!
Ah-ha!
My Popchips!
Only to meet an unfortunate end.
"Oh, no, Max, my wallet."
"Mm, yeah, I know."
You've aged a lot since that license picture.
"No, it's gone."
All of our cash and our credit cards were in there.
What are we gonna do?
I'm freaking out.
"Nah, nah, nah, calm down."
Caroline will get us out of this.
"Oh, wait."
You're Caroline.
- about Carlos Mejia?
- Anything I told you.
"- No, I have not."
- You sure?
Yes.
"- Bryan, I'd never..."
"- Well, they found out somehow."
- Who found out?
Found out what?
- Mexican Government.
"- Okay, wait."
Slow down...
- Probably the cartel too.
And you think that's because I said something to someone?
- Not even accidentally?
- Like at the hair salon or something?
That's not what I meant.
I thought we understood each other.
Respected...
No.
"Actually, I thought it was quite a bit more than just that."
I am the one person who understands what you've gone through at the hands of this monster Mejia.
And now you're accusing me of betraying you?
- Not betraying me.
"- So what, then?"
"I had to ask, Asha, and I know you know why,"
- so don't act like you don't...
- I'm not confused.
I'm upset.
You immediately suspect me.
People at your job knew too.
They keep secrets for a living.
Plenty.
But that don't matter.
"Soon as I straighten out that old lady of yours,"
I'll take care of those smart double-crossers-
"One by one, from Curly down!"
And there won't be any mistaking who done it.
The Krozac trademark will be stamped all over them!
Come on.
Are you coming home with me?
"Yeah, I got a date with that dame in your watch fob."
My-my mother?
"Ok, call her that."
I guess I don't understand you at all.
"Mother and dads will be awfully glad, after all you've done."
"Yeah, I wonder."
"There's a lot of things you don't understand,"
"But you will soon enough, because you're my kind of a kid, see?"
I guess.
"It's awfully funny about those men thinking I was your son, isn't it ?"
"No, no, it isn't."
"Because you are my son, see?"
That's one thing you've got to get right now.
I can get home without you.
You don't need to come along.
"Now wait a minute, Joey."
"Just a second, Joey."
My name isn't Joey.
"It's Paul North, jr."
You're crazy if you say it's anything else.
I think you're all crazy anyway!
Let me alone!
Hey!
What a delightful woman she is.
Very...generous disposition.
Knows how to show her gratitude.
Only the best malt whisky.
"On the other hand, she's a woman of eccentric tastes."
Positively weird.
"Do you know what she asked me to do, Helen?"
"I couldn't begin to imagine, Siegfried."
"All right, I'll tell you."
She asked me to ask Tristan if he'd like to have supper with her.
(James) Ohh!
(Siegfried) On Saturday.
"James... you wouldn't care to hold the fort for me on Saturday, would you?"
All right.
(Laughter)
"Hey Sara, is your mother around?"
What do you mean who am I?
Don't you really recognize me?
It's not funny!
Don't laugh.
Can I talk to your mother?
Are you alone?
Do you like being alone?
Yes that's true.
We haven't been going out much lately.
But that doesn't mean I don't think of you.
"""WHAT MAX SAID"""
"Sara, you seriously didn't recognize me?"
It was a joke?
"Well, if your mother is not around, nothing."
Don't tell her I called.
How much money... 1000000.
The deal is fixed in 1000000 for this car.
This car!
How can this be?
That's what I'm thinking.
How can it be?
No one came to see it for seven months now coming to buy it.
Who is the buyer?
Laxminarayan.
This car won't go anywhere today because today at 11:00 Laxminarayan is coming to see this car.
"So both for you, clean it up."
"So when he sees it, He shouldn't be able to take his eyes off."
Come at 2:00 and take the advance.
What are you doing?
What are we going to do?
We'll lose our diamond.
We won't let Laxminarayan get here.
We'll kidnap him.
"I must close this deal today, I'll have to impress everyone with my charm."
How do you know the name?
Since childhood.
How?
Who told your Papa?
"Naturally Sir, He'd know."
If he bought undergarments from my shop then off course he knows my name.
Laxminarayan Undergarments Salesman.
My name is Laxminarayan.
You mean your...
Yes...
and you know my nature.
My name is Laxminarayan.
And I don't know your nature.
Home.
"Mom, Dad, Morgan, our sister who loves us."
How do you beat that?
"""Entering Pottstown, home of the world's largest yogurt cup."""
He beat it.
"Eric, listen to me."
"We have to go home, and here's why."
I'm completely out of clean underwear.
"Eh, big deal."
I ran out a week ago.
I'm sitting pretty.
"Yes, but, you see, I don't know if you've noticed, but I've also run out of pants."
I want to go home.
I want you in pants!
"Well, are you happy, Eric?"
"Your brother's wearing yogurt pants, and let me tell you something."
One size does not fit all.
Now can we please just go home?
"Hey, not so fast."
They got a whole schedule of events here.
What kind of events?
It's a giant yogurt cup!
"Now, why can't you just experience something new you've never seen before?"
'Cause I don't wanna?
"Look. 4:00, we have the parade of sprinkles, 6:00, we got the march of the dancing lids..."
I don't want to be here after dark.
Just stand here...
And smile.
Say...
Big pink spoon.
"""Big pink spoon."""
"Well, I am proud to be on the arm of the grocery store manager of the year."
"He still thinks that you've got a long way to go, but he's engaged, and that is a good start."
"Look, I'll do whatever he says."
"I mean, this is..."
This is all I care about.
Good.
"'Cause I also had an interesting meeting with a sponsor today who is looking for a female fighter,"
- and I thought of you.
- What kind of money?
[Laughs] It didn't really get that far.
I just wanted to see if you were interested first.
"Fuck, yeah, I'm interested."
Are you kidding me?
What is it?
"Mm, it's an energy drink called Slaughter Water."
"You know what, I don't even give a fuck."
"I mean, dude, I'll freaking sponsor an abortion clinic for all I care."
Are you kidding me?
[Chuckles]
My bad.
It's okay.
I'll set up a meeting.
I also wanted to find you a fight.
How do you feel about that?
"I mean, yeah."
What do you and Alvey think?
"I mean, what does..."
What does Alvey say?
"We both agreed that it's got to be the right fit, but I'll start looking around."
Jamal:
What are you doing?
I clocked out.
Employees can't eat in the dining area.
Oh-- he likes it a lot.
- Yeah?
- What's it about?
- I'm kind of reworking it.
- It's fucking awesome.
Mickey!
"You haven't seen it yet, dude."
You told me about it.
Did you check out that apartment I told you about?
"Yeah man, it's the shit."
"Maggie, you got to see this place, it's a railroad flat on Ninth Street and Avenue C."
- Ninth Street?
"- Yeah, baby, it's great."
I'm not moving down there.
- It's already rented out.
- I don't care if it's rented out.
I felt like a little pendejita sitting there.
"I asked Danny 'cause it was an idea, and he looked into it."
You even went to go see it.
"It was beautiful, a gorgeous place with a lot of sunlight."
I felt like I could breathe for once in my life.
Really?
"Well, maybe you should go breathe by yourself."
I can't be without you.
Don't you get it?
"No, I don't, because you don't talk to me anymore."
- I don't know what you're doing.
- I was thinking about both of us.
"You sewing in the back and me drawing in the front,"
like we dreamed.
Like we talked about.
We've been here our whole lives.
"Now I'm torn, aren't I?"
"I mean, I don't want stolen goods on me hands, but if it's a chance of meeting you again, Sergeant..."
"Your T Dan, what's he look like?"
Ooh... 40ish.
Short dark hair.
A bit taller than you.
"Beautiful skin, soft blue eyes."
How much did you give him for this lot?
£42.10.
"It's a hard life, isn't it?"
~ There you are.
"~ Thanks, John."
There's no missing person's report matching the dead man's description.
The pathologist hasn't got anything yet and won't have until tomorrow.
And we've got no Gwendolen Howard on any of our files.
"Making progress, then(!"
)
"Don't shoot the messenger, Inspector Bacchus."
She never irritate you?
No.
"Our man's not a thief, John."
That pawnshop bloke could have sniffed out a thief out a mile away.
We watched him do it.
He's pawning the family silver.
"This is a man with a wife, who's got rings and necklaces."
"At least, she did have."
"So, where is she?"
What's she waiting for?
~ It's dead.
~ 'Right.
How do you know that?
'
"Yeah, but not as bad as the grocery store."
"There was only one pack of toilet paper left, and me and this crazed housewife reached for it at the same time."
Tell me you took that bitch down.
[ Wind whistling ]
- Ha!
- [ Claps hands ]
Still...
I feel like there's something missing.
Are you perhaps looking for...
these?
- Ohh!
- Aah!
Yeah!
You are almost sexy right now.
"I mean, seriously?"
I got bit.
Mmm.
_
Jules:
Ugh.
"That was a wild night, but we made it through."
And nobody behaved badly expect for everything that Jelly did.
"I warned you guys-- when I fear for my life, I kick and scream and yell and I tell people exactly what I think about them."
"Still, I am sorry for everything that I said."
And did.
- I'd be mad if I wasn't so impressed.
- Ugh.
How is the damage out there?
"Well, it looks like we lost a tree and gained a new patio set!"
Score!
You're holding hands?
"What, is the world ending?"
"Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of renegade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So then they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
Jeanine needed a reason to petition the Council to institute martial law.
Now she has one.
(CHUCKUNG)
Staying here at Amity is still our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground.
Find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can make a move.
We need to kill Jeanine.
I know.
But we're not ready yet.
(SIGHS)
"Beatrice, you're not being serious, right?"
"No, I am being serious."
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.
"Tris, you can't just go around killing people."
"No, she's right."
Listen to your sister.
"Tris, I think you should go to Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself."
"I'll stay with Caleb so that you don't get him killed, too."
What?
PETER:
"Come on, you know."
Like you did your parents.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
FOUR:
Come on!
What do you think you're doing?
My office.
Now.
OK?
So now it's time for you to be honest about how you feel about Justin.
Let me put this in a way you'll understand.
You've been an emotional grower.
Now you need to be an emotional show-er.
I mean Justin's your best friend.
Have you ever even told him that?
"No, but in my defence I"
- have a really good reason not to.
- Why is that?
Because he wants me to so bad.
"I'm disappointed in you, Danny."
Good night...
Oh.
You want to get high and watch wrestling?
- To Candace and Justin.
Cheers.
- Thank you.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Did he say happiest day or last day?
"Babe, you can sulk about this whole Danny situation this whole time."
Now I know that you said you want to do whatever you want to make me happy.
"If you want to make me happy, you go out there and you get Danny"
"Yes, ma'am."
"- Guys, I'm here."
Where's Justin?
- You just missed him.
- He went out looking for you.
- Aw crap.
Let me go see if I can catch him
"Well, look like those guys will never..."
- I got the text.
How beautiful it is!
You like it?
I haven't seen such a lovely house in my life.
This is the world's most beautiful house.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
I feel like...
"Believe me, Mr Ravi, you won't find a better building contractor than myself in the whole of Bombay."
All right.
You go with my secretay and check out my vacant plot at Juhu.
And build a house for me.
Exactly like this.
How long will it take to build it?
- Say around 6 months.
Make it as soon as possible.
Don't wory about the money.
"Ifthat's the case, I'll show you better designs than this."
"I just want this design, Mr. Malkhani."
Because this is the world's most beautiful home.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
"I get it, Mr Ravi."
You are strange!
Where are you?
Can't even get to see you at the Gym.
Nothing as such.
- Who was he?
An architect.
Why?
What for?
I am building a house.
- A house?
What's wrong with this?
I have travelled much.
"I know it hurts, Jenny."
You'll get through this.
Just give it time.
"- Maybe you should go lie down, okay?"
- Okay.
Come on.
How was your thing with the counselor?
Useless.
Jesus.
"So what are we thinking here, human kill or Fae on Fae?"
Don't know yet.
"I kept it out of the human system to be safe, but the wife's missing."
"Hale, where's the head?"
- Not here.
- What do you think did this?
Something went through those bones without too much fuss.
- And interrupted the poor man's dinner.
- Yeah.
"Hey, you think it was a misadventure with the electric carving knife?"
"Yeah, I'll just call the cleaners."
Any witnesses?
All we have is the text that you got from Samir's own cell phone.
Anonymous.
Not that anonymous.
"So Olivia ran out of the house, crazy as a loon and I found Samir, no head."
"Oh, and Jenny's upstairs sleeping."
Did Olivia have the weapon?
- I didn't notice.
- Did she have the head?
- I don't know.
Was it not there?
- No.
So we should have a friendly chat with the president and ask him to step down?
- Get some rest.
- Who will relieve me?
- I will.
- Thanks.
"- Good night, son."
"- Good night, Padre."
"Hey, you've become friends."
But who's won over whom?
- We've both learned from each other.
- All right.
You could be dressed as a poor peasant and people would still respect you.
That must be to do with your charisma.
People believe what you say.
That's because I'm convinced of what I say.
"Sure, but that's not all, you know."
It also takes a lot of courage.
I'm not sure whether you're overestimating me.
"I'm scared like everyone else, but I fight it."
"If we know what we believe in and love our fellow men, we will find the strength to fight our fears."
Stop!
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
My name's Rafael.
I come here every week.
But I've never seen you before.
Are you González?
- I ask the questions round here.
- OK.
I'm delivering medicine and food.
All right.
Throw the rope over to me.
- I don't understand.
My legs are nothing.
These are my life.
I play the piano.
I'm a concert pianist.
A pianist?
"Well, any helpful suggestions?"
"Well, this one is interesting, but I'm afraid... burning down the entire camp would be impractical."
First Annual Naked Day shows promise.
We're working on that.
[ Chuckles ] I see.
Oh.
"Uh, how did your Simon Says tournament turn out?"
"- Oh, great."
B.J. won.
I came in second.
- Nobody else showed up.
"Evening, Captains Heckle and Jeckle."
"I'd have been here sooner, but I stopped to watch the dancing in the streets."
"Well, after just two days, what did you expect?"
Miracles?
I expected a big goose egg.
But you two haven't even done that good.
These folks expected a lot from you.
And getting let down is worse than having no hope in the first place.
"Oh, now, Colonel, I don't think it's as bad as all that."
Right!
Everything is under control.
"Listen, you two."
Where are the cosmetics I asked for?
"My nurses are human beings, you know?"
They have needs.
You're in danger!
- Go after him!
"Ifyou consider me your friend, kill me now."
I loathe seeing you demean yourself by begging.
Though I didn't succeed...
I risked my life trying to get you your money!
I could havejust killed you.
I didn't have to beg Weng foryour money.
"I'm not completely without honor, am I?"
Our world is changing so fast.
It never used to be like this.
Perhaps we're too nostalgic.
Nostalgia is one ofour saving graces.
"At least when I die, I'll know I was remembered by a friend."
Let's settle our differences in the next life.
Let's cancel them right now.
That's what friends are for.
Right?
- A drink?
- Thankyou.
Jenny always wanted to live by the sea.
You've done so much for her.
I wonder how she feels about you.
- Hello?
-Jenny!
"Jeffrey, why did you leave without saying good-bye?"
I'm sorry.
I had something to do.
We have to leave tonight.
- Tonight?
- Dr. Ho called this afternoon.
"He's reserved a pair ofcorneas, but they're in Singapore."
"That wasn't a lie, that was doctor/patient confidentiality."
- She didn't...
"- No, that's bullshit."
A mom would tell another mom something like that.
Just please tell me the truth.
Okay.
"Okay, I was scared."
"I was scared if your dad and Louise found out that I had left that stuff lying around,"
I could lose you and Cambie.
That could happen?
Yes.
That's why I didn't tell anyone.
"But Jess, I can, and I will if it would make your life easier."
I thought you were lying because you were a drug dealer.
"Honey, I'm not a drug dealer."
I know.
That must have been really hard growing up without a mother.
"Like, with all your flaws still,"
"I couldn't imagine life without you, so."
"Well, you don't have to."
"Mr. Lewis did request a late check out, but..."
It's urgent.
"Since he's not answering the hotel phone,"
- I can let you in.
"- Uh, actually,"
- we should probably go in alone.
- Yeah.
- Room 214.
- Thank you.
Shit.
What do you think?
I think Mary finally figured out a way to kill Morgan.
Excuse me?
Rayanne showed me his picture in the yearbook.
If I were Angela running around with him...
I wouldn't give a damn about guns in the school either.
So you think that Jordan has gotten in the way for Angela--
And she was so obsessed with him all that time and now...
it's actually happening.
"But we know what that's like, right?"
Young love...
or lust.
What is the difference?
Yes.
Jordan.
"I could have died. I did die. I mean, this woman knows and I don't know."
She's not even a woman.
She's like this forty year old girl.
She's gorgeous.
And she's telling me about my daughter's sex life...
"which apparently she now has, and I don't even know about it."
"Patty, kid's talk."
The girl talked to her mother.
We don't know that it's true.
These things are always true.
Of course it's true.
Taste this.
I couldn't taste anything.
Guns are going off in school.
- Angela's sleeping with someone.
- You don't know that.
How is it?
"You know, and even if she isn't, which I pray is true..."
she obviously has some sort of secret life completely apart from us...
"There's always going to be a little J in you and a lot of ""D"" in me."
"Well, we did it."
That's the worst conversation of all time.
"Don't worry about it, man."
I'm not even bummed out that you're moving out.
That's OK
"That's so weird because your pants are on fire but you're a liar, liar."
I spent all day dividing up our stuff.
Most of it was pretty obvious.
- All the make-up was...
- It's sunscreen!
Alright?
Don't piss me off.
Look.
Just admit that you're sad.
Why don't you get off my butt?
"What am I, Kanye West?"
I don't know what that means but let me ask you a question.
"Two weeks from now when you walk into that empty room and I'm not there, what are you gonna do?"
I'm probably gonna be doing a lot of this.
Because that's where I'm going to put my new Nordic Track.
OK.
We need to stop them from fighting.
Yeah for sure.
I agree.
Why don't you just call me when you have that figured out.
- Wait.
I don't have your phone number.
- I know.
I don't have anyone's number.
Get off your Nordic Track and talk to me.
- What is that?
Place looks good.
I'm excited you finally get to see our renovations.
Can't believe that excites you.
"God, you sound like a brat who lives in a dump in New York."
Don't be shitty.
My house is not a dump.
Wouldn't know.
I've never been.
Lots of fights happened in this room.
Only with you.
We're going out.
Get yourself dressed up.
It's gonna be a big night. (LAUGHS)
"OK, could you stop doing that?"
It's really annoying.
I planned on going away for a week.
- You know this is important to me.
"- I know, but it wasn't supposed to start for 10 days."
They changed it.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're not being really supportive right now.
You know this is an amazing opportunity for me.
Tell me the good version of this conversation.
"""You got the job?"
"""Congratulations, Ashley."
I'm so happy for you.
"""Although I admit to being a little disappointed,"
"""I understand that these things happen."
"""I'm so proud of you, baby."""
That's basically what I said.
I would never say that.
I am proud of you.
"You, uh... you sure you want to get rid of this pup, huh?"
"Well, we have a small apartment."
Okay.
(chuckles) Come here.
Don't look at me like that.
I ain't got nothing against you.
"Honest, if I was gonna have a dog,"
I'd have a dog look just like you.
"It's just that... well, an apartment's no place to keep a dog, you know, and... they're expensive and everything."
"Besides, somebody'll come in and pick you up."
Maybe somebody with a big backyard or something.
Might even live in the country.
"(chuckles softly) Boy, you got some kisser."
"Honest, you'll see."
This is probably the luckiest break you ever got that I didn't take you with me.
- Honest.
-All right.
Here.
Just sign this and I'll take the dog.
Everything's in order.
There you are.
Thank you.
There we go.
"Up you go, boy."
That's it.
(speaks indistinctly)
"Something I can do for you, mister?"
"No, no."
(clears throat)
"Say, tell me something."
I just brought a dog back here.
Uh... will somebody pick him up and give him a good home?
"Yes, love it!"
Let's choose team-mates.
Who's sporty here?
"Everyone, who's good at sport?"
No!
"Whatever it is that's happening out here, no!"
And why is water boy strapped to a column?
Water man.
"But, yes, I completely agree."
We're playing jugball.
"As I say, no."
"You're going to the Legal Department, where I put you."
"Come on, it's eight-all."
"I'm sorry that this massive grain company is getting in the way of your cretinous game, shredder."
"It's not cretinous, it's brilliant!"
"And if you actually cared about this company, you'd give people squeakier chairs and lower the price of toilets or whatever."
"Right, guys?"
Yeah...
"Well, something like that."
OK.
"Well, clearly, someone's a little bit tired."
So let's go and get a nice glass of milk.
I'm not tired!
You're tired.
You're tired and you're fired.
Excuse me?
You're firing me?
"That's right, Flave."
It's time to make way for a guy who knows what's really needed here.
Ha!
You don't even know how to wipe your own bottom.
"Not me, the Professor."
You're not even the prettiest woman in this car.
That couldn't be further from the truth!
"Okay, look, the editor's gonna be here any minute."
We still don't have an idea for this book.
Don't panic.
Maybe he'll be late.
"Oh, my God, he's not late."
"And the advance he gave us was huge, and we've already spent it."
What?
I didn't get any money.
You've only been working here a day.
Don't get greedy.
You know what?
I'll stall him.
"Anderson, how lovely to see you."
"This is my collaborator, Melanie."
- Hello.
- Listen.
"We could do that whole dance, but let me just bottom-line this for you."
Melanie and I just need a little...
"Victoria, you better not be asking for another extension."
You and Melanie have had two years.
Two?
"Extension, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Delay this idea that is going to change children's literature forever?
"If anything, we need less time."
Fantastic.
I want to hear it after I take this.
- Is there a place I can...
"- Oh, yes."
Right down here.
Go public?
"Call the New York Times, call CNN."
"Tell 'em everything you know, tell 'em this is all real."
You just signed our death warrant.
- You think she cares about killing 11--
- Shut up!
"She's not gonna call CNN, Ray."
She's gonna have us all killed.
I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to make that call.
"My people have a very old-fashioned, Cold-War slant on things."
It's not right...keeping something like this secret as I'm sure everyone here would agree.
This is news that belongs to the world.
"How do you know she's from the government, Ray?"
How do you know she's not one of them?
Sit down.
Why don't you let the little girl come with me?
It's the kind of gesture that would go a long way.
"Give me the girl, and I promise, I'll do everything I can for you."
WILSON:
"Look at the eyes, Ray."
You see?
Those are alien eyes.
RAY:
"Wilson, shut up."
Let me have the girl.
"Let Allie go, Ray."
She doesn't have to get hurt.
"Allie, stand up."
Stand up.
"You've got something I want, now I've got something you want."
Get out.
Get out!
I keep daydreaming about the stuff that I wanted to do.
Get really drunk at a college party.
Go windsurfing.
Get married and have kids.
Stupid stuff like that.
It's not stupid.
Even after I got really sick I kept talking myself into believing that I had more time.
At least enough to do some of those things.
Sean Simmons?
You know what?
Hold on a second.
"Sean, I can't get you into college, and windsurfing's nuts."
But you know what?
"Come on, let's get out of here."
- For real?
"- Yeah, come on."
Not unless you have someplace else to go.
- I'm supposed to get him home.
"- Yeah, could you call his mom for us?"
- Tell her we went on a date.
- I'll have him back by curfew.
Maybe.
Say maybe.
Abby.
Abby.
"Listen, I got ahold of Sonia Riley and I told her to call you here if she hears from Eric."
I'll keep my eye open for messages.
Can you get this banana bag to that guy?
My leg-splint girl's screaming.
The Soupbox for lunch?
"Oh, you' re busy."
We could go to that place across the street.
By whom?
By Yagi.
By Takao.
You surprise me.
Isn't your husband in Kyoto?
But Takao might be watching for us.
That kid is his father's son.
He doesn't like ballet.
He wouldn't be at the theatre.
So everything is just fine with you?
I don't think that we're doing anything that should make us afraid of people.
I thought that someone was watching us the whole time.
It sounds like you're getting hysterical.
Maybe.
I shouldn't be seeing you.
"This place has changed a lot, too, hasn't it?"
"During the war, Takao and Shinako used to come here to get grass and dirt."
"When they came home, Yagi used to clean them off."
Yagi was like that back then.
Let's not talk about Yagi.
Shall we go to Ginza to get something to eat?
I said I'd meet Shinako at 6:00.
She's coming back from her performance in Sendai.
Wouldn't it be alright if I came along to meet Shinako?
I'll see you some other time.
It's difficult for me to be with you today.
Come in!
Is my mother here?
"Yes, she's waiting upstairs."
Mother?
Welcome back.
Sorry I'm late.
"George, this was found snagged on the shed where you made the tea."
Got any ideas?
Yeah.
That woman that Henry had a spat with at the party last night.
"She was wearing a cardigan, same colour as that."
Iris Lightman?
Is that her name?
"Thank you, George."
I'm sure we'll have you out of here very shortly.
"Of all the secretaries I know,"
Jean is definitely one of the most obliging.
Interesting?
I'm afraid so.
All right.
I did go to that flower garden this morning.
I wanted to punish Henry Lee for not speaking up.
"Punish him how, Iris?"
By hitting him with a spade.
A spade?
Yes!
"But as I stood there in that garden shed,"
"I realised it wasn't going to solve anything, was it?"
So I left.
That's it?
Yes.
OK.
So this is what really happened.
You put hemlock in Henry's teacup and then set up George Hammond for the crime.
I don't know any George Hammond.
"Come on, Iris, make this easier on yourself."
Where would I get hemlock?
How would I know which cup to put it in?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm fine.
"Nothing, huh?"
Doesn't look like nothing to me.
"You got a new tie there, huh?"
Classy.
Gray.
Didn't know that was the new power color.
Strong choice.
Thanks.
Mr. Gates.
"Okay, fellas, we all have a lot of work to get back to, so I'm gonna keep this snappy."
I've looked through all of your proposals.
"And while I think all of you have more than a little something to offer, the proposal that hits the nail on the head is the one that shows the most leadership and vision that is gonna be required to take this company into the future."
"Congratulations, Felzner."
"Thank you, sir."
You are welcome.
And you can move into that new office of yours whenever you'd like.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Mr. Gates?
"Yes, Allan?"
"Listen, you said that you liked my work."
You said that it was strong...
"I said I liked your work, Allan."
And I do.
"Okay, so why am I not getting the promotion?"
"I mean, I've been here longer than Felzner."
"Felzner is the future, Allan."
It's as simple as that.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"We didn't quit until five in the morning, so I stayed over."
"Thank you, sir."
"This friend, sir, the lawyer, where can I reach him?"
SID:
Is this a grilling session?
What am I?
Some kind of suspect or something?
"Nothing personal, sir."
I have to ask these routine questions.
"Well, his name is Leo Hart."
But I think you're gonna have trouble contacting him.
He took the plane for Rome at noon.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're ready to roll.
"Let's do it then, huh?"
Mark!
Why don't you entertain the Lieutenant while we shoot this.
"I'm sure he's seen this, anyway."
Seen it?
He was in it.
"Yeah, you know, Ward is right."
"Time is my business, you know, and I always know it."
"Oh, boy, am I hung-over today."
I'll be glad when this day's over.
"Hey, what time you got, Lieutenant?"
11:00 on the dot.
Are you kidding?
"Jeez, I paid a thousand smackers for this watch."
I lost five minutes overnight.
"Do you mind, sir?"
I have never seen a thousand dollar watch before.
"Boy, that must be solid gold."
"Well, with any luck we may be in Krems by morning."
Maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Are you starting that again?
Anybody cover?
Somebody step on that crumb.
"We warned you, Sefton."
Sure you warned me.
You were gonna slit the throat of that stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with.
Only make sure you got the right throat.
We're looking at it.
Hurry up on that door.
"What are you trying to do, gum up the works?"
That's right.
"Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the morning, like Manfredi and Johnson?"
"Look, Sefton,"
I had my hands full keeping these guys from tearing you apart.
"I called it last time, didn't I?"
Are we gonna listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
How do they know?
"You told them, Hoffy."
- Who did?
- You did.
Are you off your rocker?
Uh-huh.
Fell right on my head.
Sprechen sie deutsch?
"No, I don't sprechen sie deutsch."
Maybe just one word?
Kaputt?
"- Oh, nothing a little whiskey can't take care of, right?"
I'm sorry to hear about your parents.
My condolences.
They were good people.
- Thank you.
Isabel has taken it especially hard.
- Hmm.
Sorry to hear that.
Please give her my best.
- I will.
"Truth be told,"
I found it necessary to temporarily place her in professional care.
- Hmm.
"- I didn't want to, but Dr. Torrington thought it the best course of action."
They say Rosewood is the best.
"What is it, Detective?"
- Nothing.
Rosewood provides the best care money can buy.
"- Thomas, please."
"- Okay, I heard rumblings of strange occurrences many years ago, but they are mere rumours, nothing more."
"- Thomas, you would tell me if there were reason to be concerned, would you not?"
"- Yes, of course I would."
Of course I would tell you.
"Please, pay me no mind."
"When I drink, I speak heedlessly."
"Look, set your mind at ease, all right?"
Your sister's gonna be just fine.
She's in good hands.
- You.
Have you seen me?
This is not me!
It's not me.
I want you to put a guard on me.
"Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy."
- Right?
- Right.
So who's gonna watch me?
Cookie?
"No, not Cookie."
Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
"Okay, Price, you stay here."
What about Schulz?
We'll take care of Schulz.
Come on.
You too.
"That's a boy, Joey."
Play us a little something.
"What do you want to hear, Price, ""Home on the Range""?"
Or maybe a little Wagner?
"Or, uh, how about a game of pinochle?"
"No, you're not a pinochle man."
You're a chess player.
I never knew much about the game.
"Now, let's see a pawn moves this way and a bishop moves this way and the queen moves every which way, doesn't it?"
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I went to school with a guy named Price.
That was in Boston.
"- You're from Cleveland, aren't you?"
"-Yeah, I'm from Cleveland."
I thought that's what you said.
You're from Cleveland.
"And you were with the, uh, 36th bomb group?"
Thirty-fifth.
The 366th bomb squadron out of Chelveston?
Would we stay for you!
?
You two have no conscience at all!
Yu-lu...
Yu-lu...
Are you angry with me?
I know I said something wrong... but I didn't mean to hurt you
"Don't cry anymore, okay?"
"I'm apologizing to you, Yu-lu!"
Look at me!
I swear I won't say it again!
Ta-pei
"Where are you, Ta-pei?"
Ta-pei
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
What are you doing?
"Any orders, Brother Chin?"
Where's the old fellow called Chang Seventh?
He went to gather some wine-making materials
He stole our master's nine-dragon jade cup lf you can't find him by tomorrow
Then just move this winery out of here!
Yes-please report to the master that I want to keep renting this place
The rental's up 30 per cent
About the nine-dragon cup... I'll surely make him to give me back!
Stop!
What are you doing?
come to give back the nine-dragon jade cup give back the nine-dragon's jade cup?
"Give way, be quick!"
"Bastard, you dare come to start trouble?"
The cup's broken!
Report it to Master!
"Oh, I remember these."
Can we go again?
Sure.
I'm happy to take more of your money.
Gambling's awesome.
I think it's gonna be a problem for me later in life.
Whoo!
I feel good.
"- Me, too."
- Yeah.
"Mom, all you do is try to get attention, and all I do is yell at you."
We have got to figure out a way to stop that.
- Mm.
"- I mean, come on, Mom."
What is with this thing?
"Well, it's... it's from my car accident."
"I called you about it, but you never followed up."
Because you said it was nothing.
"When I hear the word ""nothing,"" I move on."
"Okay, can I just ask you..."
Why is it so hard for you to be there for me?
Seriously?
When were you there for me?
You picked a life of travel and adventure over being there for your kids!
"I sound happy, but I'm very upset!"
"Katie, I know that I wasn't a good parent."
"You know, whatever that thing was that's supposed to kick in just never kicked in."
"Well, maybe because you were such a crappy mom, that's why I try so hard to be a good mom."
Oh!
So I made you a good mom.
Mnh-mnh.
That's not what I'm saying.
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post traumatic stress.
"Yeah, and unofficially?"
I don't really think that's any of your concern.
My job's to disorganise crime.
Illegally.
I prefer to use the world irregular.
"Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
Unfortunately a million extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould.
Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him either.
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"Niece and nephew, right?"
Yeah.
"I haven't got 'em any presents, though."
A bit behind when it comes to computer games and stuff like that.
You should talk to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games."
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John, that'd be irresponsible!"
That's not their age range at all!
How did it go with Lenny?
"Yeah, pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"I guess that's what you did in the Army, right?"
Wrong.
That was legal.
Yeah.
Astal thinks he's going to a safe place.
Fifty Magic Knights.
What a clown.
He thinks he can bare his fangs at the prince and win.
Hilarious!
You sick-minded manipulator!
Don't you dare look at my sister that rudely!
The prince?
Brother.
"What's the matter, Sister?"
I can't breathe!
"Ferris, you always spoil Iris so."
Jobs should be thoroughly finished.
"If we let a man like this live, it would sully the Eris family, would it not?"
What's your intent?
Is the prince behind this?
Does that mean Sion is also a prince?
The Eris family serves only the king of Roland.
The true king.
The king?
We must see whether or not Sion would be a suitable king.
"Will he make it back alive, faced with a troop of fifty Magic Knights?"
Impossible.
I could do it.
Sion isn't you.
He most certainly isn't.
But he carries something.
"You met Sion, and as a result, you saved his life."
Don't you find that fascinating?
"I'm not particularly fascinated, no."
Staying asleep
Losing sight of you
"I'm reminded of something Descartes once said,"
"""Whether I am awake or asleep, two and three will always make five."
"""A square can never have more than four sides."
"""It does not seem possible that truths"
"""so clear and apparent can be suspected of any uncertainty."""
"Uh, this book has taken me over 14 years to write."
It is not without a little sadness that I say goodbye to it consuming my days and nights.
And nights...
Um...
And so...
And as I stand here...
"And so, in coming up..."
Summing up...
Uh...
"Excuse me, I'm feeling a little dizzy."
Uh...
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I would know more.
I don't.
"I don't know anything, really."
Thank you all for coming.
Thanks.
Thank you.
"Oh, God."
What did I say?
"It was fine, although I'd think twice about doing volunteer work for a suicide hotline."
You were doing okay until Candice walked in.
"Don't start, Henry."
I just forgot to eat.
You should never drink on an empty stomach.
"Listen, it's perfectly natural."
"She left you what, a year ago?"
- You're not Mr. Sommer.
"- No, I'm not."
No harm done.
What's up... with y'all?
[Turk] Ahh!
"Hey, Dr. Turk."
What happened to you?
I found the latest issue at a comic book store a mile and a half away.
Here you go.
"Actually, I ran there in a foam needle suit, but you don't care."
"Thanks, Dr. Turk."
"Christopher, I heard you were sweating the rankings."
No.
I'm married and trying to have a baby.
Not having a job would be a big boost for me.
You're a good surgeon.
"Plus, your bedside manner is really important."
There's no one on that list who spends more time with their patients.
Are you saying I have a job?
"If you are trying to ""Kelly Ripa"" me right now, I will freak out."
I got a job!
"Well, the good news is, his head isn't in the storage room."
I once found a head.
It's a funny story.
I put it in my locker.
"I didn't have time to get to Lost and Found, forgot all about it."
"Come back to work on Monday, open my locker, whoa!"
Head!
Plus rats!
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.
"I grabbed the thing and ran up to the roof, punt it, and I shank it wide-left."
"Here, here, here."
"Sweetheart, is he annoying you?"
"Well, no."
No one beneath me could hurt me and no one above me would hurt me.
What a beautiful sentiment.
"Now, you let her finish."
Music.
Cooing.
"* Cooing, billing birds of spring *"
* Come back each year and sing and sing *
"Cooing and billing birds of spring, come back and..."
"Pardon me, something is bothering you?"
- I forgot the words.
- That's fine.
* Oh that is what he taught me to.. *
* Spreading sunshine and gladness *
* And teaching lessons of love
"* Fluttering, chirping birds of spring * [yodeling]"
[yodeling continues]
What a lovely pizzicato.
"To you, that's a pizzicato."
"To me, that's a pizzinati."
"I know, music."
[yodeling]
"All my life, I've looked forward to America."
"I suffered fire, floods, pestilence, and starvation to get here."
"And when I arrive, what does America give me?"
- A hillbilly.
- Oh.
"Now, you see what you've done?"
I warn you.
"Any more insults, and I take my money and Miss Chummy out of this production."
Can I see?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything okay?
Except that Annette can't cope with the stress.
Then now's not the time to say another guest is coming.
A business contact from India.
You better do it gently... in stages.
"Hello, hello."
Have you changed your mind?
There's still time.
"- Yes, come on..."
You've got time.
- You're just jealous.
"Yes, of course."
You're much too beautiful for him.
"Will you love and honor her, for better or for worse   in good times and bad   as husband and wife til death do you part?"
Yes.
"And now I ask you, Anna Louise Hansson   do you take Christian Refner as your lawfully wedded husband?"
- Yes.
- Will you love and honor...
- I'm very sorry.
- That's okay.
"Those who before us have pledged to live as man and wife   confirming before God and those assembled here   their solemn vows, I therefore pronounce you   man and wife."
Don't throw them yet.
Come here.
I'll show you...
- Hi.
"- Hi, Jacob."
- Doing well?
- Yes.
- Hi.
Be cool.
"Okay, you're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates."
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.
All right?
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
"Okay, so if a prison shanking is completely off the table..."
And we're sure of that?
No shanking!
"All right, all right."
The way I see it is somebody is going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
You don't give us the name of your supplier...
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
"Yeah, you cooperating?"
"Okay, let's start with a name."
He just goes by Heisenberg.
"Heisenberg, huh?"
How old is this Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
"It's just, well,"
"I also kind of have, like, a day job."
"- Thanks, Nikki."
- Yeah.
Or secret identity.
- Doc!
- Right.
Yeah.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"Where are the bombs, Petty?"
Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended, Doctor, by all means, wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.
Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
"If you'd like me to stop, Warden..."
"Don't be sensitive, Milton."
Tell us where they are and you'll have a wool blanket with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple pruned hands.
We'll find out one way or another.
He'll break.
Never had a man in this tub that didn't.
"He's already broken, Dr. Beauregard."
What we need to do is put him back together again.
A prescription straight from the pad of mother goose herself.
"When you're ready to come into the 20th century, please let me know."
Dr. Sengupta.
Time for the talking cure.
"Step aside, Milton."
"Yes, ma'am, it's a military medal, all right."
"Whatever he's done in the past, forgiving him is better than ignoring him."
"Tom, you shouldn't be spending your last..."
"What, lecturing you?"
Why not?
I hope your gran is right.
About what?
The next life.
Specially that bit about the new body.
I'm gonna need that!
"If we don't get new bodies, it'll be easy to spot the post-mortems in heaven."
Thanks for being here.
"I'm glad I'm here, Tom."
"Grand Chief, it is Yongeum Island, Yi Do-hyung's hideout."
You called for me?
I don't see Yum Moon.
Where is he?
Go and bring him.
"Yes, sir."
We will land here.
It'll be about a half day's march from this landing site to their camp.
Was there any guard at the landing site?
It is a large island.
They don't have enough men to cover this area.
"Why don't we just go straight to where Yi Do-hyung's ship is docked, and attack them?"
Lt'll be to our disadvantage if they see us coming.
We are outnumbered.
Where is Yum Moon?
Head Chief is not on the island.
What do you mean?
He has gone to attack Buryung in order to secure provisions and weapons.
Where is Chief Jang?
Leave me!
- Panju...
When is Manoj's birthday?
- September 12th.
He keeps annoying!
Don't move!
Won't you leave?
Sir...
Stay quiet!
Sadhana!
What are you doing here?
How did you come here?
Are you still after her?
I wonder why I came running for you!
"Your mom is worried about you, wondering where you are, what you are doing..."
"And here you are, roaming behind your lover."
Don't talk nonsense without knowing about the situation!
This is Ashwini.
Are you trying to act wise by changing her name?
I know that it's Deepa.
I can never forget that face.
You were all intimate with her at the restaurant!
If you knew Deepa all along...
Why didn't you mention it when I was searching for her?
"Yes, it's my mistake."
Big mistake!
"I should have found he, gotten her married to you, and blessed you both."
It's my mistake.
Please forgive me.
You will never change.
You will go completely mad roaming behind her!
Please don't blabber without knowing the situation.
I can't figure out.
It's some kind of a code.
Code.
Jerry.
Have you been paying your bills?
Well...
I've moved around a lot.
"I haven't had a lot of consistent bills, per se."
But you have a checking account.
You've had one since you were a kid.
mething due on the tenth.
You think Marla and Walker are in on it together?
Marla was telling the truth about wanting to sell Gus' work.
Maybe Walker had money troubles.
Stole his own artwork to sell it on the black market.
So he'd cut Marla out of her share?
What do we know about Walker's background?
Anything out of the ordinary?
Not so far.
(Angela) I know Walker's lying about something.
"Let's take a closer look at him, okay?"
It's funny--
"(Leo) Oh, boy."
Here we go.
What?
"Every time you start a sentence with, ""It's funny,"""
you're about to segue into a story about Dana that has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about.
That's not true.
"Okay, that's true."
And you've been dressing nicer for the past week or so.
Is that a new shirt?
"Yeah, Dana picked it out for me."
I thought I was getting pinched over here.
He's hangin' on my fuckin' neck like a vulture.
Like impending danger.
What do you want?
This guys worried.
He didn't want to come over with the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
"$7,000, that ain't peanuts."
"I don't mean to be out of order-- lt's good you don't like to be out of order, Sonny."
"Embarrassing me in front of my friends, callin' me a fuckin' deadbeat."
"Ya know Sonny, you're a real fuckin' mutt."
You know the money we spend in this fucking--
-Don't be like that.
-Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
"You think this is funny, eh?"
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fuckin' moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
"You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too, ya know?"
You're a funny guy.
"That's it, Henry!"
You want to laugh?
This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.
"I charged him $7,000."
You really are a funny guy.
Nothing blew up.
There was no victims that were brought out
Or--or dead bodies.
There was nothing.
I don't understand.
Nothing blew up?
That's the weird part.
"It was--it was like a bomb, only backwards, okay?"
"Instead of blowing out, it--it--it yanked everything in."
- Implosion.
- Artie.
Artie.
Did the sword do this?
"And if it did, can I reconsider this mission?"
It didn't.
And what you have to do is you have to get in that room
And tell me exactly what you see.
That's a look I don't know.
It's called the past rearing its ugly head.
"So in other words, the sword didn't do whatever happened at the embassy."
But you know what did.
"Oh, God, I hope not."
"- Artie, where are you going?"
"- No, no, I can't--"
"First, I have to..."
- Hey.
- Here we go.
Round two with Mr. Congeniality.
"Mr. Ogawa, look, we've answered all your questions,"
And now we have a few for you.
"Actually, agent Bering, I have one more."
Why does the secret service need to send two different units
I think you had a druids dream.
I think you instinctively knew
You were going to meet da veiga.
"Sydney, nigel."
"(nigel:)doesn't look much like a map, does it?"
I don't understand.
How's that supposed to
Lead us to the astronomicons?
There are words written down
One side of the blade.
"It's latin, I think"
They may reference the map.
"First I nearly get us killed,"
Now I've stolen the wrong package.
"Yeah, well you should have"
Come to us honestly.
(andreas:)I could have proved to you
That I'm an academic in my own right.
Dedicated to the conservation of relics.
But I knew you'd never trust
Anyone named da veiga.
I don't expect you to understand.
Try me.
(andreas:)after my father got back
"From the jungle, he was badly burned..."
Doctors said he'd die.
He didn't.
He asked to see me.
I wouldn't at first.
He hadn't done more than
Send me a card at christmas
And birthdays since my mother died
"Hi, ziggy!"
I heard you hit a home run today!
Yeah.
That is so exciting.
Congratulations.
"So, i organized some of the photos."
Here's grandma and grandpa.
"Cousins, brother, more cousins."
"I don't know if they're first or second, though,"
Because i'm not sure who they--
"Okay, wait, first of all, we have to draw the tree."
That's the most important thing.
And they want it actually on the cardboard.
"Here you go, honey."
The assignment said the child has to contribute.
"Now, put the trunk on there."
"And you're gonna be in the trunk,"
And then your mom and dad are then leaves.
And then we'll go from there.
What about my father?
"Um, we don't--"
We need to put him in here.
"You don't have a dad, sweetie, so it's-- it's okay."
"We'll use grandma and grandpa, and me, and great-uncle jimmy."
I still have to write my dad's name on the board.
"Well, you know, i said that, but everybody's board"
Is gonna be a little bit different.
You have to write down both of your parents' names.
I'll get in trouble if i don't.
"No, you won't get in trouble."
I want you to put it down.
Ziggy.
Don't you recognize me?
"In any case, you know that the only real pictures are childhood photos."
What is this picture?
It's an eminent Victorian in a hollywood bed.
There's a special effect here...
The bed appears twice.
"Yes, I made the bed even more hollywood-ish by doubling it."
"I prolonged it, to show this curve."
To make it even more victorian.
"It was taken in London, in a hotel room."
And who is this person?
My husband.
It was taken in London?
"In London, in january."
"At night, as you can see."
This is my friend of mine.
"Whom I photographed here in Paris, nearby actually."
I took off the part I wasn't interested in.
This person is also in a bed?
"No, he was layed back in a couch."
Layed back...
"But he seems floating in a bathtub, no?"
"Yes, yes."
"In the water, in a pool."
He holds a glass of tequila.
I gave him some...
In order for him to relax.
"It worked just a little bit, actually."
I have never seen this one.
This was taken more or less a year ago...
In Montfort I'Amaury.
Actually I wasn't the one who took the picture.
Today one will left.
Didn't worked.
I think its out of range.
Take the car near the rally.
I think they know we are following them.
Increasing the speed.
"I am getting near, you make target."
Drive fast its getting late.
You don't know my nature?
Uncle?
Why its not working?
Bhai (brother) its on target should i shoot.
"Wait lets find out where's the diamond,"
Papa!
Yes!
"A man who is behind us, asking for side, should I give him?"
"Papa, tell him if he give him side, then car will come on the middle."
"Then how could we get the range, I'm telling you over take him,"
"One, Two Three..."
"Laxminarayan, it's your first murder, Shoot him,"
"For your mother's tears sake, Shoot him."
"Papa, he's escaping, No, Papa."
"I suppose to leaving you but to ask first,"
My I take a leave please?
Please!
No!
"Till he die, you can't leave from here, Follow him,"
I miss a lot still water and died grand mother.
What you looking at my face?
"We don't have to spare Yadav, Come on."
Dad!
Dad!
[Groaning]
"♪ She's a superfreak, superfreak ♪"
♪ she's superfreaky yeow.
What was that?
You are not going to believe this.
At work I got all these compliments about the no-makeup thing.
"I mean, people telling me I looked great, and, like, younger."
Really?
Yes!
"And I actually got carded at lunch, and then I went to 2 other places, got carded again."
"I'm not gonna lie to you, honey."
I'm a little looped.
[Laughs]
That's--that's great.
Great for you.
"It is great, isn't it?"
We decided to be more honest with each other.
"You know, set some goals, work on some stuff, and we did it."
"Yeah, we--we did it."
Yeah.
You're done.
Wow.
"It's like without my makeup, my eyes stand out in this really great way."
And my mouth is so naturally pouty.
"I tell you, this telling each other stuff was the best thing we ever did, babe."
"You know, there is other stuff."
Huh?
"There's more things that you could work on about yourself, you know."
There are?
"A couple, yeah."
"Well, how come you didn't mention it the other night?"
I guess I didn't want to dump everything on you all at once.
Bitch...
Thanks for coming out.

"Look,I'm sorry."
But wouldn't that be kind of gross if that turned me on?
You look like a ten-year-old girl.
I feel like a pervert.
You got used to the Hitler.
"Well,the Indian pacifist just is not my thing."
"That says a lot about you,don't you think?"
"It's not right,okay?"
There's hair there for a reason.
"Oh,really?"
And what exactly is the reason?
I don't know.
"Maybe it's nature's way of saying,"
"""Hey,look over here."
"Thank you, Sergeant."
- Was salute satisfactory?
"- That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this."
The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.
Now try it again.
"Very good, indeed."
"That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it?"
"Very regimental, Din."
"Keep them at it, Subedar sahib."
They may need it.
Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown.
"- Where did you get the bugle, Din?"
"- Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking."
Don't you know that's very naughty?
"Please, sahib, don't take away."
Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti.
"Thank you, sahib."
- Sahib care to hear new call?
- Not now.
"Very regimental, Din."
"Company, attention!"
"Company, dismissed!"
"Let me see your tongue, Annie."
"I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib."
Very old Indian remedy.
"All right, go ahead."
But be careful.
"If anything happens to her, I'll..."
Understand?
Cry my eyes out.
"No, sahib!"
Very little bit goes very long way.
Everything is under control.
We have an unconfirmed report that resuscitation efforts may have failed.
It's always a danger up there in that copter in the Windy City.
"In a child with hypothermia, it can cause fatal arrhythmia."
She's right outside.
"- Jerry, turn that off."
- TV doctors....
Get Security to escort Dr. Mahoney to a less conspicuous place.
Let's get the life pack and drug box.
- Any sixes?
- Nope.
Go fish.
- How are you doing?
- My stomach hurts a little bit.
Get a CT of her abdomen along with the head.
Probably just a bruise.
- Where are her parents?
- Coffee shop.
"I get next game, okay?"
- Coming through.
Coming through.
"- Doctor, is he dead?"
"- Please, get out of the way."
- Dr. Greene can you confirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
- Not for a second.
- Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
We are stronger...
What are you ?
Some goddamn wind-up tin soldier ?
- This is my wife we're talking about.
- I know who she is !
And I have known her and cared about her a hell of a lot longer than you !
You can do whatever the frak you want !
I am going after my wife !
"Missiles are loaded, Admiral."
Open launch tube doors.
"Doors are open, Admiral."
What are you doing ?
Getting ready to nuke the planet.
Radiological detection.
- They've opened their missile doors.
- He's bluffing.
"- I can't let you do that, Sam."
- I am not asking you for permission.
Sergeant Mathias.
Load target package three-bravo.
Set ground zero for the underground structure.
Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee ?
They're loading a targeting package.
It's a bluff.
Don't let him rattle you.
The risk to us is unacceptable.
Turn back the Raiders.
The ships cannot turn back.
He won't launch it.
And D'Anna was explicit that she and Baltar make it to the planet's surface.
"So, is that what all this is really about ?"
"""And the heavens opened up, and they saw the eye."""
"Let's get another tube in, keep pumping in the saline."
We need to get her BP up.
- What can I tell them?
"- Nothing, say nothing!"
"Just get him here, fast."
Ready to insert the left tube.
Got no response to stimulus at any of the extremities.
"Right pupil's blown, left is slow to dilate."
We need to get her...
- She's in V-tach.
- Damn it!
"Who the hell was she chasing, anyway?"
Lanagan Pike; fell into a shallow pool of water and sodium hydrochloride.
"Burns to the right side, deep laceration to the left thigh."
"Frig, man, that burns!"
I need that one for questioning.
- You can have him when I'm done.
- A police officer's been injured.
"1, 2, 3, up."
Backstage is off limits!
"Listen, man, just get Yannick."
"Yannick knows her, man!"
"Her name is Natasha, she has brown eyes, she's a dancer in there,"
"- Yannick knows her, she's totally sweet..."
"- Hey, hey!"
- Take a walk.
"- Dude, listen to me."
"I'm sorry about what I said about your lack of neck that was hurtful, OK?"
"But I gotta find her, man, you gotta help me!"
"Dude, come on!"
"Trust me, you're better off."
You?
"But that, no."
It isn't clean!
"You can catch germs in no time,"
licking just anyone like that.
What happened after that?
"After Touchy, Ducky and the Morin girl arrived."
They came from the hotel.
"We turned to look, we saw this kid crossing the street, he almost got hit and jumped into the field."
"Ducky got out of his car, all excited."
He came up to us and asked:
"Touchy, what was that?"
"- A black guy, I think."
"...Touchy said, coming out of his truck."
Ducky was looking all around.
"Touchy saw that I had gun, so flicking his hair, he said:"
I'm gonna go catch him!
And he ran in the corn behind the kid.
"Ducky stayed with us, saw the statue and went..."
"He looked at me, then turned to the field."
Nothing was moving in there.
"Nothing at all, at all."
Ducky started yelling:
Touchy!
No answer.
"He was getting scared, he said:"
Was he alone?
How should I know?
They hang out in gangs.
It was no joke.
We were all staring at the corn field... even the Morin girl... who was quite... quite drunk.
Ducky was getting more nervous.
"Touchy, did you catch him?"
Brother llango...
How many more are there?
Call any number of men.
This will be their fate.
You said I can't come alive.
I have come alive.
You said I can't save my father and my people.
I have saved them.
You said Konda Reddy is the King of Cuddappah.
But now I stand on his dead body.
You said whether I am real man.
"Yes, I am real man."
"To me, you're just a corpse."
If any Konda Reddy or Gocha comes here
I will slit their throats.
Stop.
"As you said, you have saved your father  your people."
No one can cross Cuddapah.
I've framed your people as naxalites.
"Courier, I woke up when you killed Cuddappah Raja."
We jailed your father as a naxalite.
"Just 5 minutes, I changed everything."
"To free the head of terrorists, police station vandalized."
Terrorists attacked police and escaped with arms  ammunitions.
How is it?
No inquiry for naxalites.
Encounter straight away.
It's our men.
Hey Inspector.
We got the shooting order.
Don't listen to anyone.
Just kill them all.
"Okay, it all comes down to Virginia."
"If O'Brien gets Virginia, he wins."
"- However, if we get Virginia..."
- We win!
"No, actually, Gary, if we get it, we tie."
- What?
- What?
"I don't follow these things that closely, but that's right, isn't it, Mr. Davison?"
Yes.
"Tie, like it's a tie?"
"You mean, we tie?"
- You do.
"- The real shock, Greg, is where this leaves us."
Neck and neck if the president takes Virginia.
"Matty, you'll forgive me if I sideline you here."
- Sure.
"- Dan, you know the president well."
What is going on in that Meyer hotel suite right this second?
The president has a lot of top minds working on her campaign.
They're gonna be all over this.
What happens when there's a tie?
Everybody goes online to try to find out what happens if we get a tie.
Way ahead of you.
"Shit, I'm just getting how to tie a tie."
Is there a book?
Like an old-fashioned...
like a paper book?
"Jesus Christ, you know?"
You do your best.
You try to serve the people
- and then they just fuck you over.
- Yeah.
- Nothing?
So you had kept punching a number no longer in use!
Manoj...
Do you have any photo of you and her together?
"No, I don't."
What will I do with the photos?
The few photos that we did take are on her phone.
Any of your relatives or friends who have seen Ashwini?
No.
Have you seen any of her friends or relatives?
No.
Where is that ancestral place that you mentioned?
I don't know.
- What?
What were you doing with her without knowing anything?
Manoj...
Have you both gone out somewhere together?
Sometimes we used to go for a night drive.
Mostly we like solitude.
Hmmm...
Enjoyment in solitude...
Please think about it...
Haven't you gone out anywhere together?
On my birthday...
We went to a temple and had lunch outside.
Which restaurant?
Beach Walk.
- When is your birthday?
September 12th.
"Okay, Manoj."
We will try to find Ashwini.
You don't get scared.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm not Jeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
Rose!
"- Hi, Alex."
- I can't believe it's you.
My God!
"Alex, get a fucking grip."
- You look incredible!
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she look incredible?
"- Yes, we already covered that."
"- Oh, yes!"
- Can I have another drink.
- I thought you hated salad.
- I do.
"I just can't eat a big cheeseburger in the middle of the day anymore, ya know?"
- Doesn't it bloat you?
- Bloat me?
- Yeah.
"- No, it doesn't bloat me."
"Actually, I thought it went really well with the spareribs I had for breakfast this morning."
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.
"I just thought we'd always be in the same boat, ya know what I'm sayin'?"
It made it easier somehow.
I know.
Tell you what.
I'll give you half my salad if you give me half your burger.
- We'll need some more dressing.
- Definitely.
Waiter!
"We all WANT to be attractive, but remember:"
One of the first things people notice... the one thing that makes a lasting impression... is... your smile.
"If you're like most people, your appearance is important to you."
I live next door to you.
Right there.
"Just so you know, I can't be your friend."
...Why not?
That's just the way it is.
who said I wanted to be your friend...?
!
god!
what am I supposed to do?
to go out in there and do it myself?
Huh?
what?
answer me
maybe I'm getting slow
maybe I want to get caught... maybe I'm just tired
excuse me can I get through here?
"As some of you may have heard, there was an incident last night and one of our recent graduates was killed..."
"I want assure you that everything possible is being done to find those responsible for this tragedy, but in the mean time we should all be on the lookout for any suspicious activity..."
Your safety is our number on concern.
"it's you again, huh?"
"You know, I really wanna be left alone.."
Me too.
So leave.
You leave.
I've lived here longer than you...
What is that?
...This?
It's a Rubik's Cube.
You don't know Rubik's Cube?
Is it a puzzle?
Yeah...
Wanna try?
You had a little trouble.
"- But don't get off on the wrong foot, huh?"
- I'm not getting off...
"- If you have any problems, come to me with 'em."
- Just keep him off my back.
- Just try and cool it with him.
- I will.
"If you have any problems, come to me."
I'll handle him.
- Do me a favor.
"- I'll be happy to work with him, believe me."
He's a good cop- basically a good cop.
- He's got good hunches every once in a while.
"- Fine, fine, fine."
- Give him a chance.
- Keep him off my back.

"Every time my mom receives a paper, she tells me to get my dowry ready."
Is she nuts?
"That's exactly what my father says, and that's when the fighting starts."
"Whatever, if everyone agrees, let's sneak into the materials room and get the answer keys for the rest of the weeks, which will put an end to it."
What's the plan?
First the keys.
"Rafet has one of the keys, and Seyfo has the other one."
Seyfo has one key chain that has all the keys in it.
"Gamze, Seyfo is a big admirer of yours."
"What's up, Seyfo?"
"Hey, welcome Gamze."
I'm going to get some ice-cream.
I'm burning from inside...
I'll give you it.
Which one do you want?
Don't bother.
"I'll get it, but it's locked."
"Can you throw me the keys, Seyfo?"
"You continue your work, Seyfo."
"Hey Seyfo, are you ok?"
Thank you.
What's up?
Can you give me some water or something?
I am thirsty.
There's no water.
Drink from the fountain.
But the selling still continues.
Gamze is getting an ice-cream there.
What the hell is this?
Are you planning a robbery or what?
Of course not.
It's the key to the girls' locker room.

"Honey, can I talk to Mommy?"
She says she'll call you back.
Tracey?
Hello?
"I had everything checked out, everything... brain, heart, lungs, blood."
"I got my urine tested, my saliva, my sperm... they tested everything and they found nothing."
Nothing at all.
There's the file.
Take a look.
A little hypoglycemia and nothing else.
Nothing else at all.
"I'm very glad to hear that, Nathan."
- I'm happy for you.
"- So as of this minute, you are out of my life."
"No phone calls, no visits, nothing."
"If I ever see you again here or any place at all, it'll mean the police..."
got it?
May I show you something?
- No.
- It's a photograph.
Anna Rachevsky.
Very cute.
Now leave.
From a Russian family.
That photograph was taken the day she arrived in New York.
I don't give a shit.
"Not much money, father out of the picture."
"She wanted to go to college, but the closest she ever got was working in the cafeteria at NYU."
Her boss treated her like an animal.
The students didn't even notice.
Except one.
Above the stairs...
I'll write you where I am in case something happens.
- What would happen?
"- I said ""in case""!"
And don't overstrain yourself now!
Drive careful and look after yourself.
Yes.
"And you look after our child, dear!"
Brennemann?
"Brennemann, wait a minute... he was such a nice young man from the East Zone..."
Görlitz!
"Yes, but where he ended up... that I don't know."
- Didn't he say something about Düsseldorf?
- Düsseldorf?
"Ah, now I recall."
"There were some old family heirlooms, destroyed in the bombings, that were deposited with us."
Now he has sold everything.
"Away with it, he said"
Brennemann!
"And I'll have you know that 23,50 Marks too much was incorrectly charged in storage fees."
"- Well, what do you say to that?"
That's my husband all over!
"What didn't belong to him, he did not want."
"It was here 4 months, but debt never lapses, he always said."
Because there's always a chance he'll return.
"Well, forget about it!"
What now?
I see!
Bruno!
"- Yes, what is it?"
- Come here!
"Oh, dear Lord!"
"Uh, I'm a lawyer following up on a un-cashed check from FE Construction."
"Unfortunately, we'll need you to reissue the check."
Who is this?
Um... is this FE Construction?
Yes.
I don't recognize your voice.
"I'm a lawyer representing... someone... uh, who has an un-cashed check from FE Construction, and she can't access her funds, uh, unless you reissue, so..."
Who's the check made out to?
Cash.
"Where are you calling from, lady?"
"Can you just reissue the check, sir?"
Sure.
Give me a check number.
"You know what, um, I'll call you back with that information."
Thank you.
Wow.
"Oh, hey, Cary."
- How are you doing?
- Good.
"You seem to be, too."
"Oh, it's just from being liaison to Eli Gold."
"As soon as he's back on the campaign trail,"
I'll be out there with everyone else.
Where are you?
I'm out there with everyone else.
"Well, then you'll have company."
Canning.
"Oh, Cary."
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.
The Veriscene case-- we're in the middle of negotiations.
"Yeah, go for it."
"Uh, celery's all right, isn't it?"
"Oh, it's fine."
There's only one problem.
"It's in the refrigerator, in the back... and you're gonna have to work your way through a lot of other stuff to get to it."
"Emily, I wasn't even thinking about the banana cream pie."
"Honey, why don't you just come to bed and don't worry about it?"
"Yeah, you're right."
I'll... worry about it tomorrow.
- Good night.
"- Good night, honey."
Let's see.
An eighth of a pound...
in five hours.
That's more than a half a pound a day.
"In a year, I'll weigh..."
a little over 400 pounds.
"Well, this is it, Bob."
"You're really gonna love this place, and these noon classes are really the best... because all the greatest-looking chicks are here."
"We got... models, dancers, secretaries."
"Jerry, you didn't tell me there'd be girls here."
- Sure.
What do you think I'm doing here?
"- Well, I don't care, Jerry..."
- as long as I lose eight pounds.
"- Exercise is the key, Bob."
More important than dieting.
I don't diet and look at me.
That's Olga.
She is in charge here.
- Guess how old she is.
"- Uh, 65?"
That's right.
"I'll make it up to you, Kay."
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I'll...
I'm going to change.
I'll change.
I've learned that I have the strength to change.
Then you'll forget about this miscarriage and we'll have another child.
"And we'll go on, you and I."
-We'll go on.
"-Oh, Michael!"
"Michael, you are blind."
It wasn't a miscarriage.
It was an abortion.
"An abortion, Michael."
Just like our marriage is an abortion.
Something that's unholy and evil!
"I didn't want your son, Michael!"
I wouldn't bring another one of your sons into this world!
"It was an abortion, Michael."
It was a son and I had it killed because this must all end!
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.
"There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me."
"Not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000..."
-You won't take my children.
-I will.
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.
"Fredo, give this to Grandmother."
"Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino."
Allow me the honor of introducing someone.
"My partner in America, in New York."
"He's kind of weird, but he's quiet and always comes through with his half of the rent."
"But now, where were we?"
"Ah, yes, cloning."
Wait a second.
What do you want with me if it's the Tick you're after?
Don't you know anything?
You're the sidekick.
"I clone you, then send the evil clone to procure a tissue sample of the Tick, so I can clone a million of him."
"And speaking of tissue samples,"
I need to get one from you.
[Whimpers] You don't want to do that.
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, I do."
Now hold still.
"Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?"
Cloning is a precise science.
That's why I use the Clonerizer.
"It costs more, but you get what you pay for."
My own recipe includes a generous portion of Dr. Flack's secret cloning sauce.
"A pinch of oregano, 'cause, you know, a little goes a long way."
"And last, but not least, your toenail."
"Mix well, and... voilà."
"Arthur the Sidekick, prepare to meet Arthur the Evil Clone."
I Arthur.
I Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur, I Arthur."
"I Arthur, I Arth-ur."
I-I-I Arthur-Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur."
"[Chuckles] He's an eager little bunny, isn't he?"
They're a bit excitable at first.
[Gasps] No!
"I mean, the Ark's in the hands of a fanatic who thinks that it's a cigar box."
And the key that opens it is a thousand miles away at the Royal Academy in London.
"MacGyver, i-is there a purpose behind these acrobatics?"
"Oh, I hope so."
Watch your eyes.
Bravo.
I always said you were my brightest student.
If only you had applied yourself at university.
Professor!
Quite right.
Carry on.
Looks like that gate's the only way out of here.
Come on.
Put this on.
What?
I'm not leaving without the Ark.
Professor--
"MacGyver, the Torch of Truth is in that Ark."
I'm not leaving without it.
All right.
Understood.
"The final shipment of arms is being unloaded now, Colonel Petrovic."
Good.
A schedule has been brought forward.
We attack in two hours.
"If the prisoners are spies, the U.N. forces may know of our plans."
We should strike at once.
Could these men be telling the truth?
That old chest-- It does not matter.
They are to be executed immediately.
Those barbarians must have tried to force it open.
Look.
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
Oh!
- Jake?
- Amy--
It's so good to see you.
- Thank you guys so much for coming.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"- My dad died, and--"
"- Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Quick follow-up: did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"- All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
- What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"- All right, then stand up."
- Easy.
I love standing up.
"- Yeah, you're staying here."
"- Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
- That's not happening.
I'M GAY!
HOLLYWOOD HOOKUP!
"Hey, sweetie."
"Listen, Jessica wants you to print a retraction."
- She's really...
- Not now.
Ok.
So we'll talk about it...
"Yeah, that's good."
Celebulimia?
!
?
"Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
"What's that, Harvey?"
"No woman should leave their drink unattended in these troubled times, most of all you."
You ever heard of Jatropha Curcas?
- Your second wife?
- No.
It's a poisonous plant that grows in the tropics.
"Very difficult to detect, flavorless, and it kills in about 15 minutes."
Do you have any idea of how many of these people would like to see you laying on the ground begging for somebody to call 911?
"Damien Fields, less than 20 feet away."
You have pictures of him blowing some guy in Griffith Park.
At least we shot his good side.
Cara Valente.
Expose' on her and her nanny.
- Manny.
- Right.
Manny.
And that time-lapse series on the hooker parade on and off my yacht.
That was very clever.
And very funny.
You watched me pass out.
Doctor said the bullet you put in me missed my vital organs.
"Well, uh, lucky me."
"Because, uh, now I get to collect the money that you hid from me, Paul."
"Or, sorry, what are you calling yourself now?"
Craig?
Heh.
"You know, heh, I couldn't believe when I saw you on that game show."
I thought I was losing my mind.
"But there you were, in the flesh."
A second chance at getting what's mine.
"No, the money belonged to us."
"I figured you would double-cross me, so I moved it."
Smart boy.
"But, uh, you're not so smart right now."
You listen to me.
I know about that Swiss Bank account where you moved my money to.
Now here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go in that bank and you're gonna wire the money to yourself.
You're gonna get it out in cash.
You can't just walk into a bank and take out $4 million.
You just go in there and you get me what's mine.
All right.
Let's go.
- I said no cops.
- I didn't do anything.
"Go, go, go."
"Five-0 requesting back up, Pacific Rim Bank, shots fired."
Everybody out.
Are you the manager?
"Show me the back door, let's go."
"Chin, I see him."
I want to know where you're building the weapon.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-The hell you don't.
There's a reference to a planet he visited recently.
Azati Prime.
The coordinates match the location of one of the red giants.
"Set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
[Grave instrumental music]
Magnify.
REED:
"It's definitely Xindi, sir."
The hull composition matches the other ships we've seen.
It doesn't look like a Reptilian or a Primate design.
Bio-signs?
None that I can detect.
There's no atmosphere aboard.
-Anyone else in the system?
"-No, sir."
ARCHER:
Put a team together.
REED:
"Aye, sir."
[Grave instrumental music intensifies]
[Theme music]
It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I will see my dream Come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And they're not gonna Hold me down no more
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"
"Good day, cornele."
Nice day for erie.
"Look here, drew, who's that new broker you got?"
What?
You don't know who that is?
That's jim fisk.
Fisk?
"Oh, the fella that taught you to suck eggs, drew."
So you've taken him into camp.
"As soon as you get these recorded, come over to the office."
Have you got a big pocket?
I want to put new york in it.
"Oh, hello, commodore."
Too late to buy erie today.
You better come back tomorrow.
"How much you got to sell, fisk?"
All you want.
We aim to please.
Nothing stingy about the erie.
How much?
"1 million, 2 million, 3 million."
As far as you want to go.
That's all i want to know.
"Good evening, hannah."
Good evening.
Was there a printer here with a big poster?
"No, sir, mr."
Fisk.
"Well, i told him to send a sample copy of the show bill here as soon as it came off the press."
"It's got a picture of you on it, big as life and twice as natural."
And it won't be a week before everybody in new york will know who you are.
"I'm going to hang those posters all the way from the battery up to the end of new york, clean up to 34th street."
"-I do love you, Jess."
-I hope so.
"Darling, let's have dinner at home tonight, just the two of us."
"Oh, we're supposed to go to a party at the Lees'."
"Well, we can drop in for a few minutes, later, when you're getting bored with me."
"If we wait for that, we'll never get there."
Get some sleep.
"You, too, darling."
Just a minute.
"Come in, Josephine."
Mrs. Lee is here.
"Oh, how nice."
"Show her into the library, please."
I'll be down in a minute.
"Yes, Mrs. Bourne."
-Helen.
-Jessie.
It's good to see you.
Very good.
"How are the children, and Owen?"
And what are you doing out in the world so early?
"The children are devils, Owen's an angel, and I'm here to remind you of our party tonight."
-Coffee?
"-Yes, thank you."
Is the party about anything?
"Have I forgotten a birthday, or an anniversary?"
No.
"Strictly business, and bound to be awful."
"Some ex-cop has written a book Owen wants to buy for the paper, so this party is to dazzle the poor fool into signing away the syndicate rights."
"His name's Dwyer, Mark Dwyer."
He gets in from Europe today.
We'll drop in for a few minutes after dinner.
Thus qeu do?
Bujar was right.
You lost all respect!
I'll be back tonight.
And you will tell me everything.
Get it?
"Daddy, do not go!"
Behave!
Go back!
"Dad, come back!"
Good thing we have a coordination center.
I am proud to say that this research will be led by our delegated Helen Sikkeland.
The OS of Oslo appointed for this case here in Mysen.
"Given his experience in Kripos, this research is in excellent hands."
-I Could not identify the connection.
-Imaginei He could not.
"It's obvious, but what makes me angry is that I did not know that there is only one person in it."
'Tell me what you have.
-Ok.
They were members of Ferrymen and supported the Sixers.
Sixers sell marijuana and amphetamines.
They do not play.
-So They were responsible?
-may Be.
The Ferrymen lost two deliveries because of the informant.
It's a great debt.
-Possível.
-Possível.
Even if the victim has been saved on their own.
"-If So, the Audi could have been her."
-Encontraram The GPS in the car?
-Do Not.
Your Father Name:
Sivaratnam.
Your Grandfather Name:
Navaratnam.
- It seems Ratnam is the common capital for all.
Exactly..
This Maniratnam is a bonded slave to the family of Vasundhara Devi.
He is now here to find out a secret.
This is peaks to the peaks and is sensational.
Oh my god..
I remember by secret PK bro.
If required I will catch your feet.
You catch the hands of my wife.
Say whether there is someone else in her heart.
I helped so many people.
You are my friend.
Come!
What is this meaningless thing?
"Even if my sister agrees for this test, I will not agree."
My sister is like fire!
Who are you to agree?
Catch his hand.
Why do you just leave without saying anything?
I cannot break families by telling.
Ethics are wealth for me.
"No problem, tell."
My heart is like the granite.
Then listen this..
Another one is seen in your wife's life.
He is a very tall guy and dangerous man.
He stepped in a company as an employee and has married the daughter of the Chairman.
"Correct, right?"
Last I heard.
True story.
"- Oh, this was so cold."
- Yeah.
- It was raining too.
- Look at those boys.
How can you just not love them and wanna hang out?
Jonny's beatboxing was really funny.
"This was when the ""let me show you my balls"" thing happened."
"- Yeah, that was that night."
- Right there.
A guy wanted to show us his balls.
Didn't get to.
So a guy on our movie or some other dude?
- A drunk guy that was stumbling...
- A guy tried to show us his balls.
- Christo handled it perfectly.
- Christo and Self handled it.
- What did Christo do?
- Christo handled his balls.
"Christo is our first AD, who is..."
- Handsome.
- Handsome.
- Hand me some of that.
- And so sweet.
Gorgeous.
Ari.
"By the way, this pregnant lady actually threw up like in the left over where the chairs were, before we started shooting."
Threw up everywhere in between her legs and then just proceeded to sit there for 20 minutes with her and her boyfriend and nobody cleaned it up.
I feel like that was a good omen.
- This is the greatest...
- Ari.
what did he say?
which we are told to say
its opened
you should never leave the door open
who knows who will come in
sit..
we need to talk talk about what?
want to tell you the truth may be you'll feel good.
really?
shall we start?
from bankok ..o.p ramsai guilty..
and vikram kapoor.?
I've linked him with police.
"Infact, i wasn't with him when he commited suicide."
So how come you know he's dead.
the police department knows this.
you might have phone.
are you a police officer?
So what do I call you?
nil or arjun?
there's no need to mess up this case more
so you do think too that the kabir got killed.
Human has some strange habits as .
when the drink wine while smoking..
So their glass would must be in their left hand.
Like a kabir malhotra..
I'm also left handed.
If he's left handed...
so why he driggered gun from right hand.
but who?
there's a tale in a latin language
who's benificiry?
How many ships did you lose?
Hmm.
About half the group.
Flying out of England?
Yes.
Waddington.
92nd bomber group.
"Hey, lieutenant, how'd you blow up that train with 50 guards around?"
"Well, I, heh..."
"Just lucky, I guess."
Don't let him kid you.
Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.
Here's what happened.
We're waiting at the depot at Frankfurt.
Understand?
When an ammunition train comes through the longest ammunition train you ever saw.
Understand?
"Oh, he's just giving it a big buildup."
"Actually, it was simple enough."
"I just drifted into the men's room, fixed myself up a little time bomb, broke open the window and when the train started pulling out, I just tossed the thing into an open car."
I guess there must have been some straw in there.
Yeah.
And about three minutes later you can hear it.
Boom!
Understand?
Broke every window in Frankfurt.
Understand?
It was gorgeous.
Wait a second.
I'm not through.
Understand?
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
"Office...""Future  Wellness""."
Apartment... 12.
Don't fret.
It won't be bleeding for long.
Now it's a habit!
"Well, kick it!"
"""Future  Wellness""."
"With what they'll get from us, they'll qualify for a new plaque: ""Past  Flabby Cankers""!"
Hit it.
Big time.
"My half brother, Léo, Mickey."
Edgard Venom.
"What does he poison, this Venom?"
He's the fat pussy with a small...
I can't see his full livery.
He heads the Office of Buildings and Investments.
He's investing in me.
He's pumping shit into your veins.
They all screw you 'cause you believe in the system.
All that's in vain 'cause you don't have taste.
Do you get off on family affairs?
You unhealthy paranoid.
I want the recipe!
It's too complex.
You wouldn't get your head round it.
Around what?
That you and your Venom brothers swap guided missiles for Afghan dope?
Dope which you blow up in the street?
Laundering fallout through Buildings and Investments to get clean books?
"As for official stamps, we've got Mr André at the Ministry."
And where is Simon Venom in all of this?
Simon's untouchable.
"It sounds like they're shouting "" pizza."" Are they?"
European fans lik e they're just crazy.
They don't come out in the tens and hundreds.
They come out in thousands.
just wish that could just go along each person and just lik e  chat to them. ith how busy the schedule is it's really frustrating that you can't stop and talk to them and tell them what they've done for us.
"Five minutes, we're on stage!"
One Direction!
One Direction!
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"milan, make some noise!"
Thank you so much for having us!
We've been One Direction!
This one's for you.
Thank you.
still get a buzz every time go out on stage.
still come off with  the biggest adrenaline rush.
hen get to  come on the bus and stay up with my mates and laugh about things that we did on stage.
Do you know when I taped you up in the middle of the show with the black tape?
Is that what you did?
"I know, it failed miserably."
You should have just gone with it.
"Thanks for your help, mate."
One girI-
- That is...
-...awful.
-Putrid.
It is absolutely putrid.
Own up.
Own up.
"-Oh, my God."
-Who's farted?
"When you run out of the truth, what are you gonna say then?"
"Nothing, nothing at all."
"You just keep repeating that, Mrs. Slocum."
It could mean a whole lot to your future.
[door opens] [door closes]
~~[scatting]
[sighs]
[clucking tongue]
"Thanks, honey, I don't mind if I do."
"Say, where's your mother anyway, it's almost dinner time."
"Well, she can't be out much longer."
"As soon as the stores close, she's got to come home."
What a good girl you are.
Always waiting for your mother.
"Like the other night, for instance."
It was real nice of you to wait till she got home.
"What time was it, anyway?"
She got in around 2:00 a.m.
You're sure 'cause you were up?
"No, I'm not sure."
Then how can you be sure?
I'm not.
It's just that she said she got in then.
Then you wouldn't know if she went out again.
"Really, Mrs. Armstedder."
Why don't you stick to solitaire?
"Janie, what do you think?"
A lady at the hairdresser's asked me for my autograph... and the man at the corner said I ought to sell my story to the Chronicle.
"Are you still here, Blanche?"
"Well, Jane asked me to dinner."
"Say, you've got a new hairdo."
"Well, looks pretty nice."
"Well, I don't see how any man could say no to you in that dress."
"Hey, word is Paul Logan's in town."
Paul Logan?
Paul Logan?
Number one host in Macao.
"Yeah, Macao, Monte Carlo."
But not Vegas.
"No, not Vegas."
"Mr. Taylor, if you're missing personal property, we can call security, but..."
"I'm telling you, I ain't payin' for this room, not after what happened to me in there."
Excuse me.
What's going on around here?
There's a ghost in my room.
And she's a thief.
I'm sorry.
There's a what?
She took my money clip right off the nightstand.
"It was silver, with my initials..."
R.P.T.
And there was 400 bucks in there.
You're saying that someone stole your money...
"Not someone, something."
"I get back to my room, and I see this dark-haired woman sorta hovering on my bed."
- Hovering?
"- Yes, hovering."
"Next thing I know, she's gone and so is my money clip."
You oughta comp my stay and reimburse me what she stole.
That's him.
That's the guy who walked out on his check at Mystique.
"All right, you owe her 86 bucks, pal."
Let's go.
Did you intend to pay for any part of your stay here?
You have no choice.
I'll just go tell Mom and Dad about the money and they'll ground your ass for a year.
"I don't care, tell them."
'Cause I'm not even going to be here.
I'm going to run away and no one will ever see me again.
"Good, go."
And who's even going to miss you?
You're just a little thief.
"Where you going, Chris?"
Who are you going to turn to?
You don't even have any friends.
(doorbell rings)
Hi.
I ran away from home.
Do you mind if I live with you?
Live with me?
"My goodness, I feel like"
I want to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming.
"Hot dog, it's real."
"Mr. Herbert, it's 6:00, I'm-I'm not really tired yet."
"Well, you had those three cups of Nyquil."
You'll be down soon enough.
"Okay, good night, Mr. Herbert."
"Sweet dreams, Chris."
"Mr. Herbert, what's life really all about?"
"Well, I suppose it's about trying new things;"
sampling the sweet and the savory;
not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
Wow.
I never looked at it like that before.
"Thanks, Mr. Herbert."
But don't you think it's scary to try new things?
You're welcome.
You don't know how I've been waiting for this.
"Listen, you see Robin before I do, tell her I really appreciate it."
"- Are you listening to me, Stan?"
- Yeah.
Because you need to be very clear about something.
Go ahead.
This is not the beginning of anything.
This is the end.
Got no argument here.
"Look, I don't know what Robin told you about this but I made a couple mistakes, reference to some gambling."
"Believe me, I learned my lesson."
"I swear, Stan Heywood gambles no more."
"I swear to you, I really appreciate Robin helping me out like this."
You finished?
- Yeah.
"- I'm a cop, Stan."
"- Oh, God."
- The only reason I don't bust you--
- I made a couple mistakes--
- I understand.
Things happen.
"I won't pop you, because I haven't looked inside that envelope."
"If I were to find money in there, I'd pop you."
So forget whatever you're thinking.
You've committed a crime.
"If you ever approach Robin again, I will put you in jail."
You understand me?
Straight to Rikers.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
MARTINEZ:
But it really doesn't matter because I like me.
"Well, I don't like you."
Whatever.
I love you.
I can't stand picking out tiles.
It drives me nuts to try to redo the fricking house.
I know it does.
"But, you know, the one thing that we can and should always do is just kind of have fun with each other."
"And truthfully, sweetheart, that should be the easiest thing to do because before there was the kids or the house or the job or any of it, there was just you."
"And I love you, Ronnie."
"I love you, too, Dave."
"Hey, now, all you naughty boys and girls, gather 'round, gather 'round."
The hell's she doing here?
Who?
That's my wife.
She must be looking for me.
I don't think so.
She looks fine.
You should just relax.
Son of a...
Excuse me!
Hey!
Peacock!
"Please, I don't want to hurt you."
"""Encouragement!"" Joey!"
"Baby, remember when we first met and I told you that you were the only man I'd ever been with?"
You lied?
"No, no, no, no, no."
I was...
"I was completely inexperienced, and, honey, I didn't know what I had in you."
I've been cheating on you!
I've been cheating on you every chance I got!
I hid it in the basement before the war.
A 60-gallon barrel.
He'll confiscate your amazing barrel without you.
Sit here quietly.
"Vanya, I'll get you acquiainted with some folks."
-Which folks?
- From the Vlasov units.
What for?
The Germans made them set all the minefields here.
They know all the passages and easily get to my house.
They either stay awayforweeks or visit us every other day.
So introduce them to Shulgin.
It is his business.
Shulgin will execute them.
And you are a scout.
-Aren't you afraid to offer such things to me?
"- No, I'm not."
-Why?
"-You a real man, Vanya."
"They are traitors, do you understand that?"
Traitors.
I'm a traitor as well.
-Have you ever shot at ourtroops?
- Never.
-Can I have yourword of honor on that?
"-Yes, you can."
Do not tell anyone about that.
Think about saving your own life.
is there anyone to feel pity for us when these boys kill us?
"Maryska, my niece."
Her parents were executed when yourtroops came in 1939.
She has the pneumonia.
I'm sure.
You gonna be all right?
I'll be all right.
And you?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think so."
Tell Catherine it brought me luck.
I will.
"I'll be seein' you around,"
Dr. Jackson
"I'm telling you, the government has a car that runs on water, man."
"They just don't want us to know, because then we'd buy all the water."
Then there'd be nothing left to drink but beer.
And the government knows that beer... will set us free.
"Hyde, you told us about the car a million times."
Can we please talk about how hungry and horny I am?
I wish I had a lady made of pizza.
Or a pizza made of boobs!
"Yeah, hungry, check."
"Horny, check."
"It's getting a little old, Fez."
"God, I feel like I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?"
Remember when he was living on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?
Just workin' on Uncle Owen's water farm all day.
Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station to pick up some power converters.
Boring.
"Eric, enough with the Star Wars crap!"
"Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown."
"And when I frown, my skin wrinkles."
"And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over."
And I like my free ride!
Get your heads out of your asses.
We got two frisees... one torn crab- and fire the sweetbreads.
Oops-a-daisy.
I'm sorry.
It seems I got a little enthusiastic with the coulee.
"Well, whilst you're licking things-"
Make it again.
"- I got your back, bro."
- Hmm.
Oh-ho!
Oh!
- [ Popping Sound ] - [ High-Pitched Squealing ]
- What the hell was that?
"- It's called "" the shocker."""
And any of you tools try and touch me again... and you're gonna get one of your own.
"Hey, I'm used to being the only woman in the kitchen... so back off or bend over."
- Oh.
- Raise your hand if you got a semi right now.
Semi-what?
"You don't actually like that thing, do you?"
"Oh, I know."
I wish I didn't 'cause it so fits into the stereotype.
But the truth is this poofy little dog has won my heart.
- I love you.
"- You guys... when my friend Jessica shows up tomorrow, please be gentle, okay?"
"Ooh, what's wrong with her?"
"Oh, does she wear the big shoe?"
"She's not a freak, okay?"
She's just a bit of an outcast.
"You know, could never get a boyfriend."
"She was kind of like my project, my mascot."
I tried to teach her how to be cool.
Now we're even.
"So long, Stacey."
"Come on, you."
On your feet.
"Honest, Stacey, honest."
It wasn't my fault.
I told ya I didn't want anybody killed.
Get moving.
Where you taking me?
"You didn't think I was gonna let you live and welsh on that confession, did ya?"
"No, no."
Let me alone!
Let me alone!
"Please, Stacey, please!"
[GUNFIRE]
[¶¶¶]
[¶¶¶]
"So long, old-timer."
"I guess if you hadn't socked me on the chin,"
"I'd be laying in the icehouse now, along with Dale and the rest."
I-
"- Gee, I don't know what to say."
"Never mind, Red."
You'll be out yourself before long.
Thanks.
"So long, Frank."
"It oughta make up for what you've gone through in here,"
"Ross, to know that it hasn't been in vain."
"The day Stacey came to me and gave himself up,"
I asked him why he was throwing away his freedom.
"I didn't fully understand all he tried to tell me, but it was something about you living the rest of your life for him as he might have lived it himself if he'd had the right breaks when he was a kid."
Then he asked me for a photograph of himself.
"You know, some people might find it peculiar that I, a Muslim, am buying so much fertilizer."
OK.
"Well, enjoy your fertilizer and being a Muslim."
I'll get your change.
Aren't you supposed to go to Amaar's mosque kick-off press conference?
"Yes, I am."
"It's a town meeting, and I am the mayor."
And yet you're not moving.
I will.
Just waiting for Charles to call.
I just want to hear his voice.
We've hardly talked at all this week.
Hey!
"Stop ignoring me, I'm actually opening up."
I'm sorry.
I'm just lost inside my head.
I don't think I'm a Muslim anymore.
Have you eaten any bacon yet?
"I've toyed with the idea, but I haven't followed through."
I just keep asking myself:
Why am I a Muslim?
"I mean, is it because of Rayyan, because if it's because of..."
"Oh, my God!"
"OK, you win."
I'll go to Amaar's press conference.
Just stop talking.
[ sigh ] [ cell phone ringing ]
Mayor Popowicz's phone.
Oh!
"Hello, Charles."
"Well, I must say that's very descriptive, but this is Sarah, and I'm not nearly that flexible."
I'll let Ann know you called.
Larry King.
Yeah.
Or any of those shows.
That's right.
And you can usually find us at Big Willy's Dirty Dogs.
Most times.
"My name is Will, and this is Dale."
And we've been through a lot ofheavy stuff in that truck before.
"- Monster madness, dude."
- Major monster madness.
"- Gentlemen, please."
- What?
But-But...
- We're not fooling around!
We're not fooling around!
- Get in the back.
Sometimes you got to take the bull by the horns!
We're American citizens!
And there you have it.
Who says the great American hero is a thing of the past?
"- Back to you, Rocky..."
"- I hope you can see this, Bill and Wendy."
It's like a circus down there.
"You know, Byron, it's easy for us reporting this story... to forget there's a very scared little girl inside that car."
"We can only imagine, as this chase continues... the horror young Natalie Voss is experiencing right now."
"Oh, shit."
- Just-Just hold still.
- It stings.
- Mm!
- I don't want it to get infected.
- I'm so sorry about this.
- As you should be.
Evil is the nature of mankind.
- Isabel!
- Evil must be thy only happiness.
- Isa...
"- Welcome, children, to the communion of your race!"
No!
Isabel!
"- I, young Goodman Brown..."
"- Isabel, help!"
Help!
-...stand before you with the devil as my witness.
And promise to strike down any who seek to impede my destiny.
"- Isabel, it's me."
"Isabel, please!"
No!
Ah!
"- Oh, Faith."
What would I do without you?
"- Allison, will you please leave us?"
"Faith, will you please leave us?"
Who are you?
- A simple good man named Brown.
"- And at the coven, you spoke the lines of the devil."
- Lines?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
I admit that night in the woods is a bit of a blur.
There was so much darkness.
I'm just glad I was able to save my Faith.
- Very well.
It's a testament to your will that you were able to inhabit your role so fully.
But now I need you to forget him.
You are no longer Goodman Brown.
"And this, a photo he had on him."
It's from 1940.
1940.
Everything's leading us to the same year.
Alright.
"Have Amelia and her team visit him in the hospital, immediately."
"Time travel with a shrimp allergy, now that is risky."
I don't know what you're talking about.
About this.
"We're pressed for time, so you can confess everything now."
"Relax, Alonso."
Tell us how you arrived here from 1940.
"I'm sick, not crazy."
Time travel can't be done.
"Yes, yes it can."
"We do it, as a matter of fact."
So I'm sure that you aren't crazy.
"But if you don't work with us, we can lock you up in an asylum for life."
Are you sure this will work?
I've synchronized the frequency with my phone.
We'll hear everything that Himmler says from his room.
I don't hear anything.
They haven't gotten back from the bull fight.
Here they are.
(HIMMLER) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
What did he say?
"-""What a disgusting spectacle""."
"""Gallito is a fucking murderer""."
Whereas they have Auschwitz... now that's a show for the whole family.
Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You did good.
Listen.
You did a great job.
Here you go.
Careful.
It's full.
Okay.
"Paul, I'm-- I'm sorry I'm late."
It's okay.
"I, uh, gave the speeches."
"We're just, uh, waiting on you."
I got MVP.
Is my trophy in there?
I'm sure it is...
somewhere.
"Uh, hopefully, there are trophies for all the players that contributed."
"Okay, Hornets, bring it in, guys."
Come on over.
"Finally, now that the hardware is here, we're gonna give out some awards, okay?"
"And, uh, I'm gonna make you guys suffer through some more boring speeches, and I apologize for that, so bear with me, okay?"
He is so good with kids.
I think coaching's been a real solace for Paul during this time of upheaval.
I think it has.
"We should probably organize something with Joy's other girlfriends, make sure he stays fed, don't you think?"
"Or, you know, I could just... feed him."
It's been two months.
He's hardly wasting away.
"Libby, I'm looking for an excuse."
"You're gonna think I'm terrible, but how long, exactly, does a widower have to wait before he can start, you know... eating?"
I don't know.
A year?
Says who?
- Ha ha ha!
"What, did he hop the gate?"
You came!
- I said I'd come.
"- I know, but you came!"
How could I miss it?
"Manny, the first member of my family"
- to ever graduate from high school.
- Wait a minute.
Don't you have a brother in Colombia
- who's a doctor?
- Yes.
"He just does orthopedic surgery, no brain or heart."
"Think of it... tomorrow,"
"I will watch you stride across the stage with a sash, like a rebel's bandolier telling the world ""No absents, no tardies."""
"Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks and drink some, um, beers."
"Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,"
I would like to take Manny out for a special father-son celebration.
- Is that okay?
"- Ah, sure."
"I mean, he... made the effort to come."
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.
But... go ahead.
Perfect!
The night begins.
But first... here.
(spritzing)
Walk through this.
(chuckles)
"I know that smells terrible, but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite."
(singsong voice) There he is... the graduate.
"I have one word for you, Luke... plastics."
Thought you might know the right man.
He calls himself Fred.
Which one?
He calls himself Fred.
Which one?

What was that for?
I bet that this would suck.
[Laughs]
"What a fucking, fucking, fucked up thing, man."
It was a fucked-up burn.
These guys are doing a high fall for us later.
It's the same shit every time.
Never hire Lloyd's friends.
Never.
INTERVIEWER:
What's your biggest fear of today?
Not getting the shots and not going on schedule
Are my biggest fear every day.
"We had a-- we had to have a Toxie stand in,"
Because our Toxie was late.
He's usually incredibly punctual.
He's been consistent every single day.
I think he's one of the first people on set almost every day.
"And yet today, he overslept."
Fucking dammit.
I said 6 o'clock.
It's three hours and they can't get the guy into costume.
INTERVIEWER:
That did not make Lloyd very happy.
"No, it didn't make anybody very happy."
[Inaudible] at the office.
Yeah.
"I can't hold their fucking hands, Lloyd."
You can kick them in the ass.
You can certainly ring their bloody necks.
"And you know, mules-- if you kick a mule hard enough,"
You get it to pull the plow.
You want me to give you the death ray?
"Now, Marty."
"Well, then give me a quarter for a flying saucer or I'll let him have it."
"All right, dear."
Here.
MAN ON PA:
"Last call for the Santa Fe,"
"San Bernardino local, train number 54."
"Leaves at 5:30 p.m., entering through gate J."
This is the last call.
I'll take this one.
"25 cents, please."
"Here you are, I'll pay for that."
Thank you.
"Oh, don't be frightened."
(SHUDDERING) Here.
"No, no, no, that's for you."
I like little boys who have space guns.
You know why?
'Cause I have a space collection.
You have?
"Oh, sure, they're right here in this bag."
"And do you know that when I went to the moon,"
I got my first space gun.
"And since then, I've added almost 350 space guns to my collection."
"I have one space gun that shoots out little men, and those little men have space guns that shoot darts."
"And when I was in Tibet,"
"I got a space gun with camels sitting on the top of it, just about so big."
"I know it's pretty difficult to believe that, but you must believe me."
The train leaves in 15 minutes.
What if we miss him?
Not a chance.
"Molly, you up yet?"
Aw!
Out!
"Oh, look who's coming to the kitchen in his jammie pants."
Morning.
"Cop a squat, I'll get you a cup of coffee."
Thank you.
"Listen, uh, Mrs. Flynn,"
I really appreciate you letting me move in here.
"Oh, please, call me Joyce, and it really wasn't my decision."
Cream and sugar?
"Black, please."
You'll love it with cream and sugar.
That's the way Molly's dad drank it.
"I don't really process dairy well, but okay."
"And listen, if there's anything you ever need done, just let me know."
I want to earn my keep.
"We're talking chores, right, not some sort of plus- sized gigolo action?"
No.
"I'm pulling your leg, hoss."
Oh.
"If you're serious about helping out, a couple of those kitchen cabinets could use new hinges."
I'll take care of that today.
We could also use a new screen for the back door.
Victoria walks through at least one a year.
Consider it done.
And a new exhaust hose for the dryer.
Easy to do.
"Oh, and the pulsating shower wand upstairs has seen better days."
Three women in the house...
don't ask.
Wasn't planning on it.
That is not the same girl Chuck came home with last night.
"Has he, uh, come to talk to Lily yet?"
Do you want me to talk to him?
"No, I already tried, but thank you."
I'm gonna come to your lacrosse game after brunch.
Judge away.
Shame turns me on.
"Hey, man, she's going to Lily's for brunch."
Maybe a stack of waffles will help your hangover?
I find the cause is the best cure.
I gotta go.
"So I will see you later at the library,"
And I'm sorry about before
With the Tisch catalog.
It's fine.
"Dan, I don't know how to do this."
We've been tiptoeing around each other for days.
"Look, we're-we're two artists in a relationship,"
"And sometimes we're gonna be competing for the same things,"
"So, all right, we're- we're-we're smart people."
Let's come up with...
"Some rules,"
A list of topics that are off-limits.
Isn't that what got us in trouble with Tisch?
"No, no."
"This will be different,"
Because we'll know...
What we don't know.
"Hey, listen to me."
I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld.
"Okay, until the sting of Tisch has worn off,"
I
I have a pair of cargos that come with a ski cap.
"- Just some long pants, if you got those."
- Yeah.
Sure.
Like drop-crotch slacks?
Just the best-- whatever.
It doesn't... [coffeemaker gurgling]
Pants!
- Thanks.
"- So, what's the what, man?"
"Yeah, like I was saying, I just, you know--"
"It's the first time I've been back in the 'hood in a minute and it kind of... you know, to be honest, it feels like people are... trying to hold me responsible for something I did."
"Man, that is unfair."
"But, I mean, that's like, just like a people, isn't it?"
"Like, they do that."
"Yeah, they do."
"And, you know, I'm just..."
I really just need somewhere to-- somewhere to stay.
"Oh, man."
You should talk to my landlord.
"- Man, he's the most accommodating dude."
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"He's always telling me he's got like, a line of people that he wants to get in here."
"You should get on line, Chip!"
He is a real coolio too.
"Like, I haven't paid rent in like, three or six different months."
"So, I mean, that's one thing."
"But, you should hurry, because he said that rents are gonna skyrocket soon because of the new hotel going."
So--
Shit!
I don't see why.
Huh!
"What, you -- spend money?"
"Granville, I am t--talking about advertising."
You keep on about s--spending money.
I wish you'd w--watch your language!
"I may be old--fashioned, but I hate to hear young people t--talking loosely."
I haven't brought you up to be promiscuous over m--money.
-
"- True, I'll give you that."
-
- You've lacked for nothing.
That's right.
That's one thing I haven't lacked -- nothing!
I've had plenty of that!
You've always had good food and healthy exercise.
I know.
But what about boring?
It's often been boring.
"Well, I should hope so."
But look what it's d--done for your complexion!
-
"- You've got wonderful skin, our Granville."
-
"- I haven't done a lot with it, though."
Skin like that is entirely due to good old--fashioned English b--boredom.
"We used to be famous for it, a while back, all over Europe."
"""There go the English,"" they used to say. ""Aren't they boring?"""
"Mind you, we were always r--respected for it."
"Yes, but the world's changed."
And d--don't they know it.
Look what they get now abroad.
I see.
"Uh, how long has this been going on?"
Ever since we got back from vacation.
It was not a vacation.
It was an aliyah.
That's a pilgrimage to Israel.
Where did you visit when you were in Israel?
We shopped in Tel Aviv.
We swam in the dead sea.
It was wonderful.
They have spa treatments there.
- Then we went to the wailing wall...
- Oh!
- Where... this one went bananas.
"- I-I mean, I was brought to my knees."
- And I was moved to tears.
- He was on his knees.
"- B-being there, praying there..."
"- It was very scary, actually."
That is as close to heaven as I've ever felt.
It changed me forever.
Jerusalem syndrome?
"Mm, it's been around since ancient times."
"Apparently, people go to these holy sites, like the wailing wall, and they start relinquishing possessions,"
"- wearing togas, sermonizing."
"- Yeah, but it's..."
It's temporary.
And they usually recover in a couple of days.
"Yeah, but this has been going on for three weeks with this guy."
Tracy said it's getting worse every day.
He's such a show-off.
You're eating doughnuts for lunch?
"Forgive me, I don't stock new labels or small labels"
KK-Mix burnt out four years ago.
"And what an album, ""What's Life?"""
These songs don't sell.
And I won't annoy Mr Shekhar
Mr Om!
You...?
Hello...
You don't recognise me?
I remember you very well
Can I ever forget a pirate?
- That's just as well
"Market news is, no one's willing to distribute your label with KK-Mix"
But I can sell
"Until now, you only trusted gentlemen"
"For once, try out a scoundrel"
"I will, if you stop pirating music"
Stipulating terms?
Even in distress?
That makes me feel like agreeing
"Okay, God be my witness."
No more piracy

"And I need that in a cashier's check or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
And make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates.
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"After that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
I look like your high school girlfriend?
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defense that money can buy.
"Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
Ok.
"Look, it's on your head."
You're not supposed to double up on Vitamin A. It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
"What happened to my masturbator, Francesca?"
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
"Gentlemen, I sense you're discussing my client."
Shut up!
I got this one!
- Roldy?
- Please don't!
"I am in a great amount of pain, sir!"
Everybody relax.
Just calm down.
Everything is under control.
Tell 'em to turn the plane around.
These two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.
Secretary Fox.
Glad you could make it.
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack of this magnitude?
Not a fuckin' chance.
Who are these people?
Representatives of the different intelligence agencies.
I assume Secretary Whitmore's coming?
Negative.
He's on an ice fishing trip in Glacier Bay.
I'm in charge while he's gone.
"Well, shouldn't he be alerted?"
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?
Who are you again?
"Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA."
"Yeah, well, listen, Dr..."
Dipshit.
You've obviously never been ice fishing before.
"- No, I haven't."
"- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating."
The last thing anyone would want while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.
Now back off... and let me do my job.
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?
"Archaeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith."
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it,"
"I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless..."
like the Ark.
Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.
"What about your boss, der Fuehrer?"
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see Him together.
I've got nothing better to do.
"Uncle Indy, come back home now!"
Uncle Indy!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you."
Uncle Indy!
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
Sire.
The palace has canceled Our King.
"Ludovic, we are the Palace."
Anything he has filmed will be censored.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lloyd."
But think a little.
His story and my film will never see the light.
"Once again, my footage was being thrown away forever."
But I could not blame him.
"After all, a king has no fate in his hand."
"At least, so I thought."
"Yes, that's fine, but we have to agree with Turkish security."
"Yes, our versions must coincide."
Nobody knows.
"Well, no one knew about the king's identity."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Sire, I have the official version proposed by the Palace."
"We left Istanbul yesterday, accompanied by Turkish security."
And our escape in the Balkans has never happened.
Mr. Duncan Lloyd?
"I, King Nicolas III, King of Belgium..."
I authorize her to do what she wants
With all the pictures and sounds
Which he recorded from the day we were at Mini Europe.
"Any pictures, sire?"
Yup.
Are you sure?
Agree.
His Majesty.
Do you think this trip is due to chance or destiny?
It must be fate.
I'm still your mother.
"No, my mother's dead."
I went to her funeral when I was six.
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.
"She was trying to use me, like you are now."
Why?
She wants an army.
An army?
I want an alliance.
"No, what you want is revenge."
- This isn't about me.
-(SCOFFS)
It's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another.
"This city may be surrounded by a wall, but it doesn't have to be a prison."
- I think that's a bit extreme.
-Hmm?
"I mean, the Faction System isn't perfect, but it's hardly a prison."
Let me guess.
Erudite.
I was Erudite.
You willing to kill Jeanine?
Absolutely.
"When I was married to Marcus, I knew her well."
"And believe me, there's nothing she isn't capable of."
But I think you already know that.
"Tris, we can't trust her."
Or maybe she knows...
"We're on the same side, Tris."
I'm Factionless because I don't fit into any one faction.
And you're Divergent because you belong to too many.
But we're both a threat to Jeanine.
"My people are ready for war, if that's what it takes."
What's the last thing we want?
No panic.
Right.
"Okay, is the tutorial over?"
Let's get in there.
Out of here.
"Beers, is that you?"
"It's Janet Lewis, Beers."
You haven't been answering your phone.
Everything all right?
Beers?
"Oh, my God."
"You're right, that's not Beers."
But it sure looks like him.
He's not anybody anymore.
Looks like a stab wound.
"All right, it's time to shut down the airport."
Not a problem.
We've been unofficially shut down for the last 20 minutes.
No vehicles in or out until this storm ends.
"His gun's gone, Tony."
Great.
"We're snowed in here with an airport full of cranky passengers, a dead fake air marshal, and his killer somewhere on the loose, with a knife and a gun."
"Anybody else feel like they're playing ""Clue""?"
Unbelievable.
"These shots will be coming to you from Jake's phone, McGee."
"We'll send them to Ducky, too."
I think he's gonna be busy for a while.
"""And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast."""
"Yet I'm the one who had to get out and push the van, Shakespeare."
"That was W.C. Fields, Mr. Palmer, in The Fatal Glass of Beer."
And I predict you will be pushing it again on the way back.
"So, he must be around them."
Who is the new entrant in their family?
He is my friend Kalyan.
He can't be the thief.
He is memory loss patient.
I'm at peace in this condition.
Something is wrong.
Thanks partner.
How are you?
Who is your partner!
Do you know where will I be tomorrow?
How many people are so honest in their duty like your son?
Catch me before December 16.
You will catch him for sure.
You are his right partner.
You are my right partner.
"What do you say, Swami?"
"First, let's have tea."
"Later, we can deal with the money."
Thief...!
Money is more important to me.
"Yes, my son is a thief."
He became a thief for kick.
"He was in search of kick, but he didn't get it."
But it came looking for him.
We are Venkat  Swapna.
We have a daughter.
I work in a private company.
My salary is Rs.10000.
"Every morning at 8, I take the lunch box, drop my daughter at the school, catch a running bus, go to office, come back in the evening, play with my daughter,"
"sometimes go to theatre, count our savings several times and feel safe, this is my life."
We've no complaints on anyone.
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
"Unfortunately, a million of extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould."
"Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him, either."
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"- Niece and nephew, right?"
- Yeah.
"I haven't even got them any presents, though."
A bit behind on computer games and stuff.
Should've talked to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games -"
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John."
That'd be irresponsible.
That's not their age range at all.
- How did it go with Lenny?
"- Pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"- That's what you did in the army, right?"
- Wrong.
- That was legal.
- Yeah.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"- Shut up, Calum."
- I'm just saying.
"At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it, not just some scared kid in a trench."
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"- Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
- OK.
I have to go.
"Yes, come fast, OK."
OK Madam.

Did you had Viagra?
And now you cant control it?
"Don't do this, don't play with my feelings."

No.

Itwas an awful thing forthis country.

They were born when I lived in Florida with Bram.
"Don't you know Bram, my husband?"
-No.
You helped him go into hiding.
His name was Henk Meyer then.
1m90 and skinny as a rake.
I really don't remember him.
He was always hungry but he still gave me his distribution coupons.
There were so many.
He looked me up straight after the war.
Then we got married.
He'd be kicking me at least once a week during the night.
He'd have nightmares about Krauts and camps.
"When the Cold War started with Berlin and the Russians, it got really bad."
He kicked me out of the bed every night.
"Without being aware of it, the darling."
So we went to America.
"At least, there was an ocean in between."
"Yes, I heard you left the country."
"When the children were adults, they went to Israel."
We didn't.
"But we did come back, so we're halfway now."
"Nowhere at home, but still happy."
Very happy.
"No other news, and you?"
Do you ever think of Arie?
Arie...
It's easy to idealize.
-Would you have been happier?
I am happy.
But Arie's no longer there.
"On Remembrance Day, I sometimes think of what guys like Arie missed out on... after the war."
"This were the old way, this mean six kadam high."

"Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct."

"Not much time, then."
Where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?

"He was bugging me, so I turned him into one."
Ginger beer?
A bug?
"Hilda, you've got to change him back."
He is in a perfectly humane situation now that I gave him air holes.
SABRINA:
I wonder if that last milk shake made any difference.
I certainly feel lighter.
"Salem, help!"
I've disappeared!
(gasps):
I'm so sorry.
"Hey, twirl me around so it looks like I'm flying."
SABRINA:
What's happened?
!
Where am I?
!
"I like you, René, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fräulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a... china cup.
Colonel!
Wake your men!
"Indy, the torches are burning out."
"Go on, get out of here."
Hyah!
- Sallah!
- Hello!
Hello!
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
What'II happen if we call the cops?
"Touchy disagreed, he said:"
They'II talk to him and force him to buy a new one.
I can buy another one.
That's not the point.
He did something illegal.
Since when do you care about what's legal.
"And I suppose you drank milk at the hotel, so you could drive back?"
We drank milk... 0.08% .
The kind of milk Ducky could lose his license for.
And not you?
"I can't lose mine, I already lost it."
No... that's a joke...
he still has his license.
"Everybody was laughing, except... except the neg..."
"black kid, and Ducky convinced her about the police."
It's like drinking and driving.
"You don't get caught, you're OK."
"He got caught, he's gotta pay."
It's our duty as citizens.
What if he smashes all the little statues around?
"If we let him go, he might go and do a massacre at Gagnon's Nursery."
We'II feel guilty... our whole lives.
"They won't hang him, they'II just... give him a ticket."
alright!
"You want to do it, you deal with it."
"Bertrand, you know where the phone is."
I'm going to bed.
Come polo sweetheart.
We'II go beddy-byes.
Come with mommy.
She took polo by the arm and...
"Mr. Brubaker, I assure you that my father is innocent."
"I... no, he's not in the office, but..."
I'll have him call you.
- I am so happy to see you.
"- Guess who no longer works for Partridge, Savage and Cann?"
- You quit?
- Or got fired.
Quit slash got fired.
Lot of things were said.
- None of them good.
- What happened?
Your father.
"They said as long as I was representing him, I wasn't working for them."
It's Thursday night.
No knocking until 9:00 p. m.
Cohen!
How did you get in here?
"Your stepmom, who's in unusually good spirits."
- It's the Klonopin.
- That'd explain that eye twitch.
"- Listen, I'm not going to stay long."
"- Actually, you can't stay at all."
"The Valley is on, so you should just..."
"Right, no, I have something for you."
"- Well, unless it's a plutonium -fueled car to take me back to last year so I can never date you, I'm not interested."
"- Oh, okay, it's two tickets to The Walkmen tomorrow night."
"- I'm not going to a concert with you, ass."
"Hey, I'm not going, okay?"
"Well, I am, actually, I'm going, but I'm not going to go with you."
These are for you and Zach.
- Me and Zach?
- Yeah.
"He killed my client and tried to kill me, so there you go."
"Yeah, there's all kind of fucking motive."
I get it.
"But you got no prints, no blood, no weapon, none of that shit."
"So unless you're going to arrest me,"
I think we're done here.
Patty:
"No, so I thought I had more time this morning."
- Man:
Sorry.
- Patty:
Excuse me.
"So I decided to make breakfast like an adult,"
"And everyone saying ""Avocado toast, avocado toast,"""
so I'm there with an avocado in this hand and trying to get the pit out.
You call.
"The fucking knife slips, right?"
"And it slices me right fucking there on my middle finger, mind you, which I fucking need."
"And it's like four stitches, they're saying."
"And I think there's, like, seven to ten days, and then it's going to be fine."
[cough cough]
But I've never had to deal with that before.
Talk to me.
"Look, I'm-- I'm telling you, it's-"
- What's going on?
[muttering]
"Oh, my God, what's going on?"
What's going on?
Just talk to me.
Um... um...okay.
"Uh, I don't-- I don't know."
Um... do you-- How about a story?
Ishmael...
What happened brother?
You never came with me for help.
Ready for this?
"I do not know, Ish."
"Come on, Commander!"
Your team is waiting for you
All members of the UCF crew have arrived...
Ash-393 is considered to be the most sophisticated noid ever created by men.
A class one surface humanoid 300 Series.
It has full AI access.
He was the leader of Noid's rebellion.
He was.
Is dead.
"By rumors has many crimes In the Federation of Arizona,"
He recently arrived in the northeast corridor.
The reactor 12 has been turned off.
He killed 28.
"Hidden by intelligence, it is in the death zone 714."
Hidden in the death zone?
Does not sound very clever
The fusion of the nucleus has probably smoothed the brain of the Noids.
"Or, Commander?"
Not as soft as your dick.
Revenge is a bitch...
Like you!
"What, Kix?"
Stop him!
Five years ago I got a team sent to kill Ash.
We lost contact here.
There temperatures must be subarctic.
Your Iso-Gel will last 48 hours.
Johnnie.
I wouldn't blame you.
Branigan is one in a million.
And I'm not much to write on about.
Am I?
I'm just an everyday sort of bloke.
Everyday!
?
Everyday for the rest of my life.
Good work!
Bloody good show!
Two shots so far!
"If this thing is being treated for color, it's going to look marvelous."
God!
The American's teeth.
Can that be real?
"If the studio shoot goes half as well, this picture is going to be a triumph!"
"There is however, one area of concern."
Uh!
"Memo, please."
From American distributors.
"I'd ask you to absorb what's said without division, Buckley."
American picture goers liked to be knocked off their feet.
"Bangs, crashes, ambulances careeding around corners."
The same goes for romance.
"What you call understatement, translates as a lack of, uhmf..."
Americans feel that the ending is presently written is too subtly too newses.
Restrained.
Restrained?
I mean it's practically a call to arms!
"Their concern is more, what one might crudely call..."
"""A love triangle"""
"Ooh, McGee."
Gibbs wrote something in the comment section.
"""Agent DiNozzo displays exemplary skills, though he can be too talkative in the field."""
"If, by too talkative, he means you never shut up."
"Well, I think Gibbs was being a bit too gracious."
"After ten years, he doesn't know this is how I work."
I always thought it was like a mild case of Tourette's or something.
It's my process.
You guys know that.
"It-It's how I focus, you know."
I talk it out.
Talkative.
Hah!
"Com-Coming from a functional mute, that's rich."
Maybe that's what he's...
Maybe that's what he's doing.
He's trying to tell me something.
Maybe I should dial it back.
Get...
Get my quiet on.
"I think you're, uh, overreacting a bit, Tony."
I'm gonna kill the next performance appraisal.
"Next time he writes down, in his little margin here, ""DiNozzo:"
"""professional;"
DiNozzo: focused.
"DiNozzo..."""
Too much yabba yabba.
"Sorry boss, I was just suppressing the yabba?"
Good.
Grab your gear.
Got a dead petty officer in Baltimore.
So now it's too much yabba yabba?
But sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending  we don't learn how to read the signs.
How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't.
The ones who will stay from the ones who will leave.
- Hi.
- Hi.
GIGI:
And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy.
Maybe it's you  on your own  picking up the pieces and starting over.
Freeing yourself up for something better in the future.
Maybe the happy ending is just  moving on.
"Baby, what are you doing?"
It's our turn.
Forget the dip.
"Come on, come on."
MAN:
"Let's go, Alex."
"Come on, Alex, your turn."
Ready?
LOL.
Laugh out loud!
We won!
GIGI:
Or maybe the happy ending is this:
"Knowing that through all the unreturned phone calls and broken hearts  through all the blunders and misread signals  through all of the pain and embarrassment  you never, ever gave up hope."
NEIL:
Now that we are married...
BETH:
We're gonna move.
Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.
Another thing we're gonna do is move a little further away from...
- Baltimore?
College is gonna be so much fun!
Totes.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
"When you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history."
You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
A trigger-happy girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
"...family, too..."
"Hey, is that your mom again?"
...if you're desperate....
"Someone needs your help, Michael."
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
"That's how we do it, people."
"Bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere."
Put the weapon down.
Hands on your head!
"Listen to me, Michael."
Gray shot your brother.
He murdered Nate.
"Michael, what happened?"
"Card's dead, Fi."
Now we need a way out of here.
-I got it!
"-Hey, ten days!"
"Wait, I can be out of here tomorrow morning, in Chicago, and outside of her dressing..."
"Hey, come on, fellas, I'm a little, you know..."
"-Sarge, I'm tapped out."
"-Me, too."
What a time.
"Men, freeze."
"Freeze, you heroes."
"Men, I may have seemed a little harsh with you."
It's only because I was mad at myself for forgetting to tell you the new thing I thought up for you.
It's only a buck a throw-- my new snack-in-the-sack raffle.
Snack-in-the-sack raffle?
What's that?
Just what it says.
The guy who wins gets his breakfast served in bed for ten days.
"How about it, boys?"
"-But Sarge, we're broke."
"-Busted, not a dime."
It's a miracle how this platoon is always broke at the same...
"Zimmerman, on the double, right here."
"Yeah, but Sarge, you told me..."
Right here.
"Now, Herman, you're not going to take me serious all the time, are you?"
I want this.
I want these deadheads to look at a real live wire.
This boy's not broke all the time.
Why?
"'Cause he's on the hustle, he thinks up things, washes officers' cars at a buck a throw."
He's all right.
(chuckles)
"How much did you make, Herman?"
"I was wearing a brown tie last night, not a red one."
This was a red one with a little figure on it.
I don't own such a--
Wait a minute.
- Was the figure sort of gray?
- That's right.
I think that's one of the ones I left at the office.
"Sure, that's it."
"You know, in case-- in case I lined up something kind of special."
"At the office, where anyone might have taken it?"
Yeah.
I mean no.
"A couple of months ago,"
Sandy spilled some soup and-- that's it.
That's the tie I loaned to Sandy.
"Beth, I have to see him."
Everything points in one direction.
Now if you want me to help your husband before the police get here--
"Perry, I don't know what I want-- just time to think, please."
"Beth, stop that sniveling."
You don't have to pretend to be loyal.
"Mr. Sandover, you went out to Lita Krail's cottage last night, didn't you?"
She lied to me.
She was up to something;
trying to get you into trouble.
She said she'd meet me in Phoenix.
She lied to me.
I bought a new sport coat.
I told her things-- things I never told anyone.
You thought she cared for you.
"What did she do, laugh at you?"
I didn't give her the chance.
Getting Scott to sell the bar wasn't going so well.
This place has been in my familyfor 112 years.
I promised by grandfather I'd come back and run it.
"So, the huge deal my dad had worked on for a year fell through."
I'm not going to repeat what he's saying there.
Let's just say my dad pretty much hates Scott.
But I kind of like him.
Enough to sneak out of work to do this.
"I got to tell you, you turned out to be a pretty good motorcycle passenger."
"Well, it involves two skills I'm good at-- sitting and not dying."
"Come on, give yourself more credit than that."
"You leaned with the turns, you didn't put your hands over my eyes and shout ""Guess who?"""
Just that once.
I got a little bored when you did that wheelie on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Well...
I guess I should go.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Alex, fantastic news."
"Julian, hello."
My upstairs neighbor.
This is Scott.
"Well, this is awkward."
"Two people about to kiss, and I'm not one of them."
"Well, I have a tavern to get back to."
Okay.
- See ya.
- See ya.
I'm sorry if I ruined your moment there.
"Oh, that's okay."
"So, what's your big news?"
"I just wish you would, too, you know?"
Hey.
I don't know why I had to be married to such a good man.
Who I'm still mad at.
"He'll just stay the night, Jackie."
And he's out by morning.
Yes.
Abbs?
Abby.
"Gibbs, oh."
Sorry I woke you.
I woke you.
I woke you first when I called you.
You spent the night here?
"Yeah, Tony found the knife in question in Petty Officer Smith's seabag, and I kind of got on a roll testing it, and the next thing I knew, the sun was coming up."
Was it worth it?
Totally.
"I mean, even with my little windows, the light was just gorgeous."
"Abbs, I haven't had my coffee yet."
"Ooh, all right."
The knife.
So it tested positive for blood but in the trout family.
These scales that are lodged in the handle suggest rainbow or steelhead.
No blood from Adams.
Means Petty Officer Smith wasn't our killer.
But somebody is.
"You know, it's probably somebody that we don't even know yet."
Or someone we do.
"Abbs, you stayed here overnight trying to clear Vance's brother-in-law?"
"Well, the director is like family."
"I mean, you would want me to do the same for you."
Tox results.
"Look, I can I just talk to you for a second, Dale?"
Just about you and me and about us and what's happening here.
What about us?
"I don't know, I just..."
I think I'm falling in love with you.
"And I know that scares you, and I-"
It's not gonna really-
"I'm not going anywhere, Dale."
I'm not gonna die on you.
"I'm not your mother, or your father."
You are so scared of anything that's real.
And I'm right here.
And I just want to know if you feel the same way.
"You hooked up with one of my best friends, Zach."
Wow.
"Wow, I thought I understood what was going on here."
But I guess I was just I guess I was just totally wrong.
I can't believe you're saying that about me.
I can't believe you don't trust me.
I just want something real.
I've been chasing you for two years Dale.
Two years.
You know how that feels?
But I can't do it anymore.
Not if you don't feel the same way about me.
"Goodbye, Dale."
I told Zach I want something real.
And here I go screwing up the best chance I'll ever have at something real.
What do you think I wished...
for my birthday?
It... starts with Z and ends with Ack.
And it turns out...
"I can help you, Nick."
I'm here for you.
Who can help your hunger?
"Your craving for the warm, sweet taste of blood."
"You can beat it, Nick."
Surrender!
Yield to your thirst.
[GROWLING]
Gonna fly the coop on us?
SimÃ²n.
"You gonna take care of that business for us, right?"
You brought your brother in.
You gotta take him out.
Santana was gonna talk to J. D.
"Come on, don't punk out on us, ese."
"If you can't take care of it, we will."
Anybody that happens to be with him gets to go along for the ride.
"One-two-three, five!"
"One-two-three, six!"
"One-two-three, seven!"
"Dear Julie, maybe the reason I learned how to read and write was so that I could write you this letter."
"Here in this cage, behind these bars,"
"I can read, I can learn."
"I can even make love, but it's distorted."
"I thought that what I had learned on the inside was everything I needed to know, even on the outside."
"Like they say, things don""t always turn out the way one feels they should."
"Till now, all the books I've ever read have been to try to get power."
J U LI E:
Let's see.
"Mico, help me find my shoe."
MICO:
Yeah?
Aside from our difference in age.
Hey... of course we are!
And I look young for my age...
I keep being told that I look young for my age.
It's really... difficult to be modest these days.
"As scary as Park Seon Woo can be, don't underestimate us either."
"Because, we're all friends."
That man doesn't have any friends.
I know him well.
"Oh, but Shi Yoon."
- There's something you must do for me.
- What?
Since I have to meet Han Gyul tomorrow...
"Please teach me the most important, or the most basic, element of fighting."
"Hey, Im Soo Bin!"
I heard that your dad was in a chase in our neighborhood yesterday.
Except he wasn't the one chasing.
He was being chased.
- Wasn't your dad a police officer?
"- Shut up, and keep stuffing your face."
Oh!
We should have recorded the chase and put it on the web!
"I would have gotten 10,000 ""likes""!"
Get a horde of fans!
And it would climb up the internet search engine rankings!
Soo Bin!
What's that?
Blood?
"Oh, spicy rice cakes?"
- Did you fight someone?
- Did you kill someone?
I'm asking you if you killed someone!
Which together with your brothers missile trade with cocaine?
Coca push to make the road and the money washed them to become construction materials for guinea pigs.
"And that hog André the Secretary,"
"Simon and Venini in there, where?"
Simon is untouchable!
It is not the flow from dirty sewer rats!
Of sewer rats?
This I brings to mind a bath.
There is a pool here?
The joint construction passing through the Bank of Polo Red ...
Spring bank and give me the banker!
What does the banker well as the banker to do?
Go to the Bois with the German dachshund?
Medium rare?
Al dente?
At the point right?
Overcooked?
The theater has been put baldracca with an actress.
You could tell us what is your name?
"Aglaé, gia, gia!"
This information you saved my skin.
"Unfortunately for you, Marie gave you goodnight."
- Can I do anything for you?
- Noo ...
Why do you show this?
Because you are my friend!
You know what I want?
You know what I feel?
Just now I was about to tell you I have a conviction.
Servant to someone?
A nothing.
Sprofondo.
"Hey, Christine."
I think we're done.
"I-I have to go, Mom."
"No, they're calling us back to the sabbatical room."
"Yeah, of course it has a room."
"Uh, do you even know what a sabbatical is?"
"Oh, it is?"
"Okay, I-I love you."
I do show it.
I have to go.
Bad news.
Mom and Dad can't make Grandparents' Day.
Why not?
"Dad's run out of miles on his car lease, Mom did some calculations and, at 15 cents a mile, it just wasn't worth it."
Does this mean I can't go to Grandparents' Day?
"No, of course not, sweetie."
"You know what, Uncle Matthew will go as your special friend."
I don't want to go with a special friend.
The only one in my grade who has a special friend is that weird kid with the gray hair.
"To be honest, I'm also getting a little uncomfortable introducing myself as a nine-year-old boy's ""special friend."""
"Daddy, maybe you could go as Ritchie's grandfather."
You guys had so much fun when we went miniature golfing the other day.
"Well, I'd be happy to, if Ritchie wants me to."
"Yeah, that'd be great!"
What?
!
"No, no."
"I'm sorry, that's not appropriate."
Appropriate?
You once dated your cousin.
Second cousin.
And he asked me out.
What shall we talk about?
Alright.
Take it up.
Easy!
You're a stubbornness that girl.
You like her too much I think.
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a....china cup...
"Colonel, wake your men!"
Indy the torches are burning out.
We got to get out of here.
Sallah!
"Hello, hello!"
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
"Why don't you come on down here, I'll show you."
"Thank you my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
That's right isn't it?
Yes we are very comfortable... up here.
"So once again Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
"Ha, ha, ha, ha... son of a bitch."
I'm afraid we must be going now doctor Jones.
Our price is awaited in Berlin.
"But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place, all alone."
"Slimy biff, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Aaahh..
Marion!
Hang on!
Just do it!
"You are really rude, aren't you?"
You're making me angry.
It was three days ago.
I saw you walking along side him in the Ginza.
That was in daylight.
"If you continue to do things like that, I'll stop talking to you."
It's just a joke.
"Look, I've always wanted you."
You know that.
Am I bothering you?
"Well, if I am, there's nothing I can do about it."
It's just my rengai for you.
"You know, Mrs. I'm not trying to get you directly, but I am trying to get you."
You are my ultimate goal.
"I was waiting for you to fall in love with someone, and then when that fell apart,"
I was going to snap you up.
"My heart has been broken already, so it doesnt makeanydifferencetome if  youvelovedsomeoneelse ."
"Ah, miss, over here."
I came with Nozu-san.
How do you do.
Thanks for taking care of Shinako for me.
Don't worry about that.
What happened?
"Mother, Kayama-sensei was here!"
Kayama-sensei?
He just left.
What would he be doing here after giving up dancing?
"Mother, I want to meet him."
Don't you think it would be better not to meet him?
I just want to see him.
You should go to Tokyo Station now.
With all the crime that you and Robin should be out fighting how do you find time to come here and fix Black Widow's coiffeur?
"Those aren't hair dryers, Chief O'Hara."
"They're Bat Wave Brain Analyzers, which Robin and I have slightly rewired."
"Oh, you mean you're not really fixing their hair?"
Right.
What we're doing is decriminalizing them.
"It may take months of treatment, but we feel it's worth a try."
If we can permanently short circuit the bad streaks in them we will make honest useful citizens out of those spidery crooks.
"Chief O'Hara, do you realize what time it is'?"
I'm famished.
"Please bring me a menu, doll."
And don't forget the wine list.
"You heard the lady, chief."
Get a menu.
Yes.
"Yes, ma'am."
A menu and a wine list.
I'll see if I can locate them.
"Divine, darling."
Absolutely divine.

"Oh, that stings."
What is it?
A steroid with an antibiotic.

"Ah, yeah."
One of the guys responsible for killing your parents.
It's a great way to start your day.
"And get this, they tied him to the beating death of a coin collector in hamburg."
Turns out the victim was the dealer who sold the three gold coins to Sam Bertram here in Portland.
I'm not sad those coins disappeared.
"You know, that's a nasty-looking guy."
The hell is that thing on his face?
It's called the Aegishjalmur.
And it means what?
Helm of awe.
It's a symbol the vikings wore for invincibility.
I believe it is.
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(LAUGHING)
"Because you don't have the facts, sir."
(CHUCKLING)
Wait a minute.
You're gonna love it.
Let's see what we got here.
All right.
I don't know why you started laughing.
Here.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(WARD LAUGHING)
"I'm just silly, sir, but that machine, that is really fantastic."
"How much, roughly, would a thing like that cost?"
"Oh, about $3,000."
"Not counting the camera, of course."
Three thousand?
Dollars?
"Why, I can get a new car for that."
Not that I need one.
"Lieutenant, you have something to say to me, don't you?"
"Yes, sir."
"I'm really sorry to bother you like this, sir."
But just a couple of questions before my report on Sid Daley.
"It doesn't look like he could have done it, sir."
He was with a girl and she confirmed it.
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"Tell Travis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
"Right away, sir."
Hey.

Previously on Enterprise:
HELMSMAN:
The Insectoid ship's been damaged.
Target the second one.
Is that what this is all about?
You think I want to replace you?
"You just can't stand taking orders from me, can you?"
-Tell me something.
-What?
Why won't you let me do my job?
I hear that you're a high school history teacher?
- How is that?
"- Where have you been, Isobel?"
I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you.
I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you.
I wanted this.
- It's that simple?
- Yeah.
You were supposed to mourn me and move on.
You were my wife.
And I loved you.
How could I not search for you?
"Because I wasn't lost, Ric."
"I understand that you know my daughter, Elena."
And I hear that she's been looking for me.
So I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.
"You want me, ahem, to deliver a message?"
Yeah.
Screw you.
You selfish bitch.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[WHOOSHING]
What do you want from me?
- I told you.
- I'm not gonna do anything for you.
[ALARIC GRUNTING]
You better tell Elena that I wanna meet.
Or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one.
And I'm gonna start with your History students.
Got it?
I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founder's Day Parade.
"If I don't, I get the wrath of Caroline."
We have got hundreds...
"As you can see, the military's moving into position but won't advance because of safety concerns for the hostages."
"--Obvious to everyone, this is the work of al Qaeda or some like-minded Arab terrorist group."
- The National Guard...
- The building's buttoned up.
Rooftop's secure.
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.
"- Apparently, we're all Arabs."
- Good.
- Cake?
"- No, I don't want cake."
I'm diabetic.
Hallelujah.
This is my Graceland!
Sweet Shiva.
Sugary pops of delight.
"Come on, let's go!"
Move!
"Let's go, sheeple."
"Now, welcome to my house."
"Now, sit down and shut up!"
"Oh, baby, I've missed you."
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Skip Tyler has arrived."
"By the time you're watching this, I will have pulled off the greatest hack the world has ever seen."
"This is difficult for some, it is but for me, it's as easy as one, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
Yes.
Showtime!
"Oh, some latecomers."
Secretary of Homeland Security is in the house!
"Lil, I feel like maybe you're trying a little too hard to keep your mind off Neal."
"Oh, pft, don't be ridiculous."
I'm completely fine.
Should I get braces?
"Honestly, I saw an infomercial, it really got me thinking."
"Oh, my God, it's Neal."
"He's on his way, he wants to pick up his key."
I don't want to see him.
We've gotta get out of here.
"I've got to go, grab my uggs!"
"Lil, Lil, stop, stop, stop."
"Look, I know this sucks."
But you can't just run from this.
Or drink from this.
"Or yoga from this, or invisalign from this."
I'm not.
I'm just keeping busy.
And taking advantage of my groupons.
"Come on, Lil."
I see what you're doing.
You don't want to be alone in this apartment.
"You're attached at the hip with a best friend, you're trying to drink away the pain of a breakup,"
"I mean, you're not dealing with reality."
How do you know?
Because I'm doing it too.
"Only, in my case it's even sadder, because I have not changed my underwear in three days."
"Yeah, you're right, I have to deal."
"I've got to cancel all the wedding stuff, and find a new place."
Can I live with you?
"Wow, that's aggressive."
"But, uh, yeah."
"Will you, please?"
"All of a sudden you had to get this off your chest, huh?"
"To be honest, it wasn't really my idea."
"After yesterday, Mary found out that I was using again, and she hired a private nurse to come to my house and make sure I stayed clean."
Nice friend.
She demanded...
That I come down here and I-I tell you the truth.
"And what is the truth, Desmond?"
Mary.
"Mary, I was just about to call you..."
I'm in trouble.
What... what do you mean?
"Grady Burgess, Des's dealer."
I came to see to him to tell him to leave Des alone.
"Help me, please."
He drugged me.
He's going to kill me.
"Okay, stay on the line, okay?"
Keep talking to me.
Where are you?
1287 Monu-ment...
Monument.
Mary?
Mary?
Shit.
So you're saying Mary had...
nothing to do with this.
"Mm-hmm, that's right."
"The truth is, I couldn't pay my drug debt because of the whole lost license ordeal."
Grady knew about my work with the terminally ill.
"He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid."
Go to Grady's house.
"You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital."
Bye.
"Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it."
"*MICHAEL EVERY DAY* Season 02 Episode 06 ""Hodophobia Part 2"" Synchronized by srjanapala"
you're an alcoholic.
Yesterday was an unusual day.
You drank at lunch.
I had one beer.
"Three, actually."
And then you drank the champagne before you tried to poison a moose.
That was to make room for the pills.
You drank at the trucker bar.
"I mean, you really drank there."
And let's say
- it was stress-induced drinking...
"- I can relate to that, but..."
It was something you said to the stripper
- that really sealed it.
- At the bar?
"- At the hotel, at 4:28."
- What did I say?
"You said ""I'm an alcoholic."""
Did I have sex with the stripper?
There was more crying than sex.
- I made her cry?
- Not her...
Oh God!
Look...
- I don't know what I said last night...
"- I mean, I really don't know what I said last night, but it wasn't necessarily the truth."
In Vino Veritas.
"Is not accurate, is what I'm saying."
"It's just an expression, and it's Latin so people give it more weight than it deserves."
So what does he like?
"Well, I kind of just gathered that so far he likes sitting on people's shoulders and sneezing on the top of my head, so..."
Okay.
"Well, um, I'm gonna go."
"Will, it was really nice to meet you."
Can I get a high-five?
- No?
OK.
- All right.
"Anyway, should we go show off to all of Detroit?"
My ring says yes.
Yoohoo!
"Dude, I can't believe you didn't tell me about proposing."
Give me a break.
I didn't tell anyone.
"Well, you told Backstreet Boys"
You didn't tell me and I'm your emotional guidance counsellor.
You know it's like I'm your sensei.
I don't speak Japanese and neither do you.
"Anyway, see this is the kind of thing we need to cherish."
Okay?
Our banter.
Our back and forth.
It's awesome.
"We've got to love this while we can because you're engaged and we may only be be living together another 7, 8, 9, 10 years."
- Who's engaged for 11 years?
- Turtles.
OK.
I didn't...
I didn't know 7-year-olds can improv like that.
"Actually, since Candace has her house we thought it might be romantic if I moved"
- in on Valentine's day.
Just what you see.
"With the Ministry's cutbacks, when someone retires they don't send anyone new."
And the weapons are from the Moroccan War.
So what's the plan?
Do you have what we asked for?
There's the clothes.
Here you go.
"Two Civil Guard uniforms and for you, a monk's robes."
And the explosives to blow up the door.
I'll carry that.
I won't argue with you about that.
"Ah, one more thing."
"In case of an emergency, ring the Abbey's bells."
And what do we have the phones for?
"They're worthless here, in these mountains there's no coverage."
The Spanish hell is everywhere.
What is the Spanish hell?
"Nothing, a joke."
You can tell it on the way.
Let's get to the monastery.
(Thunder)
"(ANSWERING MACHINE) ""This is the talking device of Ambrosio Espínola Doria,"

Message for Espínola.
Emergency call from the Ministry.
I repeat: emergency call from the Ministry.
(Thunder)
Are you worried?
Aren't you?
We have a very complicated mission ahead of us.
Your love blobs looked like Yul Brynner snogging Kojak.
I'm not prepared to rise to it.
Your spite and venom offends me not.
- Baldy blobs.
"- Right, that's it."
That is it.
"I hope you've got a good lawyer, because I am suing and you're going to prison forever."
"Hello, Filthy?"
"Yeah, it's Richie here."
I wanna sue Eddie.
Richie Rich.
Your client.
"I'm five foot ten, brown hair..."
"Look, it's not important."
"My minder, Edward, says that I've got bald love blobs and I want to sue."
Have I?
"Well, they're not so much bald as receding."
I'd put a wig on them for the trial.
"Bloodsucker, what do I pay you for?"
"I know I don't, it was a rhetorical question."
Goodbye forever!
He was furious.
But I persuaded him to give you a chance.
Shut up and tell me why you are wearing a hat that makes you look like you've got a toilet roll on your head.
"Because, Eddie, I have taken up the skillet and the frying pan."
I've been studying cookery all morning and I am now a master chef.
- That's why I'm wearing this great hat.
- You look like a chicken drumstick.
Ha ha!
"Wrong again because, actually, I look great."
- We are having a dinner party.
- Oh-hoo.
No...
Trevor...
You still got half an hour.
I can fix you some eggs.
I'm tired but thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on guys, keep it moving."
"Yes sir, yes sir, Master Tucker, motherfucker"
"Hey, why is that machine down?"
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill.
"Where am I going to make up that 7 minutes, Miller?"
Your paycheck?
"- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations."
- What regulations?
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery.
"Ocean, 1989."
Yeah?
Write to your congressman and hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
You just made my shitlist.
"She copping his joint, right?"
"And he's tellin' her, you know, baby this, baby that..."
Chatting her up like mother fucking Barry White.
"Talking about what he going to do to her, and how he going to make her coochy feel and all that."
That's right.
"So then, she stopped"
She looked up at him with these big old puppy eyes she's like...
"That sounds good pappy, but me no have no coochy."
"So, my man's like ""Say what?"
"!"""
"He isn't finding it easy, following the success of his first novel."
I do what I can to help.
I take care of the day-to-day things so he's free to focus on his work.
Try and keep him happy so his mind can focus on being creative.
Cook him his favourite food.
That sort of thing.
Tonight I've cooked him pilchards.
Hmm.
Bob loves pilchards.
There you are.
- There's a lot more than I'd expected.
We've been at it for hours.
"- We have, haven't we?"
I want to apologise for the other day.
- There's no need.
I should never have put Dr Campbell in that position... or said half the things I did.
I understand.
I can't imagine how it must feel to think of your child going to fight.
What...?
- It's heading for the village.
"If Will doesn't need me, I'll be straight back."
Do you want a lift?
Thank you!
What happened?
- I heard Bob shouting for help.
I found him being violently sick and doubled up in pain on the hall floor.
"We need to go, Doc!"
- Tell Pat.
Ah...
Pat?
Come in.
Will asked me to let you know Bob won't be discharged until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.
I will not go down that way.
I choose to fight back!
"I choose to rise, not fall."
"I choose to live, not die."
And I know I know that what's within me is also within you.
That's why I ask you now to join me.
Join me.
Rise up with me.
Rise up on the wings of this slain angel.
We'll rebuild on the soul of this little warrior.
We will pick up his standard and raise it high.
Carry it forward until this city your city our city his city is a palace again!
Is a palace again!
"I am with you, little James."
I am you.
Thank you very much.
Terrible thing to bury a child.
Your trip to Washington.
The stuff for the Convention Committee.
History of New York City for Senator Marquand.
Reservation at the Willard Hotel.
"Lincoln stayed there, by the way."
Enough about me.
Enough about me.
What are you going do tonight after I'm gone?
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it.
You're going to get yourself a good meal.
You're going to pass up that double cheeseburger from Roy Rogers.
"You're going to go to Dominic's and get take-out, on me."
Get a decent meal.
"But before you go to Dominic's, go to Macy's and get a chair with legs and arms."
They've all had incredible training.
"It was intimidating at first, but I know I'm in good company."
I'm learning about composers I never knew-
"Amanda's heart was beating rapidly, and she was speaking really fast."
"She seemed happy, but I could sense that she was troubled."
I'm already a better technical player.
Amanda... is everything all right?
I can never hide anything from you.
But I need to let my mom know I'm home.
Can we get together later?
Of course.
Good.
I guess we need to talk.
She said what?
"""We need to talk. """
What is it?
Nothing.
"No, I missed something."
"Well, when someone says, ""We need to talk,"""
sometimes it's a lead in to a discussion about feelings that have changed.
Feelings?
"Prepare yourself, dude."
She's dumping you.
At least she has the decency to do it in person.
Don't read into it.
Just wait and hear what she has to say.
No.
Not my lucky shirt.
"Josh, you've outgrown it."
I couldn't help but wonder...
Had Amanda already outgrown me?
"Okay, grab hold of the wire and make these babies blink."
Lovely!
"Wolfie'll check out this tart you've been boning, then."
- Good.
- Maybe Wolfie'll pull her.
- He won't do that because she loves me.
- She loves you?
I'm going to cry!
I mean...
- She loves to fuck me.
- Yeah...
Course she does.
"That evening at the Civic Hall,"
I hoped Neil would enlighten me about what I'd be up to next week.
"He'd never enlightened me about anything before, but you never know."
How was the newspaper?
Did you write anything?
"No, nothing boring like that."
"I'm on the internet most of the day, this afternoon I smashed old desks in a skip and then home at four."
Are we the oldest here?
Possibly.
It's even more shit than I knew it would be.
I honestly don't why you came.
- To see you get blown out by Charlotte.
- Please try not to fuck this up.
"Charlotte asked me so there's a chance, admittedly a very slim chance, that she wants to pull me."
Or maybe she needs a mechanic for her car!
- Good one!
- I'd service her all right.
I'd slide my dipstick in deep!
"Thanks for coming, really appreciate it!"
I'm gonna find Charlotte.
Up to you.
"You and your partner were having a beer, trying to unwind, and this jackass..."
"Uh, Joe Penn comes over and starts mouthing off."
"Maybe it was about the Cubs, maybe it was about Chicago's new mayor, I don't know."
"But this Joe Penn crossed a line somehow, and you felt you needed to step in and deal with it."
Or not.
"If I'm anywhere close, just grunt."
Read my report.
"Lee says he and Taggot had been there about an hour, had a couple of beers, were about to leave when this Joe Penn got into a fight with another patron."
He and Taggot stepped in to break it up.
How'd you do?
"Yeah, that's pretty much what Taggot said."
"Hey, Sis."
I'll just be a minute.
"Donny, Steve."
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be out busting bad guys?
The shift doesn't start till 11:00.
"Yeah, but this isn't your station."
Why are you acting weirder than usual?
- I'm not.
"- Yes, you are."
"- Yeah, you really are."
- Way beyond your normal weird.
"Well, I'm just surprised to see you guys here, that's all."
So why are you here?
To wish Sean Dunn good luck.
We talked about this last night.
It's his last day.
He's moving to Tampa.
Is any of this ringing a bell for you?
Right.
"Uh, let's get you on a cardiac monitor."
"CBC, chem panel, EKG..."
I realize that.
"I'm sure he is, but this isn't about me, him, or even you."
It's about the welfare of a mother and her child.
You will?
Great!
Thank you so much.
"Um, psych attending's coming down to assess Judy Anderson."
"If Dr. Wakita asks, you agree with my postpartum depression assessment, right?"
"Yeah, you got it."
"Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,"
I have some good news.
One of our attendings from upstairs has agreed to come down and speak with you.
I've seen enough doctors today.
- We're going home.
"- Please, he's on his way down right now."
- We've been here for hours already.
- This will only take a few minutes.
"I just want to go home, have dinner and a bath and put Grace in her own crib."
"You want what's best for your baby, so do I."
Then leave us alone.
- Judy you need to speak to someone.
- She just needs to rest.
I know you don't want to hurt yourself or Grace.
You need professional help.
Do you have children?
Then how do you even know what you're talking about?
- I'm a doctor.
- But you're not a mother.
"Judy, listen to me..."
Please don't go.
Why did he stab him under there?
"Well, according to Shrimpton, Lorton stabs the kid here."
Shrimpton then heroically runs for help.
Lorton then drags the now dead body over to here.
Makes no sense.
It's closer to the street.
Why would you put it in a place that's lit up like the SCG?
"Now, your father was in the diplomatic service, is that right?"
David's told us all about you.
Very proud of his wife's exotic background.
We're not married.
Where exactly was he stationed?
All over.
"Italy, Spain, we ended up in Peru."
"Bloody hell, no way."
Peru?
That's where my brother-in-law was stationed.
Bob!
"Oh, this was many years ago."
"Yeah, ten years ago he was there."
"Bob, you great deaf bastard."
Come here!
"Oh, my phone."
"Oh, excuse me."
"If I was Joe Average instead of Joe Sandilands,"
I wouldn't be voting for us.
"I'd be buying a gun before Davo here bans them,"
I'd be putting a fucking bullet in my head.
"I think you've had enough there, Joe."
"No, Wal, Wal, I've only just begun, brother."
This man here is exactly what this party needs and we need 20 of 'em and we need 'em bloody quickly.
(Mobile phone rings)
"- No, no."
You're just a reflection.
The real Myka's in Las Vegas on a mission with Pete.
What?
"No, no, I'm not!"
Artie!
See?
That's exactly what I mean.
You just don't do it.
Turn that thing off.
"Artie, if I'm in Vegas with Pete, then how can I be here?"
Just no!
Just don't turn it off!
"Whatever that thing is, it's never getting out of here."
Lewis Carroll's Alice.
"You're so sweet, so innocent, so not true."
This woman was as mad as a hatter.
"And Charles Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, was not writing books."
He was chronicling this young woman's descent into a sociopathic madness in all of his books.
He didn't write these books.
These are Warehouse fabrications...
Brilliant fabrications...
To hide the truth about that mirror.
Here's a report from Warehouse field agents.
The mirror crossed paths with Alice Liddell.
I bet it crossed paths.
When?
- Before the murders.
- Terrifying.
"Yeah, and there's no mention of where the mirror came from."
"Okay, well, where do any of these things come from?"
"Artie, these agents, they trapped her inside of the mirror."
-She must be a very special woman.
-Yes.
"I'm here, Alyssa."
Where are you?
Why don't you answer me?
"-Welcome, Mr. Casey."
-Check him.
"-And who, may I ask, are you?"
-Marek
Thai is Trea.
-Let me guess:
Draconians?
-We are.
"-Well, then I'm certainly not pleased to meet you."
-It's clean where I found this.
"-Whatever your reason is for coming here, understand we have no intention nor interest in keeping you alive."
"-So I'm dead either way, right?"
-Correct.
No one will be spared.
-Why?
-The Earth's position in the solar system provides us with a strategic and tactile advantage.
"-Robert, the human role in the universe is inconsequential."
"-That may be so, but we have a right to exist."
-Only if we allow it.
-And we don't.
"-Well, before you start waving your victory flag, might I suggest examining the contents of the drive you hold in your hand?"
I think you'll find it very consequential.
-Alright.
Take him.
"And Robert,"
Jaelen had something we very much want.
It's a Grey stone that contains crystals.
But what?
"But what, Ryan?"
You better speak now.
His ex mentioned that he might have a bit of a bad habit.
What kind of habit?
The kind that requires rubber sheets.
He's a bed wetter?
Yo.
Detective Menendez just called.
"According to the prop master, those two knives went missing on the last day of the shoot."
Ohh.
He's got the studio pulling drive-on logs from that day.
He's gonna send us over a copy so we can see if any of the names connect to one of the New York murders.
"Hey, you okay?"
[Chuckles]
"Damn, what'd you tell her?"
Bed wetter. [Laughs]
[Sighs]
This had better be important.
The masseuse was in the middle of doing things one only dreams of.
I was able to trace the tracker in my dad's watch.
It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.
Oh.
Born and raised in L.A.
Former Army Special Forces.
Says here he's working overseas.
He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.
"We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything."
"Sure, we could do that."
Or we could just pretend you never found this.
Fine.
But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.
- Sookie and Jackson?
- That would be fun.
- And Grandma and Grandpa?
"- Oh, no."
Come on.
It's your graduation.
They should be there.
- Forget it.
They won't want to be there.
- Of course they will.
"Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school, go to Vassar... marry a Yale man, get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny."
"Instead, I got pregnant."
I didn't finish high school...
"I didn't marry your father, and I ended up in a career... that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her."
I humiliated them.
"The two proudest people in the world, and I humiliated them."
I spoiled their plans.
"I took their fine upbringing... in a world of comfort and opportunity, and I threw it in their faces."
"I broke their hearts, and they'll never forgive me."
I guess I can't expect them to.
Maybe you're wrong about how they feel.
It was a long time ago.
"Rory, I don't want them to go."
"It'll just hurt them, and me."
- Okay?
- Okay.
- You should get back to your studying.
- Fine.
- Great.
- What?
I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.
"- No, you haven't."
"There's bigger things happening in the world... than your stupid actor clients, and the Nielsen ratings on the TV."
You're now officially embarrassing everybody here.
Ok?
"Don't you... dare ""F""ing tell me that I'm embarrassing you, ok?"
Because...
my friends think you're a douchebag.
A... nasty ass... sleazebag agent.
"Drew, we don't think you're a douchebag."
"Jill, come on."
That's ok.
Thanks.
"Oh, where you gonna go?"
Are you gonna go home and masturbate?
To one of your anime porns?
Cartoons.
He made me watch animated porn.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go home and masturbate!
Disgusting.
Because it's better than anything you're giving me at home.
"No, 'cause you love to masturbate."
"'Cause for you, it's like having sex with something that you love!"
Yourself!
Did she just make that up?
Annie Hall. '77.
I'm going home!
Are you gonna go screw one of your actresses?
"One of your stupid, slutty..."
sleep your way to the top actresses.
I think I need to go to the bathroom.
Somebody can take her home.
'Cause now she's drunk and you're pissed off.
Do they go out frequently?
Juan says he wants to live with Clara.
She's crazy.
He also says you're still in love with mom.
And that you'll always be.
I don't understand why all men are after her.
It was always like that.
Are you in love with mom?
Me?
No.
Love vanishes.
And it never comes back.
"When we decided to split up, my wife assumed that I was leaving and she was keeping the house."
That's what happens usually.
I think it's not fair.
But surprisingly I accepted that as something natural.
Someone had to leave.
"We could've flipped a coin, for example."
And where did you go?
To a hotel.
Even now I still ask myself what I was doing in that room all alone..
Awake and looking at the ceiling.
But wasn't there another woman?
"-Yes, Rosa."
It took some days until I told her I've left Clara.
Why?
I don't know why I didn't go to my parents house in the very beginning either.
And you had a woman..
And a house waiting for you?
And you went to a hotel?
I was there for a few days without unpacking the bags.
Then I reacted and I called Jacoba to tell her I was coming over.
"Look, what's going on in Exam Two?"
D.U.B. needs an ultrasound to rule out fibroids.
Good crits.
Vitals stable.
How about an outpatient scan and a GYN referral?
"Well, if you can get her in this week."
Done.
"Okay, next:"
Buster Freeman.
"Dirty puncture wound to the foot, waiting on IV..."
Could he sit in a chair for that?
"I mean, it frees up a bed."
Crystal Maranacchio.
- Waiting on an ortho consult.
- She's been cleared.
- I called the attending.
- You what?
That's a new policy.
"When we call for a consult, the resident has 60 minutes to respond to the page, or we call the attending."
"All the department heads signed off on it, except Psych-- crazy bastards."
Blaire Collins has been here forever.
I called the nursing home twice.
They were supposed to be sending a ride for her.
"Well, if they're not here in ten, I'm putting her in a cab."
- She's comatose.
"- I was kidding, Dr. Kovac."
Frank ?
Call Blaire Collins' nursing home again and tell those idiots she's been ready to go home for the last four hours.
Tell them yourself.
I'm busy.
Dr. Kovac?
I think I'm one of those idiots.
Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
Where's the nurse who did nights?
Matilde?
"She called, she can't come in today."
Didn't she notice anything odd?
Matilds having family problems.
Many nights she can't come in.
And who stands in for her?
Benigno.
Am Ito tell her father his daughter is in this retard's hands day and night?
Please!
Let's calm down here.
I don't know if you realize you are the main suspect.
Why did you hide her first missed period?
I'm sure you've got an explanation.
You're incapable of harming Alicia.
You can be sure of that.
Then...
"Last night, I was in the parking lot and heard a conversation between Benigno and Marco."
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
I don't have to think.
We didn't say anything to anybody.
Not a word.
Not until we hit this barracks.
What are you looking at me for?
Lights out!
Lights out!
Lights out!
Lights out!
I suppose some jerk's gonna say I did it.
Why don't you try it one at a time?
"Now, there's a lot of folks around these days that don't believe in Santa Claus."
I always did and I always will.
"For a while, I thought the Luftwaffe had shot him down reindeer, sleigh and all."
"But no, sir."
Come the day before Christmas the Geneva man showed up with some presents for us.
"They brought us coffee, a little sugar, prunes and toothbrushes."
"And of all things, some Ping-Pong balls."
There must have been a slip-up someplace because suddenly we wound up with 2000 Ping-Pong balls.
"It seemed pretty idiotic at the time but as it turned out, those Ping-Pong balls sure came in handy."
"Oh, mother, did they come in handy!"
"Hey, Schulz."
What is this?
You must get out of your bunk.
The Geneva man is coming to inspect the--
Du lieber Gott!
How do you look.
You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor.
Maybe I can--
- Silk stockings.
Come on.
Open the door.
"Open the door, please."
"Come on, Rose."
What are you doing here?
I just came to sleep in my own bed.
Is that okay?
What happened?
Is it Gregory?
"I don't want to say I told you so, but..."
- Mom.
- What?
"When I was a baby, did you think I was pretty?"
All babies are pretty.
"No, I mean me."
You must have thought something about how I looked.
And who will undergo such fantastic plastic surgery?
Only a faceless old folk will do it
"King of no face, you bastard !"
I hate others to cheat me by pretending as woman !
Especially disguising as such pretty woman to seduce me!
Luckily Fat is so smart!

"He wanted to screw me so he brushed his wife off, and he even beated his wife up in front of me"

"In fact, no one can replace your mother."
I bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon.
"All right, then."
I'm glad we had this talk.
I'm gonna go post my plan on the Internet.
"You know, there's moments around here..."
... thatmakeme wish I had a son of my own.
That wasn't one of them.
"Yeah, well."
"Anyway, I really appreciate you watching him tonight."
No problem.
-How you getting to the restaurant?
-Sherri's picking me up.
-Very convenient.
-Why?
Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?
Because you've had sex with her in every room in the house?
"No, because you can't drive."
But it's interesting to see how your mind works.
"Alan, let me give you some advice."
Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions.
We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.
Of course.
Very good.
Just go to the concert alone.
- Zach.
- See Seth.
"No bickering, no bantering, just talk."
"As much as I like you, Summer, you need to figure this out with him."
I need you to figure this out.
Holy mack.
"You are, like, such an adult."
"I mean, you're not insecure, you're not jealous."
Are you a robot?
Huh?
"We had a great time over break, right?"
"But if that's all it was supposed to be, and we've taken this as far as possible, just let me know."
Okay?
Okay.
Do you think champagne is really necessary?
Ooh.
Absolutely.
"We need to toast to quitting, slash, getting fired."
To independence.
- You mean unemployment.
"- Oh, Dad, just think how much time Sandy will have to spend on your case."
- Padding around the house in his black socks and his robe.
I can't wait.
"- Cal, don't you have a toast to make, too?"
- No.
"Uh, it's all right."
"Um, too much champagne, I get giggly."
- When have you ever been giggly?
"- Dad, what is it?"
"Julie and I have been talking, and, uh, I've come to a decision."
"Tomorrow morning, I'm calling a press conference to announce that I'll be stepping down from The Newport Group and appointing"

How about some ice cream?
Banana split.
I'll be right back.
I hate the scary part.

"Yeah, let's slip around and go in through the shadow of the buildings."
I'll take the one with the white hat.

Another murder made to look like accident.
"That's, uh, that's five in two years."
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
I'm just wondering about something.
Okay.
Why does your father hate psychiatrists?
He doesn't hate psychiatrists.
"Okay, so why does he hate me?"
He doesn't hate you.
He thinks you're great.
Why are you concerned about what he thinks suddenly?
"You know, he's a puritan."
He quotes Proust and wears tweed.
He doesn't know anything about us.
Do you think that we should've gotten married before?
Before when?
Before coming out here?
"He runs around, spends my money on drugs and ends up in a mental hospital!"
"Oh, I'm so close to letting go on him."
I'm at the end of my rope here.
I think that what's going on with Wyatt is complicated and I don't think your anger is helping him with his problems.
My anger?
I'm not angry.
I'm furious!
"Because this is all about me, you see."
"I will not tolerate disgusting, degenerate behaviour and disrespect for me and my values--"
"Mrs. Jones, listen."
Give your values a rest for a second.
Your kid's in trouble.
Yeah.
"Oh, Jesus, Claudia."
Give me a fucking break.
My relationship with lan has nothing to do with this.
Sure.
Can I borrow your forehead?
"Good afternoon, gentlemen."
How may I help you?
Afternoon.
Agents thompson and sousa with the ssr.
If you're looking for mr.
"Stark,"
I'm afraid he's indefinitely unavailable.
"We're well-aware of that, mr."
Jarvis.
"That is your name, isn't it?"
Mr. Edwin jarvis?
You misplace anything recently?
"Yes, I did lose a fountain pen on fifth avenue."
How about the bumper off a fleetmaster?
Just the bumper?
Wish you'd found the entire car.
I reported it stolen several days ago.
Detective davis at the 19th precinct was very helpful.
If there's nothing further...
That bumper was found at a major crime scene.
There's plenty further.
"Mr. Stark doesn't like visitors,"
Whether he's here to receive them or not.
"Look, mr."
"Jarvis, I can call a judge"
And wait here to get a warrant.
"But honestly, it's almost lunchtime,"
How would you like to take a ride downtown?
"Well, lead the way."
"Well, this will be novel."
What?
Oh!
it's to remind you of who you are.
I love it.
I am gonna put it up on my wall at brown
As soon as I get back from europe. oh!
Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me
And going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
so I need to just stop moving
And contemplate the failure of my life.
Well When you're ready to start moving again
- You know I'll be here.
- Yes of course I do.
Humphrey Where's your mind?
I know it sounds crazy
But I actually-
- I kind of miss high school.
I miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions
Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch
Even Chuck Bass who would get so close to talk.
Wow. you miss Chuck Bass.
Well not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass.
But yeah I uh I think it's safe to say
That the nostalgia's officially begun.
Apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you.
What's up Dan Vanessa?
Shouldn't you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something?
Well I think she'd rather I gave her something else.
- Yeah she made a pass at me. - god. is she hot?
Actually yeah she is.

You deny this area has a high crime rate?
You have no perception of reality!
We'II get a specialist to evaluate.
He was sent here orhe came by hisself?
"And anotherthing: when you speak, I don't understand you."
Speak to me in italian.
Were you sent here or did you come by yourself?
They sent me here to make you work.
Let's try to optimize the work.
I'm constipated.
You're pushing it.

You could have come a little later!

Don't force me to report you for discipline.

Didn't they teach you manners?

"Hi, I'm Jenny pope."
I'm here to interview for the practice manager's post.
"If you'd just like to take a seat, Mary will see you at 9:05."
"Hello, I'm Mary."
I'll be looking after you this morning.
If you'd just like to follow me I'll take you to meet the doctor.
Are there many other candidates?
"Oh, just one."
"Doctor, this is Jenny Pope, is it?"
"Jenny, meet Dr. Blair."
Hello.
"We've already met, actually."
"Oh, yeah, the *** lady"
"Yeah, that was very much my sense of humor on display."
***
It's just silly.
As you come to learn I'm pretty quick on the draw when it comes to banter.
"I'm a social beast- who knows where to draw the line, hard working, but very pleasant."
Right.
Take a seat.
"This is Karen from the PCT, she is going to be doing... *** testing and role plays."
"Yeah, thanks, Mary."
"And there will be an interview, and then at the end of the day"
I'll decide who's going to be taking over from the late great Valery.
"Well, if you're ready, doctor, I think we should begin."
It's Jimmy.
We've only got a few moments until they run into they're onto us again.
"Okay, just give me your arm."
"Okay, just relax."
Here it is.
Here it is.
Bingo!
This little fucker is how they've been tracking you.
Toodle-oo.
"In a few moments, your mechanical parts are gonna start shutting down."
Your friend Akan's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.
Slick handles all Akan's cops/guns/ real estate/ a lot of other shit.
This helpful dot on the map... is Slick's place.
"All you gotta do is break in there... kill him... open up his ribcage, take out his beating heart... and fucking eat it."
I'm kidding!
I'm kidding.
You don't have to fucking eat his heart.
"Under his heart is his charge pump, yeah?"
Bring that to me.
Use this and I'll contact you on this.
That has gotta be the gayest jacket I've ever seen.
(SCREAMS
Henry.
Akan's already started.
"If we don't stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner."
"You're half machine, half pussy."
"Wait, wait."
"I can tell you something very important, about the man who sent you here."
"Oi, Henry."
I'm at this high-class establishment.
Follow the dot and then just knock on the knocker.
Get it?
You can stay as long as you like.
Based on true stories
"The police are searching for Robert Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie who disappeared earlier this evening from her home."
What are you doing to find her?
- Sarah Lund
- Who is this?
- The girl's all fight.
I'm collecting on a debt.
I have a suggestion - a life for a life.
"I'll get Zeuthen, you'll get the girl."
Emilie!
No!
The perpetrator listened to you.
You made him think twice.
- I saw him shoot her.
- Did you?
"Sarah Lund, Juncker and Borch have gone to Jutland."
The perpetrator may have spared Emilie.
He won't finish until he knows what happened back then.
- We don't know what happened.
- He shot her and threw her in the water.
- I can't feel it.
- And the investigation in Jutland?
We haven't found anything to show that your daughter is alive.
You could say that mourning is love without a home.
Don't!
"Let me out, damn it!"
I've decided to resign as Prime Minister.
The assistant public prosecutor had another meeting that day.
- I won't argue over Emilie's grave.
- They say she may still be alive.
[Screaming] Move!
[Grunting]
[Gunshot] [Bystanders Screaming]
- [Woman Whimpering] - [Bystanders Muttering]
It just went off.
I didn't mean to.
Zucco.
Talk to me.
[Man] He's dead.
You have a phone call in my office.
"Don't give me that fishy look, Doctor."
You just got a nicer job than we do.
[Bystanders Chattering]
[Walton] Plenty of shotgun shells and wire and a box for an alarm clock.
There's a receipt for it.
Alarm clock?
"Well, that didn't figure in the analysis of the last explosion."
"According to the receipt, he just bought it at the corner drugstore sometime today."
But it's not here now.
"I'm gonna stick my neck out, Kojak."
"I think he made a bomb today, and it's not here."
So you think he's got one ticking out there somewhere now... a time bomb?
[Walton] Yeah.
Yeah.
Send Crocker up here with everything I ought to see.
[Seymour] Then it's true.
Danny's dead.
"Sure, he's dead."
"The big, bad copper didn't like what he said in here, so he plugged him."
"The big, bad cop didn't like what he said in here, and you wanna know why?"
Because he's been going around this city killing people.
"Now, if you have any plans, you better get on the phone right now and give your apologies."
We're going to do a full run of the first act.
I want to check the timing...
"Alex, please..."
"Everyone in place, please."
I know we're tired.
"Believe me, sometimes it's a big plus."
"Okay, no talking backstage."
"Music, please."
Last night at 6 PM the deceased's wife was seen by the fireplace in the cook's arms
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Stop, cut."
"I said, stop."
The timing of your entrance was wrong.
"Your cue is the orchestra, not the lighting."
"The lighting didn't start on time either, Zeltzer."
But that's beside the point.
We'll do the entrance from the beginning of the song.
Music.
"Eli, are you ready?"
Ten to midnight
"A wet, cold night"
Waiting for my friend at the street corner
"My dear Dr. Watson is a partner and friend but, unfortunately, he's always late"
I saw you from onstage.
I had to come get a kiss.
"Do you recognize me with the moustache, Goni?"
"Alex, it looks so funny on your face."
How's it going?
"- Wonderful, knock on wood."
I hope the theater doesn't fold before the general rehearsal.
Where the hell is Alex?
And it's the first time I've ever sung.
"Oh, it's these jokes Ben Littmeyer gave me at lunch."
"Ben Littmeyer, from the sociology department?"
"Yes, oh he has the best sense of humour."
I finally convinced him to host the fundraiser.
"Well, why didn't you ask me to do it?"
I have a wonderful sense of humour.
"Nina, come in here."
"I have a wonderful sense of humour, don't I?"
Ohhh.
See?
- Oh!
"This is an important fundraiser for Pendleton, and Ben can get those fat cats to cough up some cash."
Well I can make a fat cat cough.
I can even make him vomit.
"Thanks Dick, but Ben already said yes."
You don't think I'm funny?
"Oh Dick, you're loving, and intelligent, and sexy.."
and funny?
- Oh!
I have a class!
I am funny!
I am funny!
I am!
What happened to your coat?
"I don't know what happened to it, so Mrs. Dubcek let me borrow this one."
Sweet woman.
So you lost your coat?
Oh tough break.
"I lost more than a coat, Tommy!"
"I lost a friend, a buddy, a companion, who kept me warm when it was cold and warmer when it was really sort of too hot to be wearing a coat."
"Tommy, look, you're the information officer."
What do you know about this thing they call a sense of humour?
- What is it?
Sit down.
"Emily, I've been cheating."
Cheating?
Eating cheating?
"You know today, when you called the office, and Carol said I couldn't talk?"
- Yeah?
"- Well, I couldn't talk... because my mouth was full of chocolate-covered peanut brittle."
"Oh, Bob!"
"Emily, Let me finish."
The peanut brittle was just the dessert.
The appetizer was a liverwurst and Swiss cheese sandwich.
"- Oh, Bob."
How could you?
"- Emily, I'm still not finished."
Then I went down to the snack bar... and I snacked on almost every bar they had.
"Do you mean while I was stuffing radishes, you were stuffing your face?"
"Well, Emily."
I don't know what came over me.
"I just-The minute I walked in there, I wanted to attack anything edible."
I felt like...
Bela Lugosi in a room full of necks.
"Emily, hunger is a terrible thing, and I gave in to it."
And You know what's worse than all of that put together?
- What?
- I'm still hungry.
"Well, Bob, what do you want me to say?"
"I mean, eat whatever you want, stuff yourself like a pig?"
Start your diet next week or tomorrow or never?
"Well, It is my birthday."
Fine.
Why don't you eat your gifts?
Go home!
"Yoshimura, stop picking on them"
You don't know nothing
I was educating them
These damn savages!
I'll have you pay for this some day
Good morning
What?
Checking out guns?
Watan Robo is getting married We've got some preparations to do
Tado?
Baso?
I heard your father Mouna Rudo has mobilized lots of men for this hunt?
"Yeah, but what can we hunt in those disappearing forests?"
You've about hacked down all the trees on our hunting grounds
If we don't go hunting now we'll have nothing left once the trees are all gone
Tado Mouna!
You'd better watch your mouth!
Savages will always be savages
They have no manners at all
Wait!
Pawan?
What is the kid doing there?
Pawan!
Chief Mouna!
My hunting ground is right here!
Temu Walis?
You red-foot pheasant!
Don't you know this is the Mehebu hunting ground?
Mouna!
It's just a misunderstanding
This is the first time my eldest son goes hunting
That's...
And a few baboon friends that my brother shot.
I bagged some too down there.
But otherwise down there I usually shoot with a Steyr-Mannlicher 868 S caliber.
I have to say it's the best caliber for antelope and game because so far I've never missed a shot.
"And never needed more than one shot for an animal, thank God."
There are enough sleepers in Austria.
It's them we should fear.
Not normal people.
Them.
"And, unfortunately, there's also..."
There didn't used to be...
preachers of hate.
They preach hatred in Austria.
Why?
I don't agree.
"You have to... investigate who's doing it, who's stirring up hatred."
The Koran has both.
"The Koran has evil and bad- I mean, good in it."
It's not just bad.
"I was talking with him and asked, ""What are you?"""
"He says, ""I'm an Austrian."""
"I go, ""Sure, but at the European Cup you scream ""Turkiye, Turkiye!"""
"He says, ""Yeah, I'm Austrian, but I'm Turkish."""
You see?
But he's more Turkish.
Even if he was born here.
It's a typical case of oriental logic.
- They can't think logically.
- He has Austrian papers...
They can't think logically.
Because Islam teaches them that logic is something that goes against God.
"Sheila, I did it."
I was selfish.
I was self-involved.
I practically invited that woman into my house.
"You can""t abandon them."
"They don""t have any money."
"I did this and I""m gonna do something about it because I have a list."
"Clara, please."
"If you quit, where were they going to go?"
"L""m gonna win my husband back."
"- Hi, Miss..."
- Not now.
"- Clara, what are you doing?"
"- Old lady""s clothing."
Boring!
You wanna go shopping?
"Isn""t this great?"
"You know, this doesn""t look very comfortable."
They are.
"It""s like you""re wearing nothing."
Only thing worse than being lied to and cheated on... is what you're reduced to.
What makes you sick to your stomach is your own demoralizing behavior.
"The paranoia, the obsessing, the dirtiness of it all... is enough to make you crazy."
It will make you damn crazy.
The liposuction will only remove 4 to 5 pounds... but the difference will seem much more dramatic.
What about my breasts?
Can you make them look fuller?
Sure.
"L""ve been thinking... you know, about you and Daddy."
"You know, you guys love each other so much."
"Amy, not now, okay?"
"Daddy""s going to be home any minute."
I'll find your wife within the hour.
Bring him a phone.
I still say we should go look for them.
How?
All we know is Mike's somewhere in Miami and Schmidt's either with him or dead.
We can't just sit here.
They're out there somewhere.
Hang on.
Could be Mike.
"Is that you, brother?"
"Hey, Chuck, I need a favor."
I need some suxamethonium chloride for an interrogation I'm doing of my son-of-a-bitch boss.
"Uh, Mikey, that's not a truth serum."
That's a poison.
Did you want Schmidt to die?
Exactly.
I think it's the only way we get what we want here.
"Uh, Mike, if you're doing what I think you're doing, we're gonna need an ambulance."
"Oh, you read my mind."
How soon can you be here?
I'm at that Syrian restaurant on 12th and Bayshore.
How much time do we have?
An hour?
Sounds great.
I don't like the sound of that.
"Uh, they must be in a tight spot, because Mike's trying to get Schmidt out by faking his death."
"But with this suxamethonium chloride, five, six minutes in, you're dead for real."
Which is why we need an ambulance.
"Only problem is, we don't have an ambulance."
"Fi, when's the last time you talked to your EMT friend?"
The guy with the dimples?
It's been an hour!
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.
"Make sure your ""Open, please come in"" signs are out."
You all know what to do.
"All right, nobody panics."
Here we go!
"Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere."
"- Minny, I know exactly where we are."
"- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere."
"- Honey, please."
- Hello.
"Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley."
Legendary for its service and hospitality.
How can we help you?
"- We don't need anything, thank you."
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.
He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee.
"We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we..."
- OK.
Really.
"We're just peachy, OK?"
"- What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel."
"No, it doesn't agree with my tank."
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
"- Good to see you, soldier!"
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs.
"- Honey, surplus!"
- We have too much surplus.
I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
"And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast."
Bevan?
"Yes, Bevan."
"Bevan, yes, yes."
"Bevan, your boyfriend Bevan."
Fiance.
Just rooms and rooms full of bleeding saints and fat cherubs.
"There's this room full of these Goya sketches, sort of man's inhumanity stuff."
I could hardly breathe.
Felt a bit the same when I saw Pica's stuff.
Did Goya murder kids too?
No.
And you don't judge artists by the way they live their lives.
"I don't care if he can sing, write, paint and dance all at the same time."
An arsehole's an arsehole.
Isn't it time you went on a diet?
"No, I'm a good weight."
How long have we got this room?
How long does it take to fix cancerous testicles?
Oh.
"Oh, geez, Keith must be pissed."
He never used the bloody things when he had 'em.
Found out what our boy did with his money.
Yeah?
"He paints a masterpiece, sells it at grunge markets for a fiftieth of what it's worth, then wanders around the city handing out wads of cash to homeless people."
Jesus Christ.
We're defending Jesus Christ.
I don't need money.
"That was Denny Lorton, my previous life."
Now I find it an intrusion.
So that's what you were doing in a lane that night?
You were giving Ben Rigby money?
I'd been told about him.
My 5-year-old niece just texted me this.
"""Uncle Jesse, you're a big fat stinking... ooh!"""
How does she know that word?
And my grandma's weighing in.
Probably just to say that she loves you and that everything's gonna be okay.
Yeow!
Now you know where your little niece got the trucker mouth.
Look Jesse you had to know that dating me.
Was sometimes gonna be a pain in the...
Well I'm not your grandma so I'm just gonna say complicated.
Dating me would be a pain in the complicated.
"But I'm worth it, aren't I?"
"Again this is where you say ""No..."""
What?
What do I say?
And to which one of you?
"Because if I'm dating Hannah, now I'm cheating on Miley."
"And if I'm dating Miley, then I'm the jerk who broke Hannah Montana's heart."
Either way I'm just...
[Cell phone buzzing]
And that's my mom.
"Ooh well if we ever get married, she is not gonna be baby-sitting the triplets."
I have very specific fortune cookies?
Would you stop joking about this?
"Listen, Jesse sometimes joking about it is the only way that I get through it."
You just stepped into this.
This has been my life for six years.
Please let's just forget about it.
Come on.
"Pizza, a movie, anything."
Let's go.
Pizza and a movie is not gonna fix this.
FITZGERALD:
We got horses over here!
"Hey, Bridger."
We got horses!
JIM:
What you want to do about these pigs?
FITZGERALD:
"The Lord's on our side, kid."
FITZGERALD:
"You all right there, kid?"
Your head in the right place?
I guess.
I can't help thinking about whether we did the right--
Ain't our place to wonder.
The good Lord got us on a road whether we choose it or not.
"My pop, he weren't a religious man, you know?"
"If you couldn't grow it, kill it, or eat it, he just plain old didn't believe in it."
And this one time he head on up the old Saba hills.
San Saba hills?
He joined a couple Texas Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
Pretty routine.
He done it like a hundred times before.
"Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day, it all went fucked."
Somehow that night he lost his buddies.
And to top it off them Comanches went and took the horses.
"So he was starving and delirious and he crawls up into this mott, this group of trees out in the middle of nowhere just sticking up in this ocean of scrub and he found religion."
"At that moment, he told me he found God."
Uh-huh.
And it turns out that God He's a squirrel.
Yeah.
"A big, old meaty one."
"""I found God,"" he used to say."
Is that a girl who could kill herself?
"This is 1 957, Sam."
An unmarried girl that got pregnant was an outcast.
Sometimes they'd end the pregnancy.
Sometimes they'd even end their own lives.
- Maybe Greg helped her do both.
- You really think he killed her?
Hilla tried to break up with Greg on the fourth.
She said they fought all night.
"She broke with him, Al, but it was too late."
She was pregnant.
He's gotta be the killer.
But you've got no proof of that.
I've got feelings.
Feelings?
That's a song.
You've got no evidence.
- You got no gun.
You got no bullet.
You got nothin'.
- I got her.
You got shadow and light flickering on a wall.
That's not Hilla.
What you're seeing is in your imagination.
"[ Sam ] She's trying to tell me something, Al."
"I don't know what it is, but she's trying to tell me something."
"[ Sam Narrating ] As much as I hate to admit it, sometimes Al's right."
Hilla was haunting me in a way even I couldn't understand.
"But I kept thinking about the road she had traveled to get here... and all she had lost along the way... to die alone, buried and forgotten, with her murderer free."
I had to be here to change that.
[ Lyle ] I told you this was a waste of time.
Not really.
"Look at her, she's a barfly that hangs out at cop bars."
"She probably heard boys in blue talking about the case over beers, so she comes down here figuring she can get something for nothing."
"She did ask for something, didn't she?"
"C'mon, what was it?"
I gave her a cigarette.
"And if you went so far as to offer her a drink, she'll say she was on the Chicago flight with OJ."
She was in the parking lot behind St Lukes.
"She saw an Oldsmobile or a Chevy, she's not sure which."
"Two guys get out, open the trunk, lift out a body, throw it in the dumpster."
- Two guys?
She can ID them?
- She didn't see their faces.
Of course not!
"She did get a partial plate, 287, she thinks."
"Oh, so she's down here looking for a partial reward?"
She's a joke.
- She knows about the white gloves.
- What?
- You got an address on this woman?
- Mm-hm.
"Take Tim, go to her apartment, find out everything you can."
"I'm gonna have a little chat with her, find out what she knows and how she knows it."
"Frank, go slow."
You see me smiling?
"Hi, I'm Frank Pembleton."
Pamela Wilgis.
It's nice to meet you.
"Nice to meet you too, Pamela."
"So, she was wearing gloves?"
"- Yeah, I seen it."
- You seen what?
When the two guys dumped her.
- It was his hat.
- What are you doing with his hat?
Why shouldn't I have his hat?
"Hanna, maybe you're looking for something a little edgier after Sean."
- But this guy is dark.
"- Spencer, he's not that dark."
He's dark enough.
"Well, he's no Arthur Dodger, whoever that is."
"Yeah, he's just had it tough."
Are you two on speaking terms again?
- Of course we are.
- You need to be careful about that guy.
It seems to me we had this conversation once about Toby.
I'm looking for Coach Fulton.
- Is the coach expecting you?
- The coach is avoiding me.
- That's what the coach is doing.
- Are you a parent?
"Yes, I'm a parent."
Nick McCullers.
My daughter is Paige McCullers.
I have your daughter in English Comp.
I'm Ezra Fitz.
The coach.
Why don't we walk to the principal's office see if we can find Coach Fulton?
I've seen the principal and all I got was politically correct double-talk.
About the agenda in this place that's penalizing my daughter.
Taking opportunities and giving them to someone who doesn't deserve them!
"Everybody gets a fair chance here, Mr. McCullers."
We go out of our way to make sure it works.
My girl is the best swimmer on that team.
You can't give it to somebody...
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"- Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
- Really?
Then what is this?
"- Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
"- All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"- Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
- Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
- I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"- Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"- What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"- Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
- Road trip!
- I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need-- whoa!"
That apartment of yours looks like it belongs in a homeless file.
"Then it's off to Crate and Barrel for a knife a fork, a spoon and a glass while you're at it."
Then I'll need a dishwasher.
Just throw them out after you finish eating.
It's on me.
Get a life.
I've got yours.
It's quite enough.
You read this?
Today's Times editorial?
"""Judge or be Judged""?"
"""Notwithstanding Judge Stern's distinguished record one must ask, 'Would he be on the bench if he were not a former law partner of the mayor's?"
"'"""
I didn't appoint him.
"He was nominated, like everybody else."
Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on yours and I always will be.
But I smell a hanging party.
We should put distance between ourselves and Walter Stern.
- Distance is shit.
Distance!
Distance is something you do to your enemies.
It's the thing of the '90s to make friends extinct.
Distance is the absence of Menschkeit.
Translate that for me.
You don't know what Menschkeit means?
I don't.
Menschkeit.
"You know, something between men."
"It's about honor, character..."
Untranslatable.
I'm yourJagadish
I'm yours!
Jagadish
I got something to tell you
I have sold my engine design for 2 million dollars
Don't you want to know why I sold it?
For my sake?
I mean... for our sake for the sake of our future
Yes Nitu.
But the future for us lies in India
In India...?
Our house is being auctioned
I'm going back to India
Will you come with me?
"Jai, take care of yourself"
"Nitu, you never wanted to marry... someone who was weak, a man without a backbone"
"All along I knew, you were hinting at me"
But what are you doing now?
Jai is a man of substance
You'd like him to become like me?
"Feeble, spineless...?"
"Look, someone who doesn't value relationships remains a loner"
You want to be lonely all your life?
- Lonely...?
Our next big act is Marcus Brewer singing Roberta Flack's beloved Killing Me Softly.
He'll be accompanied by Simon Cosgrove on the recorder.
"Marcus, I can't do this."
- That lot's going to shit all over us.
- But you said...
I'm sorry.
Here's your £5 back.
Any moment now.
These stories don't have a long shelf life.
"If we don't give him more ammunition, this Silk will move on to somebody else."
- Then...
- Then what?
Daylight again?
- Definitely.
- Good.
And I could totally take that guy.
"You just worry too much, Nora."
You always have.
I know Sarah and Joe are going through a rough time.
Are you sure that's all?
I really think Tommy's decision to buy this winery with Holly is bothering her more than she's letting on.
Tommy and Sarah have a very strong bond.
William never would've brought Sarah to Ojai Foods if he thought she and Tommy couldn't survive sibling rivalry.
You're right.
You're right.
"I mean, look at us."
- What do you mean?
"- Our family wasn't exactly a picnic, yet here we are, after all these years, still speaking to one another."
- You want a green bean?
- Thank you.
"- It's a small miracle, isn't it?"
"- Yes, it is."
I don't know.
I think maybe I was wrong about her.
- About who?
- Holly.
- What do you mean?
- You're seeing her.
Tommy is starting a company with her.
"As much as I hate to admit it, maybe William was a good judge of character."
"No, no, in the crabbing area."
"It's just that you were fishing for bass, so..."
That probably explains why we didn't catch anything.
"You fish in the Apachaway a lot, so I thought that you would know that, but..."
I don't fish a lot.
"- I thought your equipment was pretty sophisticated, but..."
- There's a difference... between wanting to fish and having time to fish.
Tell me about it.
- And he freed the slaves and won the Civil War.
- That's right!
He was probably our greatest president.
- Even greater than George Washington?
- It's a running debate.
- Laine Hanson.
"- Oh, Mr. President."
And you must be one Timothy Hanson.
Timothy Muskie Hanson.
"Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would you like a great big cookie?"
Any kind.
"- No, thank you."
- Any kind at all.
"Oatmeal, white chocolate..."
"Actually, we just had dinner, but thanks."
"In that case, shall we have our picture taken, young man?"
Hmm?
- How do I look?
- Your tie's a little crooked.
"Well, can't take a picture like that."
Will you straighten it for me?
Your mommy tells me you know more about the presidents than most grown-ups.
- I like to study them.
- Mmm!
Are you hurt?
"Oh, no."
"I tripped earlier on the-- on the cobblestones, and I-I must have cut it and--and not noticed."
"Well, I'm glad you're safe."
You must be Annie!
"Uh, I am."
I forgot to tell you we have dinner guests.
"These are my dear friends Blanca Gonzalez and her boyfriend, Hector Serrano."
It's lovely to finally meet you.
We've heard so much about you.
Yes.
So much.
♪
You found a real catch.
We just love Simon.
Really?
How often do you get to see him?
Every few weeks.
He's doing some business deal with Hector.
That must be frustrating-- always losing your boyfriend to a business meeting.
Tell me about it.
Hopefully I'll have him back to myself soon.
He tells me this deal is basically finished.
"Three mojitos-- the personal vice of your countryman and fellow Cubaphile, Ernest Hemingway."
I wonder what
Hemingway would think if he saw our country after 50 years of the embargo?
I bet he'd still be enchanted with its natural beauty and free-spirited people.
I know I am.
Mm.
We hear that sentiment a lot from tourists.
I find it incredibly condescending.
"Hector, please."
What happened to the Poncherello School of Cool?
"Well, I'm always open for suggestions, Jon."
"Go up to her and say, ""Hey, my name is Frank and I'd like to get to know you. "" Take it from there, just be honest."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm gonna let her discover me.
I'll put these on and go outside and polish my bike.
"Chicks can't resist a nice, shiny bike."
And me in these shorts.
There she is.
I can't see her feet.
Got it.
Dalecki's Baby Food.
One of my officers?
Loose load cite?
"Not so far, but we'll check right into it."
"Yes, sir, we'll start an immediate search for the two boxes."
Right.
15-5 Mary L.A.
"11-82, southbound Harbor freeway at Exposition."
"15-7, Mary L.A."
"11-79, northbound Hollywood Freeway at Vermont."
Attention all units we are requesting all area agencies to assist in the search for two boxes of contaminated baby food.
"The boxes were lost on the Golden State, southbound, near Ninth."
The food is contaminated with botulism.
"Repeat, botulism."
I can't find the blue one.
Which goes best with these shorts?
Come on.
You're not going to a fashion show.
- You're going to meet a girl.
"- Yeah, maybe I don't need a shirt."
Where did he go?
I don't know.
"I said to Axel, ""Go back into the apartment."""
"I said, ""Eat something."""
"But then the phone rang, and he answered, and then he asked me to go back into the shop and not to listen."
"But he only spoke for a very short time, and then he went out."
"Who was it on the phone, Lisa?"
"He didn't want to tell me, but I know."
I know it was her.
Miss Morrow?
How do you know?
Because she called early this morning.
Carl told me.
I made him tell.
Did your brother tell you what she said on the earlier call?
Yes.
For Axel to call her at a number.
"At, uh, at Mountain 33497."
"Sorry, but the lodge is full up."
No checkouts today.
We're looking for a woman.
She was driving an expensive convertible with a man asleep in the back.
They told us at Conley Corners she stopped there about 8 a.m. asking for a room.
We do mostly vacation business.
"The woman was around 40-- very striking, silver haired."
"Now, did she, uh, stop here?"
"I sent her down to Joe's Cabins, a few hundred yards down the road."
"I guess she found a vacancy there, all right."
What makes you think so?
I've seen her car shuttling back and forth to the junction once or twice.
"Matter of fact, she went in that direction not ten minutes ago."
Toward the stores.
Ministry of War Transport.
Seems they've had wind of your proposed filmic scenario.
"Apparently, they're concerned that ""the Nancy Starling's engine failure may cast morale-sapping doubt on the quality of British engineering."""
It was her.
Bloody Ministry spy.
What if it's not the engine?
What if it's the propeller?
"It gets snarled up with flotsam,"
"Uncle Frank goes in the water to free it, gets shot, and the girls have to finish the job under fire."
- Not the girls.
- Not the girls?
- No.
"Uh, Johnnie."
- Johnnie?
- Is there an echo in here?
- Why him?
- Because he's the hero.
- So?
"Well, how do we know he's the hero if he never does anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
Johnnie can't go in the water.
"He's injured, badly injured."
"A manly slash on the bicep, for Christ's sake."
He's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"This is Rose and Lily's story, and you won't let them do anything."
- They go to Dunkirk.
- And Johnnie pilots them home.
They're girls.
Girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to be had by him.
I'm stuck on something.
I could use an extra set of eyes.
And I'll let you insert your own blind joke.
"I'd love to, but I'm on my way out."
I just came to check a few emails.
I like it.
Banker's hours.
Make that banker's half day.
"Hey, you want to grab a beer later?"
"I'll try not to smash a bottle over anyone's head, but I can't make any promises."
"As nice as that sounds, I'm on my way out of town."
Did Joan put you on an assignment I don't know about?
I'm taking a few days vacation.
Really?
"This from the woman who's never taken a day off work for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Kwanzaa."
It was a spontaneous thing.
"Now, that is more like the Annie Walker that I know."
Where you going?
"Michael's taking my sister away, and they need me to watch the girls."
What about Michael's parents?
Didn't they just move out there?
They're on a cruise.
And they just now asked you to come out?
They're not big planners.
"Listen, I'm gonna be late for my flight."
"I'm fine, Auggie."
We'll catch up when I get back.
I've never pulled a job like this in three hours.

"No,  you love this idea, and you love it so much that you made me love it, too."
How many people do you know that would actually pay money to party on The Mystery Machine?
A lot of people.
"There's Tom, my co-worker Sam-- he loves this idea."
"And, uh..."
Crap.
I'm an idiot.
Oh.
"No, you're not."
Come on.
Just because this idea isn't great doesn't mean the next one's not gonna be.
I believe in you.
Oh.
"Oh, now we're out of wine."
I don't want to go all the way to the store to get it.
Why can't wine just appear whenever you want it to?
- Bye.
- Where are you going?
"Uh, I just want to go look into something."
But I'll catch up with you later-- maybe when you're done sucking that cork.
Shut up.
I don't do that.

I was dropping mad knowledge on these shorties till this wangsta scrub came in and ganked my crew.
"Oh, I was helping out with a children's music class till another teacher came in and took my spot."
"I mean, me and the kids were having so much fun-- you know, really connecting."
And then this guy just came in and took over.
I feel you.
"She went back inside caressing his hair, and..."
It's the Iast time I saw her alive.
You stayed with the others?
"No, I was tired, I had to work early the next morning."
"I let them deal with it, I jumped into my truck and I went straight home."
"You're here now, so you came back later."
- Is that it?
- One hour later.
"Yeah, one hour later."
"I don't know why, but I couldn't sleep."
I drank some water and looked out the window.
"Lights were on at C,duIie's, so I went over right away."
"Just as I got there, I think I heard a gun shot."
Then the lights went out.
"So I slowed down, down, then... a second shot, and the lights came on."
"I stepped on it, then I saw the kid with the gun."
"I just had time to lean over, then another shot."
"There was a hole where my face was before, the black guy was gone."
I got out of my truck and ran across the lawn.
"There's Touchy, Ducky with Josée, and C,duIie, covered in blood."
What happened?
", I asked."
Touchy couldn't answer.
"C,duIie wasn't moving."
Ducky was speechless.
"Josée, was crying."
Touchy was trying to bring her to...
I felt something in my back.
"I turned, saw polo."
He had blood in his mouth.
"We tried to bring her to, but she was gone, gone for good."
polo walked towards where the black kid was.
"No, I want you guys focused on possible external threats."

It got to be normal.
It got to where I was even proud that I had the kind of husband that was willing to go out and risk his neck just to get us the little extras.
But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.
"-Can't do it, Karen."
-Why not?
I just can't do it. I got something lined up.
"Yeah, but tomorrow night's the only night she can do it."
-Pretty please?
"-Karen, I can't do it."
What do you want me to do?
-l got to go.
-Wait a minute.
"I wanted to go shopping, can I get some money?"
How much do you need?
That much.
This much...
Give me a kiss.
See you later.
Oh...all right.
"- You're a long way from home, Ray."
"- Yes, so are you."
But I'm not the one who's been ruffling feathers.
Where did you hear that?
I got a call from Director Hendricks who heard of a Michigan senator who was responding to a call from a local mover and shaker.
Marcus Van Sciver.
Is that the guy you've been accusing of killing people?
I didn't accuse him of anything.
But this has to do with that local cop that you've been chasing.
"Starts there, I don't know where it's gonna end."
"It's gonna end right here, Ray."
Right here.
"It's time to fold up the tent, people are tired of the sideshow, Ray."
You're asking for my gun?
Do I have to ask?
- Do you have a spare?
- No.
I'm gonna believe that.
Is there something else?
What?
Van Sciver isn't human.
"Ok Ray, I've gonna get..."
"No, you have to believe me, I've seen things."
- I don't buy this...
"- No, listen to me!"
There's a conspiracy here.
And it goes way back.
"I, I'm not sure who it involves, but these... these people, these things..."
"Hey, I'm gonna make you promise, hey look at me, look at me in my eyes!"
"We're gonna go home, you're gonna get to talk to..."
I'm not talking to another doctor!
Talk to Hendricks.
I have 10 times more experience than any Ivy League kid.
It's not just about experience.
I would need to depend on you every day.
What do you want me to do?
I'll start at the-
- I'll start at the bottom.
Just give me a chance.
I'm sorry.
Did you get the job?
"- Yeah, I think I got a shot."
- Really?
You know how it is.
They gotta go talk amongst themselves and...
These-
"- Look, these things, they can be really political."
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.
He has phone calls to the congressional leadership.
First lady is back tonight?
Empress is wheels down at 1845.
"They're supposed to have dinner at the residence, but you know how they are."
"So we should have an advance on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual."
- What if she wants sushi?
"- No, no, she's off sushi."
Remember she had that thing on the Japan trip?
"- Carol, how are you still awake?"
"- Caffeine and patriotism, sir."
- Threat matrix?
- Well threats against POTUS have quadrupled since the G8 speech.
PID is keeping an eye on a guy in Buffalo they're worried about.
- Visitors today?
Those two.
"All right, ma'am, I've just spoken to Amy."
Her and Dan are with Pierce and his mom at the hospital.
- But there's been a holdup.
"- Oh, God."
She's probably gonna die just to spite me.
That evil bitch.
And Richard and Jonah are there.
And I blame Kent and Bill for that.
"Well, this is a long glass of frozen strawberry fuckup."
"Hey, listen, Ben, you've got to do something."
I don't want to be a bagman for the toughest guy in D block.
"- All right, stop it, Gary."
"- Okay, look, get Pierce here."
Okay?
Right now.
"I'm gonna take control of this situation that I don't know anything about, right?"
Because I am the only one who seems to be...
Capable.
"Oh, God."
Is it possible to stop coughing?
No!
- You are not taking him.
- His jittery ass is mine.
"- Guys, I'm right here."
"- I'm sorry, your jittery ass is the president's."
"You shouldn't even be here, Jonah, unless you're giving your brain to science."
"I'm here on behalf of the president, Amy."
Do you remember her?
She's the woman that would have fired you if you hadn't gone fucking Fukushima.
"That's right, we're on a mission."
I am surprised the two of you even found your way out of your own mothers' vaginas.
What I will say is when we finished filming and I drove to the hotel
I always found myself getting into the Subaru.
I prefer the Impreza.
No idea why.
"It's like I prefer dark to milk chocolate,"
I prefer Bedford to Bruce Forsyth.
"Right, let's see if we can find out if there's any real difference between them on our test track."
Please say mushi mushi to Stig-San.
So first up the Impreza STi.
"This is the tweet one, remember."
And...
Oh dear.
"An emotional Stig this week, round Chicago."
This car does understeer so will that slow him down?
It is looking good so far.
Ooh.
He is...
He IS running wide there.
Into the penultimate corner.
"Come on, Stig, keep it tight."
There's loads of understeer and he goes round the finishing line!
Now what about the Evo VIII?
In the interests of fairness
I should say this isn't the car Jeremy drove in Scotland.
It's the 301bhp FQ version.
Very tidy round Chicago.
No trace of understeer as it smoothly powers through that hammer head.
TYRES SCREECH Good Lord!
"Screaming at the follow-through, a second faster than the Subaru."
Will it beat it?
Over the finish line.
I have the times here.
LAUGHTER
This is the same studio we film Pointless.
Where David is sitting there is roughly where I sit.
"Jessica is roughly where the column is, and if you look under your desk, that's Alexander Armstrong's secret coke stash."
LAUGHTER
Does this remind you of anything?
HE MOCKS RICHARD
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
That's a little harsh.
I mean...
"listen, it looked like me."
I don't think it sounded like me.
LAUGHTER
"So, I've knocked the microphone off in trying to do an impersonation."
"Yeah, you know what?"
"It's harder to be me than it looks, my friend."
"Sorry, do you think your impression was so good you dropped the mic?"
LAUGHTER
"Literally, our sound department has just gone, ""Aww."""
LAUGHTER
Should we treat ourselves to a little look at Pointless?
Check this out.
We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many words ending in 'ZZ.'
"OK, so I have a word, um..."
"But, again, it's sort of slangy, maybe slightly profane."
So what do I do about that?
What's your counsel?
"Hey listen, my counsel is..."
LAUGHTER
"My counsel, if it's going to score you 250 quid, fabulous."
"So, I'm going to go with jizz."
That's why it's Yiddish.
I didn't know you'd taken up the language.
Abe laid it on me.
Abe's a good man.
"You're a good man, Pappy."
Underneath that Louisiana cane syrup plain red dirt.
"Not that different from the pavements of Astoria, where I'm from."
You and me are sticking by Judge Walter Stern.
"Man, thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return."
If there's anything I can do please feel free to call.
- Thank you.
- It's the least we can do.
Good morning.
Where's the mayor?
He had to go Washington on convention business.
This rates an inspector's funeral and that includes the mayor.
The mayor's absence in no way diminishes his concern for Mrs. Santos and her children.
Where'd they get all that stuff from in the newspapers?
At school they tell my girl her daddy was a drug dealer.
We'll get our press people right on it.
What about Internal Affairs?
What are those clowns doing?
Where you going?
- City.
- I thought we were in the city.
Not if you're from Queens.
Let's start over.
Where you going?
Manhattan.
Hop in.
Go fuck yourself.
"Not to be disrespectful but the Transportation Department wasn't prepared for 1,000 people."
I'll talk to you later. 10-4.
10-4 and out.
DUD:
Just give the names of the two suspects.
"Ray Malcolm and Lane ""Pluto"" Franklin."
Give a description of the girl and say the victims were stabbed to death.
How many stab wounds?
"No, don't mention that, or the hog-tying or the pillowcases."
What about the three other victims?
Just say they were strangled.
And what about the kid?
Don't mention the kid.
Just say there was a survivor and that we think the suspects fled the state.
Might get us some national coverage and make it hard for them to travel.
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.
Okay.
Play it up that they're as violent as we've ever seen.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you.
What's the story on this Star City thing?
"Somebody, come on."
Dud?
Would it be a wild goose chase if you went down there?
"We've been lucky so far, and we can tie Ray there."
The police chief in Star City said he didn't know of Ray or Fantasia but he thought he'd heard of the uncle and was going to check them out.
I'm just waiting for his phone call back.
What about an ID on the second suspect?
JOHN:
"They call him ""Pluto."""
His real name is Lane Franklin.

Hi.
"Tell me something, Peter, when did this Mary Goodyear die, exactly?"
- Three weeks ago.
- The same time Barkway invited you to speak at his conference.
"Thank you, and good morning."
And welcome all to our conference on human justice.
Bunking off class?
That isn't like you.
- Going to a rave or something?
"- No, the library."
"- Miss Cramer, please..."
- Let me get this straight.
Barkway has seen that intimidating me personally doesn't work.
So now he's sent his poodle to do the job instead.
"Really, Miss Cramer, I am nobody's poodle."
Where is Bathroom?
"Bathroom is on left, Whose left?"
Yours or mine?
"Your Tamil will take my life, And I am M.A. Munay."

"Please have it, Please!"
Look!
I am not feeling very well and my head is so hot.
Then make your head cool and take coconut.
"Then sit under the coconut tree,"
"Not coconut, why you're saying coconut?"
"You gave my money or I'll take it, Sorry!"
May I have water?
"Jia Jee, someone fire a bullet."
It's not like that you call some guys here to kill me.
"There are nobody, Jiaa, M.M. Munday not enough, not less."
Bubble Gum.
Very much.
"But Munday won't afraid to any bad guy, you just wait here I'll be back."
What the hell?
Where is this Laxminarayan?
It isn't like this that he's here and he's not recognizing you.
Yes.
"It could be,"
"Eat sometime, Excuse me, I need to announce my name"
Laxminarayan!
"Sir, I didn't came here to kill you."
I didn't came here to kill you.
"Sir, trust me, I didn't came to kill."
Then whom you came to kill?
- Dad hated jelly beans.
- He liked the cherry ones.
- He said they taste like cough syrup.
The only candy your father really liked is Almond Joy.
Don't ask me why.
"But get what you want, get what you want."
Not if Dad hated them.
Yael.
What was Dad like before he met Mom?
"He didn't smell as good, but he was the golden boy to my black sheep."
"He did everything right, a mother's dream."
"Hardworking, athletic, ambitious."
"That wasn't getting him laid, so he went through a tortured-artist phase."
- Where are his paintings?
"- No, no, no, not that kind of artist."
A performance artist.
He did weird stuff like paint his whole body silver and stand naked on the war memorial reciting bad poetry.
- Why?
- To get laid.
"It worked, too."
He met your mom when he hired her to dance barefoot in his Feet Me in St. Louis installation.
But he was always broke.
"It wasn't really his true nature, and your mom wanted kids."
"So he took his engineering degree, got a real job, moved to suburbia."
I'm never getting married.
It's death.
You're a little young to have reached that conclusion.
"How come you're not married, Uncle Andy?"
'Cause it's death.
Right here.
Here we go.
So Elaine Roberts' brother owns Green Grass Landscaping?
I am putting you two on it.
As captains?
"Or should I say, crap-tains?"
"Hey, everybody!"
I got spinning wheels for Barbara's carriage.
Now's it's not just her attitude that's gangster.
"Uh... can y'all keep it down, please?"
I'm trying to set up my new wireless headphones.
Gonna make my walkman sound amazing.
This is ridiculous.
"I'm trying to keep things on the down-low, and you three went on the biggest shopping spree since Ellen at a Men's Wearhouse sale."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Wait a minute.
"Han, why are you taller than the counter?"
Just been eating right and getting enough sleep.
"Yeah, something's weird."
You're almost the height of an adult penguin.
Fine!
I treated myself to lifts.
I was sick of being nose to butt with everyone on the subway.
Check out Caroline's Instagram.
Looks like they're in more trouble than I was the last time I tried to put on overalls.
"Ooh, they're on a tugboat filled with toilets, and she writes, ""Help."
"Please send money."""
So... quick unfollow?
Or sleep on it and pow-wow in the morning?
No.
We have to help them.
I lost the cord to these headphones anyway.
"Oh, still got toilet boat legs."
"Ugh, this place reeks of bait."
"Oh, no, wait."
You're a real jerk.
You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe decidedtotakeon a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
but he was already a legend.
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give a doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games.
The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.
The Irishman is here to take you Guineas' money.
Want a drink?
Give me a Seven and Seven.
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Thank you.
Keep them coming.
Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city.
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do what he really loved to do was steal.
He actually enjoyed it.
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in movies.
Give me your wallet.
but we know who you are.
He was one of the city's biggest hijackers shrimp and lobsters.
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter were local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa.
They turned out to be narcs.
Just get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
"Phone taps, surveillance, everything."
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.
"You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a problem all night."

"What, were you guys grocery shopping?"
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?
Is it good?
"Bye-bye, dickhead."
"See you in Attica, dick."
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.
Fuck Jimmy and his money.
"I got to straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead, Karen."
Then you're better off staying in here.
"They could whack me in here as easy as outside, maybe even easier."
They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here.
You got to get me out.
Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.
I remember I had this feeling I would be killed right outside the jail.
"Okay,fine."
"You win, I will die, one day."
But...
"You win, I will die, one day."
But...
Why does it have to be today?

I think this is our cue to exit.
Where do you think you're going?
It's a knockout!
They're falling back.
Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the north.
Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.

"Actually, someone did."

You really are as dumb as those rocks.
Of course we're a couple.
"Bolin, you saved the president."
And you proved Mako was right all along.
We have to go tell him what happened.
Yeah.
"Oh, you meant right now."
- President Raiko...
"- Avatar Korra, what's wrong?"
"Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed."

"Now, these hopefuls are ready to enter"
Chef Ramsay's domain.
They come with confidence.
I'm not nervous at all about any competition.
"Throw a pan at me, and I'm gonna throw a pan back."
And they come with dreams of being the next winner of Hell's Kitchen.
It's done;
it's over with.
They might as well just give me the prize.
"Today, representatives from the media have come for their first glimpse of the group that will contain the next culinary superstar."
"It's not that I'm cocky, but"
Hell's Kitchen's gonna be a piece of cake.
These aspiring chefs think they know what awaits them.
I'm pretty confident that
I'm prepared for anything that Chef Ramsay can throw at me.
But no one is ever really prepared for Hell's Kitchen.
"Right, let's go."
Come over.
"Oh, my God."
I was taken away.
I felt like a celebrity.
"Hello, hi."
This year's chefs come from all over the country.
"I'm from Maui, Hawaii."
"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
"Boston, Massachusetts."
"From many different culinary backgrounds,"
I'm a master cook.
I'm a culinary arts teacher.
Funny.
"Right here, at the Del Rio, $50 is a cheap evening."
"And over here, it's a lot of laundry."
I never get used to New York.
"I don't know why not, it got used to you."
"Darling, since you're the one who did the walking out, why should you be so unfriendly?"
-I don't like revivals.
-And what makes you think this is one?
"We knew each other very well, for a very long time."
"I've been away, and now I'm back."
"Is it so odd that I should want to know how you are, and what you're doing?"
-And that's all?
-And that's all.
Fine.
"I've been working hard, doing nicely, and I'm happy in my marriage."
-She forgave you?
-She forgave me.
And you've been on the wagon since I left.
"If you mean have I been faithful to my wife, yes, I have."
And I don't find it very difficult.
I've always loved my wife.
That shouldn't be news to you.
"Of course, you met me after you were married."
"But then, maybe that wasn't love."
"Whatever it was, it's over."
Maybe it wasn't love.
"Maybe it was only chemistry, or the right combination, or a miracle."
But most people drag through their whole lives without finding it.
"We both know that, don't we, Bran?"
You'd better get back to your Mr. Dawning.
Alec Dawning has other things to offer.
"All that nice, new, shiny money, huh?"
Watch the hands.
The hands tell you everything.
"I stand corrected, and... disturbed."
Okay... what about our cranky friend over there?
"Sum him up for us, Tony."
Cranky car salesman.
Lonely childhood.
Behind on his quota.
Regretting his life choices.
Not a couple.
And not familiar to either of you?
"Geez, Ellie, let it go."
"I'm trying, but..."
he's right there.
"You know, Tony, I don't mean to pin this on NCIS, but Ellie became much more suspicious about people since she joined you guys."
That is so not true.
"Oh, you really like talking bad guys."
"Well, I have to talk about something, since we can't talk shop anymore."
"When we were both at NSA, we'd debrief every night after work-- but now that he's restricted from telling me anything, all I can do is talk about what we do every day."
Chase bad guys.
"So I get where I may seem more suspicious, but..."
I'm not.
"Hey, why don't I get us some coffee."
"Well, there's Dirk, if it's a boy, obviously, or Oskar, with a ""K."""
Oskar Palmer-- that's a lot of R's.
Hmm.
"If it's a girl, we're thinking, uh,"
"Freda, Greta, Liesel-- something sort of Von Trapp-ish."
"Come on, McGee, up and at 'em."
Workday's over.
We're talking baby names and snow angels.
Can't right now.
Hmm?
Do you hate your job or what?
No.
The only job I ever hated was that horrible job as a bag boy at the supermarket.
I'm certainly glad I had the sense to get out of that after about a day.
"You've been listening, haven't you?"
Voices carry.
"Seriously, George, I mean, you've been a teacher all your life."
Do you still enjoy getting up in the morning?
"Oh, Alan..."
"It would be very easy for me to tell you that I have dedicated the last 38 years to several thousand young minds, and that is my chief joy and reason for getting up in the morning."
Except it isn't.
I teach because I like it.
And because it's fun for me.
"Ah, but when it stops being fun?"
"Well, then I suppose I would look to my family and friends for support to help me find something new."
"Well, thank you, George."
You've taught me something.
And it was fun for me.
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
"I mean, who would possibly stop and pick me up in the middle of rural Pennsylvania?"
Whoa!
"Young friend, how far art thou traveling?"
Me?
"Yes, thee."
"Uh, well, I'm going to Philadelphia."
"Well, I'm going as far as..."
That farmhouse there.
That farmhouse there?
Yes.
That farmhouse there.
I see.
It's Eskimo or something.
BELL:
All clear!
No one's home.
It's freezing in here.
Is there a window open somewhere?
"Yeah, in the bedroom."
Otolik's an Inuit name.
The address he registered with the front desk is well north of the Arctic Circle.
So you can imagine he likes things a little chilly.
"His companion, on the other hand, might've preferred things a bit warmer."
His companion?
"Yeah, long brown hair."
Looks like Tendu spent the night in someone's warm embrace.
Before they went out the window.
Hand and shoe prints.
HOLMES:
Male and female.
So I find people rarely exit rooms via windows when they're not fleeing for their lives.
"Perhaps Owen Tuchman's killer paid them a visit, too."
That's one possibility.
The other is that they were worried that someone would catch them with this.
Looks like the murder weapon.
BELL:
"If that's a garden tool, it's not like one I've ever seen."
That is a hakapik.

It's a seal-killing club favored by the Inuits.
"Judging by this inscription, it is a going-away present, a little memento from home."

"We have money, he has nothing"
"I've done it, Om"
This is Jai Batra.
He has designed the fastest car
"Sure, I'm ready for the engine tests"
"Shekhar, Jai here."
I'm returning to India
To pay back what Om owes you.
Sure Jai.
Welcome back To India
"But don't come to return my money, come and save your house"

He was hiding this all along
He thinks his brother is worthless?
He wants to fight it himself?
Why were you hiding this from me?
Om!
You were a father to me!
You were my father
Why did you tear yourself from me?
Ellis wanted me to go back to Wales.
"And you what, you couldn't bear to miss the Blitz?"
I'm sorry.
"Well, at least Parfitt will be relieved."
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but then he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you'd found yourself in a similar position, what with your husband's Spanish War wound and all."
Should I...
Do you want me to come in tomorrow?
"And how would that help, losing you?"
Who the bloody hell else do you think's gonna be writing the slop?
"The work's good, Mrs. Cole."
You're doing a good job.
"Hello, Catrin."
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ellis?
I just saw Perry and Conroy.
You had friends over?
I got a letter.
"A commission to document bomb damage in the provinces, and an exhibition in London straight after."
- The National Gallery.
"Oh, Ellis."
"Will there be Sunday trains, do you think?"
Only I'll need to get back to London on Monday mornings.
- What are you talking about?
- Coming to see you.
"Well, you'll be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course."
After the script is finished.
"Well, you can get out of that now, surely."
But I don't want to get out of it.
"[ Man ] Officer, how can you testify... that Superboy jumped off that bridge when you didn't see him jump?"
"I mean, I'm looking at your statement right here... that you filled out at 0200 hours."
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna object because we went through this.
"[ Lawyer ] Now, he's been up all night."
How many times are you gonna ask the same question?
"Let me ask you another question, brother."
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"
"- What kind of question is that, Lieutenant?"
- Counselor.
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"
- You think those white boys on that bridge--
"- Come on, Lieutenant."
- Please.
I object to this!
"- What do you think this is, Mod Squad?"
- [ Lawyer ] I'm offended by this.
- [ Men Arguing ]
"All right, all right!"
"All right, listen."
"He doesn't tell us what we want to know, he's gonna lose his job."
That's about as simple as I can make it.
He's gonna lose his fuckin'job.
All right?
Do you want that?
What do you take us for?
"A bunch of fuckin' morons, huh?"
- What is the matter with you?
"- With all due respect, I think--"
"- You be quiet, you be quiet!"
Shut up!
- I believe--
-We push!
Good evening Antwerp!
This is gonna be good!
One Direction One Direction!
"Europe has been so crazy because there's a lot of fans who have been there  for you know a year two years, three years."
And they've just waited for us to come.
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"berlin, make some noise!"
"I think we're in the 50s now, Iike 53, maybe 54 out of 1 30-something shows."
So we're nearly halfway there.
You sing.
Sing it.
"Just a natural, really, aren't I?"
"I mean, I don't mess about, that's the main thing for me."
I think the Europe trip so far has just flown by.
When you think about tour rehearsals and everything...
-...it seems such a Iong time ago now.
-I know.
Do you remember when we met at boot camp?
Yeah.
"I just saw you darting around in your beanie every day and just being like, "" Hey, I'm Harry."""
"Those were the days, man."
"NiaII was the loudest person at boot camp, without fail."
"Wherever NiaII was, there was a guitar there was noise and there was loads of people around him."
-He was so popular.
"-Yeah, I remember."
"When we first got together, there was always little clashes."
Yeah.
But there wasn't anything huge.
Do you remember when we went to the coffee shop and Zayn didn't turn up?
-There was a serious conversation.
"""Okay, sounds good,"" and he's gonna go off and do whatever he wants to do."
And you know that.
"So my advice to you is, please, get confirmation on these rumors, and get the truth, and share that truth with Steve."
Because you know and I know that he's not gonna stop until he gets it.
Are you sure it was Sato's men?
I don't know.
It could've been the Triads.
Here's what you need to do.
You need to get yourself out of Hong Kong.
"You got to get to one of Doris's safe houses, okay?"
No.
Kono...
"Look, not without Adam."
You're still a target.
They're not gonna take you off their hit list just because they already have Adam.
"I'm not leaving him, Chin."
"Kono, listen to me!"
What good are you gonna be to Adam if you're dead?
"Look, just get yourself out of Hong Kong, okay?"
Let us worry about getting Adam back.
He gave himself up for me.
He sacrificed himself so I could get away.
We will find him.
I promise.
"Now, please, will you do what I'm asking?"
"Cousin, I love you, but I have to do this."
(sniffles)
STEVE:
"Okay, listen."
HPD canvassed the area where our little car thief found the Impala.
"Unfortunately, there's no traffic cameras down there, so we're never gonna know who dropped it off."
What about you?
He didn't say anything interesting at all.
- Huh.
"- So, after 30 years, my dad finally had a chance to sit across from the man who was running everything."
And you know what he saw?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing special.
My dad realized in that moment he could have been that guy sitting behind that desk.
But he realized it too late.
"We're all just a bunch of guys, Joe."
Some of us believe that we could do anything.
And some of us believe we can't.
"So, when you ask me why I wanna do this, my answer is because I know what guy I wanna be."
What about you?
"( clears throat ) I definitely don't wanna be the guy that just lets the clock run out, you know."
I definitely do not wanna be the guy who just sits there while time fucking stands still.
I wanna be the guy.
- The fucking guy?
- Yeah!
"Yeah, the fucking guy."
Then let's get the fuck out of here.
( chuckles ) Holy shit.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

"Okay, I'm ""fight"" too."
I hit you on the way out.
Do you really not see the problem here?
"Okay, I don't know what it is, okay?"
This is all I know.
It's like I was raised by wolves.
"No, you weren't."
Wolves stay in a pack.
You know what?
"Look, I guess it's fine, it's just, when it comes to emergency situations,"
I'm on my own.
"Come on, that is not true, all right?"
We are a team.
We're like Sonny and Cher.
"Cher left Sonny, and then Sonny died."

"Going out and drinking all night, and doing stuff off daily candy all day."
"I mean, I never thought I'd say this, but..."
I actually miss being alone with my thoughts.
I don't.
We're having so much fun.
"Okay, Lil, I'm tired, all right?"
"I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore."
I think I'm too old to be an alcoholic.
"And I am definitely too old to be grinding teenagers in ""da club."""
"Oh, well, that's okay."
"I mean, there's plenty we can do without drinking."
Can I just say three words to you?
Architectural boat tour.
I'm Marcy Nunley;
I'm the new principal here at Westbridge.
"And I'd especially like to welcome all of our grandparents, our parents and special friends-"
- Hi.
"I know those pancakes are tasty, but this event is really about raising money for our children and our school."
Remember our theme:
"""You can't take it with you, and we'd love to have it."""
I'm really glad you let me come.
"Yeah, me too."
So is this considered our third date?
Because I brought my batting glove.
Your mother looks like she's having a good time.
"No, she's just had so many face lifts, her mouth is stuck that way."
The kids call her the Joker.
I think it upsets her.
How can you tell?
"Oh, hey, look-- it's Christine."
Who's she with?
Is that her dad?
It must be.
"Wow, he's so handsome and well-dressed."
"Oh, she must take after her mother."
"Oh, God, that's good."
"You know, sometimes, I wish I was the funny one and you were the pretty one."
I think those two women are staring at us.
"Ugh, ignore them."
Those are the meanie moms.
They're awful-- all they do is judge everyone and gossip.
Should I step away?
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?
"Because if you'd rather be with one of the other grandfathers,"
I completely understand.
You don't know how pleased we are to meet you.
Without you we'd never have come here.
You'll be much more pleased when you learn about the Ministry of Time.
There are hundreds of doors there that lead to all of the past.

"And the guy in the German hell, covered in shit up to his ears, asks the guy in the Spanish hell how he's doing..."
I don't know what I'm doing telling jokes.
Not knowing what the Nazis are doing with Amelia.
"Continue the joke, I beg you."
The Spaniard says he's living pretty well in the Spanish hell.
"The German, dumbfounded, asks him:"
"""Don't they throw buckets of shit on you?""."
"And the Spaniard says: ""In Spanish hell when there's a bucket, there's no shit, and when there's shit, there's no bucket""."
Well I don't understand.
Fine.
I guess Spain's changed a lot since the 16th century.
"For the worse, as I see it."
It seems that they are here.
Let's go.
Could you shut up for once?
I'm sick of all your blabbering!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy or what?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You should fight better.
"I save lives, I don't take them away."
The first life you have to save is your own.

"Therefore, as a senior council member,"
I declare we can no longer entrust the affairs of our nation to him.
President Choi Eung Chan... will be impeached!
Mr. President...
Congress has agreed on your impeachment.
I couldn't protect you...
I'm Sorry.
It's okay...
"Actually, I feel free."
It should've been sooner.
It had to turn out like this.
What is this?
These people were asked to pass the Private School Reform Bill... and accepted bribes.
Stand them up.
Bring them in.
It has been revealed that these Congressman accepted bribes in exchange for passing the Private School Reform Bill.
Evidence has been found and an investigation is underway.
It looks like he's going to be impeached.
Those punks...
"Well, since they betrayed the citizens..."
"Where are you going, Yoon Sung?"
I'm going to Father.
"Kim Na Na, you're on duty tomorrow, aren't you?"
"Since we're in an emergency situation right now, be prepared for when a decision comes forth."
"Chief, I'm not on duty tomorrow."
You are on duty.
Did you get something wrong?
I'm not.
I wrote on my schedule...
Mr. President's seven-day guarding schedule.
Mr. President...
Hello?
Do you have kids too?
Is your husband unemployed?
Did he mess up while doing business and ask you to bring home money?
What crazy person do you think would marry a beggar like me?
"If it were, would you do that?"
I don't have a husband and most definitely do not have kids.
"I don't have a house, money, or pride, so I'm living with my friend Na Ri."
So what?
"Because of a certain psycho, I got fired from my job, and I will continue to not have money, a house, or a husband."
Is it entertaining?
Is it funny?
Why do I even bother saying these kinds of things to you?
Crazy wench...
-SKYYoonproductionPD.
-Hello?
"-It's me, Yoon PD."
I think you will have to continue working on Sin Joon Young's documentary.
I thought you were switching me out for a different PD.
Sin Joon Young said that he would not film a single scene if you weren't the PD.
He said to cut back on all of the staff except for the production crew.
I think you'll have to come to the company to discuss it.
"You can come now, right?"
Hello?
No PD!
"No PD, are you listening?"
Hello?
"Ah, I'm telling you, it's urgent!"

"Like most people of genius, Mary had a grand theory."
So...
Thank you.
"Mary spent 20 years trying to model plankton population, so that we could work towards re-seeding the deserted areas of the ocean."
You're talking about fish food.
"Plankton can also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, Mr Kingdom."
Re-seed even a fraction of the Pacific and you could stop global warming in its tracks.
- Reverse it.
- Gosh!
Gosh!
That is why Barkway wants to get his hooks into it.
"But, Miss Cramer..."
"Oh, please call me Janet, since you are buying me cakes and everything."
"Janet, all Professor Barkway intends is to publish Mary's research."
Isn't that exactly what she would have wanted?
Don't you think I'm a better judge of that than anyone else?
"So, you're going to publish it yourself?"
"Okay, um, not that I care about this challenge, but it's cheating to wear overalls over a suit."
"No, it's not."
"They're not called ""over-T-shirts,"" Robin."
"They're not called "" over shirtless fat guys who used to come fix my mom's car"
"""and then hang out with her upstairs for a little while."""
No.
"They're called overalls, okay?"
And I can wear them over whatever I want.

- So are we all right?
"- Yeah, we´re fine."
All right.
Let´s do this.
I got the high res on monitor two.
Tony.
Didn´t know I was gonna see you today.
You know what we want.
We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus.
I already told Jack everything I know.
I want you to tell me.
"First Jack, now you."
What does that remind me of?
You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers?
"So, where do we look for Alvers?"
It´s a nice ring.
Who´s the lucky girl?
Hope you did a background check cos you don´t wanna make the same mistake twice.
You´re going back to prison.
There´s a good chance you´ll be executed as a traitor.
"You know if you cooperate you may be able to save your own life, but you´re stalling."
"Which means you know something and think there´s a play you can make, only now´s not the right time."
Very incisive.
I hope your wife appreciates that about you.
Why don´t you tell me about Alvers?
All I know is that he works only with Amador.
I don´t know him personally.
All we´ve been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases.
He had an mri on one of his knees.
There´s a prescription for antibiotics.
Treated for hiv.

- Dunnett.
- Major Dunnett.
It means going a hundred miles into occupied French territory.
"Care to come along, Sharpe?"
- But...
- Good.
"Tomorrow, I go on ahead."
Alone.
"It attracts less attention and gives me a chance to contact my Spanish agents who are searching, too."
"A small special force of Rifles attached to Dunnett's force will travel a day behind, in case I need help."
"That's where you come in, Richard."
Want you to command the sharp shooters
Sir Arthur.
The men you will be commanding must know nothing of this mission in case of capture.
"That is a secret shared between you and your superior officers,"
Major Dunnett and Captain Murray
"Whatever happens, one of you must get through to Casa Antigua."
You'll find them camped about three miles north of here.
They like to live rough.
They expect you at dawn tomorrow.
Give this to Captain Murray.
"Major Dunnett is an officer of the old school, Sharpe."
He may not erm...
He may not approve of my raising an officer from the ranks
"Yes, sir."
He may not erm... mind his manners.
So you must mind yours.
Sir.
"Good luck, Mr Sharpe."

Why did you choose to come by ship?
"The next several weeks will be very difficult for me... and, uh, the middle of the ocean is the only place... where the telephone isn't ringing all the time."
"Mr. Devereaux, do you agree with the recent survey finding... that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world?"

Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein will sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down.
"You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?"
"Yeah, I know Popeye."
- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
"- Hey, look."
If this is the way you're comin' in on this... why don't you stay home and save us all a lot of grief?
- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.

You realize what would happen if our parents found out about this?

I am not Arab!
I am Indian!
"Look, Chief."
"I'm not here to argue seblantics with you, OK?"
I'm here to save lives.
Ask the Lees what they know about their son's terrorist activity.
"Look, we have been American citizens for over 40 years."
"Now, frankly, I find this very offensive."
They're using some sort of dialect I've never heard before.
But I'm pretty sure he said something about going on the offensive.
"Tell them we know what their son is up to... and if they don't cooperate, he could be sentenced to death."
Hit 'em.
Yeah.
We know what he said!
"Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys."
He's supposed to be in medical school.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the... chapter that you have."
on the entities you call...
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
The president was the leader of the sweep mission?
Does this make sense!
?
These are records of Mr. President's political slush funds.
Very detailed.
With these named councilmen here.
In order to pass the Private School Reform Bill.
He even made a certain deal.
This is breaking news.
Run.
Private School Reform Bill results.
For: 228 votes.
Against: 41 votes.
Abstention: 5 votes.
I pronounce that Private School Reform Bill is passed.
It passed.
Finally it's passed!
Are you that happy?
"Of course, I'm happy."
"Agent Kim, you also relied on yourself to study, right?"
Yes...
This is something that should have happened sooner.
Come on in.
Mr. President...
Something big happened.
President Choi Eung Chan's Use of Illegal Campaign Funds Revealed.
President Choi Eung Chan...
"While he was trying to pass the Private School Reform Bill,"
"He caused damaged to the separation of legal, administrative, and judicial powers."
And not only did he shake the foundation of democratic society.
The Sweep Mission in the past as well.
He concealed it and deceived the citizens.
"You can just tell him I was nuts, you know."
Stir-crazy.
Me?
I like a kid with some... with some get-up-and-go to him!
"I like a kid that knows all the answers, all the angles."
"Why, I like a kid that..."
H- how do you get out of here?
"Good luck, Joe."
"Hello, Joe."
I saw you delivering your boy.
Aren't you staying to take him over now?
"You're running out on him, eh?"
Getting big-hearted.
"That touches me, Joe."
I'm going to help you.
Start walking into the alley.
"Well, you've had a nice, long time to think about it, and now it's here, Joe."
Move on.
Now just stand there a minute and I'll give you something else to think about.
"So you're kind of bashful about letting people know he's your boy, are you?"
"Well, I'll do it for you, Joe."
"After I pump you full of this,"
I'm going to drop a little note to every newspaper in town.
Going to tell them about your boy.
Going to tell them what you don't seem so proud of anymore.
That he's Joe Krozac's son.
"All his little pals are going to know it from now on, Joe."
"No, you won't."
"Stay there, Joe, I haven't finished."
"They'll all know it, Joe, everybody."
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
Joe Krozac... subtitles resynched and adapted by cinephage from the TCM cc
"Photographed in Aix-en-Provence, a man I really loved."

"Just like before, the sun through the tree."
"It's not the same tree as before, but it's the same man."
"The same garage in Montfort I'Amaury, close to Ravel's house."
I went on vacation there last year.
"That's done with a light pencil, and that's entirely imagined."
I like to do that...
Didn't you cover the negative?
"No, the negative ends here."
I actually printed this...
Then I prolonged the picture...
"With imaginary lines, on the top and the bottom."
"Then in the middle, all this black part."
All with the light pencil.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
And my two friends?
"No, I don't know them..."
I'm sure you've seen them here before.
"The real version of this picture, is this one."
"""Eric's new boots"""
It's a guy who'd follow me around surprinsingly...
Without any warning...
"Without me wanting him to, in New York."
I didn't like him very much...
He'd come to New York all dressed in white...
With clothes he'd bought for the occasion...
And boots very...
Which he was proud of...
Which must've cost a great deal of money...
He photographed everything in New York.
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?

"Bye-bye, dickhead."
"See you in Attica, dick."
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.
Fuck Jimmy and his money!
"I told you, I gotta straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead."
Then you're better off staying in here.
They could whack me in here as easy as outside.
They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here.
You got to get me out.
Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.
I remember I had this feeling I was gonna get killed right outside the jail.
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me and he's such a hothead.
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was in the drug deals with me Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me."
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"So, now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until things got straightened out."
Fuck!
"Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
"She's got you on the hop already, mate."
Sit down.
"Look, I..."
I know he's young.
(Bangs around in the kitchen)
"But there's something so special, beautiful."
"I-I tried to resist him, believe me."
I-I tried but...
What we have now is extremely honest and good.
You sure I can't tempt you with a burger?
"Uh, no."
"Come on, we've got marty sauce."
No?
I want to find a way to make this work.
I want to protect him emotionally and care for his academic future.
"Sorry, did you say protect him?"
Yes.
You're delusional.
You think I'm delusional?
"From what Finnegan tells me about you, it sounds like you..."
"Oh, listen Fiona, I know I'm a sinner, alright?"
"I know, because despite the enormity of what you're doing with my beautiful boy,"
I would fuck you in a heartbeat if he wasn't coming back in a minute.
Do you really want to turn him into me?
"The best thing you can do for Fuzz right now, believe me, is go downstairs, get in your car, and get driving and keep driving, preferably until you find some sort of elevated landform, and then keep driving a little bit more, OK?"
"Let's go, Fi."
"Fuck, Dad."
Fuzz.
Fuzz.
Mate...
(Dials)
(Phone rings)
You did.
"Bullshit, you could have come to me privately."
- We could've had a conversation.
"- I did it when this thing started,"
- and I'm not doing it again.
- You son of a bitch.
- He's right.
- What?
"Alex is right, you gave him no choice."
"God damn it, Harvey, that prison is doing shady shit."
His client doesn't care because all they care about is money.
And you knew that when you handed it off
- and said you'd live by it.
- This is about you
- coming into a courtroom and...
"- Okay, that's it!"
It's done.

"Donna, you have a minute?"
"Louis, if you're here to berate me for what I said to Stephanie, then, no, I don't."
"Uh, that is not why I'm here."
I came to tell you that I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you weeks ago.
You're gonna have to be a little more specific.
You kept telling me that I wasn't dealing with Tara.
"Well, I finally started, and I think because of that, it allowed me to get past my anger and make peace with Stephanie."
"I'm glad to hear it, Louis."
I'm proud of you.
"Like I said, I wish I had listened to you sooner."

You don't want furs?
I'll take the furs away.
"No, don't take them away, I want them."
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.

"For us, to live any other way was nuts."
"To us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day and worried about bills, were dead."
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
"If we wanted something, we just took it."
"If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."
It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.
"Frankie, what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?"
520 ain't even close to 469.
What he fuck does that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.

"Not only one, but three foxes were found in Seoul's Nam Mountain."
"According to witnesses, these foxes walked around Nam Mountain as if it were their home."
"The Animal Protection Association said those foxes are known to be extinct, and asked special protection and affection from citizens."
The foxes will add another attraction to Nam Mountain's scenery.
I hope they live happily in these parts.
This is Kang Yoo-mi from Nam Mountain.

Hurry or we'll be late!
Okay!

Carry your bag first and go.
Isn't it great to run on two legs?
"Oh, look at your pretty cheeks!"
"Honey, hurry up."
Tell your father not to go around.
He went out again.
It's because he feels stuffy at home.
And tell your brother not to piss everywhere.
"Don't worry, I'll clean up."
"Yeah, like you ever did."
"From today on, don't do somersaults or eat anything like you just did at school."
Why not?
Because you're different from others.
You're a 0.5 breed.

"I mean, you're a good talker, but you're not so"
Summer's right then.
"I have to do, I have to change."
I have to be a better person.
Better how?
"Uh, less selfish."
"More selfless, less take, more give."
"- Less pitching, more catching."
"- Look, man, I'm used to it."
You don't have to change for me.
"- Oh, I'm not changing for you."
"- For who then, Summer?"
"Uh, no, no, uh, uh, I"
- I think for the greater good of man.
"There's no hidden agenda here, like say, getting Summer back?"
"Dude, I don't even want Summer back."
"Unless... that is what she wants, in which case, that's not about me."
"That's about... me supporting her, and her wanting of, of, of me..."

Just admit it... you want her back.
No.

"All right, Mr. Potkin, you've positively identified the Sandover car."
You say it came from the cottage and went past you as you were working on your truck in the dark.
"Nearly ran me down, you mean."
Of course I was parked on the only road out.
Yeah.
You heard the written confession of the defendant's husband introduced earlier by the prosecution in order to clarify their case.
You heard Mr. Sandover's statement that he drove that same car
- out to that same cottage.
You can ask him yourself
But he is blind!
What?
Blind?
He told your fortune in darkness?
I think you should get into your room first

"Master, what should we do?"
Should we hire some more men to help?
In order to eradicate these kind of dregs
Maybe it's good to have some more men
Do you know where the three of them... used to stay?

Swoon.

Question three.
"""Why buy a shovel?"""
-Oops.
-No.Sorry.
"""Why bury a shovel?"""
I have no answer to that.
"But here,how about this one?"
who is darkman?
that is thquestion.
Liam neeson in the 1990 cult classic directed by sam raimi about a mentally unstable scientist who seeks revenge.
"You left out ""who shot rebecca?"""
That was my next question.
Siri claims she was out walking at the time of the shooting.no witnesses.
Gsr tests came back negative.
"Even if siri shot rebecca, I don't think she killed finn."
I saw her face when she saw his body.
"If siri's innocent,she'd assume that rebca's guilty and she'd seek revenge."
Shting someone in broad daylight is just dumb.
"You're not thinking like a jealous woman, ziva."
They're keeping rebecca in the hospital overnight.
"She lost a lot of blood,but the wound was through and through."
Anything on the shooter?
Said she didn't get a good look at her.
How'd she know it was a her?
Rebeccsaid she heard a female voice at the door.
"When she opened it,bang."
Siri?
Maybe.
What did you want him to do?

About what?
I don't know.
About the trouble you caused?
It wasn't my fault.
- You went to the pictures.
"- ""You went to the pictures""."
Neh!
"It didn't mean they had to gang up on him, the Hanlons and all, and shut up about it."

Barnhill.
"Brave, decent Barnhill didn't long survive his rescue by my mother."
"A swarm of Focke Wulf 190s set on him over Dusseldorf, one moonlit night in 1944, and though he fought a long-running battle towards the Channel, he never made it."
"He is buried among the small farmyards, the barns and byres of St Joseph, close to Wormhout in Belgium."
I often wonder what my father knew about that night.
Did he decide to let Barnhill get what was coming to him for his cheek?
"I hope not, but my father was a Moybeg man."
Its darkness may have lain somewhere deep in his DNA.
"Well, perhaps you're not the... best advertisement for skipping a grade."
"So, wait."
You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?
"I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade put too much pressure on you, and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies, and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision about, you know... paint."
Wow!

Yes.
"But look, if you laughed at it, you was laughing at my life, 'cause it was based off of some painful shit."
"I'm gonna be honest with you, it was about me and my ex."
"We're not together no more, know what I mean?"
"But let me tell you something, my parents have been together for 33 years."
And you don't have a 33--
And you do not have 33 years of a relationship without going through little bumps and bruises.
"And if they can't get through the bumps and bruises, forget about 'em."
"Find you somebody that's your ride-or-die, you know what I'm talking about?"
Find you somebody else.

"You know, jim, i'm just crazy enough to go with you, but how are we going to get back across that line?"
"You-all know, folks, i'm on my way to savannah, georgia, to join my regiment, and i'm giving my good english friend here, sir nicholas boyd, safe conduct."
"Ah, yes, of course."
"And i'm buying cotton for dear old england, eh, what?"
You sure is.
"You sure is making me mighty nervous, you sure is."
You-all's price is right with me.
I'll take your whole doggone crop.
"I say, fraser, you better move all this cotton onto the dock immediately and make some bally room for the 200 bales coming in in the morning."
"Perkins, go up to the stonington railroad, tell them to run 20 freight cars onto our dock before 3:00."
We're gonna put a lot of money in the bank today for jim and nick.

"Gee, jim, i'm so happy."
"I can't wait, i've got a bet on with jim."
Tell me-what were the total profits on all that cotton we shipped up here?
"$821,000.46 in gold."
821 thou?
"Why, that's 100,000 more than we expected."
How did you do it?
Luke- you're the eighth wonder of the world.
That's the most conceited statement.
"But if she starts to interrupt, he shrinks her back and puts her away."
I understand.
"What you're saying is, women are made to be loved."
- ls that what I'm saying?
"- lt's a confession that a woman may drive you crazy, but you wouldn't trust her."
"And because you couldn't put her in your pocket, you'd get mix ed up."
I don't understand what does it.
What did it f or Johnny?
"The trouble is, it happened to Johnny but it didn't happen to me."
- At least not as intensely.
- That's what he was af raid of.
I was going with him because he was the nicest person I'd ever met.
And I'm lonely.
You're right about women being made f or love.
But what happens when it never comes the way you want it?
Like music that never reaches a pitch?
"What do you do, go on singing songs and drinking Ramos gin fizzes?"
Yeah I can see why Johnny loved you.
- And why he couldn't reach you.
"- l loved him, Rip."
It's just....
There's some people you feel you can talk to.
"They come along, they sit beside you in your car."
"Only, the f unny thing is, it's never happened bef ore."
- That's crazy to say.
- You're the one that's mix ed up.
- But I'm not mix ed up.
- Get back in my pocket.

I decide who lives and who dies  the city that I will build!
I will create an immortal Rome!
Not even the mighty Olympus will not be able to prevent the birth of this city!
Oh mighty Cesar.
"Now I know, that you are mad."
Mad?
Why?
Because I take what I want without asking?
Because I have everyone executed who hates or betrays me?
I simply wipe away the worms which are attracted by the fetidness of their souls and which they try to hide under their tunicas.
"No Petreius, I'm not mad."
I am free!
I am the only free man in the world!
Yeah.
"Actually, I'm supposed to have drinks"
"With the woman from CNN, and I owe it to her"

Okay.

Absolutely.
Blair.
Hey.
You never made it to my lacrosse game yesterday.
What are you doing?
I could ask you the same question.
Does Serena know you're trying to pull off plaid?
"Seriously, Blair, I expected Chuck"
"To go back to his old habits after your breakup,"
But I'd actually thought you'd grown up a little.
Whatever do you mean?
Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side
Two days in a row?
It pretty much looks like
"You're pretending to be a Columbia student, and not that"
"I care much about what Jenny Humphrey does these days,"
"But I saw that smackdown on ""Gossip Girl."" she was dealing drugs."
It's called an intervention.
"It's called you going back to plotting and conniving,"
"Okay, and that's the Waldorf equivalent"
"Of Chuck going around, sleeping with every call girl in the city"
And avoiding any kind of emotional contact.
Okay.
So I'm pretending to be a student here.
But it's only because I'm living a nightmare.
Did you wipe it off well?
Kim Young Joo's blood too...
You should wipe it off as well.
The one who killed Kim Young Joo was Cheon Jae Man.
Did you know?
You're no different from Cheon Jae Man.
He didn't kill those agents in the special task force himself either.
He merely borrowed the hands of others.
You dare put me in the same category as Cheon Jae Man?
!
The last person to be punished.
Is President Choi Eung Chan.
The cruelest revenge you talked about...
Was it this?
Making me kill my real father by my own hands.
You've had quite a lot of fun these past 28 years.
Taking me away from my mom...
Making me believe someone else is my real father...
"Now, you're telling me to take revenge on my real father?"
That revenge...
I don't think I can do it.
Is it because he is your father by blood?
No.
"After becoming close to him, I saw he was an amazing President."
That amazing President you talk about...
Do you think he really got to that seat cleanly?
Choi Eung Chan...
I look forward to seeing your expression when you find out what he's really like.
Don't look forward to seeing my expression.
Things won't happen the way you want.
What Father wants...
That won't happen.

"It was a murder, believe me."
I know Don Mackay.
You don't.
"It was a murder, believe me."

You don't.
OK.
Are you sure it was a Ford?
OK.
Are you sure it was a Ford?
"Yeah, it had the 4.1 badges on the front mudguard."
"Yeah, it had the 4.1 badges on the front mudguard."

"Director Vance, what a surprise."
"I mean, not like a surprise."
"I mean, I know you have a special interest in this case because y-your family member is involved."
"No, that, that is not what I meant."
I-I am sure that your brother-in-law isn't involved.
"in anything at, at all."
"Ms. Sciuto, just proceed as if this were any other case."
Of course.
"Yes, sir."
So we know that the killer struck Petty Officer Adams hard and fast.
The wound is four inches in length and five inches in depth.
"The knife was stuck in once, to the abdomen."
The killer thrust it in deep and then tilted it up and pulled it out.
What's the weapon?
A five-inch boning knife like this one here.
It's the favorite of avid fishermen everywhere.
"The wound pattern matches the blade's design, but that's not all that matches."
The only prints on the body belong to none other than...
Petty Officer Brian Smith.
You have your guy.
"That's a good thing, right?"
"Hey, DiNozzo, search Petty Officer Smith's belongings."
Weapon's a fishing knife.
I want Michael released into my custody.
"Need to keep him close, Leon."
I'm taking him home tonight.
"Hey, Dad."
"All right, kids, that's enough of that for now."
Somebody here wants to say hello.
Hey.
Uncle Michael!
"What's up, man?"
But this one little thing will break Nitu's heart
"Nitu is mature, she'll understand."
"Try and understand, Om"
"Jagadish, tell Ma to go home and prepare for the reception"
Take Nitu home in our car.
That car...?
Brother!
Your turn now
"Your brother-in-law-cum-chauffeur at your service, dear sister-in-law"
Drive carefully.
- I'll try
Move it!
Batra family on the move
Stalling...
Let's take a look
"Jagadish, take a look"
Can't make out a thing
Here's hoping it isn't clogged dirt.
Come on... put to the real test your five years of American education.
Get going
"Nitu, stay inside."
It won't look too nice
What about fixing a junk car on your wedding day?
Does that look nice?
My Ma had another car waiting didn't she?
"Oh come on, it's okay."
- No it isn't okay Jai
"Sister-in-law, Jai is jacked"
Never expected you to be up so early
But I am an early-riser
"Early to bed, then early to rise"
And the dark circles under his eyes tell us he hasn't slept all night
"You have to be careful what you say around a coma patient, Mrs. Farrell."
A lot of times they can still hear what's going on around them.
"Listen, kid, if he knew he was dying and we weren't taking action, he'd be pissed."
"Besides, I bought him a few squares in case he comes out 'cause he gave me my Johnny."
And nothing else.
"Your dad's hospital room is really nice, Johnny."
"Yeah, they're taking really good care of him."
How much does a room like that cost?
"I don't know, he's got good insurance through the fire department, so it's pretty much covered."
"Good, good."
"Ball park, what do you think it normally costs?"
"Like, a night?"
"Six, seven?"
600 or 700?
Wow.
"6,000 or 7,000, Brian."
Shut up.
Shut up!
That room was so tiny.
Whoever set those prices is a criminal and deserves to spend the rest of their life in that miserable little room.
"I mean, did you see the view?"
Of course you didn't.
Because there wasn't one.
"Chicago North, ambulance needed, Lincoln Park carousel."
Reported leg injury.
Ambulance 14 responding.
And did you taste the jell-o?
'Cause I did.
I was not impressed.
You took my dad's jell-o?
"Well, it looks like you got a broken fibula, but we won't know until we get some x-rays."
"Wow, that music just goes on and on, huh?"
It's completely isolated.
"He can beat, torture, or burn somebody, and nobody would hear it."
I never thought the FBI would be here for our fine city's tradition.
I'm Al Garner with the DFD.
Agents Morgan and Prentiss.
"I guess Devil's Night keeps you pretty busy, huh?"
Not as much as it did in the '80s.
"Used to get up to 600, 700 fires back then."
- In three days?
- Down to 115 last year.
It still takes everything we got.
"Fortunately, we've had some help."
Have the police increased their patrols in the Rivertown district?
"I wish they could, but the city's reeling from budget cuts."
No.
Detroit's Finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.
[Door opens]
[Prentiss] A thousand volunteers?
"[Morgan] Well, that just added another thousand names to Garcia's list."
- Do you think he's one of them?
- Can't rule anyone out.
What is this place?
It's an old engine factory.
It's massive.
Medieval.
"And from the Industrial Age, when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs than anyplace else in the world."
This is where we found Tony's charred remains.
"Well, the char pattern tracks back to here."
That's where he stood when he started the fire.
It's not the best vantage point.
There's your escape exit.
"Yeah, except he didn't want that."
"You know, instead of adding someone... maybe you should think about weeding out a few."
Like you and you and... you.
- I'm your son.
- I can't play favorites.
"You know, if you're looking for a new friend, how about Lance Crawford?"
He's such a nice boy.
"Mom, Lance Crawford and I hate each other."
You're just obsessed with getting his mother's peach cobbler recipe.
"Well, what kind of a woman keeps a recipe a secret?"
"If that recipe were the polio vaccine, we'd all be in wheelchairs!"
I don't like Lance Crawford.
He's always staring at me in this really creepy way.
"And this one time, I saw him fiddling around in my locker."
"When I opened it, there was a rose inside, and my gym socks were missing."
"Donna, a little advice."
You're not gonna want those socks back.
I can't think of anyone new I wanna hang out with.
All the girls I know are either too snobby or too slutty.
"Yeah, I'm not good with the snobs, but slutty's my bread and butter."
"You know, what we need are people with stuff to offer, like Mark Herman."
He's got that dirt bike.
I always liked him.
- Sold it last week.
- That punk.
He's out.
"Hey, Carrie Gerber has a trampoline."
"Carrie Gerber also has a big, hairy mole."
I don't wanna be bouncing around and get tangled up in that.
Eric.
Eric.
"Honey, there's someone here to see you."
"Mom, if it's another one of Dad's Marine Corps recruiters, I'm gonna run away."
"You know, I find that the most amazing creatures have furry behinds."
"Sitting in Woolsey Nicholls ' office, discussing the furry behinds of bees  Chuck realized this was her very first job interview ever."
"She considered this fact for a moment, then had to ask:"
"I have to ask, are you the Woolsey Nicholls from Bzzzzzzzzz!"
Honey and More?
Mm.
"Yes, I am."
Why are you here?
Isn't Betty's Bees your biggest rival?
I own Betty's Bees now.
We made the acquisition very quietly.
"These days, merger can send brand loyalists into a tizzy."
"Well, I'm a honey loyalist, and you'll get no tizzy from me."
I just hope you're not killing Bee-Girls.
- I beg your pardon?
- The Bee-Girl sales division.
"With any acquisition, there's always downsizing and restructuring."
I hope it doesn't affect the Bee-Girls.
The Bee-Girls will always have a home in my hive.
"Unfortunately, although fortunate for you we've recently had an opening in the Bee-Girl division."
"Oh, yeah, I heard about that."
Kentucky Fitz?
Something about a honey-harvesting tragedy?
Yes.
It's very sad.
She had a bright future here at the new Betty's Bees.
Yeah.
I also heard that she was thinking of leaving Betty's Bees before she died.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
"- Well, you sure hear a lot of things."
- Very gossipy office.
Yes.
"Hey, Alice."
"- Hiya, Ed."
"-Well, is, uh... loveable big stuff home yet?"
(chuckles)
"Yes, he's inside washing up."
"Ed, do you realize they have another emergency meeting tonight at the lodge?"
That's the fourth emergency meeting in this past week.
I'm beginning to think those emergency meetings are nothing but a poker game.
"Oh, wait a minute, Alice."
Wait a minute.
I'm surprised that you even think anything like that.
An emergency meeting is an emergency meeting.
Never a poker game.
An executive meeting-- that's a poker game.
Will you tell your lodge brother for me that I'm up at Mrs. Manicotti's?
I will do.
Hey there.
"What say, Ralph?"
Mmm!
Alice told me to tell you she's up at Mrs. Manicotti's.
Mmm!
"Boy, this is delicious."
"Norton... if I ever ran into you when you weren't eating,"
I don't think I'd know you.
"What kills me is you eat and you eat and you eat, and you don't even gain a pound."
"I guess my nature, my basic metabolism or something, I don't know."
"As long as I can remember,"
I've weighed exactly what I weigh now-- 165 pounds.
"As-as far back as I remember, 165."
"Gee, I remember when I used to weigh 165."
Did you ever see a picture of me when I weighed 165 pounds?
"No, Ralph, I never did see any of your baby pictures."
And also a woman's hand is healing
You are not from here
Yes
I come from so far away
Then welcome my Paşa
I have got your cure
You are very strong
Will you stay a while?
I'd like to see you all the time my Paşa
"You never loved me, did you Victoria?"
"İbrahim, come here"
Are you okay?
Give your hand to me
Can you feel it?
Our son is very naughty
He turned again
Our son...
Don't condition yourself that it will be a son.
If it won't be a son you would be very sad
I did something when you were not here
What is it ?
I was weak when you were not here
I couldn't stand it
I met with astrologer Yakup Efendi
Why did you meet that faker?
He said that we will have a golden haired son
Golden haired...
Yes
I was relieved to hear that
Good then
But he said me one more thing
That there's a shadow that follows us
No.
"It was so Dr. Cicchirini, I do not know..."
"I already am in charge, yes, yes."
I already am in charge.
"Good night, Mr. Benito, where he has gone of party tonight?"
"To where she wants that she goes, lady?"
"That way, with the friendly."
"Ah, I know very well the youth of nowadays."
"Friendly, friendly, small orgy..."
"It hears, by the one of the rent, still I am waiting for the heel of my aunt."
She is really his aunt?
Because the handsome boys always find some arranged to pay by them.
My aunt has 70 years and it pays for the studies to me until the Medicine doctorate ever since a doctor discovered that he suffers 14 diseases and it makes happy giving a pile him of medecines.
I know it.
Already there is it to me counted.
"But although not outside her aunt, would not be anything bad."
Because a true woman knows to give itself and in the bed it is not like the children of nowadays.
I in the bed give everything it.
One is bad?
The belly hurts much to me.
-It wants that it does a massage to him?
-No. no.
"Hungry of love, it was observing to me..."
-Who is?
-I am Italia.
Step inside.
"Professor, is everything to point for the operation."
"Italy, Italia."
"They see this, see here."
Closer.
Professor the operation.
"They see, Italia, Country of saints and poets..."
"Just kidding, just kidding."
"The kid is sick, and a child's life will never come back once it's gone."
Child?
Whose child?
His child.
What about his wife?
She's not well and can't work.
Is that why you have to work as a stripper?
I can't understand how he could make you work for his child like that.
It's not for him.
I want to do it.
"People are going on and on about ""freedom"" these days, but I think I should have the freedom to give up my freedom to someone else."
Tomoko?
Good morning.
I was wondering where you were.
told me.
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything for you.
This is for you.
"Sensei, I can't take that."
"Ah, I hear Pertolucci."
I think Shinako is dancing.
It must be because I was talking about some really unpleasant things last night.
"Sensei, I'm going to dance my last ballet."
What an irritating racket for so early in the morning!
Is Shinako dancing?
"Yes, with Tomoko."
"Did you know that while you're dancing to Pertolucci, this is the anniversary of Nijinsky's death?"
"Yes, he died in a hospital in London last spring."
He went crazy and died.
You could say that he was a victim of the war.
"When he started to lose it, he was talking about ""Russia"" and ""War""."
"Well, Nijinsky was a pacifist, a follower of Tolstoy."
I have to talk to you.
I'm in trouble.
My wife arrives tomorrow.
Aren't you happy?
"Sure, but I lied to her about my Iife here."
"I tried to tell herthe truth, but she didn't believe me, so I let herbeIieve what she wanted."
I told herit's awful here.
"The more she thinks I'm suffering, the nicer she treats me, ourreIationship has improved and she's better."
I'm not sure I got it.
She's betterif you're worse?
"It sounds strange, but that's it."
What did you tell her?
.
I didn't get that.
"Stereotypes, more orless."
Untrue things they say up North.
Like you're somewhat basic.
"SimpIetons, dull, that you gesture, you can't be understood, you're a bit vulgar."
"Maybe I used the terms dirty, violent, shitkickers."
- Shitkickers?
- I did it forIove.
ForherI was a hero facing life courageously.
Don't abandon me.
I didn't even want to come here.
I was sent because I faked being handicapped!
"My friends, I did it forher!"
"His book is on the night table, he's at page 11, he has to reach page 26, then he can sleep."
He has to brush his teeth for at Ieast one minute.
"That's the humidifier, and not too much perfume, it dries the boy's mucous membranes, he'II lose his sense of smell, as an adult he won't smell a gas leak."
I'II go get the bag of medicines.
"Mommy, I'm scared of Grandma and Grandpa!"
What's this smell?
"- Well, she hasn't."
"The guidance system malfunctioned at the point of re-entry, so instead of the Atlantic Ocean,"
- she may well be in this area.
- (MARSH):
Are you sure?
The American consulate in Nagoro just radioed me.
I've been out alerting all the village chiefs.
"Well, having been on a lunar orbit,"
"I'd say that at this moment,"
Sally is the world's most valuable chimp.
(SCREECHES)
"As soon as she's found, she has to be given a very complete examination."
"Now, the American consulate in Nagoro is sending out a truck with a military and scientific attaché, but they don't know the area as well as we do."
"Poor thing, she might've been injured in the landing."
Or what about possible attack by another animal in the bush?
"Uh, she has to be in an exhausted condition, so wherever she is she's in serious jeopardy."
"Mike, get me a dart rifle from the truck."
- Mmm.
"- Hedley, I'll go with you."
- Good.
"- Jack, you and Mike take a look down by the river."
"And, Paula, you stick right here by the radio."
(JUDY CHATTERING)
"Look, Judy, come on now."
This is no time for fun and games.
Come on.
Get over there.
"Go on, scoot."
(ENGINE STARTS)
(SCREECHING)
"Come on, Judy, we have work to do."
You heard the Daktari.
I said ifs not Zaer Kheder's order
You will go neither to Zaer Kheder nor to Tangak_ That's it!
"So, sorry to disturb you, Bashirou's mommy."
- It's early to leave.
"- I leave, I have something to do."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye
- Don't bother yourself.
- Please.
"It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
What did you say?
"- It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
- Don't talk nonsense.
Did you look at yourself?
"They forced your father to drive out of Tangak, they did it to me."
"What the hell are you going to do there, as a baby boy?"
You are a little boy.
Are you such a man to go to Tangak?
So?
Donkey work!
"Pottering, minor works and difficulties are for mine and playing Ketfledrum for the others'."
Just you tell me is it fair?
"Bashirou, tell me definitely how much?"
"- Playing Kettledrum, definitely."
"- No, ifs not the way."
From morning to dawn.
You are headstrong like your father
"Obstinate, dogged, inflexible, tough."
"If I wasn't headstrong, how could I play Kettledrum till dawn?"
Ashoura is perennial; ifs not going to be finished this year.
"Next year, God willing."
"Don't say God willing, Zaer or say it in the way means ""yes""."
The vice president is scheduled to preside over a Senate vote today on President Sawyer's controversial Middle East peace plan.
"Then tomorrow, the vote will go to Congress."
Republicans and Democrats have indicated they will vote along party lines but some members have indicated that they may cross over.
"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.
Carol.
He wants to do the thing.
- Really?
- Really.
"Mr. President, it isn't a good idea to deviate from the flight plan."
"Pretty please, Carol?"
"Leader of the free world saying ""pretty please""?"
That ought to count for something.
"Captain Johns, we are going to deviate from Route Omaha."
The president would like to do the thing.
Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.
Dropping to 30 feet.
Do you know that Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president who was in favour of women having the vote?
He wrote a paper on suffrage while he was still in the Illinois legislature.
"Yes, I did know that because you tell me every time we do this."
"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
"We are short Foxtrot, one minute out."
- I need a go-no go.
"- Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground all clear, three inbound."
"Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report."
"Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground."
You are clear.
Scanning sky south.
Clear.
This way!
Follow me!
Follow me!
Enormous explosion over toward the West Wing.
I don't know if this means the president has been killed.
We know..
I got 100 people in here!
Somebody tell me something!
You idiot.
What'd you say?
You are an idiot.
You just blew our whole mission.
Your mission.
Shut up.
"Mr. Stenz, this may be your lucky day."
Get your men back to the basement.
"I, Alvin Hammond, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute.."
the office of president of the United States..
"and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend.."
"the Constitution of the United States, so help me God."
"Sir, follow me, please."
"Place your hand there for scanning, please."
"Sir, these are your presidential launch codes."
Keep them on your person at all times.
Vice President Alvin Hammond has just been sworn in..
as the 47th president of the United States..
"confirming, of course, the worst possible scenario.."
the death of President James Sawyer.
People all over the globe have been holding their breath.
They're wondering what is happening right here in America.
"After all, the United States has the biggest weapons arsenal in the world."
We need to start moving the money.
"""he lived with the pineapples..."
"""and he will soon die as an American..."
"""leaving me this vast farm."
"""He tells me that he wishes to see you..."
"""his younger sister, before he dies."
"""Please come and see my father."
"""Sincerely yours, Clark. """
It's touching!
It sure is.
"Say, Grandma, let's go to Hawaii."
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.
"But still, this is all so strange."
It could be some kind of mistake.
Cut it out now!
"Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire... it's possible it could be a swindler claiming to be your brother."
But I bet there is no one fool enough... to bother lying about being a brother of poor Grandma.
"In the first place, these people are rich!"
Suzujiro Haruno.
"Surely, my maiden name is Haruno... but I can't remember the name Suzujiro."
"After all, I was born in a poor family that was blessed only with children."
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.
More than ten?
"Besides that, this man is an American, isn't he?"
- How could he be my big brother?
- It was written in the letter.
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant and became naturalized.
Although he has American citizenship...
Grandma's brother is still Grandma's brother.
This guy Suzujiro must be Grandma's elder brother.
Right.
"Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?"
"I hope you appreciate this moment, lieutenant."
"You see, I am a cavalry man."
All the von Scherbachs were cavalry men.
"Well, you know what happened to the cavalry."
"Just give me 5 minutes on that couch, will you?"
Five minutes.
The young ones they put into the panzer divisions.
"The older ones, they put in the quartermaster corps or made them recruiting officers, or wardens, like me."
Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.
"In Berlin, they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists."
But they will remember now.
Berlin?
General von Pfeffinger?
"Oberst von Scherbach, Stalag 17."
"Jawohl, Herr General."
Name:
"Dunbar, Leutenant Dunbar."
Sabotage.
"Jawohl, Herr General."
"Well, there will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin."
You will be interrogated by the general staff.
When it comes to the part about your arrest I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I just want to sleep.
I haven't slept in three days.
You will remember the name.
"Scherbach, von Scherbach."
"Well, Herr Inspektor, how did you find the camp'?"
"Crowded, but gemutlich, shall we say?"
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar.
- Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
-It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
"Up till last night, they only hit empty houses."
"But when they stumbled across Colin's girlfriend, they beat her unconscious."
Now you're just trying to scare me.
Can you help me out?
Take another look at this sketch for me.
"You should ask my friend, Vicki."
She had some stuff taken a few months ago.
"I never reported it, but they took a bracelet, three rings and my GFGD shirt."
Thank you.
Is that a band?
Fashion.
It's one of a kind.
A gift from a designer.
Vagabond chic.
"Retail, how much is that worth?"
"2000, maybe."
So when exactly were the items stolen?
March 9th.
It was Chelsea's birthday.
We got kicked out of Mondrian.
"Then she threw a drink at her ex at Avalon, the ridiculous one with the reality show, K.K."
"When I got home, I was packing for London to go visit my parents when I realized the shirt was gone."
Why didn't you report it then?
"Well, I was going to London."
Do you realize there's probably a dozen more Vickis out there who don't even know they've been ripped off?
Burglary's still burglary and Miranda's not Vicki.
"So how do you fence a $2000, one-of-a-kind T-shirt?"
First you got to find somebody willing to wear it.
"But if you do, they're gonna want to wear it where they can be noticed."
I'm thinking this T-shirt needs its own Facebook page.
Yes.
Have you seen me?
I couldn't sleep myself.
"Sir Charles, I know it's strange to find Beatrix here but I want you to believe..."
"All I can believe is that your ideas are not normal, Jekyll, not fit..."
"Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix to come here tonight because..."
"No, Harry."
"Father, I know my being here is difficult to understand, but I'm not ashamed."
"Then, my dear, I shall be for you, because I do understand."
We leave for the Continent tomorrow on the boat train.
"Father, please."
"Oh, come, Sir Charles."
"After all, you could eliminate all this difficulty if you'd set an early date for our marriage."
You don't understand.
We're very much in love.
We wanna be together.
- We don't wanna wait any longer.
"- Please, Father."
"In view of what's happened, the engagement should be broken off."
"However, I'll be lenient."
We shall see you on our return.
"Come, my dear."
"Father, I've never disobeyed you in my life."
"But, Harry, if you don't want me to leave I'll refuse."
- Beatrix.
"- I mean it, Father."
"I don't want you to go, Bea and I can't agree with your father's decision, but I know he's thinking of your happiness."
I can't argue against that and I can't ask you to.
"- That's highly commendable, Harry."
Will you see us off at the train?
Better have two engines.
I might try to hold it back.
Try.
Try anyway.
You guys are harassing me because of Facebook?
That T-shirt has 3400 friends and six people posted pictures of you wearing it tonight.
Apparently it's one of a kind.
From like a three-year-old collection.
"I got it from this Asian girl, Kai, I'd seen around the clubs."
She was at that place on Sunset Plaza next to Chin Chin.
She had these shopping bags full of clothes.
I just really wanted it.
Chelsea-Colin photos have hit the Web.
"""Robbery Love Triangle."""
I ran DMV for Asian girls named Kai in the right age and weight range.
Our girl in the stolen T-shirt picked this one.
Kai Ng.
Hmm.
Say our crew flagged Colin and Chelsea at The Edison.
"Stands to reason if Kai was one of the burglars, she'd be at The Edison too."
Sounds like we should talk to the guy that took that photo.
I shoot HD video.
It's revolutionary.
"I sell stills, video, I get it all, I miss nothing."
There.
There's your girl.
Nice-looking blonde.
Part of the gang?
Show him the sketch.
What about this guy?
You ever see him?
Sure.
I know ten boys look just like him.
"Come with me to Mother Lode, I'll find you 20."
"What about this, what if we gave you a list of the other victims, could you see if you have footage of any of them on the nights their homes were robbed?"
You would give me a first dibs call on future break-ins?
"This is Captain Malaparte, our liason with the Italians."
We'll see...
"I hope to be useful to your mission, Coronel Wyatt."
General Cork has briefed me.
"General Cork has directed Captain Malaparte... to help you, Mrs. Wyatt."
"Obviously, you'll have to cooperate with the population... and Malaparte will be very useful."
He has a fabulous villa in Capri.
So what do you do in peace time?
I was far too young to remember.
"He was in Spain before that, and before that, Ethiopia."
He should have gone to the US.
Our Italians are pretty well off.
"You're right, but there were already enough organ players."
"Are you making fun of me, Captain?"
"No, on the contrary, I admire your assurance."
You're everything we're not.
You think so?
Get away from me.
I said leave me alone.
- Don't touch me.
- Keep away!
"- Come on, let's go, come on!"
"- Out, come on, let's go!"
"I'd like to help with your Moroccan troops, General, but I'm afraid I can't."
"But my dear General, this is an unprecedented shame!"
"Incredible, a scandal!"
"My men are, how shall I say, hypersexuall."
"Yes, they were born that way."
"They'll stick it in anything... in a sunflower, to be precise."
A sunflower is enough for them.
"The point is, General, that depriving my troops of penicillin... is a crime!"
Syphilis is destroying their...
She's so cute
Miyu... must be amazing to have a girlfriend like her
"No, we need to take her back"
Taking her back to where?
Back to her hometown obviously
I wanna go home too
So give me some train money
"Come on, please"
Come on
I still don't get it
Why'd we have to pay money to that guy?
We should have bought that BL book
"Those guys only have 5, no 3 years left"
Their lives are peaking right now
Grandpa said that people who are nasty will always fail at life
It was just two guys.
"We have two guys too, you know?"
I don't know...
Bebi... ..you're a grown man
Sorry
I've always been like this
I was bullied a lot too by guys like that
But even at this age...
I'm so sorry
Bebi it's ok.
They looked even stronger than Big Sis
"Their smirks were weirder than Big Sis's and they're a lot bigger than her, too"
"They had bigger boobs than her, too"
Hey there
Thanks
It just irritates me.
"Not only them, but with myself"
"If Atlantis was real, it would mean rewriting the history books."
"I thought that was an archaeologist's job, to rewrite history."
I guess some people are frightened of change.
Yes?
MacGyver and Miss Carson have arrived.
They're about to open the Ark.
Good.
You know what to do.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
The words on the medallion and the Ark are identical.
Coincidence.
You can't expect us to believe these two artifacts are in any way connected.
"""The gods march in rank,"
"""and Hecate races in the heavens."
"""Enter the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages--"""
"""And the Treasure of Atlantis shall rise."""
"I've seen this riddle in the caves at Exeter, carved on an altar by the Cult of Solon."
So the gods are these figures on the side here?
Yes.
"Hermes, Aphrodite, Gaea, Selene,"
"Ares, Zeus and Cronus."
"This little guy on top, um, how do you pronounce it?"
Hecate.
Demon of the night.
"According to ancient legend, she was an omen of disaster and death."
I'm convinced that these are really instructions written by Solon to help find the Treasure of Atlantis.
Addle-minded bunk.
"The legend of Atlantis is just that, a legend."
I can prove it existed.
- Okay.
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah.
"- You know, sometimes, if you just press on the temple--"
"You have a headache, don't you?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
"- Look, 'cause, like, your whole face is full of strawberries."
"You're sensitive, aren't you?"
Redheads are sensitive.
"- Yeah, I guess so."
- When's your birthday?
Are you a Virgo?
- Yeah.
"- I knew it, I knew it, see."
"I do just a little bit of palm reading and can do horoscopes, charts."
This woman taught me.
- Who taught you?
"- Yeah, she was a pill-popping, you know, astrologer, but she taught me how to read charts."
"It's fascinating, so I'm really good--"
Iâm really good with people.
I'm really great with strangers.
- So where did you work besides Chicago and Greece?
"- Oh, gosh, I worked in Vancouver for a while at this place called the Golfin' Dolphin, but they didn't have alcohol, but I served drinks, but it was just, like, you know,"
"water mixed with, like, flavored juice."
"I didn't work there long, but that was in Vancouver and that was a lot of fun."
"And then I worked in Iowa for a while and then Washington, D.C."
and then I worked in
"South Carolina, Charleston."
- Where are you from?
"- Are you-- Originally, Iâm from North Carolina."
"Raleigh, the capital."
You been there?
I'm sorry.
I thought this office was vacant.
I'm Kitty Pimms.
I've just been hired.
- By whom?
- Woolsey Nicholls.
Woolsey?
So you're replacing Kentucky?
A little soon after her death.
"Seems distasteful, don't you think?"
"It does, but it also speaks to the efficiency of your Human Resources department."
- Mm-hm.
I wonder how else you'll be replacing Kentucky.
Since I'm a withered hag tattered by every grain in the hourglass Betty's Bees still needs a fresh face.
"And after what happened, well no one wants to think about that when they're buying lip balm."
Welcome to Betty's Bees.
Kentucky's affairs were clearly a bee in Betty Bee's bonnet.
"Oh, I just wanted to say what an honor it is to be working with you..."
Thank you.
Get out.
And so Chuck got out.
But the question remained:
Betty Bee:
Coconspirator or killer?
"Kentucky was the new face of Betty's, which does give Betty motive."
Being replaced by better-looking always gives you motive.
"But Kentucky was sabotaging Betty's Bees, trademark which was owned by Woolsey, which gives Woolsey motive."
Woolsey's a businessman.
"Somebody sabotage him he'd send in a swarm of lawyers, not bees."
I know.
They were lovers of the same-sex persuasion and the key is for their love nest.

So do I.
I hope we can preserve it without any more Shilohs.
"They say the slaughter was so fierce on both sides, you could walk across the field on dead bodies like stepping stones."
"How would you like to put a stop to that, Pittenger?"
"Could we, with what we're doing?"
Maybe we can.
"[Pittenger] We managed to be on the Friday train, headed south."
"So far, we were lucky."

"They won't go a penny higher than $1,500,000."
It's downright sinful.
Let's draw up a contract.

"Now, not too many people realise this but the White House is actually three buildings:"
"The East Wing where you guys came in the West Wing, which houses the Oval and Executive Offices and we're about to enter the residence, which is the famous building that..."
-...got blown up in Independence Day.
- What's in there?
That's the president's home theatre.
Membership has its privileges.
"Right this way through the double doors, please."
There's still lots more to see.
You got a visitor.
Hey.
- Could you stay with the tour?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
The White House is big.
"Including below-ground levels, it's six storeys tall with 132 rooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces and 35 bathrooms."
"The grounds contain a tennis court, a basketball court a putting green, a jogging track and a swimming pool."
- And where's the PEOC?
- The what?
"She's referring to the Presidential Emergency Operations Centre which is this really cool bunker behind 10 feet of concrete and steel that's capable of surviving a nuclear blast, plus for your information, miss, it's the one room in the house that no one knows the location of."

"Who wants to see the bowling alley, huh?"
"- Oh, my God."

Here´s the situation.
We believe Michael Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus.
We believe he is headed to Los Angeles or is here already.
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen to take out a major metropolitan area.
"Our only lead is Nina Myers, who´s being brought back to CTU right now."
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers.
Adam´s done a workup on him.
"We have some background, but nothing places him definitively in Los Angeles today."
That´s it?
What about Interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?
"Our data tracking´s a little behind, so we weren´t able to access that report."
Why are we behind?
We didn´t update the European contact logs while I was down.
"- Michelle, you were the ranking agent."
- l didn´t think Europe was a priority.
- Obviously it was.
- There was a lot going on at the time.
All right.
Let´s get back to work.
"Let´s try to ease up on the mistakes, as there are millions of lives depending on us."
Michelle.
- (knocking)
- Come.
I just got off with CTU.
- What´s the status on the virus?
- lt´s not good.
The limited intelligence they have supports their suspicion.
- lt´s on its way to Los Angeles?
"- David, it may already be here."
We should prepare in case they target other cities.
Our people in the security envelope have been alerted. lt´s being handled.
T urned away and ran.
I followed him
"He kept on running, and I kept on chasing"
T o where?
I was after him for more than a mile
Then he got on a horse and went east
And you lost him?
"Y es, it's all true"
Every word is so true!
Boss!
The one you met at the pharmacy is Fan San
He's one of the Three Devils.
Very bad tempered
Very skillful with his duel blades
His way of sword is mean and nasty!
"The second one is Zhou Sanzhao, a womanizer"
Very good with dart and secret weapons
Never misses a target!
The leader of the three is Y an Qingwang

You've broken my Master's rib bones
Is it true?
You can ask him yourself
According to my Master's way of boxing
There're 3 stances that can protect the chest
How did you break his rib bones?
Which three stances?
"It is his Majesty's order, in person"
"My Sultana, a seal is needed on here too"
And one more here to have the subvention
Thank you
I bored you
This is good Daye
Mahidevran is cheerful
She's getting the reward of her tranquility

If it is not a good time...
"No, I'm available, come"
We'll go on later Daye.
Take these away
Is something wrong?
I met Hatice Sultana today
She's all fine
I wanted to tell it to you
Thank you for your care
"Actually, the icons worries her"
You know there'd be many gossips
What icons?
What are you talking about?
Haven't you heard?
İbrahim Paşa brought 3 icons from Buda
They are human shaped
Also they are half naked
You'd think they are real
They are all set up in the yard
"Your Majesty, you called me"
Are you taking care of the hunting lodge?
I visited the hunting lodge today
I selected a Spanish speaking concubine with İbrahim Paşa's order
"To the people in The Dark Knight shooting, my heart goes out to them."
"Anybody that's lost their life to gun violence or any artillery, my heart goes out to them."
It's not a good thing.
But I be thinking... about that Dark Knight thing.
"And, uh, there couldn't have been no hood Black people there, right?"
"'Cause they would've had they guns ready, right?"

"""Oh, my God!"
"""Why do people do such things?"
"Oh, my God!"""
This is my impression of a concerned white woman.
"""Oh, my God!"
"""Why do people do such things?"
"Oh, my God, Karen!"""
It's always a Karen.
"""Oh, my God, Karen!"""
"Yo, I learned something."
"You want to go to a white people's party, say you know Karen."
They will take care of your ass the whole day.
"""You know Karen?"
"""Well, come on, sit down."
"Have a pumpkin spice latte."""
"Now, I'm gonna tell you why these bad things happen."
"But you said, that you will get from me and sale it with 5°/° commision oh God, i was talking about the design which you were about to show me."
Which design?
The red one.
That's car's photo.
Then why you are showing inside space from outside?
"That means you are not the Laxmi N., who was coming to get car?"
"No... so you thought, that i am other Laxmi Narayan."
"You did this to me, what have you done... if you are not that Laxmi Narayan, then where is he?"
"That would be him, but this is i am."
"Sir, your Son is here who?"
Your Father.
That not my dad.
He is yours...
"Sir, you are not his Father?"
"I am not even married, how could i have son?"
"And now i think, i wont marry ever."
"Sir, everyone has there own taste."
We have one more Laxmi Narayan in spare.
Let me show...
"Sir, i have told you there is one more Laxmi Narayan in this hotel."
"And now even Manager has confirm too, i you will let me go?"
"Sir... shut up, i am stuck here and you want to leave?"
Just listen to me... now what has done is done.
Now listen to me... you... now you have to but the car.
Its worth is 1000000/- you can give 900000/-.
900000/-?
Madam i look stupid from face but i am not.
Why i buy the car?
"You know, in 5 days if i didn't pay the bank installments."
"Then they will my showroom, and just because of that i... otherwise i am not that type of girl."
"I am also not that type of person, do i look like Khurana's?"
"I have the reputation too, you can ask anyone at Chandni Chok if my Son find out that in hotel in one room... with one girl... shame... shame..."

I've had a V-mail letter just the other day from Norman Page.

He said something about...
He dug a foxhole so deep it was just short of desertion.
And then the seasons spun by so fast they've seen to become one.
The war news was too big to grasp and too unhappy to understand.
Selena wrote me often about Peyton Place.
and I treasured her letters.
She always tried to mention my mother... and tell me what people were saying to each other.
Orwere not saying.
"Eventually,I broke the ice of my intentions... and subscribed to the ""Peyton Place Times""."
"Iwas hungry for names that meant something to me... but among them,unhappily,came the names of those gone forever."

Rodney asked me to take care of you.
-I don't need your help.
-But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years-old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought of anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but..."
"Rodney liked flashy girls, so that's the way I was going to be."
Funny thing is Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him.
But you taught him appearance was worth more than feelings.
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's...
Let's keep of what's left of the family together.

Mr. Caine?
Magnum.
I appreciate your meeting me like this.
"Well, to be honest with you, sir, I was rather flattered."
I've never met a justice of the Supreme Court before.
You haven't met one yet.
"I haven't accepted the nomination, and even if I do, it'll have to be confirmed by Congress."
"Well, from what I hear, that's just a formality, sir."
"Well, perhaps."
"After Robin Masters recommended you, I, uh, got some friends in Washington to pull out your military record."
Makes for pretty good reading.
"Personally, I find it rather boring, sir."
"Annapolis, class of'67."
Three tours in Vietnam.
Twice wounded.
"Mr. Caine, did you come here for my help, or are you trying to get me to re-up?"
- I need your help.
"- Well, pulling my 201 file isn't exactly a polite way to ask for it."
"I had to find out what kind of a man you were, just how far I could trust you."
"The only recommendation I had was Robin's, and let's face it, he is a novelist."
And you thought he might've lied to you...
the way you lied to him?
"Mr. Caine, Robin said you were looking for an old war buddy you thought might still be living in the Islands."
You wouldn't have pulled my service records for something as simple as that.
"Magnum, I, uh--"
I did lie to Robin.
"I want you to find a woman, a woman who disappeared 40 years ago."
- Forty years?
- And you've gotta find her in the next 2 4 hours.
"-Whatever it is, tell me exactly what news U heard."""

The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.
"And nowthis little, insignificant little shit Ellsberg... publishing all the diplomatic secrets ofthis country... is destroying ourability to conduct foreign policy."
I wonder if many people here wouldn't think thatten years in prison... was very cheap ifthey could contribute to ending this war.
The man has become a drug fiend.
He shot people from helicopters in Vietnam.
He's had sexual relations with his wife in frontoftheir children.
He sees a shrink in L.A. The man's all fucked up.
And now he's trying to look good forthe Liberals.

This man must be stopped atall costs.

"My dearest Topanga, it's day 58 of my summer road trip across this great country of ours with my dear brother, Eric."
"This may be the last entry in my travel log, as my road buddy is becoming ornery."
"Hi, Topanga."
I don't know why Cory thinks I'm ornery.
"I'm actually, you know, pretty happy now that I've got the tape recorder and I don't have to listen to Cory yammer on for two months and 48 states about life on the road."
"And speaking of the road, here it is now."
Tape recorder number 17.
The golden rays of the sunset remind me of the golden highlights in your beautiful hair.
You're insane!
"I mean, how is it that everything you see in this country reminds you of Topanga?"
"Oh, you exaggerate, Eric."
"I mean, I did not mention her once during our tour of the White House."
"Hmm. ""Topanga's got a desk just like Chelsea's."""
"Well, I didn't say anything at the Kennedy Space Center."
"""Topanga's favorite movie is Apollo 13."""
"Mount Rushmore? ""Will you look at the lips on Teddy Roosevelt?"""
I said that out loud?
"You've Topanga-ed me to death, man!"
"Well, I, for one, Eric, had a delightful summer, and there's a part of me that's sorry to see this trip end."
"Well, this trip is far from ended."
Why are you stalling?
I'm not stalling.
I just want to make sure I don't miss anything in these here United States.
"Eric, we're three hours from home, you know?"
We said we'd be home tonight.
- I do not think there is any need to...
"- Listen, you boony blathering numpty."
The only way for you to get across this bridge is to beat me in combat!
"Now, are you a man, or a worthless blate like I know you are?"
I'm calling you a coward!
I fear no man.
That's some tough talk coming from a man who wears a basket on his head!
I carry my haggis in a basket.
You might even make me shiver if you weren't dressed in a nightgown.
You look like my nanny!
You call that thing dangling off your hip a sword?
Looks like a butter knife.
"You'll not hurt anyone, wielding a piece of tinfoil around."
You'd be better off using your slippers for a weapon.
This is a sword!
And it's bigger than yours.

Shall I pause while you mourn your hat?
I can play a melancholy tune to go with your weeping.
You've done it now.
I'm gonna turn your head into a flour sifter.
"Aye, you got a lot of pep for a wee laddie."
The horse-cut technique should've destroyed your sword.
"Magic runes, laddie!"
All them fancy moves will get you nowhere.
"Now, quit your jumping around and get to fighting!"
Prepare to meet your doom.
I'll give you one more chance to give up.
I am not defeated.
And I shall hold my ground.
Hold your ground?
"No names, certainly."
"More rumour, to be honest."
"No names, certainly."

ALAN DAVIES AS YET UNTITLED CTO M725W/82 BF000000
"Looking forward to lots of chat and listening,"
I'm very good at nodding sagely.
I don't know if you can tell from my outfit but my favourite colour's blue.
"Hello, thank you."
"This is me, this is my room."
Where's my chocolate?
I know you've eaten it.
I don't know where it is.
"Oh, it's here."
"Hello, I'm Alan Davies and this is As Yet Untitled."
"We will be having a conversation, I don't know what we're talking about,"
"I don't have any prepared questions, no-one's here to plug anything, they're just going to come on and have a chat and then at some point during the conversation, we will stumble upon the title for tonight's show."
"So, without further ado, please will you welcome my guests?"
Here they are.
They're a hand-picked crew.
"Now, I have Elis James who has been heckled by hip-hop legend Grandmaster Flash."
Yeah.
Worth hearing about that.
"Roisin Conaty, who has a stressful relationship with creamed spinach and belted out an Elton John medley in a meditation retreat and that's a true story."
Rob Delaney is here which is fantastic.
"Rob Delaney, who once went to Slovakia by mistake and has been serenaded by Lionel Richie."
Nice to have you here.
"And Ardal O'Hanlon, who took part in a bank robbery."
It says here.
"I didn't do a bank robbery, I was in a bank when a robbery took place."
Were you really?
"Yes, I was."
"I was so drawn to it, because in a way, that's what this entire series is all about."
Rock 'n' roll is really the evolution of jazz.
"When Louis Armstrong's ""Hot Seven"" albums first came out, people lost their minds."
"It was punk rock, you know?"
It was out of control.
A lot of the jazz musicians became the first wave of rock 'n' roll musicians.
"I went there to be educated, because I never went to school."
"And I thought, ""I'm gonna go to where the stuff came out of the ground naturally, you know?"
You can't speak of New Orleans without speaking of Dr. John.
Now leave a little room for me!
"Most people I talk to don't call you ""Dr. John."""
"Well, my name is really Mac Rebennack."
Where are you from?
I'm from the Third Ward.
Same ward where Louis Armstrong came from.
"Every time I walked past where Louis Armstrong used to live, he'd say,"
"""If you want to do something bad enough, you can do it."""
It made me think.
That's what Louis came up in.
That was good enough for me.
Was it a musical family?
"Well, my aunt Dottie Mae used to play piano with Pete Fountain and George Girard..."
All of the cats that became famous later.
"I just remember she knew how to play that style that was called ""butterfly stride."""
"She used to say,"
"""Watch the piano player's left hand."
"That's important."""
That's what I did.
She was a very special person.
"If you're from New Orleans the way we are, you're not just from New Orleans."
"Like, you're four generations, five generations from New Orleans."
"Growing up and being, like, the son of a musician is a badge of honor in New Orleans, you know?"
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
- Hello?
- I've just killed two people.
My aunt and my uncle.
My name's John Mercer.
How did I become a hit man for the state?
"It all began five years into my life sentence, on the day Lenny Douglas came to take me out of prison."
I killed my aunt and uncle because they'd hurt somebody that I love.
Maybe that was what got Lenny's attention.
He liked emotions.
They gave him something to manipulate.
So while the rest watch the Champions League... you stop trying to push down the walls... you pick up your book... and you worry about the mystery of things.
"Lenny offered me a new life, a new home, a new family."
But there was a price.
And that was the job that he wanted me to do.
Lenny Douglas ran a secret team in the war on organised crime.
I never knew who gave him his orders but somebody at the highest level had approved our existence.
And his first trick was to reunite me with an old acquaintance.
"Now, how can I describe him?"
Take the person who annoys you the most and multiply it by ten.
"You think you've left them behind, you think you'll never have to see their face or hear their idiot voice again."
That's Calum.
Che-hey!
"First time I heard this tune, I was in a club in San Antonio with these two mental birds, Niamh and Catherine, cousins from Burnley, mate."
"Everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum."
"Mate, I'm not joking, this tune was playing,"
"I had me hand up both of their skirts at the same time, it was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep."
"Very suave, man, very suave."
She ran away with somebody
"So she's gone, what's the big deal"
Jiu Jun said he is connected to the Dragon Sabre
"Look at his stupid look, most likely it's rodomontade"
Master what's the matter?
You said she's a follower of Yan Tin Jing what proof do you have?
Only Yan Tin Jing's daughter-in-law who is the student of granny Jin Hua knows such poisonous techniques
Are you the daughter of Yan?
what?
"Right, you know my father"
So you're the lunatic who avenged your mother by killing your step-mother
what a damned evil cult!
If you're the grand daughter of Yan Tin Jing that makes you my cousin.
Cousin what cousin?
You're brother Niu
Brother Niu
"Be quiet, I'll take you away"
No need
Here is highly on guard
Even if you're an excellent fighter you can't escape with this mad lass
Eat up
Any more?
No more
Forget it
I'm not too hungry anyway
"Right, where are you going?"
The six mighty clans are gathering all martial artists to annihilate the Summit Guang Ming
"It beats me, why does everyone want to destroy the Ming Cult?"
when did you marry the Yang lady?
"You're wrong, I said it only because I didn't want your teacher to kill her"
I really have nothing to do with her why do you ask?
Nothing
"""Of course it does."
"It's a Western rewrite."""
I die.

Doing television is great schooling because you're doing things you Have to do on a shoestring.
You're doing stories that sometimes aren't so good.
Some weeks they're good.
Different actors coming in.
It gives you an exposure to different ideas different directors.
And you start tbinking:
"""I'd Iike to do it like tbls guy does it."""
"If some are bad, you say:"
"""If I ever get a cbance I won't do it like tbls guy does it."""

And to hold their nerve and cool and enjoy it and perform  it's a big big ask.

But then you kind of just have to step back for lik e a second and try and weigh out the pros and the cons.

I don't wanna do anything else.

"It was massive in Ireland, though, that song."

"He's had a tattoo of that on his arm, but he's had it, it's spelled wrong, so girl is spelt ""gril""."

"""I just love Kung pao chicken."
"""No, really, really!"""
"I'm just sick of people telling me what their tattoos mean, you know?"

"""Godfather who died three-year."""
"Oh, so you got a skull with flames coming out of the eyes burning a playing card with tits on it?"
"That is a solemn reminder of his life in IT sales, that's what that is."
"Rich, are you a fan of Ed Sheeran, do you like him?"
"Honestly, that's the first time that I think I've consciously ever heard any of his music."
"I'm aware he's had all these hits, and I must have heard..."
"I've rung up call centres, I've been in lifts,"
I must've heard his music sometime in the last five years.
"I'm the same way with Drake,"
I can't honestly tell you what any of his songs actually are.
There was a point where Ed Sheeran and Drake and Stormzy had 50 of the top 100 singles at the same time.
And I hadn't heard a single one.
I don't think you're the demographic.
Do you want to see the best thing you've ever seen in your life?
"No, no."
"I really don't, because, where do I go from here?"
Sorry...
That's a great point.

It was a gift with two simple caveats:
Keep a dead thing alive for more than a minute  and something else would die in its place.
"And touch a dead thing twice, it dies again, this time, forever."
Young Ned felt responsible not only for his mother's death  but the death of Chuck's father.
"His feelings of guilt were amplified, because he too was in love."
The next time young Ned would see the girl named Chuck  she would be dead.
"Unlike Chuck, young Ned still had a father."
- After a brief mourning period...
- I'll be back.
... he would deposit Ned at the Longborough School for Boys.
"After her own father's death  Chuck was fostered by Aunts Lily and Vivian  a renowned synchronized-swimming duo and sister neurotics  who helped her build a new home, bee by bee."
It was Aunt Lily who found the ad on the pages of the Thrifty Nickel  in a fleeting wisp of something resembling maternal instinct.
Just wanted you to stop staring at that spot where your father died.
Young Chuck rebuilt her home by building a new home  for a homeless queen and her hive.
The bees thrived.
So did Chuck.
And while Chuck thrived  Ned waited for his father to bring him home  and waited  and waited.
Just as Chuck remembered how home felt  Ned tried not to forget what home was.
He held on to it the only way he could  and became  the Pie-Maker.
And the girl named Chuck became dead.
"She was 28 years, 24 weeks, 3 days, 11 hours  and 51 minutes old when murdered on a Tahitian getaway."
- But one touch from the Pie-Maker...
I think somebody's truck's on fire.
"Oh, jeez."
... she was alive once more.
Sorry I'm late.
The Pie-Maker could never touch her again.
Chuck's survival now depended on a delicate dance  a ballet of avoidance.
Going.

"During this time, Big Sis freaked out over not being able to contact her best friend..."
A sex slave living with her boyfriend in Tokyo
This made her think of something ridiculous.
"""The Sex Slave Rescue Mission"""
The mission was to charge into their love nest and steal her back
I fought against this for three days and three nights... but ended up being dragged onto an overnight bus headed for Tokyo
"We were supposed to meet Bebi-chan, Big Sis's online friend and... contributor of this mission, but she had forgotten... she was supposed to buy a BL manga that she recommended for him"
We rushed ourselves to the shop with a sea of BL fanzines...

So this is where you've been?
Shall I paint you a portrait?
It's for free.
Can't you take that off?
Wait!
"Okay, I'll paint you like that."
"But next time you'll take it off, right?"
Take it off?
This punk...
He's got a weird taste...
You punk... what are you smirking about?
- Aren't you hot?
-Wouldn't you be?
- I'm roasting in here.
"- If I were you, I'd take it off."
I'm dying of curiosity.
Are you a man by any chance?
There are plenty of guys with long hair.
And lots of guys have pretty legs.
Right... men don't wear bras
"All right, stop it."
You little cutie... don't be so shy.
I know...
Your face is really ugly!
I'm joking.
You're so cute.
This is what I like about my job.

But the frame should still be there.
I should go find it.
At this hour?
You should go when it's light.
That's alright.
I'll be going now.
You're really as impetuous as he said you were.
He?
Do I know that person?
Everyone's gone now.
We should go too.
"Gil Dong, do you want to wear this and go to the brothel for a while?"
- Shall we?
- No one will recognize us if we wear this!
You're right.
I haven't been to the brothel in a long time!
I am filled with past memories!
- Then I'll wear the black.
- Go ahead.
"I look great, don't I?"
"Are you sure you'll be alright, half-balls?"
You may be ready for the brothel yet.
Let's just go back.
How do I look?
Let's just wear this to scare the kids.
- You handsome fellow!
"- Hey, Sir Moonlight Black Hat!"
- Do you think you got rid of Burak?
Is this how you thought of getting rid of him?
Shame on you.
Where did these come from?
What are these?
You wanted to kill Burak.
"God damn you, Barış."
You lied to me all along.
Where did they come from?
"Who gave you these, mom?"
A courier left them at the door.
God damn it.
We're going home.
The murderer has been found.
Put an end to this tension.
I think the killer is still out there among us.
- What does this mean?
- Burak hired that man.
"This way, not only he cleared his name from the accusations... ... but also, he can still claim that he's the victim."
- Why would he do that?
- That man absolutely hates us.
He wants to have us on a string.
But I won't take that.
I won't let that happen.
Don't rise yourself to the bait then.
"Either way, Burak will be in your life."
I am not very sure about that.
- I need to hang up.
- Is Ebru Hanım in her room?
"- She won't be here today, sir."
- Why?
I wasn't told the reason.
The girl made this up because she was scared of you.
"She went away with Kerim, willingly."
And that's all there is to it.
This is a terrible ruse!
It's a disgusting frame set up by my rivals there.
Then do whatever necessary to clean up this mess.
- What's in the news?
It says Selim did it?
"- They're fabricated news, dear."
- Who's the girl?
- Will you calm down please?
Do whatever's needed to clean it up.
If my family's name gets involved in such a scandal... ...
"I will burn the bridges, just so you know."
"Meltem, calm down sweetie."
Let's first understand what it is.
Then do what needs to be done.
Don't waste time.
"I'll be on it right away, don't worry."
God...
My hands and legs are shaking.
God damn whoever is responsible for this slander.
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- I'll call you right away.
"We're toast now, Perihan."
We're toast.
God damn it!
"Girl, look..."
It's on the local news only.
It's most likely a slander.
That's what the man said.
For God's sake...
O my God!
Hey!
Stop there.
Sorry sir.
Are you Venkat?
Yes sir.
Get into the jeep.
Why sir?
I will tell you in the station.
What is my crime sir?
Since you are supplying gunpowder.. ..to terrorists to prepare dynamite.
Dynamite!?
"Sir, I am working as supervisor .. ..in Shakti transport company."
Your owner has revealed your name.
Confess yourself kid.
I have surrendered myself.
Why do you want to have a dispute with police?
They will beat you.
Accept the truth.
I will kill you.
He is telling lies.
I dont know about any thing.
You tell the truth.
Do you remember what you said that day?
You said your lover insulted you.
You want to earn money in any way.
I took you into my company after I explained all the details.
"I had even promised to give you 10,000 rupees per month."
You are trying to drag me into this?
"Venkat, stop."
"Sir, please dont do it."
You are in uniform.
No wonder the world is left with on more virgins.
I've more class than the rest of them all.
Very high sounding!
"Your figure isn't too bad, though."
I can see that you have a hard on.
Have you made up your mind?
"If you want to do it, act fast before my mon returns."
What?
You're telling me to do it here?
You want to do it in the corridor?
Stop pulling my leg.
Who's calling the shots here?
You'd better find out.
I've never counted how many wet dreams I'm used to having.
I come twice that night.
...which made it a bad night for me.
Set the toxic fire.
The net.
Chief...
"If you try anything else, I'll blow the whistle, and the little snake will take a tour inside, and then emerge from your head."
Do you think you'll be alive?
"Hurry, get them out!"
"Let us go first,"
I won't fall in your trap.
"If I let you go, you won't help me."
I don't trust you either.
"What about this,"
"let Master Tuan go, he knows no martial arts."
No.
How can I leave you?
"Don't try to be a hero,"
Find Xiang Yaocha to save me.
Last week.
"Look, I'm just trying to change the world, okay?"
I don't have time for a grudge match with every poser in a parka'.
Besides there's kids in that park so...
Here's one from dead-not-sleeping.
"Long time watcher, first time writing."
Blah blah blah blah.
"""You always say in your blog that you will show her the way,"" show her you're a true villain."
Who is her?
And does she even know that you're...
Laundry day...
See you there.
Under things... tumbelling.
Wanna say...
"""Love your hair"""
Here I go... mumbling.
With my freeze ray I will stop...
The world.
With my freeze ray I will find the time to find the words to...
Tell you how...
How you make... make me feel.
What's the phrase?
Like a fool.
Kinda sick.
Special needs.
Anyways... with my freeze ray I will stop...
The pain.
"It's not a death ray or an ice beam, that's so Johnny Snow."
I just think you need time to know that I'm the guy to make it real.
The feelings you don't dare to feel.
I'll bend the world to our will.
And we'll make time stand still.
Whose car's out front?
That's mine.
I'm Bonnie.
Your daughter.
"Hello, Bonnie."
How do you know this is going to work?
It's a process.
It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion.
The brain's like a muscle.
"The more you use it, the more it can do."
"A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing..."
Gratitude.
"If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why."
I was cursed.
"Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf."
It was torture.
Klaus took that away.
Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him.
"To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn."
"Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free."
But how can he turn?
It's not a full moon.
He doesn't need one.
"You're a hybrid now, right?"
"I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right?"
"Yeah, but I don't know how to just...Start."
Now you're making excuses.
You don't understand!
"When I turn, I break every bone in my body."
You asked for my help.
This is the only way.
How badly do you want your freedom?
Lyuty and his men are billeted there.
You say she's at the inn?
"Lock my freedom behind iron bars,"
"I'll steal it, bars and all."
"Lock my freedom behind iron bars,"
"I'll steal it, bars and all."
"Out sailed the moon, then again"
Hid her fair face.
"Lock the black steed behind five iron locks,"
"I'll steal it, locks and all."
"I've known God and the devil,"
I've been God and the devil.
"Imprison the maid behind a high fence,"
"I'll steal her, fence and all."
"Imprison the maid behind a high fence,"
"I'll steal her, fence and all..."
Give us a dance!
Give him the guitar.
"Give us a dance, Gypsy!"
"All of us are feeble, for we are but mortals."
Vodka!
"Way to go, the black head!"
"You're sharp, Gypsy!"
I know a pure-blooded little filly when I see her!
How can you tell?
By her teeth.
I looked round -
A coffin flying over the graves!
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound!
"Drink, sinner!"
Learn to partake of our fare.
I am sure of that.
I can tell that Kazım Bey wants to do something for her... ... we appreciate it but.
We don't want it.
I think you shouldn't make your decision now.
Think of it as your father's last wish.
No.
We thank you but.
I can't accept that either.
Because he's never been my father.
"I just named this big void in my life ""father""."
I will never forgive him because he didn't try to fill this void.
I'll never forgive him for trying to ease his conscience with a piece of paper.
But I will not wish him ill.
So he doesn't need to worry.
- I can understand your anger.
- No you can't.
"This is not anger, mom."
"It's not hatred, disappointment or anything."
"- I know, sweetheart."
"- I mean, I never had a father."
And there never will.
Please you close this subject not to be opened again.
The decision is yours.
I feel much lighter now.
I won't have to lie to anybody anymore.
I can say my father really died.
My dear child.
Did I wake you up?
"No, I gotta go anyway."
"Oh, why?"
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
"No, I'll go to work."
What's her damage?
No damage.
"Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life."
"A girl that hot, that smart...Damage."
"Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags."
"Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day."
"Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count."
I guess you're right.
It's yours.
I wonder what my exes would call me.
Nothing.
They're all dead.
Hmm.
"Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent."
She dated the medical examiner?
Mm-hmm.
"Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent."
I think he's just dead.
What?
Murdered.
Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
"Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that."
"Well, red flag number two."
Who do you think killed him?
I don't know.
"But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect."
"What are you doing here, Klaus?"
Enjoying our stalemate.
What do you want?
"Question is, what do you want?"
"My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back."
"Well, ahem, see, Klaus..."
Don't blame others for your own sin.
We don't want any of you here.
- It is hard enough to contain Mustafa...
- Are you threatening me?
- We're just saying...
"- Okay, go back to your own business."
Let us go inside.
I can't believe it.
I really can't.
They nearly lynched me today in the town.
I bet it's the pig called Reşat who let those men on us.
I bet.
Do everything to prevent this news to reach the national newspapers.
People might believe it.
"Münir will sue them, of course."
But you should pressure them as well.
Your food.
I pity this country if people like them can freely write their fabricated lies.
- He's not picking up.
- That's better.
A crazy man throws a stone in a well...
Please sort it out.
- Where you going?
- To meet my father for visa procedures.
"Okay, I'll call Mustafa Bey right away."
Let's see how we're gonna clean up this mess.
"Reşat Amca, I have a visa appointment."
I have to go.
"Okay, let our driver take you there."
- Where are you going?
"- I'm here, I'll tell the driver."
- I'll call you later.
"I identify it with my father, but not me."
I don't feel I demand respect.
You don't demand respect?
No.
Should you?
"As a matter of fact, I'd like more."
I'd like you to respect me more.
"Now you see, so you demand respect."
"Alright, yes."
"Yes, as a matter of fact if I could demand respect from you"
I would.
So do it!
Who's preventing you?
Except yourself.
'Cause if I feel I get myself out on the corner you're going to let me just drown.
You're not going to help me one bit.
And I know that I can't quite come up to standards with you.
What should I do when you're on the corner?
Encourage me to come out.
Ah.
You don't have enough...courage to come out by yourself.
You need somebody to pull a little damsel in distress out of her corner.
Yes!
"So anytime you want somebody to... ...pay attention to you, you crawl into a corner and wait until rescue comes."
"Yes, that's exactly what I'd like."
And this is what I call phony.
Pardon me?
This is what I call phony.
Why is it phony?
"I'm admitting to you what I am, and how is that a phony?"
"That is a phony, because --"
Oh!
Fatmagül doesn't want to talk to anybody today.
Not even you.
"Of course, that's what we thought as well."
Thank you very much.
Good bye sweetie.
She said you shouldn't leave home for a while.
It's bad if she says that too.
I don't get it though.
This was supposed to be a private case.
"Yet, everybody is talking about it."
You are right.
They are doing a great job twisting the facts and informing the media.
I'll go to the prosecution office and see what they can do about this.
"Also, I'll gave them a petition about what happened last night."
But it's not going to happen over night.
This'll take a while.
I just want to live my normal life.
"This is only the beginning, girl."
You can't go outside for a while.
You can't.
But what about Kerim?
And what about your job?
Your appointment with the doctor and all?
- That's enough.
- The moment you go outside... ... you'll have all those microphones in your face.
- Will you stop doing that?
- I wish... ...
"I wish they could go somewhere far away, for a few days."
But where.
That would be great actually.
What would be great?
"- Hey, abi."
I will arrange a job for him.
Ask him will he do it?
Look here my child.
I care a lot for you.
All I want is you should never repent like your mother.. ..that you have married a guy who is useless like me.
Take this flower.
Girls should put it in the plait.
Boys must put it in the ear.
Give this flower to Venkat.
Take the plate.
By the way will our son-in-law agree?
How can I say that?
I know.
He will not accept.
Your father will arrange a job for me?
Will he make me a card distributor in that club?
"Venkat, be serious."
My dad want you to join.. ..as assistant manager in a cement factory.
I dont want that.
Why?
Because my father arranged it.
- Yes.
How will you feed me if you dont have any job?
Anyone can ask that to me but not you.
When you believed that rain has united us.. ..then why cant you believe that I can feed you.
How will you do that?
- I will rob a bank or I will steal.
I can do anything for my love.
Try to understand me.
You want to see me as an employee.
With in 24 hours I will come to your house as an employee.
You have tried to create a dispute between your daughter ..and me because I am unemployed.
And what does it do?
It marks a one in each of those spots.
"Now, what did I want to do?"
I wanted to check membership.
I want to do search.
Well that's simple.
"Given that representation and some value, I just say gee is it there?"
What's the order complexity here?
I know I drive you nuts asking questions?
What's the order complexity here?
"Quadratic, linear, log, constant?"
Any takers?
"I know I have the wrong glasses on the see hands up too, but..."
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
Who said it?
STUDENT:
Constant.
PROFESSOR:
"Constant, why?"
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"Yes, thank you."
"All right, it is constant."
You keep sitting back there where I can't get to you.
Thank you very much.
It has a constant.
"Remember we said we design lists so that the access, no matter where it was on the list was of constant time."
That is another way of saying that looking up this thing here is constant.
"So this is constant time, order one."
"Everyone, in the bazaar, market, streets talking about it."
They know who cheated you.
"I am saying the painful truth, as your friend."
To make you bleed the poison out.
"She was smiling to you, but she loved someone else."
God saved you from the worst.
And they got lost.
Just leave it.
Who cares if the lawyer knows where they are.
They can go to hell.
You should focus on your own future.
Figure out what are you gonna do with your life.
But it's difficult to do it here.
- I know...
- It's best if you go away from this town.
You're a good seaman.
You can find a good job in a fine ship.
"- Of course, I can."
- Look for one that's going abroad.
Just sail away...
Some trips will take months.
I can't think of a better way for you to leave here.
"You'll make money, too."
You'll see a lot of countries.
You'll travel the world.
"And eventually, you will forget."
I will forget...
... that dark night...  ... and the smell of the ashes.
I will forget everything.
"Stop being stubborn, let's show your foot to a doctor."
At least eat your food.
You haven't eaten since yesterday.
It's over
I have good news for you!
Antony!
Leave us
Leave us
"Oh, I thought you were dead!"
I am dead
"No...no, don't say that"
This place is like a gigantic tomb you stay here long enough one becomes mummified
You deserted me!
They told me you were dead!
What should I have done?
I saw something tonight that I could not believe
The city...in victory
I had to buy time
"To keep my people from panic, to organize a defense"
A defense?
What defense?
Octavius has defeated us completely!
He has not defeated me!
I still rule Egypt
How!
By lying to your people?
How could you let them believe we've triumphed... when we've failed so miserably?
"We'll triumph, Antony, we will make that falsehood come true"
You've humiliated me with this vile hypocrisy!
As if I haven't been humiliated enough!
Be quiet!
Your men will hear you!
My men?
What men?
The bottom of the sea is littered with the bones of my men
That man isn't the real killer.
You were the one who got him caught.
And now you want to clear his name?
A man appears out of no where to save Barış from the suspicions.
Ferhat's lighter found on him?
"Come on, that's not just a coincidence."
They just want us to think that way.
The man was following me just to get caught.
"So, you're saying that Barış hired that man?"
Exactly...
Barış took action when he felt he was cornered.
First he wanted to silence us to buy some time.
That's why he said he would sue us all.
And then he made his plan.
He made that man get caught.
So that he would confess the murder.
So simple...
"See, that man isn't the real killer."
All this was setup by Barış.
Or maybe Kuzey did it.
Just when Kuzey went into jail... ... a man confesses the murder to clear Kuzey's name.
Kuzey wouldn't do a sham like that.
If the killer is one of Bekir's men... ... he might have sacrificed himself to save Kuzey.
Can't that be possible?
You have this disease for how long?
Since my son died.
The doctors said it is at a progressed stage.
- You didn't get treatment?
- No.
- Why?
- Killing that man was my treatment.
Did you kill Ferhat?
Reliance.
- Reliance.
"So if there's an electricity problem in your home.. ..you will call up the Reliance office, won't you?"
You won't call Anil Ambani directly.
"Mr. Anil, we've a electricity problem."
Silence.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
"These priests, the saints are officers of God."
- No.
They aren't officers.
Officers are educated people.
They are...
"They are salesmen, Your Honour."
They are collection agents.. ..because they own God's franchise.
Your Honour.
This man's an atheist.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
"But, we are saints."
We will forgive him.
But the world will never forgive him for this grave sin.
You won't be able to set foot out of your house.. ..if you say anything else.
ls that your concern for me.. ..or are you threatening me in front of the judge?
We...are concerned for you.
They pay me up quickly.
End this matter.
"My lord, this is enough."
"The donation receipts, the submissions."
There's no agency agreement between God and my clients.
Kanji is saying baseless things.
We cannot file a case against God for such a small thing.
Small?
"Oh, I'm sorry to have bored you with such story."
[Seul Hye]
Do not worry.
I have heard nothing.
You've changed somewhat since I've seen you last.
"You were cold as stone last time, but now you're even smiling."
"Back then, there was a man I had my heart set upon."
"Even though I may seem to be cold, I have my integrity."
Back then?
You speak of it as if it were a thing from the past.
Yes.
He was someone who I could not be with.
"So, I ended things in a petty way."
Is that so?
"Then, you could stay by my side tonight, right?"
"Forgive me, but I already made a prior engagment."
A prior engagement?
Yes.
"A favor was done for me, thus I promised to return the favor by greeting him tonight."
You wench!
You're arrogant!
How dare you put excuses as greetings to disobey him when he's speaking?
That's fine.
It's her arrogance that intrigues me.
Seol Hye!
Come outside for a minute!
"Forgive me, it seems I am required."
Alright.
She's a geisha from the commoners.
"You can just order her, why are you just watching her?"
I don't know why.
"Somehow, I can't seem to give her up."
You wouldn't be writing about mortality.
And then so.
Right.
You don't have to say that.
"I mean, things that are sort of obvious, don't say it."
"Just say the important limitations of your study, the important strengths."
"And, you don't have to label them as strengths and limit."
"It's sort of a jargon now, every epidemiologic paper, you have to find the word limitation."
[laugh].
"Yes, yes."
"Or, you know, just, state what they are."
"Yeah, yeah, good."
"So, I guess, You, you know, I guess just avoid making your paper seem like a, a thesis."
Yeah I've encountered that as well.
I'm reviewing papers.
Yeah.
Where you can tell that a.
Somebody had taken the thesis.
Yeah.
And just tried to turn it into a paper.
It's a very different product.
Right.
"So paying attention to the, the actually writing like a paper."
Right.
He says it's a great tip.
Mm-hm.
And lets talk a little bit about resubmission.
So lets say that you're offered the opportunity.
"The, the paper's rejected but."
Mm-hm.
You're offered the opportunity to resubmit it with a lot of comments from reviewers.
Mm-hm.
"You can also begin to find out why they stick, if you want."
Why?
"What is so sticky , what is so appealing about this?"
"Why is this thought, this feeling so sticky?"
And hold this question.
Don't ask two / three questions.
Hold this question one at a time.
What is so enticing about this thought?
Ok?
"And you can see ,'Ok, because it promises that'"
"Ok, as you said before, 'that is going to bring me happiness'."
Ok.
That's the first thing you've identified now.
"Now, you find out 'bring happiness to 'who' exactly'?"
"Just this question, 'who's going to become happy?'"
"And initially, it's going to be a lot of blurring."
"'Wow, you can't see. wow', you know like,"
Something can't handle this question.
"'Who's , Who suffers?"
It's me'
No.
But don't just satisfy yourself with the assumed 'me'.
"Ask again, you know, 'who, who will, who's going to be happy?'"
And keep your attention still and hold this question.
And this stillness and focus of attention will begin to burn.
"It will begin to burn, all this noise."
Stay with it.
Stay with it.
You might find yourself going to sleep a little bit.
That's Ok.
Hold the question.
Even write it down.
"already here -- so that's one of column one,"
"that's one times column one, right there."
And now I want to add on --
so I'm going to hook the next vector onto the front of the arrow will
start the next vector and it will go this way.
"So let's see,"
can I do it right?
"If I added on one of these vectors,"
"it would go left one and up two, so we'd go left one and up two, so"
it would probably get us to there.
Maybe I'll do dotted line for that.
Okay?
"That's one of column two tucked onto the end,"
but I wanted to tuck on two of column two.
So that --
the second one -- we'll go up left one and up two also.
It'll probably end there.
And there's another one.
So what
I've put in here is two of column two.
Added on.
And where did I end up?
What are the coordinates of this
result?
What do I get when I take one of this plus two of that?
"I do get that, of course."
"There it is, x is zero, y is three, that's b."
That's the answer we wanted.
And how do I do it?
You see I do
it just like the first component.
I have a two and a minus two that
We can say congratulations now.
"Let this exam's result come in the best way, let my son pass it too."
"Don't worry, Yaman will make it!"
You will see.
"Today will be a beautiful day for him, and for you too, if it's not for anyone else."
Thank you very much.- Enjoy it.
You won't have headache after you drink the tea.
"Today, my day started very bad.. but I want it to be beautiful for someone else."
Thank you very much.
Good bless you!
There are analgesics in the closet.
"No, I have my medicine."
If I say that I have also headache from the excitement...
"Come on bro, I am in hurry.- You told me to stop."
Take it.
Thank you.
Calling Yaman.
Your brother let you down.
Cut your hopes!
There were some in photo albums too but who know where they are.
The photos spread why moving from one place to another.
I will order pita.
Don't take the trouble.
I will go now.
"It can't be, you came from far away."
"I will get it and bring right away-Order it, of course."
Your must have headache from hunger.
It's obvious you didn't eat anything.
Eylül calling.
:
Actually I can't look you in your face.
I disgraced mysself that night.- After that night so many disgraces happened that... don't worry at all.
"You're going to lift one hand and one foot, tap."
"Then the other hand and the other foot, tap."
So see how the both come up and down at the same time?
I want you to try it.
OK ready?
Great job!
OK we're going to put one foot on the line here and put this foot on the carpet.
And we're going to put our hands on our hips and we're going to walk and put one foot in front of the other.
"OK we're going to come over and put one foot on the balance beam hands on our hips, and we're going to look at the target in front of us."
We're going to lift this foot behind us with our toe pointed towards the ground and you're going to stand on the balance beam on one leg until I tell you to stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Good.
Thank you.
We're going to try this activity one more time.
I just want to make sure you keep that one leg up behind you and look at the target until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Thank you.
We're going to come over and we're going to bring this leg up behind us again with our hands on our hips and we're going to jump.
You're going to jump on the end of the line here until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
And stop.
You're going to catch it after it bounces once OK?
Like that.
You're going to catch the ball with two hands until I say stop.
1 cup of sugar.
1 cup of corn.
"In a cup, you measure a finger of oil."
And dye.
The color that you like.
This is optional.
If you don't have an popcorn maker.
"You can do this in any pan, just need to cover with a lid."
Add sugar.
Water.
Oil.
And corn.
Also add a little bit of dye.
"Well guys, when the popcorn start to popping."
It's just pay attention and mix.
"It takes a while anyway, because it will still make syrup."
Don't worry.

"Hey, Would you want some?"
Thanks for watching.
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
Hopefully it won't stutter.
"And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved."
Voice (Video):
I don't know how it's possible ... but you seem to have more hair.
Brad Pitt:
Good catch.
"Alright, alright."
So now let's shift some stuff.
"Shift happens, you guys just deal with it."
"So here we go, shift to everybody."
Let's shift.
We're going to we're going to shift E2.
Ready?
We're going to make it back to E3.
I don't have enough time to do it.
Here's how it's going to work.
And let's just see if you.
Are chill with this?
"I grab the first one and -one components of u two and I should make it second to n com, second to n components."
Sorry.
That should be.
"So I take the first one through n minus one of e two and make it the second n component here, and then finish this off I take the last component of e two and make it."
The first component.
Of E3.
And I'm going to drop E3.
Right here and this is at one.
Go.
There it is.
"See that I just took this, shifted it up, dropped it down."
"Alright let's finish this off, let me take this row here, this E4 and I am going to shift it down one over here and I do this the following way."
"I say I'm going to make the vector E5 and the way this is worth the same way, two and one is equal to E4."
"And, the first component is the last component."
And I put this E5 right.
"Right over here no p5, p5, and this is at, minus then plus, plus one."
And if I spy that.
There it is.
This is the matrix we built in class.
That's the least significant stage.
"What we make sure is that all these animals have been ""grass only"" for at least a year because we do buy some calves from places we're not sure how they're handled."
A lot of these are getting ready to go to slaughter.
"Yeah, twelve of them will go tomorrow."
And how old are those that are going?
They are probably 28 months.
They don't grow as fast as they would on grain.
On grain they would grow faster.
"But they don't require any tillage, and this whole thing works on real time solar energy."
You're seeing it here.
"There's no fertilizer, no tillage, no annuals."
And you're creating topsoil.
That's exactly right.
America needs more topsoil.
"Yes, you're exactly right,"
America needs more topsoil.
That's for sure.

I will go do some work.
If I'm late... ...give this paper to anyone will bring you to me.
You will be late?
"No, no."
Just if I am late.
"Goodbye, Mother."
"What's your name, sweetheart?"
Abdallah.
Abdallah.
"What a nice name, Abdallah."
"Take this, sweetheart."
Candy.
"It's okay, take it."
"This is for you, sweetheart."
My dear!
Why dont you please relent?
If you are angry you will not walk with me till the end
Will you drench me instead of being my umbrella
You are the rain who throws away the umbrella
When I look beyond the curtains .. ..
I found that my impression in your heart.
Since I know the value of love I did not forget like you.
He is always thinking about me but does not talk to me
Even a second lost will never come back
Bye.
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Why are you thundering?
Do you think I am afraid of you?
"Even if you thunder, eventually you have to come to me."
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Cant you hear?
Are you deaf?
Dont make such a fuss.
I know that you also want to speak to me.
You are only trying to placate your ego.
Come to me now.
"Hey rain, you were the witness when a big man promised me.. ..that he will keep me in his heart and my ring on his finger."
He kept the promise too.
I also promised that whenever you come I would hug him.
Should I not keep my promise now?
Even if he is angry with me I am going to hug him.
Venkat!
What is the use of killing a minion like you.
I am sparing your life.
Go and tell him that he cannot harm.. ..even a single strand of my hair.
"Uncle, why are you looking at me like that?"
I was trying to find something that didn't look quite so horrible.
Just a second here.
"Here, we'll just do this."
- Not much better.
"- OK, OK."
Everybody is a fricking art critic.
"- If you wanted ugly discussions, this is the slide for you."
- Hold that.
I can't do this.
"Oh, oh no."
This is like way more than my French can handle.
You can deal with the blue.
I'm sorry.
I can read cereal boxes and soup cans but....
I decided it will be a fiery topic.
It makes spaghetti bindings.
"- I use it a lot, but it still can make spaghetti bindings."
"- We validate that, by the way, now."
"- [indecipherable] ""bindings are spaghetti [indecipherable] ""?"
- We validate.
"Even the bindings part, oddball expression."
"At least, it might be spaghetti, but we'll tell you if you have a bogus binding in the middle."
"Personally, I like WOOgnl, we use it all the time."
But I've talked to some people who thought it was harmful.
- I feel bad every time I use it.
"But yeah, we use it, definitely."
"- Just wash your hands afterwards, and everything will be fine."
Right?
I think that's it.
"Thank you, everybody."

Now I am employed.
As a driver?
To 25 lorries.
I am a supervisor.
"10,000 salary."
Is it enough to feed your daughter?
"I can earn 10,000 in one day if luck smiles at me."
"Do you see, because I said those words that day.. ..he became determined and got a job."
I know that you are capable.
But you need a little push.
I have given green signal to your love.
What are you doing?
Take my son-in-law inside.
I will order to print the wedding cards.
But there is a small problem.
My scooter is not starting.
Can you order to drop me since you are not the driver?
"No need, I will take my way."
Stop wearing a girls dress and.. ..let your beauty be magnified by a saree
Dont jump like a small girl and.. .. let me tie you down with a nuptial not
let me reach you quickly and.. ..let us fulfill our naughty desires hold this beauty in your embrace
"see this, how can I stop the youth.. .. when the my heart became an enemy"
Why should we feel lonely.. .. when we have each others company
Accept me as your bride
Drive away your shyness and repay this sweet debt
The girl is very delicate.
How can I touch her
It is difficult to remain alone at this age
"Here I am, twist around me"
Fulfill my desire by owning me
Hi!
How are you?
"- Zeynep, I almost died today."
"- Don't be silly, Burak."
How would he know that you'd use the elevator at that time?
- I don't know but he just did it somehow.
- Stop torturing yourself.
Throw those thoughts out of your mind.
I wish this was just my paranoias as you say.
I know you're going through a difficult period.
But you need to calm down.
It will be over soon.
I am with you.
And no one is gonna kill you.
Are you carrying a gun on your belt?
- I need to be prepared for anything.
- So is this how you protect yourself?
I need to carry this until I can feel safe again.
"""Kuzey, I crossed out one more day."""
"""I shoed away one more day to be with you."""
My captivity is over.
Yours is next.
On 4th of February.
"A new page will be opened for us, you'll see."
I'm filing a divorce suit against Barış.
"I'm with my mom, since that day."
"I won't go to that house again, not even to get my necklace back."
"Yes, Barış was so mad he seized the necklace you gave me."
I tried to get it back.
"But I had to leave it as pawn in exchange for my freedom, until I divorce."
It's a miserable effort by him.
"He will see that nothing can separate you and me, as everyone else will also see."
"Until today, I didn't know what it really meant ""to miss somebody""."
I missed you so much.
They lived in that
little house around the corner.
There was one brother that would be here - one or two that would be here
like all summer.
Coordinate stuff.
"Do you recall their names, or?"
Not really.
But they'd play ball
Baseball?
Yep.
And they'd go for walks after supper every night.
Walking down the middle of the road.
With their habits on.
"And then Larry McDonough was just getting into the riding stable thing and they'd - he had 6, 8 horses."
That was one of the things they'd do.
They could rent the horses.
They had one day to be back and forth on them.
And they just seemed a real pleasant bunch.
They never preached.
They didn't do anything like that.
"They were just more friendly, you know."
They were all teachers out of Chicago.
Some Jesuit college or something down there.
"Not Jesuit, but you know."
But we'd always haul them - pick up their luggage with the truck and - same as like when boy scouts come.
You'd load all their gear in the truck and take it up to Fox Lake or into that little road into
Barney's Lake.
"It's fenced off now, but down there."
"So, the brothers would come here."
They were teaching at the colleges down in Chicago there.
Their time here was for what?
That was their retreat.
It has different legendary levels.
"It is very good, you teach me..."
"OK, I showed my dad a new game and..."
Yes...
You have completed your things!
I made my registration to the reeve here.At this house.
It was necessary like that for school.
Did you talk with the prison management?
When can I see my brother?
"I was busy with Faruk Beylice's lawsuit , so I couldn't take care of that but I will solve it."
I promise!
Is there any development about that issue at least?
"No, unfortunately, it looks very hard..."
What's that Suzan?
Have you ever seen us eating dessert after dinner...
Yaman bought it with his first weekly salary.
Oh...
My dear...
The master gave us our weekly salary and I bought it to thank you..
You bought us dessert...
This dessert will take away the whole sadness and tiredness we had all day.
Exactly..
May God give you abundance.
- Enjoy it!
"Oh, my brother..."
"Good that I bought half a kilo, if I bought one kilo we would have floods here."
Are you comfortable my sweeetie?&amp;gt; yes.
"Don't worry for anything, okay?"
Don't be sad for anything!
Everything will get better.
We will sleep and wake up and everything will be better.
"Don't treat me like a baby, it's okay."
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.
But isn't the one with the problem you?
You even drop those kinds of things.
"It's good that you two have gotten closer... but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful."
Since Eun Jo is here too. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
When are you going to select your major?
During my second year.
"Then, when you decide what major you're going to take..."
Will you be able to do it?
"If a bunch of people choose the same major,"
"They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner..."
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.
"Well, I'm just saying..."
It would be nice if you went into business.
I'm not interested in that area.
"Ah, Why?"
Please drop me off right over there.
Are you going into class?
Seung Jo!
Again?
"Hey, when you think it's going well with him..."
Why is he so fickle?!
Is he being mean again?
"This time, it feels different from the last, though."
I don't know.
"What-  I mean, you said you even kissed."
Like this... you said you hugged too.
"But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??"
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.
It's very frustrating.
"Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas?"
To find out if he's interested in me or not.
Because.
But yeah.
"Uh, we're thinking."
Okay.
"You kno w, as."
"Responsive design, it's kind of a buzzword but it is also a necessity."
"Um, and..."
"And lot of designers are now saying, well, everything I design, by default has to be responsive."
And now it's fine when you're starting fresh.
"But um, when you have to look behind you what's already been done since, you know, in a lot of cases."
Your content.
The content you are working with has existed since the beginning of internet.
And things were not pretty then.
Oh no.
"In fact, we still have sites that look like 1993."
"And that was my biggest, even iii..."
"Ah, I have no doubt."
"But we're not going to redesign another 1993 looking website with all those blocks and squares. we gotta get away from that, please."
Yeah.
To try to be a little more hip.
"In fact, the girl was just showing us ."
"We, we were looking at, um, presentation on the"
"Tuesday on of the pages that they had ah, doing test on."
"And, and that was one of the web comments there."
"I said, yeah, yeah."
"You don't have to stick with those 1995. , Mm-hm."
"No. , I said, oh no, is he? see how terrible we are."
"We are like the, we've got to get, we've got to get this stuff."
"I mean, they have some of the coolest science around and they show it and."
And those interval waves sometimes.
"I mean, our site looks pretty good."
"Um, cause we did the redesign at MPS and stuff."
I'm tired here
I am tired a lot ..

Please
Ok..
We will go out again
But we have some conditions
"Of course, madame, anything you want"
"Gülnaz, What are these conditions?"
Like zero.
"And of course, we're probably 16 years old"
"I mean, what the hell."
"We all skate, and we weren't experts, but we started skating."
"Now, you don't see a kid out there."
"Sunday afternoon, and nobody knows how to skate."
"But anyway, they're all watching that damn TV, or..."
We got out there and finally one of us had enough brains.
I don't know who.
I ain't gonna take the credit because we looked around and here the island was just a little bit of a smudge like this.
And the mainland
looks like from here to Garden Island.
"So one of us had enough brains to say, Maybe we better..."
"We had good, sharp skates"
Not a drop of snow or nothing.
Just like skating on a groomed rink except for the pressure through the cracks.
One of us finally had enough brains to turn around and come back.
"Now, you were 16 when you - ?"
"Probably was, yeah."
So you've kept pretty close and expect to see all nine of them?
"Well, eight of them."
Kenny died in Texas.
The guy that was in the Navy.
He died from cancer in Texas here a couple years ago.
Good friend.
"That was probably the whole graduating class, then?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"In fact, freshman year I was the only boy."
Gary was in seminary and Kenny was a grade ahead of us.
I was the only boy.
What other exploits did you have together with that group?
"Keep your voice low, he is the king of entire Telangana."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"- It is raining, mother."
"If your father sees you, he will.."
Your husband is busy elsewhere.
Look there.
Silk drops which make the young girl happy
Like the colorful parrots and like sugar crystals .. ..the rain drops are falling to enhance the youth
Did you remember me after such a long time
How long will you hide in the skies
You come and go like a guest
If you promise to stay with me forever.. ..I will hold you close with my hands.
If you want to come will I stop you?
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my nose ring
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my ear ring
"like my bangles, and anklets and.. ..like ornaments I wear everyday"
Shall I preserve you like a childhood friend?
Like the blooming youth of a girl shall I see myself in you?
"Like the song on my lips, like the poetry of a poet and.. ..as the dreams in my eyes if you wish to be with me"
Father is very serious.
He wants to see you.
Let us go.
Shall I kidnap her?
Find her details.
The train started but where is your father?
Did father not come?
What are you searching for?
My father did not board the train.
You dont worry.
By the way how does he look like?
How does he look like?
I am asking about his appearance.
Far from it!
You should be thankful that he isn't the man of your life.Look!
We came to ask if there is anything we can do for you?
Where is Faruk?
"I don't know, just left, and went away."
Maybe he threw himself somewhere. or maybe he is getting ready to throw himself.
His life- insurance will pay his debts then.
"Do something ,Selim..."
Please ..-You know that i am Ümit's lawyer.
But I'll help you.I can recommend a good lawyer for him.
We're finished.
We simply got ruined.
"Thankfully, land register of this house is on me."
Could something happen?
Could we lose this house?
It depends on amount of the debt.
"But of course, as his wife you're debt's -partner.."
God damn it...
God damn him !
This incompetent guy!
"Come here, we can go outside for a bit if you want."
Since you couldn't carry out this work successfully why did you take such a risk?
Wait let me see the dimensions of this issue tomorrow first.
"Let us first see what's the issue befor you maul yourself, right?"
I 'il check on Beeren.
Everything is clear.
"In the middle of the business world, they proved that he is a thief."
"Even if he can get out of this mess, who's going to work with him again?"
He played with the future of the children.
This is the most important thing.
It looks like Mira will go from here before than that outskirts boy.
They will go away from here.
Right away!
You will talk with the foreman and will get the permission.
Thank you.
Is there any news from uncle Faruk?
What will happen if they find him?
Will he go to jail?
"He has to pay his debt, of course first he has to appear."
Give it! ~ Faruk calling.
"Yes, Faruk."
-Hi -I guess you need me more than you need her?
"Thanks, ..Thank you very much."
"How bad is the situation ,Faruk?"
"Very bad, very."
I am totally in a mess.
We guess so.
"Of course you're Umit's lawyer, you must know it."
But now I am here as a neighbor.
As much as I knew you were a hardworking man who loved his work.
We knew that everything was going well.
What happened that you came in this state?
"I made an investment in Japan,"
"I was in reserve incomes and a little risky but... ... the business was a flop, and the money lost."
Exactly.
"For a time being I managed by taking in cash from the account .. but after the rumors, everyone started to withdraw their money at the same time."
I was disintegrated.
How do you think to pay your debt?
Actually not everything is over...
There are also other investments I am waiting for the return.
"Those are solid, but I need at least 3 month till the money is back.. can't postpone the debts anymore."
"My problem is time, I don't have any other worry."
"Let's consider that you postponed your debts, how much can you pay?"
Everything.
Get it off!
Get it off!
"Release him, demon."
"I command you in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ."
"Tell me your name, wicked one."
He who commands you is he who ordered you thrown down... ...from the highest heaven into the depths of hell.
"In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, I now command you:"
Tell me your name!
"Hear, therefore, and fear, Satan, enemy of the faith."
"Give me your name, demon!"
Names!
Names!
Ancient serpents... ...depart from this servant of God!
Tell me your six names!
We are the ones who dwell within!
And I am Lucifer... ...the devil in the flesh.
Mr. Rose.
"Doctor, help him!"
"*After a few moments,* *Mr. Rose revived... *"
*... but the exorcism* *had to be abandoned. *
Emily was taken to her room and soon fell into a deep sleep.
The whole thing was a complete failure.
Describe her behavior from the night of the failed exorcism... ...until the time of her death.
Violence towards others and herself.
Sometimes she screamed for hours on end.
"She drove her head through windows, tried to bite..."
"Tried to bite holes in the walls, breaking several more of her teeth... ...as you saw in the postmortem photograph."
- You witnessed this?
"- Some of it, yes."
I tried to visit every day... ...and the family told me the rest.
Did you attempt another exorcism?
"I wanted to, but Emily refused."
"I say, ""Time out."
"Stop."""
"You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two."
"There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense."
"We don't fool around, we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get!"
"I said, ""Stop."
"This is nuts."""
"I mean, you know."
(Laughter)
"""This is crazy."
"We can't do this."""
"And Albert's like, ""What?"""
"And I'm like, ""I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it."""
"And he said ""Well, that's how we do it."""
"And I said, ""Why would you do it this way?"""
"And before I even let him explain,"
"I said, ""I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."""
"And he says, ""Like the Humane Society?"""
"And I said, ""Yes, like the Humane Society."
"Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed -- we're on in five continents, dude."
"We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this."""
"He says, ""OK."""
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
"Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum."
"Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down, gets up, shakes a little, takes another couple steps, falls down."
"I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all."
"Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress."
"And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, ""Albert, how long?"
"When does he get up?"""
"He's like, ""A day."""
"I said, ""A day!"
"How long does it take them to fall off?"""
"Btw, another great medicine that reduces inflammation is aspirin."
S:
"Aspirin, I've heard of that!"
Dr:
It's a helluva drug!
"Again, there are side effects to aspirin, it can effect bleeding, but at the same time, it gives dramatic effect by lowering inflammation."
S:
Right.
"And that is the main side effect, it's an age-old drug, and it's a blood thinner, if you get a cut or you bleed while taking aspirin, you might bleed more."
Dr:
Right.
"Blood thinner is a funny word, I'm not sure what it means."
I keep thinking paint thinner when you say that.
S:
That's how I imagine it.
Dr:
"It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating, it stops them from working very well."
S:
It's more anti-clotting?
Dr:
Right.
"And platelets are one of the key components in clotting, and they certainly affect it."
S:
"So your blood will have the same viscosity, it just won't clot as easily."
Dr:
Exactly.
And you could certainly paint a wall with either one.
S:
That's a little morbid.
Thanks so much
"For one of these things to be in the return value, two things have to be true."
"First, it has to actually match this regular expression."
I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
"So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size."
"Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green."
"I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so --"
I think we're OK.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"So, let's see,"
"let's take a different row of people, starting with you."
"I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four."
"Oh, I did this row already."
"Let's do the row before you, starting with you: one, two, three, four, five."
"Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead."
Five.
Seven.
Six.
Eight.
Three.
"57,683 -- squared."
Yuck.
Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
"I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two."
"Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer."
"Now, let me recap."
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Laughter)
While I explain something else -- (Laughter)
"-- I know, that you can use, right?"
(Laughter)
"While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation."
Let me explain what that is.
Do you know what goes on on the internet?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
(echo)
Are you going to learn how to use the technology?
I am a digital native.
Do computers scare you?
Are you afraid to use them?
Have you been on facebook?
Have you been on twitter?
Have you been surfing?
Do you even know what is on the internet?
Are you going to be my teacher?
Or just that textbook?
Because I want to know... what the world has to offer
And if you are not on the internet... and know nothing about computers. you can't be my teacher!
I said you can't be my teacher.
Make room for somebody who knows how to use the internet.
Do you think I am going to be ready?
Do you think I am going to be ready?
Do you think you are preparing me for the world that I have to live in?
Do you think I am going to be ready?
That's your job!
That's your job!
(echo)
Do you really think it is possible to be an educator in the information age and not use the internet?
"Continue to pretend, maybe the internet is just a fad."
Life was sort of stressful.
I couldn't sleep because of the fact that I was always thinking about how I could pay the creditors.
One of the ways that I thought I could solve it was having a lot of jobs.
At it's peak I had six jobs.
It was hard work because I was taking my annual leave and working weekends and evenings.
"Okay, so put some ones down here."
This is the last n-by-n block.
"Put some ones there, and this is N plus one down."
Put it there.
Put it there.
"So let's put these 1's down, cuz it's easy."
Then we'll work on these last four.
Everybody good with that?
Okay.
"We'll start this back up, we can have the lights back down, mood lighting."
"There we go, so first of all I guess we'll have to do that, get rid of that seven."
So first let's go ahead and put in those 1's.
So first of all we have -four on the diagonal not one.
"Second of all, we have 1's on the edges."
"We have a, two 1's out there, and then we have two ones over here."
"And what do they, where are they located?"
"Well, the two, if you look at what we did here, and at my notation this at, all the way at negative N, minus M. And this is it, minus M."
"And is five, this is, so there are four by 4s that are sitting inside of these things, right."
"Cause I picked five points, but really it's the interior four that matter, okay."
Alright.
And then over here I have M and N minus M. If I do a spy on that.
Here's what I got so far.
Look at that.
Kinda nice.
Laying down some diagonals.
Everybody cool with that?
Alright.
I've laid down the easy ones.
"So, so what I'm working with is the M I picked is how many points I'm going to happen this way and this way."
"So, right?"
"I have five points, but remember the last point is the same as the first so it's really and four."
"That's why I come down here and say, I have a four by four block right here, and at the fifth location, I drop this."
side.
I just cooked it up by adding this one to this one.
"Now, what's the solution with this new right-hand side?"
The solution with this new right-hand side is clear.
took one of these and none of those.
"So actually, it just changed around"
to this when I took this new right-hand side.
Okay.
"So in the row picture, I have three different planes,"
three new planes meeting now at this point.
"In the column picture,"
"I have the same three columns, but now I'm combining them"
"to produce this guy, and it turned out that column one"
plus column two which would be somewhere -- there is the right
column -- one of this and one of this would give me the new b.
Okay.
So we squeezed in an extra example.
"But now think about all bs,"
all right-hand sides.
Can I solve these equations for
every right-hand side?
Can I ask that question?
So that's the algebra question.
Can I solve A x=b for every b?
Let
me write that down.
Can I solve A x =b for every
right-hand side b?
"I mean, is there a solution?"
"And then, if there is, elimination will give me a way to find it."
"I really wanted to ask, is there a solution for every right-hand side?"
"So now, can I put that in different words -- in this linear"
You have to appeal to more of their senses in your teaching.
You should almost check a checklist.
"OK, we got sound going on, all right."
Hearing?
Hearing.
What am I doing on visual?
Am I doing any art work?
What am I doing on touch?
Am I getting their hands engaged?
All of that.
I think that happens a lot in the elementary or lower grades.
"And we figure high school, they don't need to do that anymore."
"And I think we're very, very wrong."
It's really the first time Adam Dunning has any positive feelings about
learning.
I feel good about going to school.
"I mean, school here is fun."
It's like the teachers care.
They help you out like regular school should be.
He has come to believe jail time is actually good for him.
Me being locked up was good for a learning experience for me.
"Because if I stayed out, if I didn't get locked up, I'd probably be dead or in a lot worse trouble."
I probably wouldn't be at a treatment facility.
I'd probably be back wearing an orange suit.
"For years, Adams says, he used drugs and alcohol to blunt the pain of his failures in school."
He's clean and sober now but worries about how long that can
last.
"The only thing I'm really afraid of going back to school are the kids around me, pressures."
They seen me before.
The know how I acted before.
I never been to high school when I was clean.
"I mean, it wasn't 30 days where I wasn't using."
"How can I say, you don't learn only the things written in books, but also you prepared for life."
I heard like that.
I know it like that.
Isn't that so?
You learn to differentiate the wrong from good.
"You don't have a diploma only, but also have a specialty that everyone would ask from you."
What kind of privilege is this?
"The simplest one, diploma from here opens many doors for you, you find a job easily, you establish your life even easier... you have a chance to reach your dreams."
This school provides possibilities like this.
So you want an opportunity?
Who doesn't want?
"Good, but what's your dream?"
I want to be a man.
What else can I ask?
Which profession do you want to choose Yaman?
I want to be an architect.
I want to draw the houses where people will be living.
I want it to be like this.
Shall we do something after the registration?
Okay.&amp;gt; But can't let me down at the last moment!
"No, I promise!"
But first let's get these things done.
"The school ambient hit me, I am in a huff in two minutes."
~Mira calling...
Yes sweetie.- Orkun where are you?
"I am at school, what happened?-I need you, can you come to me for a little?"
Where are you?
"By the seaside.- Why are you crying, what happened?"
I started a nightmare day...
I took my car from the sequestration police a little before.
This is all I can tell you.
"Oh no ! &amp;gt; My dad said, take it away quickly."
"But It, itself,  is not an appearance."
Hm?
What are we speaking about?
You!
"It's not  some abstract principle, somewhere behind here; that's also an idea."
"And when you  keep on looking and seeing that everything that has form depends upon a formless seer  of them, somehow."
"All of them report back, as far back as the attention can follow."
It evolves into emptiness.
Everything is coming back  to emptiness.
You have to prove this  for yourself.
This is why  I don't say it's a teaching; it's pointing.
Look.
"Ultimately, can what we are be a phenomenon?"
And a phenomenon  cannot witness itself.
"We say the ego  is aware of itself, but what's aware of that?"
So that awareness somehow comes into emptiness again.
And it is  the experience of this that brings clarity  and peace to the mind.
'What does the third eye see?'
"First, the second eye  and the first eye, then they are seeing  only things."
"And the third eye  is seeing what, also?"
"They call 'eye of intuition,' what is that one seeing?"
Hm?
[Music plays in the background]
[M:]
"Its light  is understanding, that is the light  of the third eye: intuitive understanding."
"But what sees third eye, also?"
Can the Seer of the third eye  be seen?
And by whom?
"All these questions,  they can be solved here."
Okay.
[M:]
Okay. www.mooji.org
[Student speaking].
Interesting.
"That's not something I'm going to demand right away, but what's a more important consideration?"
Second row here.
[Student speaking].
"Good, tell me your name... n cannot equal zero, David said."
"So m, n are in Z and n is not zero."
Ok?
"This is one possible answer you might give to this question, but it is not very satisfactory, for a few reasons."
Probably the most important reason is... we have no idea what this notation means.
What do you mean by m over n?
Right?
What's that mean?
The integers don't have a division defined on them.
Right?
What does it mean?
"Ok, so I'm just gonna say this is not quite good enough."
Because we don't know what you mean by... what's this symbol.
What does this mean?.
"Ok, so, let's try to be a little more careful."
And we can be guided by what we do know.
"So, let's think about the motivation."
"So, when we think about fractions, you know, we're usually thinking about trying to teach children something about dividing,"
"I don't know, cakes into pieces or something like that, right?"
"So, you know, you might for instance take a cake, which looks remarkably like an interval"
"[Laughter]... and dividing it into, I don't know, three pieces, and giving somebody one of those three pieces, ok?"
"We have a name for this fraction, we call it?"
One third.
Right?
Ok.
One third.
"Which really means one part of three, right?"
[laughter]
Joy:
"Because if you were having sex with yourself, one more question: that would mean that you have sexual feelings."
See?
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
David:
"Well, the thing is...okay."
"The important thing is, at least as far as thinking about my life-"
"If you are going to have a sexual relationship with someone,"
Joy:
Yeah.
David:
That's a lot of energy you have to spend into thinking about that
like thinking about that relationship.
Joy:
"So, what are you just lazt or what?"
[laughter]
David:
"Well, I still form relationships."
Asexual people have the same emotional needs as everyone else.
"So, I still have to think about forming relationships."
I just don't have to think about forming relationships sexually.
I have to think about how am I going to start a relationship without something else?
How am I going to form intimacy in a way that isn't based on sexuality?
Star:
Help me with this.
Because what you seem to be describing is more of a choice.
Than an orientation.
"Intially, I thought you were describing an orientation."
David:
"No, I am describing an orientation."
Star:
So it has this four pattern.
"So can we come up with any term that is a multiple of 4, what is our value?"
Well at 4 our value is minus 3.
What's the next multiple of 4?
8.
At 8 our value's minus 3.
So in general-- and if we did 12 we'd also get minus 3.
If you don't believe me you should try it out.
"So at any multiple of 4, we know our value is minus 3."
"So what I do is, they want to know the 55th term."
So what term is a multiple of 4 that's closest to 55?
"Let's see, is 56 a multiple of 4?"
Yeah.
56-- that's 10.
"14 times 4 is 56, right?"
"So the 56th term, we know the 56th term because 56 is a multiple of 4, just like 4 and 8 and 12."
So the 56th term-- I have trouble saying that.
Maybe I have a little lisp.
"56th term is negative 3, right?"
Because it's a multiple of 4.
"If the 56th term is negative 3, what is the 55th term?"
"Well the term before the negative 3 term is always the negative 5 term, right?"
"Up here, negative 3?"
It's always negative 5.
"So the answer is negative 5 is the 55th term, and that is choice A."
Very good.
"All right, let's move on to the next question."
"I know that one's a little hard, and those you always just have to experiment a little bit, try to see the cycle, and then make sure you have your terms right."
You know that you're starting on the first term as opposed to the 0 term.
And then figure out what the easiest value is as close what they're asking as possible and then you can kind of move backwards or forwards.
That's how I do it.
That's so you don't get too confused with the shifts on the terms.
And she's ferried a couple airplanes.
From North Carolina to Oklahoma.
Stuff like that.
Just little pick up...
You can see her picture up there.
That's her with her uniform on and that's her next to it with the...
"Oh, yes I can see that."
130-something pounds and...
She likes it.
"She says, ""I go to work for my hobby."""
Runs in the family then.
Came right down from you
When did you meet De then and where?
In Grand Rapids.
A flight to Chicago.
I was doing some commercial bill collecting.
And they had some kind of convention went went to around St. Patrick's Day.
So the boss flew down.
There was a big headquarters where the western... area...
That was - I forget the initials now.
It was like a commercial version of...
We did credit reports on places.
They'd have a group - say all the plumbing and suppliers would meet once a month and they'd discuss and you'd keep building habits.
We had a part of our outfit would
liquidate - if a place would go bankrupt
We'd send our crew in to get them out of bankruptcy.
"I remember one guy, we made him sell his airplane"
His twin-engine airplane.
He had a hot secretary.
"He got rid of the secretary, got rid of the airplane and he lived in east Grand Rapids."
Gave him so much money for groceries and that was it.
With the stipulation he couldn't even go to the building for a year.
Bay and the beach with the map and if we'd find something we'd just mark it.
"Because they're trying to get a drift pattern to the bodies, or survivors."
Then we'd come back and drop it off
But all those guys - the bodies that came in were all in the fetal position
And two guys survived.
One guy lived between
Charlevoix and [?].
Dad knew him quite well.
He said they started off with more than that on the raft a floating type thing.
"But it was so bad a night - just a nasty night, as you can imagine."
And the water felt warm to them.
Which it would
The water was 35 degrees and the air was 15 with sleet.
"They said, ""I'm just going to get in here and get warm."""
And they drifted away.
Two of them did hang on.
"Survived, out of the -"
But we could hear when they were breaking out -
"You listen at night, to the transitions on the channels."
Can you hear the radio of The Bradley before they went down?
Uh-huh.
Radioed in.
"It's breaking away, or bending away or"
"And when you flew out with - who was the pilot, again, that you flew out with?"
Don Hanson
"When you flew out, the goal of that flight was what?"
Flew all of the islands.
All around the shores of all the islands.
To look for survivors?
For survivors or anything that would be anything.
"And I was 16, 17 at the time."
Did you know at that time where the location of where The Bradley was?
Turn in a circle and clap!
Yay!
Those are our three dance moves!
Can we put them all together with music?
Let's try it! ♫ Music plays ♫
Let's all bounce.
Good job.
Now wave your hands.
And turn around
And clap.
Good job!
Let's try it one more time! ♫ Music plays ♫
Let's all bounce.
Good job.
Wave your hands.
And turn around.
And clap.
Good job!
You are a terrific dancer!
"If you'd like to send me an email and tell me when your special birthday is, maybe I'll give a shout out on one of my Tea Time shows!"
Email me at TAYLA@TEATlMEWlTHTAYLA.COM
Thanks for joining me on my birthday!
Bye! ♫ Music plays ♫
"this poem is called ""the lovers"" who see them going in the city if everyone is blind."
They take eachother by the hand.
Something speaks inbetween theire fingers
"In this video, we're going to look at a proof that the perceptron learning procedure will eventually get the weights into the cone of feasible solutions."
I don't want you to get the wrong idea about the course from this video.
"In general, it's going to be about engineering, not about proofs of things."
There'll be very few proofs in the course.
But we get to understand quite a lot more about perceptrons when we try and prove that they will eventually get the right answer.
So we get to use our geometric understanding of what's happening in weight space as to get a proof that the perceptron will eventually find a weight vector.
Okay.
There are forces surrounding this trial.
"Dark, powerful forces."
"Just be careful, Erin."
Watch your step.
I see.
Look...
"Father, you don't have to worry about me."
"I'm an agnostic, remember?"
"Demons exist, whether you believe in them or not."
Your involvement in this trial might just open you up to their attacks.
"Look, Father, I appreciate your concern... ...but you need to be worried about yourself."
"Ethan Thomas is using the medical aspects of this case as ammunition... ...and I have to be prepared for his attacks, so... ...with what little time we have, I think we need to focus on your defense."
"Now, what I need from you is more information about Emily's condition."
Specific details of how it progressed after the dorm-room episode.
"Well, after the first incident... ...she was sent to the university hospital for testing and observation."
"Emily once told me that in her dorm room, she resisted the demons... ...but at the hospital they overcame her."
So she believed... ...that her possession began at the hospital?
"Yeah, I think she did."
"And after that, things just went from bad to worse."
Emily!
Emily?
"Oh, my God."
Emily?
Don't touch me.
"Jason, please... ...don't leave me."
*And I never did leave her. *
*I stayed until the end. *
So much of what we shared was like a nightmare... ...but I wouldn't give up a single minute I spent with her.
"She woke me up, you know?"
"To things I never felt before, things I never knew I could feel."
I never knew how dead I was until I met her.
Thank you so much for your concern.
"It seems like you're doing some secret work, but I hope you're safe too."
"He was a bit strange, but he was a good man."
How can you tell?
"I'm not sure, but he smelled really nice."
"If you thought he smelled nice, then he must have eaten chicken or dumplings."
It wasn't like that!
It was a nicer smell than dumplings!
"It smelled like ""I love you""!"
Then maybe he ate both chicken and dumplings!
"Anyway, I feel like I met a really nice person today."
So you met a mysterious man in a black hat under the moonlight...?
Then maybe his name is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
Sir Moonlight Back Hat?
That's awesome!
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
So you're saying that ship and warehouse both belong to Yongmun?
Yes.
I'm sure they moved all the girls to the ship by now.
"If they both belong to Yongmun, then did they just loan them to the loan sharks?"
"If they loaned it out to a dirty man, then they must have had dirty business."
What should we do if Yongmun responds?
"If Yongmun comes forward, then we should too."
We may have a fight on our hands.
But...
I don't think they will.
That is the explosives manufactured by Choi Chul Joo.
They are more powerful than the explosives from China.
"If this deal with him succeeds, then will we have unlimited access to these explosives?"
Yes.
"If we add the power of those explosives to our army and weapons, we will not be lacking in the next attempt."
Is there a way we can obtain those explosives without Choi Chul Joo?
You're...
Moonlight Warrior!
Moonlight Warrior?
Wow.
That's not bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'll be a warrior fighting against evil men like Sir Moonlight Black Hat!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I will not forgive you in the name of justice!
Moonlight Warrior!
Why don't you finish your bowl of rice in the name of hunger?
Alright.
"Rice, I will finish you off in an instant!"
"Soup, you're with him!"
I'll destroy the both of you!
You are a true glutton of Joseon!
"When I see him next, I will definitely get his name."
"Your life is now at its lowest since you sold off your daughters. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you are to lift yourself up from there, you must invoke your sense of pride!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"If you really don't think you can make a difference, then you should just die!"
"If you're going to keep on living, then you must fight!"
I have been there and picked myself up.
He is right.
Let us pick ourselves from the pit and rise up together!
I forsook my own daughter and considered myself no less than an animal!
Thank you for helping us do something!
We'll do everything from this point on.
This is the promissory note that Choi Chul Joo wrote for me.
One day's interest is ten thousand yang.
"In ten days, he will owe a hundred thousand yang."
We will use his interest money and use it to buy back your daughters!
An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth!
He will try and set sail as soon as possible to minimize the interest payments.
Do whatever it takes to stop that ship.
Security is high.
It goes like this.
"Woo, woo, woo, you are my flower,"
I want to pick you and put you to my heart.
Kimho played a wonderful melody from the cultural revolution of Mao in China.
Behind me on the screen there was a big pictue with three people.
A pilot
A soldier
I don't remember his gesture.
And a girl with a red cap.
Forth question:
What must a somali businessman do to get his business running?
On the picture there was a sentence in three languages.
We must free Taiwan!
Fith question:
"What happend indeed, when someone migrates?"
During this time I concerned myself alot with Taiwan.
I watched lots of videos on youtube.
"One video shocked me, as I heard about it 30 years late."
"It was about a resistance fighter from Taiwan, who opted for absolute freedom of speech."
The government said: we will catch you.
He said: no you will catch my corpse.
70 days he barricaded in his office.
Then the police came to arrest him.
Shortly before that he burned himself.
Some minutes later the police entered and you saw a black burned corpse on the floor.
You couldn't recognise him.
He turned thin as bones.
His skin turned to scurf.
His arms were like this: fists towards the sky.
His 9 year old daughter was at his funeral.
She looked into the casket and didn't recognise that it is her father.
She cried and didn't understand why she should watch that.
"Unfortunately, Al Gore was busy but I did manage to speak to some other people who had quite a bit to say on the subject."
You look great.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Some information.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Hi.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you finally.
- Yeah.
You do such great work. - Thank you.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
What are you doing here at the moment?
"We're out here trying to show people that if they're eating meat, they're engaging in the number one environmentally most destructive behaviour they could engage in."
"And showing people that rather than cars and trucks, and SUVs even, rather than planes, meat is the number one cause of global warming."
Do people believe that when you tell them?
People are shocked to find out.
"We hear so much about cars, and trains and planes and energy, and people don't realise that it is actually the meat on their plate that's causing global warming rather than the car that they're driving even."
Some information here.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
How's it going?
Check that out when you have a chance.
Thank you.
Check that out.
Thank you.
"We use this catchy phrase ""cli-meat change""."
Its really just a way of to grab attention and get people to look in our direction long enough for us to give them a leaflet and explain the issue a little bit further.
OK.
"And get them to go home wondering how is it that meat causes global warming, rather than wondering what's on television tonight, or what am I going to have for dinner tonight."
Dr. Cartwright?
I recognize you from those courtroom drawings on the news.
You're much prettier in real life.
- May I sit?
"- Yes, please."
You're losing.
I had hoped Father Moore wouldn't need me... ...but I don't wanna see him put away.
How do you know him?
"Well, I was his parishioner at St. Vincent's Church... ...about 15 years ago."
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years when he called me last fall.
"But he needed help, so..."
"What kind of help, doctor?"
"He wanted a medical perspective from a psychiatrist... ...you know, one that he knew, trusted... ...to observe Emily's physical and mental state during this..."
During the exorcism.
Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Can you help our case?
"That girl was not schizophrenic... ...and she was not epileptic, or any combination of the two."
I've seen hundreds of people with those problems.
"They can be terrible afflictions, of course, but they don't scare me."
"But what you saw that night in Emily, that did scare you."
"God, if I'd known, I never would've been there."
"I started praying again since then, you know."
I examined that girl before I drove back to the city that night.
She was lucid... ...and she was completely aware of this separate entity inside her.
"When she wasn't in his grip, she was totally herself, completely normal."
The awareness of her alternate mental state is counterindicative of psychosis.
Crazy people don't know they're crazy.
That's right.
"You'll testify to all of this, in detail?"
Everything you saw?
Tape?
Who dares to throw it here?
"Salute, sir."
Everyone has different problems... ...and different solutions too.
Your daughter wants proof and we want your statement.
And you want your daughter's life.
On the reverse side of this tape... ...you must record in your voice that I'm telling you now.
Listen to it carefully.
"Dear daughter Radha, because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, I'm forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Your father Shreekant.
"After recording it, you'll keep it behind the big door of Mahalaxmi."
"Mr. Shreekant, if you or police will try to play any trick... ...I'll send you half a piece of Radha's body."
It will never happen.
Why are you breaking the utensils?
When daughter's body will come home you can break my skull.
I'll die but not bend at an ordinary goon.
Then I'll have to bend.
"Aunt, please try and explain him."
This is the time we must think practically.
After all it's a question of Radha's life.
"Come, Uma!"
"Why, Uma?"
Come Uma.
"Radha, this is Damodar."
"Because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, we're forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Fine!
And each of these wires connect two
letters into a pair.
"So in this case, you might see, the letter Q is going to connect with the letter E. Now you make 10 of those pairs."
Two letters in a pair will swap over.
"So if Q is connected to E, then Q and E would swap over."
That's an extra level of scrambling only available to the military.
"Now, this had the most number of combinations."
"Now, this calculation is going to be the hardest calculation, but we can do it."
So there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
How many ways to arrange 26 letters?
"Well, it's 26 times 25 times 24 all the way down to 1."
That's 26 factorial.
But we don't want every combination of 26 letters.
We only want to make 10 pairs.
"So that means there are 6 letters left over, which we don't care about."
"Because we don't care about them, that means we're allowed to divide."
And we're going to divide by 6 factorial.
Now there are 10 pairs.
We don't care what order those 10 pairs are in.
"Because we don't care about it, we can divide by 10 factorial."
"And the last thing to divide by, 2 letters in a pair."
"Well, if I swap them over, that would still be the same pair."
"If I had A and B, that's the same as B and A. That's still the same pair."
So I can divide by 2.
And I do that for each pair.
"There's 10 pairs, so I'm going to divide by 2 10 times."
Just 2 to power 10.
And that is how many ways that you can connect 20 letters into 10 pairs on the front of the machine.
How big is that number?
Shall we do that?
"150 trillion, 738 billion, 274 million, 937,250."
"So the total, 158 quintillion, 962 quadrillion, 555 trillion, 217 billion, 826 million, 360,000 flat."
"And if you multiplied that times that, you'd get 1."
Part B.
I'll do all of these.
We have 2/8.
"The inverse of 2/8 is 1 over 2/8, which is the same thing-- this is equal to 1 times the inverse of this."
"Times 8/2, which is the same thing as 4."
"Now immediately, you might see something."
"I guess, you see a pattern here."
"If I take 1 over a fraction, the result is the fraction swapped."
So the inverse of 2/8 is 8/2.
You just swap the numerator and the denominator.
So let's apply that to part C.
"If I have negative 19/21, its inverse is just going to be you swap the numerator and the denominator."
Negative 21/19.
"And if you were to multiply these two numbers, you would get 1."
The negatives would cancel out.
"The 21 and the 21 would cancel out, the 19 and the 19 would cancel out."
Part D.
"The inverse of 7, multiplicative inverse, is 1/7."
"And then finally, let's do E."
So the inverse of-- so they give us z to the third over-- so it's negative z to the third over 2xy to the third.
"So the multiplicative inverse of that-- one of the harder words for me to say-- is just going to be equal to-- so that's the inverse-- is going to be 1 over this, which is just going to be negative."
The denominator becomes the numerator.
2y to the third over z cubed.
Now let's go to this next section.
Divide the following rational numbers.
Be sure that your answer is in simplest form.
"So I'm just going to do every other one of these problems, just so that I don't use up all of your time."
So let's do this first one: part A.
"Well, I'll do it over here."
Part A. 5/2 divided by 1/4.
This is the same thing as 5/2 times 4/1.
"You are, you are in no condition to deal with this right now."

Faults are breaks in the Earth's crust where rocks move past one another in some way.
Typically faults are associated with earthquakes.
We've called faults 'boundaries' in class.
"We've talked about divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, but there are 2 types of common faults."
The first is a dip slip and the second kind is a strike slip.
Dip slips are in the top of the picture and this occurs when 2 pieces of land move vertically.
This leaves one of the pieces higher than the other.
A strike slip occurs when 2 pieces of land move horizontally.
Most of you would call this a transform boundary because the pieces of land move from side to side.
Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions.
Let's get started.
Let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much.
This should hopefully be a relatively easy question.
If I were to ask you what one fourth plus one fourth is.
Let's think about what that means.
Let's say we had a pie and it was divided into four pieces.
"So this is like saying this first one fourth right here,"
let me do it in a different color.
"This one fourth right here,"
I'll say it today before it's too late.
I've saved a woman from afire...
Saved a man from drowning...
"But now,"
Now...
I want to save a man who's fallen in love.

Now some late-breaking news.
"This evening, a fire broke out in a shoe factory in Dobong-gu."
"The blaze killed two firemen on duty... and a third, unidentified victim."
The firemen killed were 40-year old Suh Ki-soo and 30-year old Lee Jin-woo.
38-year old Lee Jo-hyung was severely burned and moved to a hospital.
The tragedy occurred in the basement of the building as the dispatched firemen tried to extinguish the flames.
"Finally, Hong will report on tonight's weather."
Rain is falling across the nation.
"The rain should quell the 20-day heat wave and open the rainy season, according to the Weather Bureau."
The early arrival of the monsoon... will most likely continue for a month.
"Especially starting the next month, a seasonal rain front will..."
Please draw me again.
"Actually, I'm leaving to study abroad next month."
"I know, you punk."
That's why I'm showing it to you.
I don't show this to just anyone.
There was something I really wanted to draw before leaving.
"If the chance came, I thought I could draw it well."
I really thought... that I could draw it well.
I know it already.
"You wanted to draw me, but it didn't turn out as you expected."
Yep.
And trying to gain some control on showing all that different science.

But it's terrible.
"That's uh, ."

"And, so, the desired for a straight test is very simple in nature to do."
They do a lot of stuff at

"Sure, exporting it out quick would either faxing back."
Uh-huh.
"But they should, but they should make it so there's a choice so people could have a responsive design and be able to read those things very quickly."
Yeah.
"Um, so I, so I do our newsletter so and the spell check, so. , people are just going to scale down hopefully, on the phone and stuff like that, but we still need to rethink the whole ,, ."
"I don't know if you could share this information, but do you have any idea how many people your newsletter goes out to?"
"Um, I think we have, uh, 1,300, I think."
"Okay. ,, ."
"Just curious, um."
"So this, you're bringing up an int..."
"We've only had a newspaper, newsletter for so, so long, so..."
Yeah.
You're bringing up an interesting course idea for me.
"Which is, um."
Taking an existing website and going through a redesign to become more responsive.

"My dad can go to bankruptcy, we can go down to Zero... we will rearrange our life according to that."
"What are those mom, what are those, what?"
"You mean the real, true happiness is this, those things?"
"My sweetheart, are we not a family?"
How fast have you given up ?
"You will see,"
That man will be ashamed for what he did...
And also for attacking my dad in front of everyone ..
He will apologize to dad in front of everyone...
"I am saying it again, I trust my dad."
We have to support him.
After all this I don't even care what people say.
And i know my father is not a thief.
I know that he never wanted to do something bad.
We will pull ourselves together.
"You also pull yourself together, please.."
Are you alright?
I am worried about you.

"And that Orkuc is an orkuc (blurt out) really. he wanders around with Hale, but I can't believe what Eylul did, how can one abandon the friend and go to them?"
"Instead of consoling Mira, both of them ran away..."
"I thought that ""plastic"" was next to Mira, he also went to Hale?"
"It looks like your receiver broke down, I am telling you since one hour."
"I am saying I saw him, I am saying she was in the car, I am saying he was with Hale."
"She needed moral support, by finding and putting her head on a pillow like this..."
"Okay, don't brisk up (simulate),i got it."
"I can understand all of them, but never Eylul."
"I will take one too, my head is exploding too."
"This night after talking to you, i did not get a wink of sleep."
I was so sad.
Who knows what they are talking about us?
So line I can be 6x plus 5y is equal to 3.
So if we were to subtract 6x from both sides you get 5y is equal to minus 6x plus 3.
And then you divide both sides by 5 and you get y is equal to minus 6/5 x plus 3/5.
So this is line I right here.
I'll do line q in a different color.
So q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
So let's subtract 5x from both sides.
You get minus 6y is equal to minus 5x.
"If you divide both sides by negative 6, you get y is equal to-- minus 5 divided by negative 6."
That's 5/6 x.
"Well, it actually looks like D comes into play."
Because the slope of this one is minus 6/5.
That's the slope of line l.
The slope of line q is the inverse of that made negative.
At this point it's a good thing to memorize.
I haven't proven it to you yet.
"If you want a line that has a slope perpendicular to this one, or a line that is perpendicular to this one will have a negative inverse slope."
So the inverse of this is minus 5/6 and the negative inverse is plus 5/6.
So this is the negative inverse of that.
So these lines are actually perpendicular.
So that is D.
See you in the next video.
We're on problem 27.
"And the question is, which equation best represents the graph above?"
"So before even looking at the choices, let's see what we can figure out about the graph."
So what's its y-intercept?
"So if we said that this is the equation of a line, we said y is equal to mx plus b where m is the slope and y is-- and b is the y-intercept."
"It's late, I'm getting slightly muddled."
So what's the y-intercept?
"Well when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 0."
So this is going to be equal to 0.
The y-intercept is 0.
"Now I don't know where that point is, frankly."
But --
linear algebra will find it.
The main point is that the three
"planes, because they're not parallel, they're not special."
They do meet in one point and that's the solution.
"But, maybe you can see that this row picture is getting a little hard to"
see.
The row picture was a cinch when we looked at two lines meeting.
"When we look at three planes meeting, it's not so clear and in"
four dimensions probably a little less clear.
"So, can I quit on the row picture?"
Or quit on the row picture before
I've successfully found the point where the three planes meet?
All I really want to see is that the row picture consists of three
"planes and, if everything works right,"
three planes meet in one point and that's a solution.
"Now, you can tell I prefer the column picture."
"Okay, so let me take the column picture."
That's x times --
"so there were two xs in the first equation minus one x is,"
and no xs in the third.
It's just the first column of that.
And how many ys are there?
"There's minus one in the first equations,"
two in the second and maybe minus three in the third.
Just the second column of my matrix.
And z times no zs minus one zs and
four zs.
"And it's those three columns,"
"right, that I have to combine to produce the right-hand side,"
which is zero minus one four.
"I mean, I don't have any doubt that the Coupe is a little bit better."
But the difference is not night and day.

This car is barely a convertible.
The roof aperture is so small it's more of a targa really.
And it's quite a fussy shape from some angels.
Those rear buttresses rise unexpectedly high.
And those ultra-low profile tires leave annoying amounts of vacant space in the wheel arches.
"And this particular example has 63,000 pounds of extras on top of the 200 grand list price."

This is a 1967 issue of the Uppsala newspaper.
A slum was being torn down in central Uppsala.
Behind that window my mother grew up.
"It was called ""unplanned workers' quarters""."
"Gran lived there, so I've sat at that window eating soup."
She had an inner window and an outdoor toilet.
She moved in the late 1950s.
This is Grandma on the steps.
The picture was taken in the 1920s.
Grandma was born in 1891... ...when Sweden was somewhere between Uganda and Ghana.
Here she is on the steps.
She's actually showing her hair.
Otherwise she always wore a kerchief when she left the garden.
"Mom had tuberculosis and was quite ill, so I was a very longed-for child."
Which I realized later.
"When I was born, people questioned whether she should look after me."
When I was four she had another bout and I stayed with Gran.
But by then streptomycin had come.
"It came in 1949, when I was one."
It cured the disease.
Previously you were consumptive.
"Once a consumptive, always a consumptive."
I remember from Mom that it was very shameful to have tuberculosis.
Robert is in charge of the lighting.
"It shouldn't be a ""Welcome to this year's knowledge gala."""
The reception is upstairs.
"Then we go downstairs, Princess Victoria comes and the kids sing."
"All right, number 14."
"In the xy plane, the equation you of line I is-- let me write that down-- number 14."
The equation of line I is y is equal to 2x plus 5.
"If the line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis, what is the equation of line m?"
"So I'm going to draw a graph for you, just so you understand what I'm doing."
But on the real SAT you really don't have to do this because you wouldn't want to run out of time.
"Oh man, I'm going to run out of time if I can't draw a straight line."
I'm being a stickler for this.
"Oh, I still couldn't do it."
I'll move forward.
"So this line, so y equals 2x plus 5."
"So if you remember from our slope and y-intercept modules, the y-intercept's going to be 5, right here."
And then the line's going to have a slope of 2.
Right?
So the line's going to look something like this.
That's line l.
This is line l.
"And then we want to know, they say line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis."
So reflection would kind of be the x-axis-- this is the x-axis.
"So it's like if we were looking at this in a pool of water, the reflection would be like if you took this and flipped it over the x-axis."
So the line m is going to look something like this.
Line m is going to look like this.
So a couple of things.
It's like the mirror image.
"If we flipped it, it's like we flipped it over the axis."
"So if the y-intercept here is 5, the y-intercept here is going to be minus 5."
Right?
Because we just flipped it.
"And similarly, if every one this moves up 2, right, because that's at slope."
2.
For every one we move here to the right we're going to go down 2.
So the slope is going to be the negative of this or negative 2.

We are in charge of His Majesty's wellbeing as well  as maintaining the palace traditions and rules.
We are the hidden hands that allow the palace to function smoothly.
Everything we do is for His Majesty and the palace.
All of you need to remember and remind yourselves of this.
Yes sir.
"Since the King is new on the throne, all eunuchs  are to be on standby without any shift changes."
If you stay here His Majesty will be in danger.
Don't move a muscle.
"I said, don't move!"
Who is that person?
He came with a recommendation from Yoon-jungho Minister.
Yoon-jungho Minister ... hmm.
He is the future of the palace inner power.
What do you mean?
"Since you became the Head of Eunuchs, you have become sneaky."
As for you...you may be a rat sitting on top of rice pot  but you never know when your luck will run out.
"If you want to stay there for long time, you need  to learn to tame young ones like him."
"Worrying about your food bowl, you must be getting old as well."
What would be more important than one's food bowl?
"You know, I almost got beheaded this time."
"I trust you, so please take care of me in the future as well ... hmm?"
"Your Majesty, please lay to the left of the queen."
"Your Majesty, raise your left side  so that your heart will be higher."
"First, kiss the lower lip and suckle it."
Then you must swallow her saliva.
"Place your hand on her lower stomach, then start caressing her."
Continue until her breast enlarges...
Then cover her breast with one hand; cover it completely.
"Your Majesty, you may start your movement."
"The Queen must embrace His Majesty's waist,  then accept his penetration."
"Your Majesty, I am ready, so go ahead."

3 times 3 is 9.
We did the whole thing.
They're just repeating the same question.
That equals 10.
That's choice B.
Rewind the video and see what I did here.
3 times 3 is 9 times minus 3i plus 3i minus i squared.
"These terms cancel out and you get a minus i squared, which is minus negative 1."
"So you have 9 plus 1, so that equals 10."
So that is choice B.
That's crazy.
They just gave us the same problem twice in a row.
All right.
They're giving us more and more imaginary problems.
"But these are fun, especially if they're going to repeat the same question."
"Problem 30, if i is equal to the square root of negative 1-- well, I'll just keep writing it because they keep writing it."
It's good as a reminder. i is equal to the square root of negative 1 and a and b are non-zero real numbers.
What is 1 over a plus bi?
"Well, once again, if they kind of want us to rewrite this, they probably just want us to get rid of the i's in the denominator."
So we multiply times the conjugate of this complex number.
"So we multiply times a plus bi, the conjugate over the conjugate, a plus bi."
The conjugate isn't this whole thing.
The conjugate is just a plus bi.
"Oh sorry, we should be multiplying times a minus bi. a minus bi over a minus bi."
"The conjugate of a plus bi, just so you get the terminology right, is just the a minus bi."
But I'm doing a minus bi over a minus bi.
So I'm not changing this fraction because this obviously is 1. x over x is the same thing as 1.
So let's see what this is equal to.
"Well, the numerator just becomes a minus bi times 1, which is a minus bi."
"Then you have a times a, which is a squared. a times minus bi, so it's minus abi."
"Then you have bi times a, which is plus abi."
I'll write it down here.
And they're like pissed.
"Well, as pissed as a news anchor can be."
"-Boy, that interview on osteoporosis on Good Morning America sounded a lot better now than it did a few minutes ago."

"Maybe if they took her and crammed her into a dryer or if they took him and rammed his head into a fire extinguisher, then it would get 8 million views and we would all go"
"""Yeah, I get it."""
"Not that I recommend ramming a news anchor's head into a fire extinguisher,"
I'm just sayin'.
"If such a thing did happen, the video might go viral."
But you know what else you should cram into a dryer?

. And that's still not the end of the story.
"We're gonna look at one more really interesting al-, algorithm that has, lots of important applications, called a Rabin Karp Algorithm."
Invented by two Turing award winners.
Michael Rabin and Dick Karp.
"I can remember hearing about this algorithm, from my friend, Dick Lipton, who explained it to me over the phone, and, I, he explained it to me in about, fifteen seconds, and I realized I had to have this, in the book."
"And, so now, here we are, presenting it."
"Th, that was, in the 70's."
"So the basic idea for the Rabin-Karp algorithm is, has to do with hashing."
They surely don't wash his feet.
None of the things that a great aristocrat is supposed to do when a stranger comes up on their shores.
Even lowly ones should receive this treatment.
Remember what Nausicaa said when she saw
Odysseus at the beginning of book six.
He was basically dead.
He had no clothes on.
He was totally bedraggled.
He was in that beggar situation.
Even worse off than he is right now.
At least he has rags on when he approaches his own house.
"When Nausicaa saw that uh-huh, naked and destitute Odysseus, she said even this person deserves our respect because all guest friends come from Zeus."
"So she said in book six you got to be nice even to those lowly people, rode down to the totem pole."
But the Suitors don't have any of the graciousness of this.
They don't give him hospitality.
"They're busy you know, hoarding and taking Odysseus' goods without sharing anymore themselves."
"Page 366, that comes out."
"Then Odysseus, as he, as he works his way into this group has a chance to tell his story."
We've seen him do this in the context of
Eumaeus.
"When he offers a story, Eumaeus listens to all the details and makes a connection with them."
"Not so, with the suitors."
"Odysseus goes on, talks about being a"
Cretan sailor.
They don't understand the meaning.
"They don't understand that, yeah, maybe there's a stranger here we should be nice to."
They have no fellow feeling.
No linkage with Odysseus.
368.
"That comes off, they treated him very rudely."
Contrast this with what Eumaeus does.
Eumaeus is doing the right thing.
"So here, more work is going to get done."
"And now my force, I would say, is maximal."
"So I've got lots, and lots of force finally."
And so it would be something like this.
"And so based on my curve, I've also demonstrated another point, which is that, the first issue, getting us from point one to point two, really helped a lot."
Really.
"I mean, that was the big, big deal."
Because you needed some space here.
"Again, this space really was necessary to do work at all."
"And now that we've gotten rid of the overlap issue, now that we've gotten these last few myosins working, we have even more gain."
But the gain was really-- the biggest advantage was in that first step.
"Now as we go on, let's go to step four."
So this is step four now.
"As we go here, you're going to basically see that this is going to continue to work really well."
"Because you have your actin, like that, and all of your myosins are still involved in making sure that they can squeeze."
So all the myosins are working.
And our titin is just a little bit more stretched out than it was before.
And our force of contraction is going to be maximal.
"And you're going to have-- and so here, I'm drawing the z-discs again."
They're very spread out.
Our sarcomere is getting longer and longer.
And our force of contraction is the same.
"Now let's just take a pause there and say, why is it the same?"
Why did it not go up?
"Well, it's because here, in stage three, you had 20 myosin heads working."
20 out of 20.
"Up here, you had something like 16 out of 20 working."
"Here, we said maybe zero out of 20 right?"
"And here, you again have 20 out of 20."
So you still have an advantage in terms of all of the myosins working.
But there's no difference between 0.3 and 0.4.
"Because again, all the myosins are working."
You broughtthe right decision.

Now on problem 37.
And they say what is the value of xy minus yz.
"Statement one says, y is equal to 2."
"Well, that by itself doesn't help us."
That just tells us 2x minus 2z.
So if you don't know what x and z are you can't figure out what this whole thing is if you just know y is equal to 2.
So that alone doesn't help.
Statement two is x minus z is equal to 5.
"Now this is interesting because this expression, we can factor out the y."
What happens if we factor y out of both of these expressions?
I'm going to just rewrite it. xy minus zy-- I just switched the y and z-- that equals x minus z times y.
"Well, we can figure out x minus z from statement number two. x minus z, this is equal 5."
And we know what y is equal to from statement one.
So y is equal to 2.
So we can definitely figure it out as long as we have both statements and we can show that the answer is y is equal to 2.
"So the answer is, 2 times 5 is 10."
But we didn't have to figure it out.
We just have to know that we could figure it out if we had both of these data points.
"One by themselves, you wouldn't be able to solve it."
So the answer is C.
Both statements together are sufficient but neither alone is.
Problem 38.
"OK, they drew us a picture."
"Let me see if I can draw that same picture,"
looks like some type of device.
"So it looks like that and then they have the other end, and the other end looks like that."
"There are these handles, or something that looks like handles"
I haven't read the problem yet.
So they say will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?
So this is a book rack.
"Second, it has to be in this string."
So a1 does match this regular expression.
"We're looking for things like a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, etc."
There's actually an a1 in this string.
"So, yes."
2b does not match this regular expression.
"For this particular regular expression, the first letter always has to be a letter and not a digit."
This doesn't work out. b2 looks very promising.
"It's one of the strings we would match, except that it's not actually found in our haystack string."
"It can't be part of the return value. cc doesn't match, because we're looking for things like a1, b1, c1 that have a digit in the second position."
This is not a digit. cc3 does not match because it's three characters long and we're looking for strings that are two characters long.
"44 doesn't match, because it doesn't start with a through z. d4 looks very good."
"It's the sort of thing we would match from this regular expression, but it's not actually in our haystack string."
Instead we have 44d.
The empty string--this was a bit of a ringer or distracter thrown in-- doesn't match our regular expression.
It's too short.
"It's zero characters long, and we're matching things that are two characters long."
"But finally c3 matches our regular expression and it's present in the string, so yes."
And the answer is 88.
It takes 7 steps to go from start to goal if we just count the go straight steps.
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
"And we have to turn once in this spot right over here, which costs an additional -5, so we pay a total of -12."
That plus 100 gives us 88.

"Well, here are her total reading scores."
"Last year in the seventh grade, she made a dramatic leap."
"Her comprehension score went from fourth grade, second month up to seventh grade, nearly a three year gain."
"What's very distinct in our community is a division between blacks and whites, right?"
"What, specifically, about the way that they speak?"
How does she feel about the way mama speaks?
"She feels embarrassed because, like, she's still using improper English."
She feels it's improper English.
Great.
What else?
What other issues about race have come up?
I definitely noticed a willingness in Sarah Lee to think beyond the first initial thought.
"She's starting to push herself beyond that, beyond cliches."
She compares how the schools-- the stamps are different from the schools.
She's highly intelligent and she's a good thinker.
She's capable of thinking through ideas.
But perhaps the best witness to Sarah Lee's progress is Sarah Lee herself.
Remember this moment from a year ago?
He used it in-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
I have matured a lot.
I have participated in my classes.
I've been behaving well.
I've been doing my homework.
My grades have been pulled up.
I've been working very hard.
"And, like, I've been overcoming the mistakes that I did many years ago."
It's clearly beginning to happen for her.
And I think this is going to be a wonderful year.
She's a wonderful girl.
And I think she will leave here and go to high school and college.
"And I hope that whatever her wishes are, they will be realized."
So far our journey through these young lives has been a difficult but mostly hopeful one.
leads a lonely existence.
"A bright boy who loves science, he cannot succeed in school."
"Forgetful and willful, Nathan has been a handful from the beginning."
Getting out of line and talking in class--
"Those were some things. --kicking other kids, you know."
From kindergarten on there were signs of discipline problems.
So Nathan's parents had him tested.
They came up with a diagnosis of ADD without hyperactivity.
And so we knew that the pencils rolling on the desk or dropping or anything like that would probably take him off task.
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.
Some days I wake up and it's just like two or three pieces to put together.
And other times it's like 500 3D puzzle or something.
Ritalin was prescribed.
But Nathan's parents learned there was no magic pill.
We went up to 10 milligrams.
It helped for a little while.
But we still had the problems with getting the assignments home.
So his parents took him off Ritalin.
But now they had nothing.
"He would be real sad that he was not able to learn, that people didn't like him, that they were out to, you know, ridicule him or make fun of him."
He got to where he hated everything when he started school.
He didn't want to
"learn, didn't want to read, didn't want to write."
Didn't want to go.
He didn't want to go.
"A lot of times when, you know, he's not in a good mood and he's real irritable and says stuff like why am I even here and stuff, I get real worried."
I hope he doesn't get too drastic.
"And when he said, I just shouldn't be alive."
"I said, this child does not have to go through this."
His parents are desperate.
"For them, public school is not working and private school is too expensive."

"Made me stop and think for the first time in my life that I was part of the problem, not part of the solution."
"I saw the birds die, I saw the trees die."
I saw the soil changed.
And it was not until I was paralysed that I was willing to admit that I was the problem.
I ended up with a one in a million operation.
"I walked out of the hospital, with a one in a million operation, but I walked out a much different individual than I walked in."
"I knew that what we were doing was wrong, was absolutely, totally non-sustainable."
Here's a scone that my wife made.

Vegan.
Everything in the house is vegan.
There's no animal products in anything that we have here.
And it tastes good.
Everybody thought the same way.
It was mass hysteria.
"Everybody was doing it, it must be OK."
You started and went on from the time you were a child.
"And can you imagine what it was like, when I first asked myself the question:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
It was one of the most thought-provoking questions
I had ever had in my life.
"Because I had never even considered that, and when you stop and think about it, it is so straightforward and open:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Do we need them for protein?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Are they good for us?"""
Absolutely not.

He was a bit of a comedian.
He showed a film where he put up an axe on a greased pole.
The natives had to try to take it down.
Dad was so upset that we left in the middle of the lecture.
It was so condescending.
Of course people wanted a good axe.
They shouldn't have to do circus tricks for it.
That attitude affected me a lot.
Dad identified more with the natives than with the explorers and the company head.

Do you see Sweden in the same way as you see other countries?
Sweden is an integrated part of the world.
"We have a tendency to see Sweden... ...as more ""permanent"" than it is."
"We speak of ""Swedish values""."
When I was in the student union in 1969-1970 we handled a secret fund where women could borrow money to go to Poland and get an abortion.
We didn't have abortion in Sweden in 1970.
Female students in Uppsala borrowed money from us.
Then they took the boat to Poland and got abortions.
That was Sweden in 1970.
Sweden legalized abortion a year after India.
Now we think it's a modern part of Swedish society.
I'm gravely concerned that it might become public works project involving concessions.
We don't have the luxury to spare a single second considering the financial condition of the Japanese government.
We must figure out how we really do the decontamination work.

I wanted to take a year of your life to give back to a positive cause in a real world setting.
Now where was she living and where were you living at the time?
Sal:
"She was based in New Orleans,which is where I grew up."
But I was in Boston at the time.
"And we agreed that she would go home, and we would get on a conference cal,l and we'd figure out something."
I used Yahoo Doodle to tutor her.
"And a couple months later, that worked out."
"Then I started tutoring her brothers, a couple other cousins."
"The whole time, I still had a day job."
"And about a year later, it just became hard for me to scale myself:"
I had trouble scheduling with all my different cousins and family friends and all the rest
And I had a buddy who I was talking to over dinner.
And I said:
"""You know, I'm really enjoying this tutoring thing that I'm doing after work."
"But it is getting difficult."""
"And he said ,""Why don't you just record your lectures and put them on YouTube?"""
"And I said; ""No, YouTube is for dogs on skateboards."
"It's not for serious mathematics, """
"But I tried it out, and, long story short:"
My cousins said that they liked me better on YouTube than in person.
"And other people did too, and they just kept watching it."
"So, it's about 2.5 million people a month are watching the videos."
Tom:
And you've got about 2200 videos.
Sal:
"It is now pushing 2800 videos, on everything from basic addition to vector calculus, and biology, and chemistry, and whatever else."
Tom:
Is this a commercial enterprise?
Are you doing this just to keep the country better informed?
Sal:
No.. a lot of my buddies from the very for-profit investment world are wondering what happened to Sal.
But I decided to make it a not-for-profit.
I am gastronome.
I explore unique foods that are available to us all over the world.
"In 2002 I founded, as part of my work, a nonprofit organization"
"The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation,  whose goal is to plant 18 billion fruit trees  and nut trees all over the planet."
"We're at about 200,000 right now."
"And, that same year that we founded this organization, a wonderful organization  filled with amazing people,"
I ran into the most incredible fruit and nut tree in the world.
It is the source of the Earth's favorite food.
"That's right, the population of the world  has one favorite food."
"And of course, it's chocolate."
"Now, in my exploration of this I stumbled into it because I was a health food fanatic."
I never ate chocolate since I was fifteen years old.
This was about when I was maybe 32.
I stumbled into  this form of chocolate here.
This is raw chocolate.
"This is chocolate  in its unique original form, a form that is called -- by the British it is the slang word ""coco."""
But it's really cacao.
That's the real word.
"And is sometimes called a bean,  but it's really a nut."
It is the most widely eaten nut in the world that nobody actually eats.
I was in Hawaii with some friends.
We were peeling them.
They started  showing up in our smoothies.
"We'd get these coconuts,  we'd break up coconuts and make these incredible drinks."
We called them superfoods smoothies.
"And we started adding them to these smoothies and I asked my friend one day,"
"I said, ""What is this?"""
I didn't know what it was.
"And he said,  ""Oh, just peel the next one, and eat it."""
"So, I did eat it."
And that's what it looks like on the inside.
"And, at that exact moment that I ate that food,  I was touched by the spirit of chocolate."
I Kiss you sir congratulations

I'll have my coffee then leave why the rush?
I'll go home and look on the internet for a home to rent since you're looking for a house for rent it means you're staying in Istanbul
No ..
Not for this reason
I don't want to be a burden on Mrs. Nesrin it's not nice
And if you see any house suitable for me just tell me
Ok .. what are you looking for?
"Not very expensive, small, doesn't have any problems no noisy neighbors.. would be enough do you have a friend for me I can share the house with her in fact there is"
Where?
Very close to here
Do you know the owner?
Yes I know him very well but is there a proper house in this area
There is
"Ok, can we go tomorrow and see it together in fact in fact we don't need to go anywhere because the house I'm talking about is this one it has many rooms Jeren"
Why don't you stay here? you mean to live together here
You said you need a friend in the house
I wish for you to live a beautiful and happy life
God willing
Now you have a big responsibility
I've missed her a lot.
"We talk on the phone, but of course that's never quite the same as hanging out with your parents in real life."
"It's such a nice togetherness, you know?"
I like it.
I like watching people walk around with their parents because I think it makes people make more sense.
I like seeing freshman run to their parents because they haven't seen them in so long.
That'll be me this year.
We're told to graph this system of equations and identify the number of solutions that it has.
And they have the system of equations here.
So they want us to graph each of these equations and think a
little bit about the solutions.
"So the first equation here-- I'll rewrite it, so I'll graph it in the same color that I write it."
"This first equation's already in slope-intercept form, y is equal to 3x plus 1."
"We see that the slope, or m, is equal to 3, and we see that the y-intercept here is equal to 1."
"So let me be clear, that is also the slope."
I just called it m because a lot of times people say y is equal to mx plus b.
So we can graph it.
"We can look at its y-intercept, the point 0, 1 must be on this graph."
"So that's the point 0, 1 right there."
"This is the y-axis, that is the x-axis."
And the slope is 3.
"That means if we move 1 in the positive x-direction, we're going to move up 3 in the positive y-direction."
"So we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3."
"If we moved 2 in the x-direction, we would move up 6."
Just like that.
Because 6 over 2 is still 3.
"Likewise, if we moved down 1, if we went negative 1 in x, we would go negative 3 in y."
"So negative 1, negative 3."
Because negative 3 divided by negative 1 is still 3.
"If we went negative 2 in x, we would go negative 6-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in y."
"So these are all points along the line, and I can connect the dots now."
"Pennycress is a winter annual, and the seeds contain a very high oil percent."
"This crop is easily grown and harvested, with minimal affect on soybean production."
"And Terry concluded that if pennycress was planted in all soybean fields, off season, at 1,000 pounds per acre yield, it could produce about 3.8 billion gallons of additional bio-diesel."
And the remaining meal can also be used as an organic fertilizer and natural weed killer for
"low-acreage, high-value crops."
It's also a source of monomer for bio-based plastics.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Hannah.
Tell me a little bit about your internship this summer with Dr. Phippen.
I understand you were working on his US Department of Agriculture grant?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I got to work at the University of illinois at Urbana-Champaign"
[Text on screen:
"Hannah, UlUC] with small grains."
So wheat and oats.
And I got to do a lot of data collection on trying to find the best variety of wheat and oats.
And lots of work out the field.
Beth Seaton:
So are you a student at the University of illinois?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I'll be transferring there in the fall."
So I'll be a junior in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
So what kind of advice would you give to anybody who is considering this sort of agricultural internship?
Hannah:
"I would say, definitely go for it."
"Because, I didn't know anything before"
I started it.
I got to learn a lot about different crops and
I got to get some hands-on experience before I started in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
So N becomes Y. Your code lights up.
Let's write that down.
"Let's do the next letter, U. U becomes T. Let's do M. And"
I've got H this time.
B. And E is W.
"Notice here, we had Y turn up twice."
And they turned up for two different letters.
"So N became Y, and then later on, E became Y. That's unusual."
The other unusual thing you may notice is that the two E's in Numberphile have turned into two different letters.
"So here, E became Y. But the second E became W."
"Now, this is why the Germans thought they had an unbreakable code."
"Old-fashioned code in the past, pen-and-paper codes that they used to use, if you had the same letter, it would become the same letter in the code."
Enigma is different.
"Probably, each time you did it, you would get a completely different code."
"Now, if we can break this code-- and by we, I mean the"
"Polish, the British, and the Americans-- if we can break this code in World War Il, we'll be able to read those German secret messages, which is what we did."
So let me show you how this machine works.
Let me open up the machine.
So we have three things here at the top.
These things are called rotors.
"And inside those rotors, try and imagine lots of wiring."
And it's all crisscrossed wiring as well.
"Now, if I press a letter, have a look what happens."
The rotors move.
"When this rotor does a full turn, it'll kick the next rotor one place."
"And then, the right-hand rotor keeps going."
"Eventually, the middle rotor does a full turn, and it will kick the left-hand rotor one place."
"So a fast rotor, a middle rotor, and a slow rotor."
"Imagine it like it's hands on a clock, like you've got a minute hand and an hour hand and a second hand."
That's the idea.
"Brilliant machine though this is, all it is, really, is just a circuit."
Here is a battery.
"Apparently, a quarter of men have a problem with premature ejaculation."
The rest of just don't think it's a problem.
"See, science isn't all progress."

Gordon Brown has got his big new idea.
He says that he wants to make children stay at school until they're eighteen.
"That's just not living in the modern world, is it?"
Seventeen year olds having to go to school.
Who's going to pick their kids up from primary?
He wants to bring in ID cards. with retina scans and 49 items of information.
"ID cards won't stop your identity being stolen, it just means that once it's stolen, you're fucked."
"""Oh, I've left my wallet in the hotel,"
"I'm going to need new eyeballs and a finger transplant."""
"Gordon Brown has seriously said, he wants listening devices put into lamposts to fight terrorism."
Is that how terrorists work?
"""Come over here, we must discuss our evil plans in this brightly-lit area."
"We'll sing them out like a f* barber shop quartet."""
Do you think George Bush even knows who Gordon Brown is?
He probably thinks Tony Blair's put on weight and has had a mild stroke.
See that bishop up North somewhere who said that the floods were God's judgement on homosexuals.
"If that were true, Brighton would be like f Atlantis by now."
I'm all for gay adoption.
Gay men would make brilliant dads.
They already know where all the best parks are.
They already know how to put talcum powder on to a sore bottom.
I'd have loved to have had a gay dad.
Remember all that stuff at school.
"""My dad will batter your dad."
"My dad could batter your dad."""
Let's say I've got me a set of vectors.
So let me call my set B.
"And let's say I have the vectors v1, v2, all the way through vk."
Now let's say this isn't just any set of vectors.
There's some interesting things about these vectors.
The first thing is that all of these guys have length of 1.
"So we could say the length of vector vi is equal to 1 for i is equal to-- well we could say between 1 and k or i is equal to 1, 2, all the way to k."
All of these guys have length equal 1.
Or another way to say it is that the square of their
lengths are 1.
The square of a vi whose length is equal to 1.
Or vi dot vi is equal to 1 for i is any of these guys.
"Any i can be 1, 2, 3, all the way to k."
So that's the first interesting thing about it.
Let me write it in regular words.
All the vectors in B have length 1.
Or another way to say is that they've all been normalized.
That's another way to say that is that they have all been normalized.
Or they're all unit vectors.
Normalized vectors are vectors that you've made their lengths 1.
You're turned them into unit vectors.
They have all been normalized.
"So that's the first interesting thing about my set, B."
And then the next interesting thing about my set B is that all of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
"So if you dot it with itself, if you dot a vector with itself, you get length 1."
But if you take a vector and dot it with any other vector-- if you take vi and you were to dot it with vj.
"So if you took v2 and dotted it with v1, it's going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j."
All of these guys are orthogonal.
Let me write that down.
All of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
And of course they're not orthogonal to themselves because they all have length 1.
I don't want to be involved in this anymore.
"Believe me, I wouldn't ask you this if there was any other solution."
"How could you believe that this is the only solution, Yasar?"
Enough...
Stop reminding Mustafa of Narin anymore.
Isn't everybody trying to make Mustafa forget her and get out of the hospital?
"If my brother forgets Narin, he will also forget himself."
"I thought like you, I wanted him to forget Narin..."
"But, he is my brother."
"When we take Narin out of him, we see that there is nothing left."
"And, you will see it as well."
You will understand.
It is true that we gave Mustafa Bulut high dosage medicine.
But this can't be the only reason for him shutting himself off and not remembering anybody.
He refuses to eat and take a test.
"In fact, he is aware of everything."
What he went through and being here affect his situation as well.
"For every patient in this kind of situation, there is a circumstance that initiates the healing period."
A constant that attaches him to the life.
- What can it be?
- It can be anything.
"Something he hid in the deepest corner of his mind, something he didn't share with anybody,"
Something that he would never give up even though he could give up on everything else
An object...
A memory...
A person...
We honorably succeeded in every war within 10 years.
"In 10 years, we created 15 million young people at every age..."
Sahan came here from Diyarbakir Prison.
He had very difficult times there.
"Now, whenever he sees somebody with uniform, he stands at ""Attention"" and starts singing a march."
We built railroad tracks across the country...
The woman paid him no heed.
"So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her."
Then Indra disappeared.
(Clap!
Clap!)
"And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared."
He realized at once what had happened.
"So, he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice."
"So, the god Vishnu arrived."
"""Are there any witnesses?"""
"""Just a one-eyed monkey,"" said the Brahmin."
"Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened."
Vishnu gave his judgment.
"""The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin."
"May he be called to wash away his sins."""
"So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse."
"And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ..."
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India there is a rape every three minutes.
"In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases."
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
And it's not only about women.
"Look around you, look at your own countries."
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
"If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail."
"If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites."
"If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks."
There is a trend here.
"And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth."
"So, have we all become one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?"
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
Good morning.
"And so, that's the exciting thing about pennycress."
It's a brand new crop.
"No one has actually done much research on this particular crop, and so the possibilities are endless on pennycress."
And it's exciting to have students involved in this type of project.
And the employment opportunities are tremendous.
You're starting to see a lot companies starting to talk about green energy and green production.
"And so these students are going to be positioned very well, in terms of getting positions at these companies,"
"looking at new crops, and breeding new varieties, and things like that."
Beth Seaton:
"It's really exciting that we have these opportunities for students here in Macomb, illinois."
And I really appreciate you showing me your lab and talking to me about your project.
Win Phippen:
That's great.
Anytime.
"You know what, later on this week, we're actually having a Field Day about pennycress."
"It will be out at the research farm, and it's opportunity for not only producers, but also, say, for potential students and other students to come out and see what we're doing out in the field."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, great!"
I would love to come out if you would be willing to show it to me.
Win Phippen:
I'd love to.
Make sure to bring your boots!
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, thanks."
Win Phippen:
It should be fun.
Win Phippen:
All right.
Thanks for coming out.
This is the field plots for the pennycress research.
We've got several studies out here.
"The one to the north here is a planting density and planting methods study, where we are trying to answer the question of how many seeds do we need to put in the ground to get a decent yield."
Let's try that again.
"Actually,"
it's right there.
"And of course, I don't have a sim card here, so it didn't place the call, but it's incredibly fast and this was a real live local search."
The number is not stored in my address book or anything.
It literally took half a second to find it and call it.
Let me show you another one.
"So, a friend of mine told me about this museum here in"
Berlin.
He said there's all this cool Egyptian arts there.
"So I want to drive there, but the name is very long, it's complicated, I forgot it."
I can't remember what the name of the museum was.
"Well, maybe I could do something like this:"
Navigate to the museum with Egyptian stuff.
And let's see what I get back here.
So it recognized what I said.
"So this is going to launch Google navigation which will figure out where I want to go and, in fact, it's right there."
It's the Pergamon Museum.
So I can just click on it and get directions.
So let's think about what happened here.
"So, first of all, my phone is with me and it knows that I'm in Berlin."
So it knows to search here.
"Secondly, there are thousands of pages on the web about the Pergamon Museum which obviously talk about the Egyptian art that's in this museum."
"So, all that Google has to do here is relate and connect all these pieces of information together and come up with a magical answer like what you just saw."
This is precisely what Eric means by Cloud Computing Innovation.
Let me show one more voice action.
This happens to be my favorite.
"Listen to Lady Gaga, Just Dance."
"So this is going to launch your favorite music application, in my case it's Spotify, and it will just going to play the song for you."
We'll stop that.
So those are voice actions.
They are
And then they feel very happy here.
And I am happy when I see they are happy.
What impresses me the most is the credit from my customers.
"Before, when we were still not ready to open the fish-watching area."
Sometimes the customers would complain about us.
"But then later, after two or three months, the customers came back again"
He said
"I would like to come back, because I appreciate your service attitude"
This made me very happy
I was so touched.
Then all what they used to complain or even scold at me is nothing to me at all.
"With their credit and appreciation, I feel I need to work harder."
I should work harder to have the people see what we own.
"Here these ""screws"" got much ""torture"" from us"
Yap......
Because sometimes we force them to learn
And also we give them much pressure
"But from all this, you can see, from the first year, the second year, to the third year......"
"Everybody has improved himself gradually, everyone"
"Little by little, they are not afraid of approaching people"
"Gradually, they become more willing to try new things"
"Before, they always said, ""No, I don't want, I can't"""
We are happy when we see they are changing their attitude gradually.
These employees have grown up.
"So, the happiness is,"
That I put emotion whenever I am cooking
That I learn what I didn't know
That a tour guide shows me a Like!
"That means, yes, you are doing better"
Welcome to Tanayiku!

More ginger people.
That's why they couldn't send Prince Harry.
"They couldn't afford the resources required to start developing factor 60,000 sun block."
"It's not always the friendliest place in the world, Scotland."
I once saw an English guy in Glasgow trying to order a pint of lager and lime.
"The barman went, ""We don't do cocktails."""
"We can't just be dour, negative bastards up there."
John Logie Baird invented the TV
And when people came up to him congratulate him.
"He went, ""Ay, but there's f* all on."""
Are you looking forward to the Olympics in London?
"I'll take that as a ""no""."
They say the Olympics is going to rekindle English national pride.
"Come on, for 9.2bn you could have written ""Fuck off Germany on to the moon""."
The Spice Girls are getting back together.
The only way we're going to see Geri Halliwell draped in a Union Jack again is if she dies in battle.
I tell you what I think they should do in Big Brother.
"You know on eviction night when someone gets sent out, the people inside, instead of hearing screaming or booing or whatever, they should just hear complete silence and then a single gunshot."
"When I was at school, I could just never work out how to get girls bras undone."
"Then eventually I realised, these girls were wearing a different type of bra from my Gran."
"If you don't like that, you'll hate this next one."
The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth this year.
She was sixty-three.
"You could imagine at sixty three, the baby didn't have to force its way out."
It spent the last three months bungy jumping.
"Everytime she went for a s*, it had to brace itself."
Like the end of the Italian Job.
"Apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation."
"Basically, it's got an anaesthetic in the lining."
It makes you numb so you can lost for longer.
Or you can wear it inside out and you don't have to wake anybody up.
"Thanks, because that one can go either way."
"You know, just a normal day."
"About 9:30, the aide came in from the college class and said that Alex had not made it to school and wanted to know if she was supposed to be there that day."
"Of course, she was."
"She would just never answer her phone, so I went and told the office that I needed to go find her."
"But, I knew where she was, and I knew what had happened."
"Just in my heart, I knew."
She had taken a back road to school that morning.
"She wasn't supposed to take it, because it was a dangerous road."
"And that's where I found her truck, out in the field."
[Music]
"The doctors had come in the second time and told us that they didn't think Alex would make it - that they'd lost her several times, and they needed to know what we wanted to do."
And my husband and I had to make the decision to let her go.
We were out in the hall waiting for them to get her cleaned up so we could go see her one last time.
[Music]
I think everything about my life changed.
"For a long time, it was hard to laugh, to really be joyfully happy."
"There are times when Katrina and I would be out doing stuff, and I would feel like I needed to text Alex and tell her what was going on, because I knew she would like it."
And then I would remember I couldn't tell her.
I was supposed to be able to go visit her at college right now.
"You know, and embarrass her on campus in front of all of her friends."
I can't do that.
It's just a whole part of my life that's gone now.
[Music]
"She left me a note, oh, probably six or eight months before she had her wreck."
"Just ""Alex hearts you,"" you know, on my windshield with a dry erase marker."
It's still there.
"You know, I can't bring myself to wipe it off."
I look at it every day.
[Music]
"After Alex died, and we went home, I got on the internet to check her phone records."
"And my husband came up and he goes, ""What are you doing?"""
"And I said, ""I want to know if she was texting and driving."""
Khan's lessons are unscripted and unadorned.
His voice over a black screen as he writes or doodles!
His style has changed little since this all began back in 2004 as
Youtube videos to help his young cousins.
9 times the 6...!
"He's now recorded more than 2,400 lessons on everything from simple arithmetic to college-level biology."
Anyone can watch for free!
People are more likely to say thank you when it's free!
And thank you is worth a lot!
But what are Khan's lessons worth?
The Los Altos school district is trying to figure that out.
"Last year, the district used Khan lessons in five classes."
"The students did well enough that this year, the Khan method is in 40 classes to be used by every fifth and sixth grader in the district!"
We found that the students are really engaged in this type of learning.
It was a great addition to what we were already doing.
You might say this California school has flipped!
"Students get their lectures at home and come to school to do their homework, fundamentally changing the role of the teacher!"
The kids can really move through in their own pace.
And then I can see who is struggling.
"At home, students listen to Khan's online lessons."
"In the classroom, they practice what they learn while teacher Courtney Cadwell works with those who need help."
"When they're having fun and they're wanting to do math, that tells me that this is a good thing."
This educational overall comes from a man who was working as a hedge fund analyst until 2009!
Khan has a Harvard MBA and three degrees from MlT.
"You're kind of a math geek, I guess."
Aren't you?
"Yes, in the best form of the word!"
"In the beginning, he financed the Khan Academy from his own savings, until he was discovered by some people with money."
"Well, it's amazing!"
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
Thank you!

"All right, so on Monday, we spoke with Shirley Phelps-Roper about allegations that the internet gathering known as Anonymous had issued a threat, and Westboro Baptist Church responded to that threat."
"Well, today we have everybody here, we have Shirley Phelps-Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church."
"We have a source within Anonymous, the internet gathering known as Anonymous, here."
So let's start at the very beginning.
"Anonymous, can you please tell us, did any active Anonymous members or participants, sources, issue a threat to the Westboro Baptist Church?"
"-No, there was no talk of it."
"The press release was... -Well, how could you know this?"
I was wondering...
"-Well, hold on, Shirley, let's get him to explain... -They're anonymous!"
I'm just saying.
-Let's have him explain.
"-Well, Shirley, with most operations, we have planning, we have execution, we have discussion of it."
"This press release came out of nowhere, and it doesn't seem like the writing style we'd make."
"Nobody that usually writes press releases stood up and said hey, we wrote this."
"The operation came out of nowhere, and you guys responded really too fast."
It was all a bit suspicious.
"-Oh, yikes!"
It was several days before we responded.
"-So Shirley, let's..."
let's take it one at a time.
"How did you originally hear of the threat, Shirley?"
By many emails.
"We received many emails, and then, how else?"
"Oh, also in some print publications."
"Twitter, Twitter was talking about it."
"Oh, and Twitter was sending us links to it, also."
"OK, so Anonymous, can you state... do you, what is your belief?"
Do you believe that the Westboro Baptist Church concocted this letter?
"So, what do you get and if you get a lot of money basically, you get two million dollars, 2.59 million dollars, arlight."
"Its two, five, nine, zero, five, six, five."
"So, what does this tell you?"
"This tells you that if you invest $10,000 in a bank 40 times, the future value of that will end up being 2.59 million dollars."
"So, what"
"I'm going to do, I'm going to try to talk you through the problem again."
"So, just, so that we are working together."
What did I do?
I calculated Future Value.
"So, in order to calculate Future Value of something that I don't know, I have to use the Future Value function in the calculator or in the spreadsheet."
"And out popped, I gave this information $10,000 was the PMT, 40 was n."
But most importantly eight percent was r.
"So, I gave all this information to Excel or a calculator, whatever you choose to be using, simply because it's a very complicated calculation."
"Conceptually, it's not that difficult."
And we got 2.59 mil.
"And I'm going to just use it approximately because I'm not going to calculate, write all the digits and so on."
"So, what has happened here?"
Let me just walk you through this problem.
"First of all, remember yesterday, remember I asked you, what is the answer to a Finance question or anybody asks you what, what should you say?"
Compounding.
But you always have to pause because you want to
"look smart, right?"
"So, you take a pause, and you say compounding."
"And so, so let me ask you the following question."
"Suppose there was no interest rate or, in other words, how much of the 10,000 are you throwing in?"
And suppose the interest is zero.
This problem is very simple to do.
Why?
"Because you do 40 times 10,000."
"You have $400,000, right."
"So, the interest rate, time value of money is zero, you will have a lot of money in your bank account but how much will it be?"
"400,000."
Calm down Karim
How can I calm down?
I can't sit down comfortably due to the diapers he made me wear
"This can't go on like this, time is passing by and the bank won't wait for us"
There must be another plan in order to find out where the money is
This money is for you and the others
It's more than what my kids would've given you
I didn't think you'd be able to convince the others to do this
Money can do anything but I didn't do this for the money
I did this because I felt guilty for what I did to you
"I know, that's why I depended on you"
"Take the money, mona"
And what do you intend on doing now?
"Listen, all this means that I couldn't properly raise my kids"
"They're gonna decide to come stay with me and when they come, I'll re-raise them"
What if they don't come?
"They'll come, they're my kids I know them"
"We came to stay here with you, dad"
To help you with anything you need
We have to stay by your side especially due to your condition ofcourse we'll do anything you need
"What, Malak, why don't you come say hi to grandpa?"
"Do you still remember me, grandpa?"
What did you tell her?
Come give me a hug
"If I forget the whole world, I can't forget you Malak"
Let me show you how much I love you
"Take your time dad, we're waiting here"
You take your time
"Everybody look for the money, I'm sure it's somewhere"
Do you think he'd hide millions in the house?
It's possible...
"Karim, we have no other choice"
Practice your presentation until you feel comfortable.
"If you have any questions, contact me at: tyler.shadick@cuw.edu or call 262-243-2009."
"Thank you, and I look forward to assisting you in making a great online learning experience for our students."
Welcome to the Simulation Center at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
"My name is Marissa Carrillo, the simulation technician providing your tour."
"The simulation center is currently located on University of Alaska Anchorage campus, in the School of Nursing."
We have two high-fidelity simulation rooms with one control room.
Each patient room is equipped with medical supplies and enhanced with features that may be found in a hospital room to practice care of patients.
This is our adult human patient simulator or adult simulation mannequin.
Can you see the chest rise or did you notice his blinking?
"I can listen to heart, lung, and bowel sounds."
"I can check his carotid, brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses too!"
What are the more exciting capabilities?
"Interventions such as CPR, defibrillation, IVs, intubation, and urinary catheterization may also be performed on the mannequin."
"(""Go Away"") Oh, and he can speak too."
Sounds like now is the time that we should visit the SimBaby.
[NOlSE]
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;How long have I been gone?  &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;About twelve hours.
[MUSlC]
[MUSlC]
[SOUND]
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'm back.
[INAUDlBLE]
again.
"Are you in? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Sam, what's been going on?"
How you been?
"[MUSlC] it's not 12 hours, it's 12  months."
You've been gone a whole year.
Sorry.

(Music)
(Applause)
Is it Ole Bull that you rank highest within Norwegian music?
"Yes, Norwegian classical music."
Why?
Because he was a great man.
And he was  allowed to be that because it was deserved.
Because he lead Norway onto the world map.
He  was the first man to promote Norwegian folk music.
He was able to get national scene in Bergen which was the first cultural place we had.
"He started Ibsen, Bjornson - a national hero."
But you want to play in the movie about Ole Bull?
"Yes, I would have loved to do that."
"I'm probably a bit too dark and talk a bit too much eastern-Norwegian, but, yes, if I practiced enough."
Can you give an example of Ole Bull?
"That's ...um ""Norway in a nutshell"", ""Seterjentens sondag"""
"You can almost see the cow walking across the grass, sort of."
What does music mean to you?
It's nothing more and nothing less than a mood setting.
Sometimes you really want just to be happy when you're sad or you just really want to feel something.
You really want to fall in love with your wife again and there it's probably not the best choice to listen to Eminem right then.
If you really want it music has the ability to bring the feelings you want to have.
Does it do this for you?
"Yes, absolutely."
The one thing I'm still to understand is people who go to see their favorite artist on a festival and there are those who just go to festivals to listen to some artists.
And then I can't understand what you get out of it when you go to those concerts and not caring for those artists.
"But of course, there is a relation - it's great."
"And me, I love festivals but every time I'm asked to join a festival as audience"
I always make sure to see who's playing.
"""Oh, I'm only able to go on Friday"" ""OK, who's playing on Friday?"" ""I don't know""."
You have to find out what you're going to listen to.
You have always had a discipline; you have practiced a lot ever since you were a little boy.
Do you still have that discipline?
The thing is that as a classical kid it went straight  to my blood that you had to practice 2 hours a day.
"I'll still come into the chatroom, that sort of thing, but it's it man."
I don't want to be a venue for man-children and My Little Pony.
"Nobody's learned shit, nobody's done shit."
"So, you know how it is."
"No, I'm not gonna abandon the chatroom man."
"I'm gonna still come in here, but I'm not gonna stay in here for as much time as I had."
Sometimes I've stayed in here for shit.
"I mean, it seems like an hour, but five hours have gone by and shit man, I've been having a lot of great conversation with a lot of you guys and females in this chatroom and transsexuals, mind you."
"Amy Daly is a believe it or not has been a great breath of fresh air, you know, in the chatroom."
Especially when I came in here this morning feeling a little jaded about this shit.
"I'm still jaded about it, but great words from her, great words from a lot of people in here, so anyway, once again, man, the show's over."
"I'll be in here, man."
You know?
"I'll be in here, but... that's it for the show, man."
"The archives will be there if people still want to listen them, they can still listen to them, so... anyway. coyoteinthehat:"
"Seriously, thank you for the time and money and everything you've put into it and sorry for adding to the forces of trolls and stuff earlier this year and whatnot, but man, thanks for everything."
GuitarNinja:
"Yeah, man, the past couple of years."
"You've been sewing the seeds of capitalism and now it's just time to sit back, you know, chill, wait for the harvest, man."
"You know, it's coming, it's gonna happen."
We just gotta wait and do our homework.
Sebastian:
"Thanks for the show, Ghost. karaszkunskadoo:"
"Hey, I wonder what will happen to the Engineer since you are quitting this show. iusethelancer1:"
"The Engineer wasn't real, dude, okay?"
GhettoCapitalist:
"Look guys, the Engineer."
Y'all don't worry about the Engineer.
The Engineer is eligible for so many entitlement programs now it's ridiculous.
He's gonna be making more money being unemployed than he ever would at Ghost's show.
"I'm just sayin', I'm just-- you know."
"Section 8, all that stuff, all that stuff."
I'm going to a party with Hollywood folks.
And I'm going to wear this.
We got the name Gapminder from the London underground.

A little note for Agneta...
There...
It's a new phase of a strange journey for Hans Rosling.
From a doctor in Africa to a professor of international health and most recently a global star with an unusual message:
The world is actually getting better.
He's on his way back to the scene of his breakthrough.
"It's California's ""Davos"" meeting, where Silicon Valley meets Hollywood."
The room is full of key people of industry and entertainment.
From movie stars to film producers.
"The conference is called Technology, Entertainment and Design."
I was invited to it in 2006 and it changed my life.
Yesterday the WHO's statistics manager e-mailed me after I'd requested malaria statistics.
He wrote:
"""I always send your video to my friends, of course I'll help."""
"If I count the number of minutes I've been teaching, this video teaches more than anything I've done in my life."
"All the articles, books, courses..."
None of it can compare with this one video.
That's a humbling experience.
Uppsala University wanted a course in global development.
"The ""Man and Nature"" course had students from many fields."
"Their worldview was cartoonish - really ""us and them""."
They were convinced that no one should touch rainforests.
"That we have to lower our standards, not everyone can have electricity."
I was horrified at their attitude and lack of knowledge.
They thought developing countries lived in harmony in the rain forest.
Only a fraction of so-called devel- oping countries live that way.
So I did a graph with money on one axis and child mortality on the other.
"The idea of ""industrial"" and ""developing"" countries is bullshit."
"Katrina is not my girlfriend, alright?"
And I doubt she gave you the stinkeye!
That's just the way her face looks.
"You know, that's just her face!"
I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.
"Hey, you big puffy version of junebug!"
Where have you been?
What's up?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level.
You need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever!
The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are!
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.
No...I mean I'm already pregnant.
So what other kind of shenanigans can I get into?
"The answer is reject, and you can see it easily from the data shown here."
79.74 is the mean.
This is the 95% confidence interval--less than a kilogram.
"The reason why it's so small is because we have so many data samples, really interesting."
"As a result, we don't even come close to 73."
"So, if all the guesses that you guys voiced online were actual measurements using the actual scale of Sebastian, and this is what I told you and the question really was H0."
Is Sebastian telling the truth or is he lying?
"The, using statistical techniques, you should conclude he's lying."
This is somewhat contrived.
"This is the only data point, and everything else is just guesses."
But I hope you had fun using actual data that you students derived in answering this question.
The pupil asked:
"""To dissolve in Being or to dissolve in Non-Being - isn't this the same?"""
And the teacher said:
"""I DON'T KNOW!"""
To the pupil's birthday party some guests have come the guests were his classmates: two girls and three boys
"The food was: three pieces of bisсuit cake and 7 bottles of ""BAlKAL"" mineral water"
"One girl eat two pieces of the biscuit cake and drank 1.5 bottle of w.ww.... ater ""BAlKAL"" and... biloowwwssss...... and drank 1.5 bottles of BAlKAL water and on of the three boys drank, on bet, all the rest of the water and told that HE COULD HAVE DRUNK EVEN MORE!"
"If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA, that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil."
"OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?"
This is a key question for everybody.
"Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?"
"Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania, restore that ecosystem?"
Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?
I've been to Tasmania.
I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.
"I've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here, who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old, but in 1926, this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines."
They trapped them.
"And when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,"
"""Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like, what they smelled like, what they sounded like."""
He led them around on a rope.
He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head.
We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.
"Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance, could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines."
My interest was in whether the environment had changed.
He thought hard.
It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.
"At any rate, he led us down this bush track, and there, right where he remembered, was the hut, and tears came into his eyes."
He looked at the hut.
We went inside.
There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night.
"And he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories."
"He said, ""I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside,"" and he said they made sounds like ""Yip!"
Yip!
"Yip!"""
All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.
"And the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?"
And he said no.
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in 1926.
The grasslands were sweeping away.
"This means I'm standing here on stage facing you,"
"And you are in the audience, in your seats, facing me."
You see the first row in the photo from the top here.
This is a photo of the model that the architects built for the contest.
"The building changed a little during construction, but basically it still looks as you can see here."
This is a photo of the National Theater of Somalia in Mogadishu.
This building has been constructed by Chinese people in the 60ies.
It was a gift of Mao to the young state Somalia.
Therefor Mao-Bibles have been provided at the opening celebration 1967 for each visitor.
"There was a page marked, when you opened it,"
There was a quotation from Mao:
"An army without culture is an uninformed army,"
And an uniformed army can be defeated.
A photo of the opening celebration.
The photographer took this picture on the 4th of May 2012 from a steep perspective.
Therefor you can see the stage tower well.
"From the stage, where I'm standing up to the rooftop are about 14 meters."
This equates roughly the height of the opera-house in Bayreuth.
The only difference is that this theater here is located in the heart of the city.
"Because of the angle which the photographer chose, you can see the prospect hanging there."
"This is the stage desgin of the opening play, which hase been written especially for this occasion."
You can see 4 persons hugging each other.
"At the back up in the sky, here, this is the white star from the flag of Somalia."
This flag resembles the flag of the UN.
It has been designed that way as gratitude to the UN for their aid.
The play has been written for this occasion.
It is called Dalaarwin Walid -
Dadaarwin Walid.
This means advices by the parents.
And this is a play about love.
"Somalia is a country in the east of Africa, which doesn't exist anymore."
"Anyway not as a state, because it fell apart in more than 20 years of civil war."
What's his name?
"I don't know, but he is like my brother"
He was killed by an APC running over him
My name is Ibrahim Azzouz
"They [army] created a trap for us, they let us approach the Radio &amp;amp; Television building"
Then the army ranks advanced on us
They began by firing shots at us
"After that they beat us with sticks, bringing us to the ground"
"After a while, the army APCs started driving around recklessly"
The APCs then started driving into the crowds hitting people
"Some people had their faces crushed in, some were sliced in half"
These were scenes of inhumane acts
From the army!
The Army that is supposed to protect us!
Our Army crushed us like cattle!
"Give us a chance to unite, we are brothers"
Patience ...
Patience
"Someone from Ezbet Nakhl, and the brother of Mina that they killed and have been laid to rest inside - Who has done this?"
The terrorist Tantawi ...
The Marshal ... he killed the young people inside
"But he is blind, because if he acknowledges those before him that are now in prison, he would not act this way"
"But the day will come, when God will take from him as he took from those that have been killed"
Not just him .. all of them
And may God put me to rest like those here
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The events of last night in front of Maspero [Egyptian Radio &amp;amp; Television Building]
Have resulted in the deaths of 24 Martyrs amongst our children
So let's talk about your characters.
Your characters are what can... are going to drive your book.
And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.
"OK, I'm still in ""Poetics,"" in Aristotle, and I'm thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there."
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.
"Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis."
"It's what our network does; it's what ""Dirty Jobs"" is."
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.
Great.
"The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know --"
"Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother."
OK.
That's peripety or peripeteia.
And this metaphor in my head --
I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.
(Laughter)
"I got to tell you, it's such a great device though."
"When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere."
"I mean, Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense,"" right?"
"Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then, boom -- ""Oh, I'm dead"" -- peripetia."
You know?
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
"Neo in ""The Matrix,"" you know?"
"""Oh, I'm living in a computer program"" -- that's weird."
"These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for."
"And, as I stood there,"
looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK.
"Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?"
"Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is."
And I talk to him.
(Laughter)
"And he says, ""Hey Mike."
"So we shipped our 0.7, and I think it was when we got to 0.8 with Firefox which it would have been on May or June of 2004, that we finally understood we had a chance."
Like a real chance.
Because 0.8 of Firefox was far enough along that people started noticing it.
And the number of people using Firefox started to grow.
Pretty soon there were more people using Firefox 8 than had ever used the Mozilla suite.
"Something like a million, or two or three million."
And the other way that I knew that we were on the right track was Tim O'Reilly called us up.
I mean I know Tim forever because I've been in the open source world for a number of years but this time he called up to say
"""Hey, we're hearing a lot about Firefox."
"Can we come down and talk to you?"""
"Tim O'Reilly's greater skill is he has a phenomenal nose for what's new, what's coming and what technology is gonna be interesting."
So there were a lot of clues.
"Then, the summer of 2004 was a long summer."
"Because in between 0.9 and 1.0 was five or six months, that's when the extension system was built and I think I've been the most nervous I've ever been in that phase."
I remember speaking and I could not...
"I was on a panel but I walked across the stage constantly,"
"I was sick to my stomach because we knew this was our big bet, we could see the stuff was happening but there was that pressure that you have to ship the product."
"So the final phases of Firefox, getting the first version out, were the start page and we..."
Before Firefox the start page had been a typical open source project:
"""Hi!"
Wanna help?
Here is Bugzilla.
Don't like Bugzilla?
Here's Despot.
You don't like that?
"Here's the link for Tinderbox."""
So when we made the commitment to ship a consumer product we realised that doesn't help most people.
[Question]
"Unlike Bugzilla, which is smooth and lovely..."
"That shows you our standards, right?"
"So this was again an immense emotional intense, like knocked-down drag-out fight."
What to do?
If there is a need of timely vaccination then that's going to be picked up and provided by the respective government programs.
According to IGAD the experiences will serve as a model for other countries with pastoralist communities. being
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
"Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won"
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care
"You touched my heart, you touched my soul"
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
"I know you well, I know your smell"
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer but when I wake
You can't break my spirit
It's my dreams you take

WAYNE MCKEEN:
"The driveline in this car, as well as all the suspension components, can be bought at your local GM"
"Performance parts dealer, including the transmission, the diff, the engine itself is all available at GM"
Performance parts.
"So it's very easy to-- if something happens or breaks, to get new parts."
"They're not custom, except for the chassis itself."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
It's every bit as exciting as it looks stepping into this thing.
It's visceral to the point of nirvana.
"It's fast, grippy, responsive, and has the best turn-in of any car I've never driven."
"It's wonderful, rewarding you when you get it just right, and kicking you in the ass when you overcook it."
"I stayed out, lap after lap, pushing the car as hard as I could, until I realized I was having so much fun, I'd run out of gas."
"While it's important to remember this car is a prototype, the production cars will be reaching customer hands at the beginning of next year."
And I can't wait to drive one of those.
"Now that we found out how well it grips on the track, let's see what happens when you try and break it loose."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
I got no gas pedal.
It's got no gas pedal here.
"I somehow snapped the throttle cable, and we didn't have time to repair it, [INAUDlBLE]"

MATT FARAH:
"Though we came to Indy to test the car, what we got was an experience."
The people at AVI Racing are true professionals who brought us a great race car.
"And because it's Arizona, of course somebody brought a Mac 10."

MATT FARAH:
This is why like shooting in Arizona-- the crew all brings guns.
And it came up again not long ago too.
ST:
"Yes, we have the ""ideologically similar"" media, although I find the phrase unfortunate."
JL:
I don't want to be there.
"I mean, if there is media which is ideologically similar or different"
I don't want to be on the list of the ideologically similar media outlets.
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me about the best experience you have had since the 15th, and the worst experience."
And here we can move on to these things.
JL:
There have been three best moments.
"One when I was streaming with the telephone and I saw there were thousands of people connected to my streaming with my bloody telephone. and I said ""what's happening?"""
"But especially when I turned off the streaming, or the network collapsed or something, and I put down my mobile and looked not through the screen, because I was really stressed out."
I was knackered.
"But I put down the mobile to rest a moment and I thought ""Blimey, something's happening here"""
"I mean, something big is happening here, that's what I thought at that moment."
"And that's actually the headline I used in my chronicle that night, then I changed it, but the URL is still ""something big is happening here""."
Because that's what I felt.
"I didn't know what is was, but it was big."
That was the first big impression I got.
The second moment was when I started to see the cardboards in the square.
When they put cardboard on the ground so everyone could sleep.
And they started to
"""carpet"" the Puerta del Sol, that was the second time that I thought something big was happening."
"I mean, they were carpeting the ground so they could sleep there!"
"It's an image that's fixed, after that came the blue carps, the distribution of the commissions, the infrastructure, the firefighters helping out... the construction of the Medina de Sol."
But the first moment
I realised they were building a city was when I saw the cardobard on the floor.
"And I saw people were going to stay there, lots of people."
ST:
"I remember an image, let's see if I can describe it."
The team travels a lot and their on the road for quite sometime how do the students keep up with their school work?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's difficult and I think golf is probably as challenging as any of the sports.
Because you know when we play on the road the first day is typically a 36 hole round.
That's 10 hours of being on the golf course your completely wiped out.
And it's tough to keep up you but know they have the computers they...they stay with them and they work on projects together a lot of times their in class together.
So they can try and help each other out as far as assignments and tests and things like that so you know typically
I've had good students on the team and this year is no exception.
We have great kids that work hard and they do their best in the classroom.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This Friday the team goes on the road to compete in the Pinehurst Intercollegiate Tournament.
What do you expect to come out?
Do you expect to come out with a victory?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well that's a very difficult field.
I mean there's I think 3 Bit Ten Schools there.
UNC Wilmington's ranked 52 a lot of good mid-major schools are there.
And so you know I think that we have our work cut out for us in terms of winning the tournament.
"But, you know our schedules very demanding and I think that pays off for us in the...in the Summit League at the end."
So you know I expect us to...to continue to improve
I'm not going to put any predictions on how we finish.
"But, obviously Pinehurst is a great place to be the golf course is a great challenge for us."
The kids will really get a great experience out of being at Pinehurst.
[Nick Spinozzi]
How much of an advantage would you say the team has when it competes in the Beu Mussatto Invitational?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I think playing on home course is a big advantage.
Because the golf course is very challenging it's got some holes on it you really need to play a few times and get some experience on it.
The greens are very challenging difficult a lot of slope so it is a big advantage.
Althought we have some very difficult schools coming.
Oakland in our conference is doing very well this year.
Wisconsin Greenbay has a great team.

For my passion about the southern culture
I kept studying until I wrote it
Then I went on my journey
For the whole southern culture

"But even so, even so I mean the fact of choosing, of selecting and deciding on one was the result of being very careful about not using my sense of beauty or my belief in some esthetics of some kind."
"In other words, finding some object of complete indifference as far as esthetics are concerned and that indifference is very difficult because there is always some detail in any object that will attract you esthetically."
"Meaning, that you find it beautiful or even ugly which is the same thing."
Ugly or beautiful is the same thing when it comes to choosing an object in the form of a Readymade.
"By Readymade, also the idea of it was being made by either manufactured or made by another person can be a Readymade, too, you see."
I even remember signing a big painting in a restaurant for the pleasure of calling it Readymade.
"You see, and of course it was not manufactured."
[Laughing]
"So, of course I couldn't take the painting with me because it was attached to the wall."
But this explains that the difficulty is to make people understand that was not through an attraction or the beauty of the object that I would call it Readymade.
"That's why I made so few because after a certain while, anything becomes beautiful."
"You know, it takes 40 years sometimes"
[Laughing]
but my - what is it called?
"Bottle Rack to be become - and people say,"
'It's so beautiful' and that's the worst complement they can give me.

Maybe I'm not listening

The Red Line stops just outside the ballparks 35th Street is the stop for U.S. Cellular.
Addison is the stop for Wrigley.
What could be more convenient and fun than a train full of like-minded fans?
How about a bus full of fans?
The #152 Addison bus drops fans just feet from the friendly confines... ...as does the #22 Clark and #8 Halsted.
The #35 35th street and 39 Pershing buses offer front door service to U.S. Cellular.
The CTA once again has commemorative fare cards and posters for this year's Crosstown series.
The posters have become sought-after souvenirs ever since they were first introduced in 1998
"This year's poster features the unsung heroes of the ballpark, the hot dog vendors."
Let's be frank.
Grilled meat and cold beverages are as much a part of the ball park experience as the game itself.
"""Exactly."
"It's part of the atmosphere, its part of the environment."""
Steve Musgrave is an illustrator who has created twelve Crosstown series posters for the CTA.
The 2010 poster is a whimsical departure from past depictions of ball players.
"""I appreciate the fact the CTA was open to doing something a little more playful than a baseball player- so it's a hot dog vendor."""
"Steve's first CTA gig was a series of baseball-themed paintings that adorn the Addison ""L"" station"
"Now, his posters adorn countless walls in and across Chicago. "" I really enjoy it, it's a lot of fun..."
"Some people collect them and some go out of their way to pick them up, which is nice to see."""
"""I'm a big fan of earlier 20th century European poster design kind of a streamlined or deco look."""
"""Every time I design them I picture them on some kid's wall, what I would have done with them as a kid."""
And how does he decide whether to put Cubs versus Sox ... or Sox versus Cubs?
"""Whoever hosts the games first gets the top billing."""
"Prior to each game of the series, CTA employees distribute the posters as long as supplies last."
"The commemorative farecards are available for purchase in CTA vending machines across the system, throughout the month of June or while supplies last."

"Let's say that I have a 5-Newton force, and its moment arm distance is 4."
The distance is equal to 4.
That's enough for that side.
And let's say I have a I'm going to switch colors.
"Actually, no, I'm going to keep it all the same color and then we'll use colors to differentiate between clockwise and counterclockwise so I don't bungle everything up again."
So let's say I have a 10-Newton force here.
"And, of course, these vectors aren't proportional to actually what I drew."
50 Newtons would be huge if these were the actual vectors.
And let's say that that moment arm distance is 3.
Let me do a couple more.
And let's say I have a moment arm distance of 8.
"I have a clockwise force of 20 Newtons, And let's say at a distance of 10 again, so distance is equal to 10, I have my mystery force."
It's going to act in a counterclockwise direction and
I want to know what it needs to be.
"So whenever you do any of these moment of force problems, and you say, well, what does the force need to be in order for this see saw to not rotate?"
"You just say, well, all the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments, So clockwise moments equal counterclockwise."
I'll do them in different colors.
So what are all the clockwise moments?
"Well, clockwise is this direction, right?"
That's the way a clock goes.
"So this is clockwise, that is clockwise."
I want to go in this direction.
And so this is clockwise.
What are all the clockwise moments?
It's 10 Newtons times its moment arm distance 10.
"So 10 times 10 plus 5 Newtons times this moment arm distance 4, plus 5 times 4, plus 20 Newtons times its moment arm distance of 8, plus 20 times 8, and that's going to equal the counterclockwise moments, and so the leftover ones are counterclockwise."
"So we have 50 Newtons acting downward here, and that's counterclockwise, and it's at a distance of 8 from the moment arm, so 50 times 8."
"Let's see, we don't have any other counterclockwise on that side."
"This is counterclockwise, right?"
"We have 10 Newtons acting in the counterclockwise direction, and its moment arm distance is 3, plus 10 times 3, and we're assuming our mystery force, which is at a distance of 10, is also counterclockwise, plus force times 10."
And now we simplify.
And I'll just go to a neutral color because this is just math now.

Charlie says that helping youth learn skills is a source of pride and inspiration.
"Maybe not so much for his grandson, Andrew."
But for other local champs like Billy Bugenig it just might be.
I worked with him on some ranches when I was growing up.
He taught me a lot.
He always knew the way the cattle were going to move.
I learned a lot by watching him.
I met Charlie at a really young age when I was just learning how to rope.
You knew that every time you went and you roped with Charlie you had a chance to win.
When I started team roping and stuff when
"I got into high school, he was always there to help and he was always someone that I looked up to because he knew how to do everything."
And I always enjoyed and still to this day would rope with Charlie any time or anywhere he wanted to.
Champs.
"Those kids, I tell you."
They're good.
"Ya, he still should have a good shot."
He's always able to catch something.
What we're gonna do is to look at the difference between cooking with the regular old-fashioned range and an induction cooktop.
So what we're gonna do today is focus on what happens when you cook it on a regular conventional range.
"What we've got is a GE (if you want to show that, Honey)"
We've got a GE range that's maybe three years old.
"And it has this glass cooktop, which we're told is about as efficient as the old-fashioned kind with the radiant elements."
"So I'm just going to pull our Lodge cast iron skillet out of the cabinet, put it on this main eye that we use, and I'm going to set it on a range from zero to (I guess) an imputed 10 because it's like 2-4-6-8-high,"
I'm going to set it on 8.
And you can see here what's happening here is as the element heats up it's going to heat up that skillet.
But it heats it up very slowly.
"Now I'm going to get some olive oil, which we use when we're cooking our eggs."
"What we're cooking is a frled egg for Amanda and a scrambled egg for me, with a little bit of veggies and some cheese in it."
We'll get that ready for Amanda's egg.

"They're the subjects of the sentence and what the predicate says, they do."
Are you a hardworking artist?
I think I'm a hardworker but at the sametime I'm lazy.
"I usually wake up, get rest, watch tv, do nothing."
Then in few hours I can work more than enough and finish everything.
I can't say that it's racked my brain
"Well there must be something, it's all done by yourself, but I'm sure it's also improvised."
There's not a certain subject nor story.
These are not message giving drawings.
Usually there's a main subject.
"Not in all, but some of them"
"Some are very simple ideas, and some are about very personal things that even I might be embarresed to tell."
I usually think how to deformate an idea onto the drawing.
"For example it can be read from this side, and if we look at it from this side, it can be something completely different."
I try to take an idea in this way as well.
"while trying to draw for example a house or a castle, there are several technics, academical or perspective..."
"For example, here the castle can symbolise a room but I don't think what symbolizes the room."
I have fun when it becomes something different with the free angle.
It's like I make some rules and actually I play a game.
Colors.. .
I have my own color restrictions and I don't pay attention to do them at the same time or to let them be in an harmony.
"As I said before, between the years 2007 and 2008,"
"I've been in a period of searching and all these pictures came out afterall, which made me really happy."
"If a pshycologist would come and see these drawings, he or she might evaluate, analyse and say something about them."
"And the result might show the truth about me, but I don't think about it too much,"
"I only try to keep myself in a positive way, self-enclosed."
Since few years I've been reading William S. Burroughs and interested in Beat Literature...
"Lately he has written the book called ""My Education"" where he talks about his dreams."
"I read it sometimes, it became one of my favorites..."

Hi My name is Colleen Hall-Patton and I am your teacher/faciliator for this semester.
I thought that you should probably have some idea who you're dealing with not all of these are going to be video recordings but we will start with this so you at least have some idea who I am.
A little bit of background about me to begin with is I have a PH.D. in Sociology from UNLV in 2004 took me ten years to do that so those of you on the long track on this I empathize.
A Bachelors and Masters Degree in Anthropology and so I take kind of a more world view of things and across cultural sort of view on stuff.
I have been teaching Women's Studies at UNLV since 1999 while I was still a graduate student and I think in Women's Studies especially it is important to know the placement of where you are or a person is in various hierarchies.
So here's mine.
I am came of age in the 1970's at kind of the height of optimism on changes on the second women's movement.
I am married had been for 35 years.
Which I don't think I am old enough to be married that long but there it is.
Two kids who are both young adults. and I had a 25 year career in Information Technology and switched over to teaching full time in 2003.
So that's kind of a background of where we are on this.
"In terms of the class, the class is organized in modules 1 for each week and our book has 13 chapters so we've got 13 chapters over 15 weeks."
"In this we have a life time of experience doing gender, race, class, ability even though we may not recognize that we do and of course our experiences are all unique."
Recommendations for this class is stay on top of the work.
"Do the work for the week in the week, contribute to the discussions that's going to our primary place of talking to each other."
I will be in out of them as well.
You learn through participation.
You learn from the other students.
"A food that's archetypically connected with winning the golden ticket, that's connected with prosperity."
"I was taken on a rocket ride across the universe in a voyage of discovery  that has brought me right to you at this present moment, right now."
"This food is filled  with legends and lore, which I summarized along with scientific data and recipe information and all kinds of great stuff in my book ""Naked chocolate,"" which became the sourcebook  or a reference book for people who are interested in raw chocolate, because all the chocolate we've ever had has been processed through high heat and machines."
"And we thought,  maybe we should just eat it cold processed -- is there a difference."
And that's we're gonna explore here as we delve into the astonishing truth about the world's greatest food.
Chocolate comes from the Mayan lands  and ancient Mayan farms.
Chocolate is a Mayan word.
"The word ""cacao"" is one of the oldest words in use in the world today."
"Some people estimate that  that word is 15,000 years old."
The oldest word in the world.
It was brought to the West  and brought to you by Hernando Cortez.
He was the conqueror of Mexico.
"It all happened by an accident, because Montezuma,  who was the leader of Mexico at that time, was in a state of civil war in Mexico City."
"And when Cortez showed up there  in 1521, there was -- they believe that"
Cuauhtémoc himself had come to the great city.
"Christopher Columbus,  when he first spotted cacao he thought it was almond."
And this was money for them.
This is what their currency was.
Today we use coins.
Then they used cacao.
It was their money.
And he saw -- somebody dropped some cacao beans on a little boat.
And they all jumped for it.
Columbus wrote that these people  are crazy about almond.
Montezuma was known to drink  50 cups of chocolate a day.
It was always consumed as a drink.
"And there you see the cup that Montezuma was known to drink out of, or one that's similar to that."
"Anyway, how do you turn this bean,  this nut, into a drink?"
"Well, you'll have to break it open, and eventually get all of those cacao beans into a beverage,  which we'll see later."
"But before we do that, we've gotta look at where  the chocolate comes from."
This is the chocolate tree.
"And yes, money does grow on trees."
"And then he bids for one million, and of course no one bid, any bids for five hundred thousand, four hundred, three hundred.."
Let's start two-fifty.
Someone put their hand up - two-fifty.
"And that's when he started - two-fifty two-fifty, we've got two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, anyone two-seventy-five!"
We've got two-seventy-five!!
"Three-hundred, three-hundred, wawawawawawa..!!"
[laughter].
"And even I was a monk, even I started getting excited."
[laughter].
"And you can see just how they do this, just the way they speak, they suddenly raise their voice and started speaking very quickly, and you do get excited."
"And how emotions can be generated, when you see how those emotions can be generated, you can actually sometimes be in power over other people's emotions."
"Just by acting slowly, and by speaking softly you can calm people down."
One of the first times I saw this and it was very impressive was the former abbot and Spiritual Director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia
Ajahn Jagaro.
I was with him when he was a monk just learning his trade in Thailand.
Because we do learn a trade - this is a training which we go through.
And we were having our morning meal when a Thai lady ran into our dining hall.
"She ran in, and she's obviously very upset, because they don't usually do this - interfering in a monk's meal."
"And she was saying something in Thai, and I actually caught it after a while, she said ""Suchin is dead!"
Suchin is dead!
She shot herself!
"She's committed suicide!""."
"And I got really quite excited too because I knew that lady, she had cancer, we've been going to see her, talking to her, counselling her."
She was a close disciple of the monastery.
"And that morning she had shot herself, and this was her best friend who found her body."
"She came in to the monastery just straight away, completely distraught having found her best friend committed suicide."
You can understand what she felt like.
"And I understood that, and I looked to Ajahn Jagaro who was the head monk at that time to see what he would do."
He understood what she'd said and he put his head down and carried on eating.
And this
"lady - ""She shot herself!"
"She killed herself!"" - and the monk just carried on eating as if nothing had happened."
But the PAL-V is not the only flying car - or driving plane if you prefer - coming on to the market.
The US-based firm Terrafugia have just carried out successful tests on their own street-legal plane called the Transition.
"Terrafugia say around 100 orders have already been placed for the car, which will cost roughly the same as its European cousin."

MATT FARAH:
It's impossible to ignore the parallels between being in the desert and driving a race car.
"The feeling of isolation, your having total control over every aspect of the experience, and if something goes wrong, there's nothing there to save you."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
Inde Motorsports Park is certainly remote enough out in the Arizona desert.
"The front straight doubles as a runway, so it's long, wide, and unforgiving."
"Rest of the two-mile circuit is bumpy, dusty, tight, and blind."
And the AVI Racing Corvette GT1 is probably the fastest track car I've ever driven.
"Or if not, it's certainly the loudest."
"In-car audio not, so much."
"I have no idea if you can hear me or not, this is by far the"
loudest car I've ever driven.
"AVl's Wayne McKeen, after putting tens of thousands into a C6 Corvette CO6 to go racing, had a revelation-- if you want to build a Corvette for the track, why start with a Corvette that's meant for the street."
That's like buying a casino when all you needed was a card table.
WAYNE MCKEEN:
I love Corvettes.
The geometry and the engineering that's went into the Corvette for a track car is unbelievable.
And we needed a stiff chassis to complement the geometry of the Corvette.
This car is a tube-frame GT1 Corvette race car.
"Essentially, a Corvette stock car, with a completely rebuilt, redesigned two-frame chassis that's extremely stuff."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"The body of this car is made out of-- this current car-- is made out of fiberglass the production cars will be out of carbon fiber and Kevlar as an option, which saves about 80 pounds to the weight of the whole vehicle."
"And the chassis itself, dry weight is about 23-30 the way it sits."
"So, getting a stock zero 6 down under 3,000 pounds for a race car is extremely tough."
"Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""The River Wild."""
"Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" together."
"And Anne Hathaway and Julia Roberts were in ""Valentines Day."""
We're going to do this as a little bit of a quiz so I'm going to mark each of these edges as something that you need to visit.
You need to visit all of them.
I strongly suggest that you actually check them off as you go because it's really easy to do one twice or forget one by accident.
"So this is what I want you to do, I want you to go through and start at Meryl Streep and move along the green lines here at the movies and each time you visit a movie, check it off as you go."
So the right answer in this quiz is to have all the edges checked off and none of them checked off twice.
"It's really easy to mess that up, so be very careful."
"And then when you're done, I want you to mark the little bubble corresponding to which actor you end up with at the end of your path."
You can follow any path that you want--you just have to make sure that you visit each of the movies once.
All right!
I'd like you to actually go and do this and check off the actor that you end up with.

And it is really helpful for me as a teacher.
"I read once somewhere, that we make more decisions  during the course of our work day than any other professions  except surgeons."
No wonder we are so exhausted  at the end of the day.
"So, taking that time for me  with my students at the start of the classes  is tremendously helpful."
I also do deep relaxation with them.
"I actually only want to do it  once every two weeks because of training, we have so much  that we need to go through, but they put together a petition  that said ""We want deep relaxation at least once a week""."
"Beginning anew is another practice  that you are going to learn about, and I use that to mediate conflict and  also I use it with my students when I want one-on-one conference with them."
"So, we have a clean slate with each other and also own up for any unskillfulness I've had."
That is the authenticity piece.
"Naming, when you yourself  as a teacher have been unskillful,"
I think it is really powerful.
"The practice of loving kindness, often times, I also start the class with that."
"I'm really happy... (Bell) to be here and hear more questions about integrating practice into classroom, you can feel free to find me anytime."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Meena."
"Our third speaker is Michele Chaban,  also from the University of Toronto."
"She is co-founder and co-director of the Inter-professional Applied  Mindfulness Meditation Certificate, which has five different strands,  it is a very large program."
She is the one who got it going.
"Michele, why don't you share with us?"
"(Michele Chaban) Good afternoon everybody, I'd like to begin with offering a blessing to you, for those of you who are teachers formally and for the rest of us  who teach informally."
May you be well.
May you be healthy.
May you be whole everyday.
May you be happy.
May you be supported  from within and above you.
"And may you continue  with your good work, because together we will change the world."
I am so pleased to be here  with you today.
"I guess we have been asked to speak  a little bit about ourselves,so here I go."
I used to be a model for Elizabeth Art  in Canada and it was a wonderful life.
"And one day, a drunk-driver ran into me  and took my legs and my arms away from me."
"And in years that ensued,  I lost my ability to talk and walk."
I kept my mind andI lost my body.
And science didn't have the resources to be able to help heal me and I waited.
We'll come back to larger questions of community design on

This is a video about how Vi Hart creates her videos.
He is filming a video about how I actually make my videos but I am filming  a video about How I make a video about how I make a video...
She's famous for being YouTube's most popular Mathemusician and a Khan Academy employee.
"If you haven't seen any of her videos, go to  youtube.com/vihart and watch a few of them."
Vi aims to make videos that show math is cool and  she's doing a great job of achieving her goal.
"For example, ever since seeing her videos about plants and the Fibonacci spirals and Sponge Bob's pineapple when I watch an episode of Sponge Bob or see a pine cone,"
I've become aware of patterns I never seen before...
"Vi Hart has been featured in newspapers including the New York Times, on the YouTube home page several times, and on the YouTube channel ""The VlogBrothers"" from Hank and John Green."
"""Nerd fighters, Click here watch a Vi Hart video  and your whole life will be changed"""
"Well, who am I?"
"Well, I am Ethan Bresnick"
I am a student and short filmmaker.
"Although math is not my thing, making films is and I want to show you how Vi Hart makes her videos."
"Vi starts by writing a script, first."
"If you are interested in how she writes scripts, click on the link in the description below to  view an example of her script writing."
It takes Vi anywhere from a few hours to a  day to write a script for a doodling video
Videos that require research take up to a week or even a month!
"But sometimes it takes a few weeks, as in the  case of her ""What Was Up with Pythagoras?"" video, to make sure that nothing was embarrassingly wrong."
Vi spent several months researching and scripting her plant series of videos.
"For you tech geeks out there, Vi uses Microsoft Word on her work computer and Open Office on her home."
"Next, she shoots her videos."
"""Filming time!"""
Shooting is one of the shortest parts in her process.
"While she usually shoots her videos alone from start to finish, sometimes she offers supporting roles to a few of Khan Academy's interns and employees."
They are eager to help out.
We are just going to do the old switcheroo
You can finish out writing this 100 times.
Keep going!
"It kinda like, you smear it on the back of my hand."
Okay we need more snakes!
So we wanted to also widen the track width of this car.
This car's eight inches wider than a C6 Corvette.
So the track width and the turn-in and everything is so much better.

MATT FARAH:
"Every bit of this car is designed the way it is for three specific reasons-- to be as fast as possible, as light as possible, and as simple as possible to fix, because you go to the track to drive, not to wrench."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"AVI Racing's mission was to develop a race car that was user-friendly, extremely reliable, and easy to work on."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
"Removing the complete carbon and fiberglass body work takes two men only six minutes, revealing a skeleton that is more NASCAR than Woodward Avenue."
A tube frame chassis with every bit of racing technology you would ever need lurks underneath.
There's an adjustable brake bias with two master cylinders powering 14-inch Brembo brakes.
"There's a 28-gallon fuel cell, beefed-up [INAUDlBLE] suspension, and a triple-disc clutch."
"It has modular front and rear frame components, which means if you crash, you can replace the entire front or rear section for less than five figures in your own garage."
"Thanks to the ease of access, one man can change a clutch or transmission in under an hour."
"There's ducting, cooling, tons of down force, and massive square-stance 305 section slick tires."
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"Most people think of a race car as a Rolex or a World Challenge 253 $100,000 race car."
"We wanted to develop a track day car for $60,000-- a fraction of the money-- that will compete with those."
MATT FARAH:
And Wayne should know-- he benchmarked the GT1 against his LG Motorspots World Challenge car.
"And without the restrictions World Challenge cars face, the"
GT1 is faster-- much faster.
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"We've taken our years of race car experience and developed an extremely fast, reliable, affordable race car that will compete with the top cars out in a track day."
"It's extremely nimble, it tracks really well, corners extremely well."
It's so stiff that it corners like no other car.

"Although Ed retired in 1991, he and his wife Dory remained close to the university."
"He and Dory are longtime season ticket holders for Matador Athletics, and are loyal supporters of the library and the arts."
Ed was named Honorary Lifetime Director of the Alumni Association and was instrumental in helping the association create and enhance its support for current students through its legacy and first generation scholarship programs.
"In 2000 Ed was presented with the university's inaugural Emeriti Merit Award, which the Alumni Association renamed in 2008 as the Dean Edmund Peckham Award, to honor Ed's impact on five decades of student life at Cal State Northridge."

Let's see if we can take the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x power.
"And you might say, hold on a second."
We know how to take the derivative of e to the x.
But what about a base like 2?
We don't know what to do with 2.
And the key here is to rewrite 2 to the x so that we essentially have it as e to some power.
And the key there is to rewrite 2.
So how can we rewrite 2 so it is e to some power?
"Well, let's think about what e to the natural log of 2 power is."
The natural log of 2 is the power that I would have to raise e to to get to 2.
"So if we actually raise e to that power, we are going to get to 2."
"So what we could do, instead of writing 2 to the x, we could rewrite this as e."
"We could rewrite 2 as e to the natural log of 2, and then raise that to the x power."
So this is the x power in yellow.
And so let's do that right over here.
"So instead of taking the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x, let's say, let's just take the derivative with respect to x of the exact same expression rewritten, of e to the natural log of 2 raised to the x power."
"Let me put this x in that same color, dx."
"Now we know from our exponent properties if we raise something to some power, and then raise that to another power, we can take the product of the two powers."
Let me rewrite this just to remember.
"If I have a to b, and then I raise that to the c power, this is the exact same thing as a to the b times c power."

The module on responsiveness by saying that the worst thing about going to the doctor is waiting.
I think I was wrong with that saying.
I think that the worst thing that can happen to a patient in a care process is to experience a quality problem.
"Experts estimate that there are close to a 100,000 people dying because of medical errors alone."
I'm in no position to judge this number.
"Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell, but God bless him."
He's making a great living.
"You ask him, ""Did you follow your passion here?"" and he'd laugh at you."
"The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas."
He didn't follow his passion.
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.
And I hear that story over and over.
"Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots."
"Now, he's selling them to Walmart."
Follow his passion?
The guy's -- come on.
"So I started to look at passion,"
"I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness -- as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction."
"I started to look at teamwork and determination, and basically all those platitudes they call ""successories"" that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now."
That stuff -- it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
Safety -- safety first?
"Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong?"
"I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say -- but what if it's really safety third?"
Right?
(Laughter)
"No, I mean really."
"What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first."
"They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first, the business of getting it done."
"And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat with the ""Deadliest Catch"" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season."

"Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen, and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down."
"So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean."
Unspeakably dangerous.
"I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity,"

"And he says, ""OSHA?"
"And as I learned how these other countries had either not allowed these ingredients, or insisted on labeling, believing that their citizens had a right to know about these ingredients in the food,"
I couldn't unlearn this information.
"And I know correlation isn't causation, but we have one of the highest cancer rates on the planet."
The American Academy of Pediatrics has linked pesticides to ADHD and hyperactivity in kids.
"And the President's Cancer Panel has recently urged all of us to reduce our exposure to these chemicals in an effort to try to prevent the onset of these diseases, which according to the New England Journal of Medicine is placing an increasing burden on our economy."
"And I got it, it was a business model."
"But at the same time, I couldn't unlearn this."
And I struggled with what people might call me.
I'd dismissed it as a hippie thing;
lifestyle of the rich and famous.
And I really didn't want to put my face on this movement.
"And yet I sat across the table one night from my husband and I said, ""I can't unlearn this."""
"And so we sat the kids down the next morning, and I said, ""You know how mom's learned about how we have all these ingredients in our food and we didn't know?"
"I'm going to have to try to teach others about it."""
"And one of the boys looked at me and he said,"
"""Mom, how many people are on your team?"""
(Laughter)
"And I said, ""Well, it's you four... and daddy."""
(Laughter)
"And he said, ""Mom, you need a bigger team."""
(Laughter)
"And people were telling me to reach out to Erin Brockovich; they were saying, ""You're food's Erin Brockovitch."""
And people were telling me to reach out to Bobby Kennedy because he was really involved with food politics.
"And I'm from a conservative family, (Laughter) and I thought, ""I can't."""
(Laughter)
"But at the same time, I thought, ""You know, I have to at least try, and I do have all of these type A genes."""
"And so I harnessed them, and I spent a couple of weeks around the Christmas of 2006 drafting a very short e-mail to Erin Brockovitch."
"And when she actually responded,"
"I thought, ""You know, maybe one person can make a difference."""
"Then later that spring, I took all of the data and of the research that I had done, and I spent a good two weeks in a Kinko's office binding it, and shipping it off to Bobby Kennedy."
"And when his Chief of Staff called, she had me on speakerphone."
"And to this day, I still don't know who was in that room, but she said,"
"Senator Harkin has been a key defender of the program, chairs the Senator Appropriations Subcommittee."
He will be retiring.
He will be here for two years.
"That's going to be a big, big change."
"In the House, Congressman Rehberg of Montana has been the chair."
Montana is a big CSBG state.
"It's a very, very important program there."
I think something like 10% of the population are beneficiaries of it.
"Of course Jim Nolan now retired, a great advocate for CSBG had helped with Congressman Rehberg who was defeated in his run for the Senate."
So the new Chair of the Labor HHS subcommittee is going to be very powerful for the future of CSBG.
"A gentleman by the name of Jack Kingston comes from Savannah, Georgia."
"How do you, Arley and Mark, see over the past several years, the approps process has unraveled."
CSBG has gone onto a continuing resolution which actually has helped CSBG because it forced all the cuts.
"What do you see happening this year with the change with Rehberg gone with a new Chairman who perhaps is not interested in CSBG to the degree that Rehberg was, how do you see that playing out in the approps process?"
"Arley: in working with CSBG, especially the last two or three years, because of Senator Tom Harkin and his support, and others in the Senate and people in the House, they concentrate a lot of their efforts in the Senate."
We know full well that Harkin and others in the Senate have held CSBG.
You know the
President wanted to cut it a couple years ago.
"Going forward, we know Senator Harkin was a big supporter."
"We know that he'll still be Chair of the subcommittee that he chairs, and we expect that there will be some strength there."
"The House has always been a bit more difficult to navigate, even before when David Obey was Chair, CSBG was also very well supported."
When Obey left it became a bit more trying.
Rehberg was a big supporter.
Kingston is a lot more frugal from what we can tell.
He's been a lot quicker to cut programs and cut overall federal spending.
We're beginning our meetings and our discussions with that new committee and with the new Chair as we begin to navigate the CSBG water.
It doesn't help us that the cut is coming from the administration.
"It's a very progressive, democratic administration that's saying that they want these cuts as well."
"It's an uphill battle, I will kid you not."
But we will pull out all the stops.
"Initially, I would say it's not favorable going in, but we remain optimistic at all times."

He was a manifestation of God's love for us.

It has endured for generations.
"And today, it lies at the heart of my Christian faith and that of millions of Americans."
"No matter who we are, or where we come from, or how we worship, it's a message that can unite all of us on this holiday season."
"So long as the gifts and the parties are happening, it's important for us to keep in mind the central message of this season, and keep Christ's words not only in our thoughts, but also in our deeds."
"In this season of hope, let's help those who need it most -- the homeless, the hungry, the sick and shut in."
"In this season of plenty, let's reach out to those who struggle to find work or provide for their families."
"In this season of generosity, let's give thanks and honor to our troops and our veterans, and their families who've sacrificed so much for us."
And let's welcome all those who are happily coming home.

"Hello, everyone, my name is Jonathan, and I am from Taiwan."
My project starts with my friend Jack.
"My friend Jack couldn't see, and he wants to know how people around him ""look"" like."
"How his friends, his family look like, but he was too shy to ask, so I designed little invitation cards that he could give to his family, or to his classmates, to his teachers, and to his friends."
"To tell them that he wants to feel their faces, and see if they accept it."
"Through the project,"
"I learned that it is the first time that Jack ever touched his mother's face, and I am very touched, and by the same time I feel very warm."
"And I think there are many people like Jack out there, so I printed more cards, and I spread them out to other organizations."
"We hope to help more people, and this is my story."
Thank you.

"Hi, everyone, my name is Danielle, and I am form Guadalajara, Mexico."
I am here to share my story about
"""The Kilometer of Love,"" my project."
"Well, it all starts well..."
"I invented the project, so that we can help our children that have cancer from all around the world, so that they have better medications, and so that they could live a better life."
"And I believe that this program, it can help everyone, it showed me to never give up, no matter what the problem is, and that we can all make a difference, even someone like me, and we do it all from the heart, thank you."
"[claps, shouts]"
"Hello, I'm Katelyn Freedberg from Pearl River,"
"New York, and my classmates and I did a project."
"We tried to prevent bullying from happening in our school, because it's a big problem, and we wanted everyone in the school to have someone there for them when they need help, so we decided to have ADDvertisements instead of regular advertisements because they subtract from us."
"But we wanted to add something to someone's life, so, yeah."
"Our ADDvertisements were posters that display positive messages, such as ""Kindness doesn't cost anything"","
"""Be a friend not a bully"", and ""This is a bully-free zone""."
And we display these messages throughout the school.
"As soon as our peers began to understand what these messages meant, words began to turn into actions, and soon enough you couldn't find anyone who is lonely at lunch table, everyone have someone there for them."
"So, thank you."
"[Car starting, tires screeching]"
The first sight of Pyongyang is pretty dismal.
[Anthem playing in background]
We're in a hotel that's about 47 stories tall.
You mean they couldn't go through a normal 45-minute class...
"Yes, because they easily got tired."
Did those health problems in children sometimes lead the families to leave the area?
"Yes, the educated class was the first to escape."
"The families that remained were either farmers, families with disabled members, or families with many children."
"In other words, families who couldn't sustain themselves in other places."
You've also been to Fukushima and measured radiation level there.
So you've seen both:
Chernobyl and Fukushima.
What do you think when you compare the two?
Radiation level in Fukushima is way too high.
It's crazy...
That's what everyone involved in Chernobyl is saying.
"So-called ""hot spots"" in Kanto region is like the radiation level in Belarus."
"In Chernobyl, people are not allowed to live in the area with more than 1 microsievert [per hour]."
"April 23, 1994 Belarus No-Entry Zone (30km from the plant) 0.232 microsievert"
"On the other hand, many people are allowed to live in such dangerous areas as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, Nihonmatsu City, and Date City in Fukushima Prefecture."
"June 11, 2011 Fukushima Municipal Moriai Elementary School (school yard) 1.383 microsievert"
I can't believe it.
I don't WANT to believe it.
I can't understand that people are treated in such an inhumane way in my own country.
"But sadly that's how it is, and the provisional radiation exposure limit of 20 millisievert/yr for school yards hasn't been retracted yet."
"Well, they say they'll make efforts to lower the actual exposure level to as close to 1 millisievert as possible, but the regulation itself hasn't been retracted."
"And children are still playing cheerfully in cities with very high radiation, such as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, and Nihonmatsu City."
"Based on your experience with the Chernobyl children, what do you think should be done now?"
Children must be evacuated immediately.
"Adults might not be able to get out due to financial reasons, but that has nothing to do with children."
"Evacuate them in units of classes, for example."
At least for a month.
"Or, considering the level of radiation there, they shouldn't return for a while."
Otherwise they would have to face really serious consequences.
The government of Belarus eventually took the responsibility to establish programs to separate children from radiation.

"Well the founder, Salman Khan, started out by posting lessons for his cousin on YouTube and now the Khan Academy has over a million unique students per month and boasts more than 2,000 tutorials covering everything from basic addition and subtraction to advanced calculus, physics and chemistry and joining us now is Ben Goldhirsh, the CEO of GOOD, it's a company dedicated to moving the world forward through its website, magazine, videos and events."
He thought that Khan was one of the breakout stars at this year's
Technology and Entertainment and Design conference.
"Before we get to all this Khan Academy business Ben, do you like it better when we're on opposite coasts or would you be comfortable if I was to move out to California to spend more time with you?"
Ben:
"I would love to have you out here Dylan, I think we do better in person."
Dylan:
And do you feel that you speak on behalf of the entire southern California community when you welcome me into that universe?
Ben:
The thoughtful ones.
Dylan:
(laughs) Okay the thoughtful ones.
We won't get into how many thoughtful ones there are but we will get into this.
Why did you decide to feature this so prominently with GOOD?
Ben:
"For the past two years, GOOD and University of Phoenix have been focusing on solutions in this education space and we haven't seen anything like it and to contextualize the findings for you, look at Los Angeles."
"We have Teach for America, we have City Year, we have KlPP Academy."
The best of the best of social innovators but they're facing a serious problem.
"600,000 students in LAUSD with a 50 percent graduation rate."
"That's terrifying and the bottom line is the solutions that we have on the ground, in my opinion, aren't going to catch this problem."
"We need a disruptive technology, we need to really revolutionize how we're tackling this."
Khan Academy is the first thing I've seen that gives me confidence that we're going to tackle it.
"It's the most exciting thing I've seen that we're doing to do this so I'm pleased to bring it to your show,"
I think we're going to dig into a good conversation.
Dylan:
Alright let's have at it.
"The man behind the idea joins us, Salman Khan."
Founder of the Khan Academy.
High praise for what you've got going from our friend Ben down there in southern California.
"He's a thoughtful southern Californian, is how he likes to refer to himself."
What have you found is the biggest problem with this?
She has long proclaimed her innocence.
"On Thursday, FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford spoke at a press conference announcing Shakur's placement on the Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"He refers to Shakur as Joanne Chesimard, her original name:"
AARON FORD:
"Openly and freely in Cuba, she continues to maintain and promote her terrorist ideology."
She provides anti-U.S. government speeches espousing the Black Liberation Army message of revolution and terrorism.
"No person, no matter what his or her political or moral convictions are, is above the law."
"Joanne Chesimard is a domestic terrorist who murdered a law enforcement officer, execution-style."
AMY GOODMAN:
That's FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford.
"In a moment, we'll be joined by two guests: the scholar and activist Angela Davis, who faced her own murder trial decades ago, and Lennox Hinds, Assata Shakur's longtime attorney for some 40 years."
But first we turn to Assata Shakur in her own words.
"In 1998, Democracy Now! aired her reading an open letter to Pope John Paul II during his trip to Cuba."
She wrote the message after New Jersey state troopers sent the pope a letter asking him to call for her extradition.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
*My name is Assata Shakur and I was born and raised in the United States.*
*I am a descendant of Africans who were kidnapped and brought to the Americas as slaves. *
*I spent my early childhood in the racist segregated South. *
"*I later moved to the northern part of the country, *"
*where I realized that Black people were equally victimized by racism and oppression.*
"*I grew up and became a political activist, *"
"*participating in student struggles, the anti-war movement, *"
"*and, most of all, in the movement for the liberation of African Americans in the United States. *"
"*I later joined the Black Panther Party, an organization that was targeted by the COlNTELPRO program, *"
*a program that was set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBl) *
"*to eliminate all political opposition to the U.S. government's policies, *"
"*to destroy the Black Liberation Movement in the United States, *"
*to discredit activists and to eliminate potential leaders.*
"*Under the COlNTELPRO program, *"
"*many political activists were harassed, imprisoned, murdered or otherwise neutralized. *"
"*As a result of being targeted by COlNTELPRO, I like many other young people, *"
"*were faced with the threat of prison, underground, exile, or death. *"
"To Karen, the only sibling who proudly wears our mom's label of a ""kraut"" just like our Dad."
How tough is my sister?
"In the past two weeks she had the entire nursing shift at the Sherman hospital taking care of my dad replaced, had a senior services cleaning lady fired and ensured one hospice nurse would never step foot in my parents house again."
Karen like my sister Theresa is a registered nurse.
"As we contemplated every angle to maintain a quality of life for our dad,"
Karen illustrated a balance of compassion and professionalism that let me nothing short of proud.
At one point in the hospital Karen paid a visit to the nursing station to rally the troops
"""I realize you're short handed, and have many other patients."" She said"
"""But selfishly the only person I need you to care about right now is my Dad."""
Trust me they understood her message
To Donna
Ding Dong Donny
At times I believe your sole mission in life is to ensure mom and dad are truly enjoying their golden years.
"You helped them to experience so many joyful times culminating perhaps, in their trip to Vail in April for the wedding between Alex - her son - and Ali."
"From baseball games, to Lake Delavan getaways, your generosity was never lost on the man you affectionately called ""Daddio."""
To our mom
An individual who has never had any issue
looking someone directly in the eyes and telling them exactly how she feels.
"We trust, when looking into Dad's eyes, those words were more often than not, endearing because until the day he died, I don't think anyone could've loved an... ...could've loved an individual more than our dad loved our mom."
Which brings us to our Dad.
I think my family is lucky because our parents did raise us to express ourselves and to not hold anything in.
"For this reason, I believe my Dad knew how important and how much he was loved by each of us."
He doesn't need to be here today to hear it.
He already knew.
"Nonetheless, those voices in my head are echoing a few final words of gratitude that I would like to share."
I'm grateful for the love of music Dad instilled in me.
"For those Sunday afternoons when he would play some Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Glen Miller, or one of his old 78 RPM records records on his stereo and often offer a subtle ""SHH SHH, just listen to that."
"Isn't it beautiful?"""
I'm grateful for the love of fishing Dad instilled in me.
"The nights before a fishing trip with my Dad were like Christmas Eve,"
I struggled to get to sleep and I woke before dawn.
"Dad convinced me we had to hit to the lake early to have any success,"
"July 23, Stiles spent the day writing diplomas onto parchment."
[laughs]
"'Yeah, I know this is a little taxing."
I've still got students and they still have to graduate so
I'm going to write out their diplomas'--which I think is really kind of striking.
Okay.
Let's turn back for a minute to look at precisely what happened as the British invaded New Haven.
"Apparently, they decided to attack the Connecticut shore to draw some of Washington's troops away from White Plains,"
"New York, where I guess they were, and that was I guess a strong position to hold, so the British thought well, if they attack the Connecticut shore, they'll entice Washington to send some of his troops to"
Connecticut and that way maybe they can defeat them on both fronts.
"And New Haven ends up being the first target in this plan, so on July 5 the British debark in New Haven Harbor."
They had about two thousand soldiers.
One part of the troops was going to enter New Haven from
East Haven and the other part was going to enter from West
Haven.
"Stiles wrote in his diary, ""Perhaps one-third of the adult male inhabitants flew to arms and went out to meet them."
"A quarter removed out of town doing nothing, the rest remained unmoved, partly Tories, partly timid Whigs,"" and then he adds that some of the Tories armed themselves and then went out to fight with the"
British.
"That's a great example of how our--I think our impulse is to say, 'Well, the people were united in unity against the"
British.'
"It's like--well, no."
The entire town wasn't a big lump--a big lump of rebels.
"It was people with different ideas, and you just--Stiles in that one little sentence--"
"He has people going to fight with the British, people going to fight against the British."
"He has people sort of not knowing what to do and kind of just staying in town and then people not wanting to do anything, just wanted to get themselves out of there-- all sort of happening at the same time."
"People are making decisions, some pretty dramatic decisions, and they're having to make them spur of the moment, and you can see them in a lot of cases here taking a side, taking a formal side in a way that could have pretty dire consequences."
"Yale immediately was dismissed, and some students immediately ran for home."
"Supposedly, according to a diary, one student, a sophomore, instead of going home decided to go to a nearby town and read Blackstone's"
Commentaries.
Why that made sense I don't know.
"'What, the British are coming?"
I think I'll go to Fairfield and read Blackstone now.'
How we experienced it.
"The first international perception of the 15M was on the 18th or 19th, I can't remember the dates when we got a message from Egypt through a co-worker at Periodismo Humano, Olga Rodríguez."
It was from the revolutionary commission of Egypt- that's not the right name but you understand- supporting what was happening in Sol.
I remember talking to Olga about publishing it but we had to talk to the people in the Puerta del Sol first.
So they knew they had support.
ST:
"There was a problem with one of the words in that, wasn't there?"
JL:
"Yes, in the message we got from Egypt supporting the 15M, in the headline they wrote of their support to Democracia Real Ya."
"So of course, they were already talking about whether Democracia Real Ya was part of the camp, who was who... it was all very sensitive."
And I remember asking Olga if she knew who was who.
"So we explained it to them and they said OK, let's make it as broad as possible, and they changed the message and made it extensive to all the 15M."
"We didn't consider ourselves the writers of the message, we simply asked what they meant and we advised them a little about what it was all about."
"It was all so incipient, there were so many debates, it was logical that something like that should happen."
That was the first international perception we had.
"Parallel to that, you spend 12 or 15 hours in a doorway telling stories, trying to find the humane side to things, working on reports..."
"In all, doing high quality journalism and suddenly you go up to a roof on the 17th, and the man there wants to charge you for taking a photo from the balcony and you give it little importance saying it's just a mobile, and you go to the balcony and make a 40 second video."
"You publish it on the internet, because there's 3G coverage up there, and after you put it on youtube it becomes the most seen video of the month in the political news category."
And in a few hours you have hundred of thousands of reproductions.
And suddenly they tell me that the video's on the website of the New York Times.
And then in the Washington Post.
"And on BoingBoing, one of the most read blogs in English in the world."
And then more media.
And front pages... it's something...
"We were the first source of information on the 15M for the New York Times and the Washington Post, the first text they produced was a photo of mine of a woman with a non-violence sign, and the panoramic video taken from the balcony with Paz Vega in the background."
"Paz Vega, the involuntary muse of the 15M."
ST:
We shamelessly took advantage of her.
JL:
"That was the second great reaction we noticed, or that I noticed personally."
"From there on, there were radios from France, from Chile, Argentina, Miami..."
Articles in Al Jazeera.
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh Stop telephonin me!"
"- So, there you go, that was my take on Lady Gaga's Telephone, when I say Lady Gaga's original video I was like you know what?"
"I gotta do my version, because you know me, Im always out at the club parting it up, getting phone calls by girls and by girls I mean my mom."
"So here is my question to you, what is your favorite music video of all time?"
Leave me a comment of video response letting me know.
"Also I just realized by looking at myself in the camera, I look like Im wearing lipstick, truth is I have a a really have a bad rash on my lips, so Im wearing Neosporin, but it still makes me look like a drag-queen."
[kisses the air]
That was the gayest thing Ive ever done in my life.
"Alright guys, see you later, quick thanks to Totally"
"Sketch [www.youtube.com/totallysketch] for helping me make this video, Klassicmaster [http://www.youtube.com/klassicmaster] for creating the amazing beat."
"Joe Dash E for recording the song with me and everybody else that was in the video, all there links are in the side bar."
"Thank you guys, hope you have a great weekend, Im gonna go,"
Im gonna go put on the rest of my make-up.
"Allwright see you guys later, woo!"

"If you're in it for the money and you're publishing short stories in a magazine, and you're getting paid something pitiful like a half a penny a word, or a penny a word, you want to figure out ways to resell those stories."
"You'd, love it if somebody sold the movie rights for you and you got a nice commission but the more obvious thing is to publish stories that somehow can go together and then, put them together into a book."
A. E.
"Van Vogt was one of the most successful at doing this, at publishing stories that then could be drawn together into a book."
"He was one of the key writers of science fiction in the so-called golden age from the very late 1930's most people would say, until perhaps the 1960's."
Different people judge this different ways.
"His weapon shops of Isher, his stories of"
"Null A, all came out in separate pieces, and then he put them all together in what he called fix ups."
And in fact a fix up to Van Vogt was just a way of getting some kind of a thread together that would make a story be salable as part of a book.
Some of the more famous fix ups are things
"like Cities in Flight, by James Blish, where we have cities that are sort of self-contained terraria environments out in space, and they go around and each one has its own story."
And it doesn't really make much of a story all together.
"These fix-ups, if they have the right pieces, give you the pleasure of returning to the same premise again and again, it gives you the same kind of pleasure that you might get in re-reading a Sherlock"
Homes story.
"And so these fix-ups were successful, they were successful for the publishers, and they were successful for the, the writers, that is to say people were making money from them."
"Steven Pinker actually says that we are becoming more peaceful. so we did better in terms of our nature, believing the statistics."
In Toronto the crime rate has gone down.
I am not saying that is because  40 faculties are teaching the world how to meditate.
But Toronto is not the place where the crime rate should be going down.
I am not going to put those 2 statistics together but they certainly are curiosities.
"So imagine the changes you can bring and  you don't have to wait for funding, you don't have to do anything more  than to start the practise yourself."
"And you started it already,  otherwise you would not be here."
"So in closing I am going to say... (Laughter) my five streams that  at University of Toronto are mindfulness and psychotherapy, East and West so that we look at integrating  eastern-western concepts so you don't throw out the baby with the bath water."
Mindfulness in contemplative education.
"Mindfulness and the mind that works, in another word, how we can work more efficiently and effectively, by breathing and being mindful."
I have seen the embracing of that at very  significant NGOs and corporate cultures.
"We also have the embodied mind, which is part of what Thay talks about and Dan Siegel."
Yoga and mindfulness which  is being used in psychiatric facilities in downtown Toronto.
"And the last one is contemplative art, using art to be able  to bring our attention home."
"So, I am going to finish  by saying thank you very much and again much gratitude to the faculties  of University of Toronto, as well as to my masters for their  brilliance, their insight, their courage to be the change that we wish to see."
"(Phap Dung) Dear friends, please listen to one sound of the bell, and enjoy our breathing."
"Just simply breathing, smile to ourselves."

(R. Brady) Thank you Michele.
Our next speaker is actually  one of Michele's teachers.
"And in her program, Theo Koffler,  who besides teaching in the program at University of Toronto, is the founder  of Mindfulness Without Border, which has done very wonderful work in very troubled countries around the world."
And has now come back to Canada.
"- (R. Brady) Theo, - (Theo Koffler) Thank you, Richard."
"I feel so much of my story is part  of the stories that you have heard so far, and I can't wait to hear what happens towards the end."
I just want to start off by telling you  that my heart swells with excitement.
"When I look out to you, 1300 educators, I think, in this room, all interested in bringing mindfulness into your life, taking it into your professional worlds,  into education or health care, wherever you are situated."
"And to know that, in 2005, I was part  of a small group of people that developed the first ever  symposium for contemplation education."
And we were 35 people  around the table.
"And thanks to Thay and  his wonderful community, here you are, being offered the opportunity  explore the mindfulness and discover it by yourself and bring it on home."
"So, I am just so terribly blessed,  pleased and grateful at the same time to be here with you."
"So, as you heard, all of us has been asked a little bit how we got into mindfulness."
So my purpose today  is to tell you that.

Beth Cron:
"Thank you, Paulette."
Good afternoon and good morning to those of you in other time zones.
I just want to say thank you and welcome to the webinar for today.
First of all I'll provide you a little bit of background on the shared drives bulletin and how it came about.
"Based on feedback that we received from agencies and NARA staff, our management decided that we should develop a bulletin on managing shared drives."
"Through development of the bulletin, we interviewed a number of agencies on the configuration of their shared drives and asked them about any reorganization projects that they've done on their shared drives."
B-sides.
"""Somewhere Only We Know"" has been released two times as a single. Each time it had a different b-side."
Walnut Tree.
"The lyrics of ""Walnut Tree"" talk about waiting for someone or something. Rice-Oxley has not talked about a real meaning to this. The song appeared on the """" soundtrack."
Snowed Under.
"""Snowed Under"" talks about a place called ""Manser's Shaw"". This is a place where the band used to spent their days. It was inspired by a poem"
"""Snowed Under"" was the only b-side played live during 2004, 2005 and early 2006."

Parts of the speech.
The Memphis Sanitation Strike.
Non-violence.
"When talking about the Strike, King focuses on the importance of non-violence. At a protest on March 28, some protesters had become violent and started breaking windows. King says:"
"King thought that if protesters or the people on strike were violent, other people would only pay attention to the violence. They would not pay attention to how badly the sanitation workers were treated."
Boycotting.
"King suggested boycotting things sold by white businesses as a nonviolent way of protesting and getting people's attention. He explains that one black person might be poor, but all together, they spent a lot of money. This gave them power. If they stopped buying things from businesses owned by white people, then those businesses would lose a lot of money. Then they would have to pay attention, or else they could go out of business. Meanwhile, black people could use their money to buy things from businesses owned by other blacks. King says:"
The Civil Rights Movement.
King then talks about the Civil Rights Movement. He says:
King promises that civil rights activists will not stop until they get their basic human rights.

The Bible in the speech.
King was a Baptist pastor. He often mentioned stories from the Bible in his speeches.
"In the end of this speech, King is talking about a story from the Old Testament. Moses was the leader of the Israelites (the people of Israel). The Israelites followed Moses because they thought he would lead them to a Promised Land. In this Promised Land, they could live in peace."
"However, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says:"
"Soon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land."
"King is saying that like Moses, he has ""been to the mountaintop"" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land."

Highly abundant number
"Highly abundant numbers are a type of natural number. Any natural number ""n"" is called highly abundant when a certain equation is true."
formula_1
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
Example.
"An example would be to use the number 5. ""σ"" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every ""σ"" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number."
History.
"Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 104. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than ""N"" is proportional to log2 ""N""."
The first few highly abundant numbers are
There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.
Similarities with other numbers.
"The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,"
"but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,"
This makes 9! is not highly abundant.
"Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969."
7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

"These stated that the Allies were planning to invade Greece and Sardinia, and had no plans to invade Sicily. The Germans thought the documents were real. The Germans moved much of their defences from Sicily to Greece."
Battle.
Two British and two American attacks by airborne forces were done on the night of 9–10 July. They wanted to capture the bridge over the River Anape. Strong wind made them land in the wrong places. Airborne troops attacked patrols. A platoon captured the bridge and fought off counterattacks for a few hours.
The strong winds made the sea landings hard. Landings were made on 10 July on twenty-six main beaches.
By the evening of 10 July the seven Allied divisions were ashore and the port of Syracuse had been captured.
Alexander's plan was to establish his forces on a line between Licata in and Catania. He wanted to capture ports.

How Australia was settled.
"The main idea is the Out of Africa hypothesis: It says that humans developed on the African continent, and spread from there. Another important site is called Kow Swamp, in the northern part of Victoria. It consists of about twenty skeletons, which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. The morphology of Mungo Man is noticeably different from these skeletons. For this reason, some researchers have said that Australia was probably settled twice. The settlers were probably descendants of Homo erectus and came from the Asian mainland. This theory is based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA. If this is true, the two lines, that of Mungo Man and that of modern humans, separated a long time ago. This would also mean that Mitochondrial Eve of this line and that of modern humans would be older than mitochondrial Eve of all living humans."

"In the 11th century, Richard II of Normandy chose an Italian architect called William de Volpiano to build the abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel. Volpiano had already built the Abbey of Fécamp, in Normandy. He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey. He chose to place the transept crossing at the top of the mount. He also built a lot of crypts and chapels below the ground. These are to support building above, because it is very heavy. Today, Mont-Saint-Michel has a church of Romanesque style."
"Robert de Thorigny was a great supporter of Henry II of England. Henry was also Duke of Normandy at this time. Thorigny made the structure of the buildings stronger. He also built the main façade of the church in the 12th century. In 1204, the Breton ""Guy de Thouars"", a friend of the King of France, attacked the mount with an army. He set fire to the village and killed lots of people. However, he had to retreat (leave) under the powerful walls of the abbey. The fire extended to the buildings, and the roofs burnt. Philip Augustus, Thorigny's friend, was unhappy about the cruel actions and the destruction. He offered Abbot Jourdain some money to build a new Gothic-style architectural set. The abbot added the refectory (""dining room"") and cloister."

"Mont-Saint-Michel is also the subject of a traditional rivalry between Normans and Bretons. Bretons say that the Couesnon River marks the limit between Normandy and Brittany. It is only because the river has changed its course over the centuries that the mount is on the Norman side. This legend amuses the area's inhabitants. They state that the border is not located on the Couesnon river. They say it is on the mainland, to the west, at the foot of the solid mass of Saint-Brelade."

Green bromeliad frog
"The green bromeliad frog, Jamaican green tree frog, or Wilder's tree frog (""Osteopilus wilderi"") is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen between 120 and 880 meters above sea level."
The adult male frog is 24.3 to 27.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 to 29.2 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and a little webbed skin on the back feet. This frog is usually yellow-green in color but it can be red-brown in color. The belly is lighter in color. Some frogs have spots on their sides.
"This frog lives in bromeliad plants. Bromeliads are plants that can live on the ground or high up on other plants. Rainwater collects in the leaves of the bromeliads. The frogs lay their eggs in this water. The first tadpoles to hatch eat the other eggs. Scientists think the tadpoles may also eat each other. ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles do eat green bromeliad frog tadpoles if they are in the same plant. But ""Osteopilus brunneus"" lays its eggs in larger bromeliad plants, and the green bromeliad frog lays its eggs in smaller ones. Scientists think green bromeliad frogs do this so that the ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles will not eat their young."
The green bromeliad frog lives in tropical forests and subtropical forests.
The adult frog eats insects. It eats leafhoppers.
This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live to build houses and to collect wood for building.

Some examples of exothermic reactions are:"
"The chemical reaction that does the complete opposite, and absorbs heat, is an endothermic reaction."
Videos.
Since then Knowles filmed a Prager University video called “What is the Alt-Right. Knowles said that the alt-right actually had much more in common with left-wing politics than with right-wing politics. Knowles wrote a book called Reasons to Vote for Democrats about all the reasons to vote for the Democratic Party of the United States and the book had no words in it as a joke. It was praised by Ben Shapiro and Donald Trump.
"Knowles also filmed a Prager University video called “Control the Words, Control the Culture”. It is about how language can be used as a political tool. And inspired by that video, Knowles wrote a book called Speechless: Controlling Words, Controlling Minds. He argues that conservatives should support certain forms of censorship and cancel culture to fight back against left-wing politics."
He also filmed a Prager University video called Conservatives Are the Real Environmentalists in which he says that right-wing politics are better for the environment than left-wing politics are.
He also made a Prager University video called Celebrating Columbus. He says people should continue to celebrate Columbus Day despite criticism of Christopher Columbus.

It is sometimes given the name the Bir Tawil Triangle, because even though it's not an exact triangle, it's made out of two triangles that share a border. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude."
"The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size."
"The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two ""triangles"" border at one point, a quadripoint."
History.
"In 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate ""administrative boundary"". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum."
"Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state. The offical currency is the but this is no longer circulated."
Geography.
"In the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil (جبل طويل in Arabic, located at ). It has a height of 459 meters. In the east is Jabal Ḩajar az Zarqā'. It has a height of 662 meters."

Eswatini is a small country. It is no more than north to south and east to west. It is completely surrounded by land. Eswatini does not touch the sea. The two countries that touch it are Mozambique and South Africa. The country's two largest cities are the administrative capital Mbabane and the economic center Manzini. The seat of government is Lobamba.
"On 19 April 2018, the King of Eswatini Mswati III announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland had renamed itself the Kingdom of Eswatini."
Health.
Eswatini is strongly affected by HIV and AIDS. The 2012 CIA World Factbook showed Swaziland with the highest HIV infection rate in the world. Life expectancy is 50 years.
Education.
"Education in Eswatini is free at primary level, mainly 1st and 2nd grades. It is also free for orphaned and vulnerable children. Children are not required to attend. In 1996, the primary school enrollment rate was 90.8%. Girls and boys both attended at the primary level. In 1998, 80.5% of children reached grade five."
The University of Eswatini provides higher education.
Demographics.
"Most of Eswatini’s people are ethnically Swazi. There is also a small number of Zulu and white Africans, mostly people of British and Afrikaner descent. Eswatini also has some Portuguese settlers and African refugees from Mozambique."
82.70% of the people are Christian. Christianity in Eswatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices. Some people think of the king as having a spiritual role. Eswatini also has a small Muslim minority.
Swazi have been subsistence farmers and herders. They now mix such activities with work in the growing urban economy and in government. Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa.
"""SiSwati"" and English are the official languages. SiSwati has 2.5 million speakers and is taught in schools. It is also one of the official languages of South Africa."

Who is a Jew?
"Who is a Jew? () is the basic question about the identity of Jews, or in other words: which people are considered to be Jewish."
Question of race?
"The definition of who is a Jew may depend on a few things. Because Judaism has no specific race, it can include characteristics of an ethnicity, religion, and citizenship, and so the definition of who is a Jew is not specific."
"This question has been a subject to legal arguments, especially in Israel but also outside of it. There have been court cases in Israel since 1962 which had to address the question. In addition, the United Kingdom and other countries has had to consider whether the question was a racial issue or not."
In Nazi Germany.
It was an important question to the Nazi party in Germany. The Nazis decided who a Jew was with the Nuremberg Laws.
My mom is Jewish or I converted.
The question is based on the person's genealogy. Simple definition: a person is a Jew either by birth (in any case if one's mother is Jewish) or by religious conversion.
Other ideas.
"However, some disagree. Therefore, the following need to be taken into account:"

World line
"A world line is the unique path that an object has as it travels through both space and time, usually called spacetime. As we learn from special relativity, the faster an object goes, the more time slows down for that object. As you can see in the illustration to the right, the slower object has a quicker passage of time than the very fast object, the one which time passes much more slowly for. When an object reaches the speed of light, it will be zero on the ""t"" axis, meaning that it will have made no progress in the time direction. Basically, the world lines show that when the speed of light is reached, time stops for the observer. World lines are very often used in theoretical physics and special relativity, as well as general relativity."
Usage.
"The concept of world lines is used widely in theoretical physics, for it shows some interesting facts about high-speed motion. For example, the time dilation equation presented by Albert Einstein is algebraically undefined when an object's velocity is the speed of light, but using world lines one can find that when the speed is the speed of light, time will stop. Although Einstein's equation (for time dilation) does show that an object going faster than light goes backward in time, the same concept can be described using world lines."

"At 32 years old, Pierre-Luc Gagnon is a successful skateboarder and well-known in his discipline. He has won eight gold medals at the X-Games competition."
"Gagnon found his passion at the age of nine years old. He asked his father to buy his first skateboard. When he got it, he started to visit the local planchodrome intensively. But during the winter in Quebec, it is harder to find a place to practice this sport. With a group, they decided to rent a localation where they put some ramps."

"But in 2000, He decided to move to California where the sport is more important and he could do it all year long. There is also more competition in California. Since he moved there, he has competed in Brazil, China and Switzerland. For him, skateboarding is not just a sport; it is a kind of art. It is a way of expressing himself, being original and unique. It is not a traditional sport where everybody executes the same tricks. A skateboarder needs to develop a unique style almost like an artist."
"Pierre-Luc Gagnon said that skateboarding helps kids to use their imagination for trying new things. He fell in love with skateboarding when he started and he never stops. He started to go to the skate park each day after school at the age of nine, and now he practices it six days a week three hours by day."

Triathlon
"A triathlon is a sport that consists of three different events one after another without resting in between. Usually, they are swimming, cycling, and running. Triathlon has been in the Olympic Games since 2000. One of the hardest and most famous triathlons is the Ironman Triathlon, which involves swimming two miles, biking a hundred miles, and then running a marathon."
Continuous function
"A mathematical function is called continuous if, roughly said, a ""small change"" in the input only causes a ""small change"" in the output. If this is not the case, the function is discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an ""uninterrupted line (or curve)"". They can be drawn ""without lifting the pen off of the page"". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy."
"Karl Weierstraß gave another definition of continuity: Imagine a function ""f"", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that formula_6, means that formula_7. We can put this another way, given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the ""absolute value"" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made increasingly small, if the point x is ""close enough"" to formula_1."
"There are also special forms of continuous, such as ""Lipschitz-continuous"". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y ∈ (a,b)."
"A basic way to know if a function is continuous is to use a pencil or your finger. Then, start at the left of the function. Then, move your finger along the path of the function. If you ever need to lift your finger or pencil to keep following the function, then you know it is not continuous. This is because, by lifting your finger, you have ""jumped"" from one section of the function to another. That means you made a very small movement but the function changed very much. This is what the first sentence of this article is talking about."

Origins.
"The ""Herald Sun"" newspaper was formed in 1990 when the morning tabloid paper ""The Sun News-Pictorial"" joined with the afternoon broadsheet paper ""The Herald"". It was first published on 8 October 1990 as the ""Herald-Sun"". The hyphen in its title was dropped on May 1, 1993."
History.
The Herald.
"""The Herald"" was started on 3 January 1840 by George Cavanaugh as ""The Port Phillip Herald"". In 1855, it became ""The Melbourne Herald"", but a week later became ""The Herald"". From 1869, it was an evening newspaper. Colonel William Thomas Reay was sometime literary editor and later associate editor, before becoming managing editor in 1904."
The Sun News-Pictorial.
"""The Sun News-Pictorial"" began on 11 September 1922, and bought by The Herald and Weekly Times in 1925."
The merger.
"""The Herald"" once sold almost 600,000 copies, but by the time of its 150th anniversary in 1990 it had fallen below 200,00. This was caused by the impact of evening television news and more people using cars to get home from work.'This was much less than that of the morning ""Sun""."
"As a result, The Herald and Weekly Times decided to merge the two, and so after one hundred and fifty years, ten months and two days of publication, ""The Herald"" was published for the last time as a separate newspaper on 5 October 1990. The next day, ""The Sun News-Pictorial"" published its last edition. The Sunday editions of the two newspapers had already been merged. The resulting newspaper had both the size and style of ""The Sun News-Pictorial""."
"With sales still falling, the afternoon edition was cancelled, the last edition being published on December 21, 2001. The News Limited now produces ""mX"" a free afternoon paper that can be picked up from stands throughout the Melbourne CBD. It is not available outside that area."
"Recent editors include Peter Blunden, Simon Pristel, Phil Gardner and Bruce Guthrie."

Abduction (logic)
"Abduction is the kind of practical logic which answers questions of the type ""how did this come about?"". It produces answers which are not guaranteed to be correct. Consider the observation that the lawn is wet in the morning. How did that happen? In London, the answer is most often that it rained. But in Los Angeles it is much more likely that someone left the sprinkler on."
"Abduction is logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation. It makes the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. Abductive reasoning is ""inference to the best explanation""."
The philosopher (1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic.

"It is relatively safe to take linezolid for short periods. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common harmful effects of short-term use include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Long-term use, however, has been associated with more serious harmful effects."

Though trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker as a Jedi, he has been drawn to the dark side of the Force, and wants to be as powerful as his grandfather, Darth Vader who he praised and thought was the king of evil, not the one who killed the emperor. Throughout all of T""he Force Awakens"" and the first two acts of ""The Last Jedi,"" Ren wants to be fully committed to the dark side, but there are times where the light side tries to pull him back in. This can be seen because when he kills his father Han, he hesitates before he does it. Even when he has a chance to kill his mother Leia, he chooses not to after giving it thought. This makes him a complex character."
"Kylo Ren is the master of the Knights of Ren and a commander for the , an organization created from the fallen .The First Order believed that the Empire's leader, Emperor Palpatine, had been killed by Luke Skywalker, not Darth Vader.

LNWR electric units
"During 1909-1922, the London and North Western Railway embarked on a large-scale project to electrify their whole London inner-suburban network, encompassing the lines from London Euston to Watford and the North London Railway from London Broad Street to Richmond. This also included branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green (where a depot was built to house the electric units), and links to what was to become the London Underground network. For this reason, the lines were electrified using the fourth rail 630V DC system, the electricity being generated at the LNWR's own power station in Stonebridge Park. The first electric passenger trains ran in 1914, limited to the West London line route (Willesden to Earls Court), and full services over the whole network did not begin until 1922, work having been delayed by the First World War. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway extended the network in 1927 by electrifying the branch to Rickmansworth."

Manchester to Bury.
"After the Holcombe Brook service, the L&amp;YR decided to electrify the Manchester to Bury line. The system used was 1,200 V DC from a side-contact third rail. The purpose of this unusual arrangement was to prevent the service being affected by ice forming on the live rail. Sixty-six cars were built at Newton Heath works. The electrical equipment was supplied by Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. The first public services ran on 17 April 1916,"

Critical thinking
"Critical thinking is ""thinking about thinking"". It is a way of deciding if a claim is true, false, or sometimes true and sometimes false, or partly true and partly false."
"To find out if someone is telling you the truth, one needs evidence. Information is found in libraries, online, and by asking people. Professional librarians can help research library sources. Cybrarians can help research using computers. Professional interviewers are good at finding people who are experts in their fields, and they know how to ask the right questions."
"To solve a problem, questions can be written as clearly and simply as possible, making certain that all terms are well understood by giving definitions if necessary. Then, this critical thinking can help one judge how true this information is. Critical thinking tools are taken from many fields of study: statistics, logistics, semantics, experimental research methodology, psychology, sociology. Research sources should be of good quality: up to date, thorough, well-informed, and impartial."

Caroline Herschel
Caroline Herschel (16 March 1750 – 9 January 1848) was a German astronomer who spent most of her life in England. She was the first female astronomer that we know of.
"She was the first woman to receive a salary as a scientist. She was the first woman in England to hold a government position. She was the first woman to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828), and to be named an Honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville). She was also named an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1838). The King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science on the occasion of her 96th birthday (1846)."
Early life.
"Caroline was born on March 16, 1750 in Hanover, Germany. She was encouraged by her father to get an education. She learnt geometry on her own. She had a hard life because people that she loved died. After her father's death, her brother William Herschel suggested she join him in England. She left Hanover for England on August 16, 1772, with her brother."
"In England, Caroline's neighbour taught her how to cook, market, and to speak English. This expanded her horizons. William encouraged her to be independent. She signed up to learn how to sing and to play the harpsichord. This led her to being a part of William’s musical shows in small gatherings. She and William discussed astronomy in their free time. This caused her interest to grow. Caroline began including English society in her everyday life. She eventually decided to devote her time to astronomy. This helped William: he needed Caroline’s talents in copying papers."
Astronomy.
"When they were in England, Caroline helped her brother in his scientific work. She helped him to discover Uranus with a six-foot telescope. William was credited with the discovery of Uranus. He was knighted because of his discovery, and she was his assistant. She recorded and completed tasks for him. Her calculations and record keeping were always accurate. They saved her brother a lot of time. Caroline often worked on discoveries of her own. She independently discovered the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 110; NGC 205) and another, new, nebula. She also discovered eight comets in 17861795."
"She reworked Flamsteed's ""Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars"". The result was published by the Royal Society in 1798 and contained an index of every observation of every star made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of more than 560 stars that had not been included. In 1825, Caroline donated the works of Flamsteed to the Royal Academy of Göttingen."
"She was the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered seven more comets between 1789 and 1797. The comet 35P/Herschel-Rigollet is named in her honor, as well as the lunar crater C. Herschel, and the planetoid (281) Lucretia. She also is famous for her work with her brother. She aided him in his studies. She reorganized John Flamsteed's ""British Catalogue"", which listed nearly 3,000 stars."
Herschel's brother died in 1822 and left her without his financial support. She returned to Hanover after his death and received her stipend from the British Royal Family. She also helped her brother's son finish his father's work.
Awards.
Caroline Herschel was awarded a gold medal for her works in science from the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. She was made an honorary member at the Royal Astronomical Society ten years later. Herschel also received a similar award from the Royal Irish Academy. She was awarded the gold medal for science by the King of Prussia on her ninety-sixth birthday.
Legacy.
"Toward the end of Caroline's life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. Her nephew, John Herschel, re-examined them systematically. The list was eventually enlarged and renamed the New General Catalogue. Many non-stellar objects are still identified by their NGC number."
"Herschel died on January 9, 1848 in Germany. She died at the age of 97. Herschel was never married."
"An asteroid was discovered in 1888. It was called Lucretia, Herschel's middle name. Herschel continued to have a legacy after her death because she discovered several comets."

Bilal's owner was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, an enemy of Islam. When Bilal learned about Muhammad and became Muslim, his master started punishing him.

"Some years later, when the Muslim army walked towards Mecca, everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Kaaba, the worship house believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""

However, it differs from other titles in that there is no assisted aiming, a bigger focus on gameplay, and online multiplayer. Samus Aran, the main character that the player plays as, can access her gunship from anywhere. The game uses both screens of the Nintendo DS: the top screen is used to show Samus' health and the amount of a weapon remaining, while the bottom screen shows the radar. The player moves Samus with the D-pad, and aiming is done with the use of the touch screen on the Nintendo DS' bottom screen."
"Online multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play as Samus or one of six bounty hunters. Each bounty hunter has different forms and weapons. The game's host is able to set options for points and time limits, as well as determine whether or not players can use the radar.

Numerical integration
"Numerical integration is the term used for a number of methods to find an approximation for an integral. Numerical integration has also been called quadrature. Very often, it is not possible to solve integration analytically, for example when the data consists of a number of distinct measurements, or when the antiderivative is not known, and it is difficult, impractical or impossible to find it. In such cases, the integral can be written as a mathematical function defined over the interval in question, plus a function giving the error."
One way to find a numerical integral is using interpolation. Very often these interpolating functions are polynomials.
"Various formulas have been studied for many years and become famous. For example, there is the Gaussian quadrature (named after Gauss), the Newton-Cotes formula (named after Isaac Newton), and the Euler-Maclaurin formula (named after Leonhard Euler)."
Numerical errors.
"Numerical errors can occur in any kind of numerical computation including numerical integration. Errors in numerical integration are considered in another area called ""validated numerics""."
"This cross is a symbol of hope over death, and of victory in returning to life. (See Philippians 2:8-9)"

Vaughan Williams always pronounced his first name “Rafe” - (“Vaughan” rhymes with “born”). His father was a rector. Ralph was very young when his father died. The family moved to Dorking near London. He went to Charterhouse School and played the viola in the school orchestra. He studied at the University of Cambridge and at the Royal College of Music where Hubert Parry was his teacher.
Early career.
"Vaughan Williams wanted to be a good composer, so he went abroad to study with famous composers like Max Bruch in Berlin and Maurice Ravel in Paris. Yet he knew that he must not simply imitate these composers, so he also studied English folk song. He became good friends with the composer Gustav Holst. The two men always showed one another the music they were writing so that they could help one another by offering criticism."
"In 1910 he wrote a work which became one of his best-known pieces of music: the ""Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis"". The piece is for a string orchestra divided into two sections. It uses a theme by the famous 16th century composer Tallis. He also wrote hymn tunes for the English Hymnal. One of his most popular hymn tunes is the one called ""Sine Nomine"" sung to the words “For all the saints”. Another lovely work is ""The Lark Ascending"". This is a short work for solo violin and orchestra. The violin sounds like a skylark singing in the sky. In 1934 he wrote a short piece for flute, harp and string orchestra called ""Fantasia on Greensleeves"" which is based on the famous English Renaissance tune ""Greensleeves""."
Later works.
"During his long life Vaughan Williams wrote nine symphonies, works for the stage, songs, choral music and chamber music. In 1938 he wrote a famous piece called ""Serenade to Music"" for 16 solo singers and orchestra. It was one of several works he wrote inspired by Shakespeare. The words were from the play ""The Merchant of Venice"". It was written for the 50th anniversary of Sir Henry Wood’s career as a conductor. In 1953 he wrote music for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, including a very short and simple motet ""O taste and see"" which has remained very popular with church choirs."
In his old age he became quite deaf. This was because of the noise of gunfire he had been exposed to when he was serving as a stretcher bearer in World War I.
Urðarbrunnr
"Urðarbrunnr (Old Norse for the ""Well of Urðr"") is a well in Norse mythology. It is situated under the Yggdrasil or the world tree.

Gameplay.
"""Mario Party 5"" plays the same as the first four ""Mario Party"" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Boards have different types of spaces, including blue spaces which add coins, red spaces which take away coins, and Bowser Spaces which causes Bowser to appear and do a bad event. The game introduces the DK Space, where Donkey Kong appears to cause an event to happen. Unlike Bowser events, these events are always good. Also new to the game is the Capsule system, which replaces the item system from past games. Capsules are containers that hold a single item. Players can get capsules by passing by the ""Capsule Machine"" on the board. Each capsule does something different, including increasing the number of dice blocks a player can roll, and taking away coins from an opponent. Capsules can be thrown up to ten spaces away."
"Ten characters are playable. New to the series as a playable character are Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Because of the addition of the DK Space, Donkey Kong is no longer a playable character."
"In addition to the main party game, players can also play a mode called Super Duel Mode. In Super Duel Mode, players build a battle vehicle to use in tournaments or fight against friends. Players are able to change their vehicle by using different parts. Parts can be bought with the points from mini-games."

The name Albert II refers to :
Nemuro Province
was a old province of Japan on the island of Hokkaido. The history of the province started in 1869 and ended in 1882.
The boundaries of this ancient province are generally mirrored in what is today called Nemuro Subprefecture.
History.
"Sir Richard Timothy Hunt , (born 19 February 1943 in Neston, Cheshire), is an English biochemist. He is usually known as Tim Hunt."
Hunt shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on cell division.
The prize was shared with Paul Nurse and Leland H. Hartwell. They had discovered the molecules which control cell division.
"Cyclins are proteins that play a key role in regulating the cell-division cycle. Hunt found that cyclins begin to be synthesised after eggs are fertilised. He also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells, where they also regulate the cell cycle."
Early life.
"At the age of eight he was accepted into the Dragon School, where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher, Gerd Sommerhoff."
"When he was fourteen he moved to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where the science prizes now bear his name."
Career.
"In 1961, Hunt was accepted into Clare College, Cambridge to study natural sciences, graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry."
"He finished his PhD in 1968 and went to New York to work on protein synthesis. Tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes (immature red blood cells), and tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge he continued work on substances which started or inhibited protein synthesis."
"In 1982 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, he used the sea urchin (""Arbacia punctulata"") egg as his model organism. He discovered the cyclin molecule."
Hunt found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells where they regulate the cell cycle. His group showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases. One of these had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse.
"In 1990 he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their work on cell division. Other honours followed, and he was knighted by the Queen in 2006."
Personal life.
Hunt is married to Mary Collins. The couple have two daughters.
"Christ Church, Oxford"
Christ Church is one of the largest colleges of the University of Oxford. The college was founded by Henry VIII in 1546.
"As well as being a college, Christ Church is also the cathedral church of the diocese of Oxford, namely Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford."
People.
"Christ Church has produced thirteen British prime ministers. This is equal to the number produced by all 45 other Oxford colleges put together, and two short of the total number for the University of Cambridge (fifteen)."
Appearance in novels.
"The college is the setting for parts of Evelyn Waugh's ""Brideshead Revisited"", as well as Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". More recently it has been used in the filming of the movies of J. K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series and also the movie adaptation of Philip Pullman's novel ""Northern Lights"" (the movie bearing the title of the US edition of the book, ""The Golden Compass"")."
Architecture.
"Distinctive features of the college's architecture have been used as models by a number of other academic institutions. The University of Chicago and Cornell University both have reproductions of Christ Church's dining hall. Christ Church Cathedral, New Zealand, after which the City of Christchurch is named, is itself named after Christ Church, Oxford. Stained glass windows in the cathedral and other buildings are by the Pre-Raphaelite William Morris group with designs by Edward Burne-Jones."
Female students.
The college has admitted female students since 1978.
Roman Wallner
"Roman Wallner (born 4 February 1982 in Graz, Styria) is a former Austrian footballer. He played as striker."
Career.
"He started playing football in his hometown Graz for Sturm Graz, the next year he played for SK Rapid Wien. He played for Rapid from 1999 till 2004 and shot 42 goals in 134 matches. Roman Wallner also played for Hannover 96, Admira Wacker, Austria Vienna, Falkirk, Hamilton Academical, Apollon Kalamarias and Skoda Xanthi. After his years in Greece he came back to Austria playing for LASK Linz. Because he had also personal problems during his time in foreign countries the contract with LASK was his last chance to gain success in football. He played this year very successfully and scored 19 goals for LASK and Red Bull Salzburg where he went in winter 2010. In the 2010/11 season he was the best scorer for Red Bull Salzburg with 18 goals in the league and 4 goals in international matches."

Their ECHL affiliate team is the South Carolina Stingrays. The Bears have won a total of 11 Calder Cups."
Social Security (United States)
"In the United States, Social Security is the term for the federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. That program is run by the Social Security Administration. The original Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. The current version of the Act, as amended, involves many social welfare and social insurance programs."
"Social Security gets its money through payroll taxes. Those taxes are called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Almost all salaried income, up to an certain amount set by law (see tax rate table below), is taxed by the Social Security payroll tax. All income over the set amount is not taxed. In 2019, the maximum amount of taxable money is $132,900."
"In 2017, Social Security spent $806.7 billion for OASDI and $145.8 billion for DI."
History.
"A limited form of the Social Security program started during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term. It started using ""social insurance"" to help during the Great Depression of the 1930s."
"Duffield Castle, Derbyshire"
"Duffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield, Derbyshire. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument."
"The rocky site was easy to defend, because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb. It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times. The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby) which was N-shaped route for the North Sea ports."
"Ancient items of Anglo-Saxons have been found there. They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site. Also, many Roman or Romano-British pottery has been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum, but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost."
The Norman Castle.
"Henry de Ferrers (Ferrars) faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. It was between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence. He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land. This castle was probably built of wood."
"His third son, Robert, fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, and became the first Earl of Derby."
"His great grandson, William, became the Earl in 1162. He supported King's sons when they resisted Henry II, and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173."
"William II was favored by King John, and took back the land of Wirksworth, Ashbourne, and Horston Castle (Horsley). The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone. William III was also favored as William II was."
"The next Earl (the 7th generation), Robert, fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Once the king forgave Robert, but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield. He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later."
"The castle was completely destroyed. Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings, and the place gradually retuned to wild."
Excavations.
"When the site was surveyed, the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it. The size of the rock was really remarkable, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London."
"The grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations, and transferred to the National Trust in 1899. For many years, Parish Council was in charge of the site, but recently the role was handed down to the Trust."
"Other surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans, because many Romano‑British items were found."
"A geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001. Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found, and they appeared to date from the same period. The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations."
Emme
"Melissa Aronson (born 1963 in New York, New York), better known as Emme, is an American plus-size supermodel. She is one of the leading plus-sized models in the profession, as well as its highest earner."

Giro d'Italia
"The Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, is a famous bicycle race held in Italy, every spring. It is one of the most famous, and best paid bicycle races. The first race was in 1909. It started because the editor of a newspaper called ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"" wanted more people to read his newspaper. He planned a race similar to the Tour de France, which had started in 1903."
"The leader of the race wears a pink jersey called the ""maglia rosa"". This is because pink is the colour of ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"". For many years, the leader of the mountain climbing competition wore a green jersey (called the ""maglia verde""), but a change in the sponsor for that competition led to a jersey change in 2012. The mountains leader now wears a blue jersey (called the ""maglia azzurra""). Similarly, the leader of the sprinters' competition wore a mauve jersey (called the ""maglia ciclamino"") for many years. However, a sponsorship change in 2010 also led to a jersey change. The sprints leader now wears a red jersey (called ""maglia rosso passione""). The leader of the young riders' competition, for riders under age 25, wears a white jersey (called the ""maglia bianca""). This is the same as the young riders' competition in the Tour de France."

Tiberius
"Tiberius (Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus, 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD) was the second Roman Emperor. He ruled from 14 to 37 AD. He was the step-son of Caesar Augustus."
"Tiberius was one of Ancient Rome's greatest generals, whose campaigns protected the northern frontier. He reigned for 22 years, and the first part of his imperial work was excellent. Later, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and somber ruler. After the death of his son Drusus in 23, the quality of his rule declined and ended in terror."
"In 26, Tiberius moved from Rome to the Isle of Capri, and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian Prefect Sejanus. Sejanus became the effective ruler of Rome, and plotted against Tiberius, murdering people who opposed him. When alerted, Tiberius counter-plotted to remove Sejanus from his official positions, and eventually executed him. More executions followed of people who had committed crimes under Sejanus' rule."
"Caligula, Tiberius' grand-nephew and adopted grandson, succeeded the Emperor upon his death."

Black Forest ham
"Black Forest ham () is a variety of dry-cured smoked ham produced in the Black Forest region of Germany. Since 1997, it can only be made in a well-defined geographical area. In the case of Black Forest ham, the salting, and curing needs to be done in the Black Forest. Most of the pigs used come from other regions of Germany, or the European Union. This only applies to the European Union, though. In the United States and Canada, there are different kinds of ham which are sold as ""Black Forest ham"": These are usually produced locally, and very often, the methods of producing them are different from the original of the Black Forest."
"In 2018, about 6. 1 million tons were produced. About 85 percent was sold through discount stores, about ten percent was sold through specialized retailers, and the remaining fice percent was sold through restaurants."
Preparation.
"Raw ham is salted and seasoned with garlic, coriander, pepper, juniper berries and other spices. After curing for two to three weeks, the salt is removed and the ham aged an additional two weeks. It is then cold-smoked using ""local conifers and sawdust"" at around for several days. It ripens in an air-conditioned room for several weeks, becoming almost black on the outside and acquiring much of its distinctive flavor. As a result it usually tastes very salty."
Characteristics.
"Black Forest ham is boneless and about one-fifth fat. It has a very pronounced flavor and is common in German cuisine. It may be eaten fresh, for example on ""Holzofenbrot"" or rye bread, with fruit, or used as an ingredient in cooked dishes. Whole pieces of Black Forest ham can be preserved for months when stored properly. It is typically served at room temperature."

Myeong-dong
"Myeong-dong (, literally means 'bright town') is an area in Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is mostly a commercial area, being one of the main shopping and tourism districts in Seoul."
"Actually, Myeong-dong is not an original name and it was not known as a commercial area at first. During the Joseon Dynasty era, it was mostly a residential district called Myeongryebang (). Later on, under the Japanese colonization, the name was changed to Myeongchijeong (). It started to be more like a commercial district during that colonial period. Finally it was changed to the current name, Myeong-dong in 1946, after independence."
Shopping.
"In Myeong-dong, there are several large department stores and shopping malls such as Lotte (), Shinsegae (), Migliore and Noon square. Also, the main streets are lined with lots of clothing shops, cosmetics stores, and international retailers."
"This area has become more and more international. The survey targeted 12,000 tourists departing Korea, and 55.3% answered that their major tourist destination was Myeong-dong, and it is one of the most popular shopping spots. Favorite items are Korean cosmetics such as Missha and Nature Republic, and there are most of Korean cosmetics brand stores on the main street of Myeong-dong. Therefore, it is necessary for those stores to hire bilingual staffs fluent in English, Japanese, or Chinese, and it attracts more and more foreign shoppers."
Transportation.
"There are two Seoul Subway stations near the district; Station #202, Euljiro 1-ga on Line 2 on the north end of the area, Station #424, Myeong-dong on Line 4 on the south end of the area."
Chuncheon
"Chuncheon is the capital city of Gangwon Province in South Korea. The city is in a small flat area surrounded by mountains. The Soyang River is around the city. It is the water source of the Han River. Because of this river, Chuncheon has lots of foggy days. Chuncheon is a popular tourist attraction among Korean and East Asian tourist thanks to the popular Korean drama ""Winter Sonata""."
Tourism.
"Gang chon is a popular tourist attraction especially for university students in Korea because it is near Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. It has good accommodation and entertainment facilities."
"Chungpyeongsa is a temple which was built in Goryeo Dynasty. Because it is located in a beautiful mountain, many people go there to enjoy the beautiful scenery and valleys with their family."
"Namiseom is a popular tourist island which became famous as a filming location of ""Winter Sonata"". It has a beautiful forest trail so that many couples and family who visit Chuncheon stop by there a lot. People can rent bikes or ride a short rail to look around the island."
Food.
"The city has several famous foods. One of them is 'dak galbi'. 'Dak galbi' is a stir-fried chicken with sliced cabbage, sweet potatoes, rice cakes, sesame leaves and picy 'go chujang' sauce. It is usually cooked on a big iron pan on the center of the table. There is even a 'dak galbi' street which has many famous 'dak galbi' restaurants in the downtown of the city. Another famous food is 'makguksu.' 'Makguksu' is thin buckwheat noodles served in a cold beef broth with sesame seeds, sliced beef, cucumber, and spicy sauce."
Transportation.
"Chuncheon has a train transportation named Gyeonchun Line. With this track, it takes about one hour and twenty minutes from Chuncheon station to Yongsan station in Seoul. Also, it has subway transportation to Seoul. It takes about one hour and forty minutes from Chuncheon station to Sangbong station in Seoul. People can take either train or subway in Chuncheon station and Namchuncheon station. It has bus transportation too. Near Namchuncheon station, there is Chuncheon Bus Terminal. This connects to all major cities in mainland Korea."
"The coal swamps were world-wide because, for that long time, the continents were close together in Gondwana. Therefore they had similar wet, tropical climates."
History.
The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian (~300 milliom years ago). Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent – Gondwana.
These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya).
"The only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur, India. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur."
"Some textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic. These are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves, such as those of ""Gontriglossa"", ""Sagenopteris"", or ""Mexiglossa""."
"Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass-extinction event."
Gnetophyta
"The Gnetophytes are a group of seed plants with three genera. Their evolutionary relationships are unclear, but it is now clear that they are related to each other."
The three genera are:
"By looking at the structure of these organisms (morphology) and the DNA (molecular taxonomy), scientists have found that ""Gnetum"" and ""Welwitschia"" are more closely related to each other than to ""Ephedra""."

Warren Zevon
"Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 – September 7, 2003) was an American rock singer-songwriter and musician known for including his strange and somewhat critical opinions of life in his lyrics. Zevon wrote many songs that were humorous and often political"
"Many famous musicians have said they liked Zevon's work, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His most famous songs include ""Werewolves of London"", ""Lawyers, Guns and Money"", ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner"" and ""Johnny Strikes Up The Band."" All of these are from his third and most famous album: ""Excitable Boy"" (1978). Zevon has written many songs that were recorded by other artists. These include ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), ""Accidentally Like a Martyr,"" ""Mohammed's Radio,"" ""Carmelita"", and ""Hasten Down the Wind""."
"Zevon sometimes recorded or sang cover songs. He liked to sing Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" and Leonard Cohen's ""First We Take Manhattan"". He was often a guest on ""Late Night with David Letterman"" and the ""Late Show with David Letterman"". Letterman later sang with Zevon on ""Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)"" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra."
"He had a lot of problems in his life, including divorce, alcoholism, and suicide attempts. He also had a paranoia of doctors and this killed him: he did not know he had cancer until doctors could not help him."
Early life.
"Zevon was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were to William Zevon, a Secular Jew and Beverly Cope Simmons, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, Utah. They soon moved to Fresno, California. By the age of 13, Zevon sometimes visited Igor Stravinsky where he studied modern classical music. Zevon's parents divorced when he was 16 years old. After the divorce, he dropped out of high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York to become a folk singer."
Success.
"In 1978, Zevon released his most popular and critically acclaimed album ""Excitable Boy"". Radio stations often played the songs off the album, especially ""Werewolves of London."" ""Werewolves of London"" and ""Excitable Boy"" were both examples of black humor (jokes about bad things). The album also had the songs ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner"" and ""Lawyers, Guns and Money,"" which were both deadpan humor songs about geopolitics."
"""Rolling Stone"" named the album one of the most important albums in the 1970s. They said that he, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and Bruce Springsteen were four of the best new artists to emerge in the 1970s."
Names.
"Most Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat."
"If a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with ""Maków Mazowiecki,"" the county may become either ""Maków County"" or ""Maków-Mazowiecki County."" Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two ""double-barreled"" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives """"bielski"","" """"grodziski"","" """"ostrowski"" and ""tomaszowski"""" each denote ""two"" distinct counties."
History and functioning.
"Some Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the ""urban county"" (""powiat grodzki""), similar in local administration and self-governance to ""land counties."" An average county (the largest being the powiat of Białystok) comprises 5 – 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw."
"The history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795."
"In the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland""), and as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań."
"After Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. ""Powiat""s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 ""land counties"" (""powiat ziemski"") and 65 ""urban counties"" (""powiat grodzki""), more formally ""municipalities with county status"" (""miasto na prawach powiatu"")."

WaveBird Wireless Controller
"The WaveBird Wireless Controller is a wireless game controller for the Nintendo GameCube video game console. It uses radio frequency signals to communicate with the controller. It is powered by standard AA batteries. It was released in 2002. Its name is a reference to Dolphin, which is what the GameCube was named during development."
"The WaveBird controller has the same design as the normal GameCube controllers. It is a little bigger and heavier than the normal GameCube controllers. It has a dial for selecting the channel a person wants the controller on, an on/off switch, and an orange LED light which is used to show that the controller is turned on. The WaveBird does not have the rumble feature that the normal GameCube controller has, as that would make the battery last for a shorter amount of time."
"Like the normal GameCube controller, the WaveBird can be used with the Wii. It can be used for GameCube and Virtual Console titles, as well as with some Wii games and WiiWare titles. The WaveBird became more popular after the Wii's release because of how it can control those games wirelessly."
Battle of Bataan
The Battle of Bataan was part of Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.
"The capture of the Philippine Islands was important to Japan's goals. Japan wanted to control the Southwest Pacific, capture the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, and protect its Southeast Asia side."
It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino military history. It was the largest United States surrender since the pre-Civil War's raid on Harper's Ferry.
Invasion.
"Japanese carrier planes attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941. Japanese aircraft also bombed the main bases of the American Far East Air Force near Manila, and the headquarters of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines. Many American planes were destroyed. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet withdrew its ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreated south. Only the submarine force was left to fight the Japanese."
"From 8 to 10 December, Japan captured airfields at Batan Island, Aparri, and Vigan City. Army Air Force B-17s attacked Japanese ships. U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, the flagship ""Nagato"", a destroyer and sank one minesweeper."
"The main attack was on 22 December 1941. The 14th Japanese Imperial Army attacked, led by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma."
War Plan Orange-3.
"After capturing the beaches, the Japanese launched a major attack."
"The American commander, General Douglas MacArthur, realized that the beach defense plan had failed. On 26 December, he said that War Plan Orange-3 (WPO-3) was now being used. This was a plan to defend only Bataan and Corregidor. The plan of WPO-3 was to delay Japanese forces until the U.S. Pacific Fleet could get to the Philippines."
"Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippines, his family and government staff were moved to Corregidor. MacArthur's headquarters were also moved to Corregidor."
The retreat.
Gen. MacArthur wanted to move his men to defensive positions.
"When the Japanese attacked, the untrained Philippine Army troops defending the beach were beaten. The U.S. decided to fight at Layac to slow down the Japanese troops. Later, from 1 to 5 January 1942, the U.S. fought to allow its troops to withdraw to Bataan."
WPO-3 had two defensive lines across Bataan.
The stand.
"On 9 January, Japanese forces under Lt. Gen. Susumu Morioka attacked the eastern side of the Abucay-Mauban line. They were beaten by the U.S. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River valley. U.S. troops fought off the attackers. At another battle to the west, a Japanese force got past the Abucay-Mauban line. The U.S. stopped their advance. On 15 January, 1st Regular Division was bombed, but they held the line. The Japanese moved through a gap. The Abucay-Mauban line had to be abandoned on 22 January."
"Within four days, the Orion-Bagac line was formed. The remaining Japanese troops managed to get through. General Homma ordered the stopping of all operations to reorganize his forces. On 22 February the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north."
"Japanese troops landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. The US sunk two barges and the rest scattered into two groups. The Japanese forces were stopped by Philippine Constabulary units and U.S. Army Air Corps men fighting as infantry. Japanese commanders sent new troops to the beaches, but they could not break out."
Fall of Bataan.
"On the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family left Corregidor. MacArthur went to Australia. He promised the Filipino people that he ""shall return"". After the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese sent artillery forces to the Philippines. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150 mm cannons, and the Type 96 240 mm field howitzer. The Japanese sent new troops to Gen. Homma's 14th Imperial Army. Toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final attack."
"The station was opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton. It was changed by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, to include services to Ilford by way of the Fairlop Loop that was opened in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway until it was given to the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central Line services of the London Underground. The station was a terminus for the Central Line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle towards Epping, until electric services began as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948."

Abram Games
"Abram Games (29 July 191427 August 1996) was a British graphic designer. He was born Abraham Gamse. He was the son of immigrants: a Latvian photographer and a Russo-Polish (part Russian, part Polish) seamstress. He anglicized (make something sound more English) his name to Games at age 12 and was basically an autodidactic designer, and went to London's St. Martins School of Art (today named the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) for only two terms. However, while working as a ""studio boy"" (a general assistant) in commercial design company Askew-Young in London 1932-36, he took night classes in life drawing. In 1934, his entry was second in the Health Council Competition and in 1935 he won a poster competition for the London City Council. From 1936 to 1940 he was on his own as a freelance poster artist."
Joan Waste
Joan Waste (1534 - 1 August 1556) was a blind woman who was burned in Derby because she would not stop being a Protestant. She had bought a Bible so that friends could read to her.
Biography.
"Waste was blind when she was born in 1534. Her parents were William and Joan Waste. William's job was to cut people's hair and make rope. By the age of twelve, Joan had learned to make ropes and clothes."
"In 1553, Queen Mary came to the throne and it was made illegal to hold Protestant views. Mary condemned 277 people for not having the right sort of religion. This crime was called heresy."
"Joan Waste was taken to court for breaking the law. The judge was a man employed by the bishop. She had to defend her views and was told she would die. She had not liked the fact that the church services were being read in the language of Latin. She was to die for being a Protestant and for refusing to agree with the Catholic Church. She bought a Bible in English, but the Catholic Church wanted them to only be in Latin. She asked friends to read to her for a penny."
"Her trial took place at All Saints Church. This main building has been rebuilt, but the tower was built in 1530. This tower is now part of Derby's cathedral."
On the day of her death she walked arm-in-arm with her twin brother to be burned.
Her death took place at the Windmill Pit on the Burton Road in Derby. She was hanged over the fire with a rope. She fell into the fire when the rope burned through. The judge was Antony Draycot. He went home to his meal.
The place where Joan Waste was killed is now the site of a church. When Elizabeth I of England became queen in 1559 she removed Ralph Baines from the job of Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Baines was sent to be a prisoner of the Bishop of London. The judge was also sent to be a prisoner. He died after being released in 1571.

"Kansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109 km2). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57 km2) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state."
"Kansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north, Oklahoma to the south, Missouri to the east, and Colorado to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the Pacific Ocean as it is the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near Lebanon, Kansas. The geographic center of Kansas is in Barton County."
Geology.
"The underground of Kansas is made of dipping sedimentary rocks, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, Cretaceous can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the erosion from the geologically uplifted Rocky Mountains west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene."
Topography.
"All of Kansas is in the Great Plains, where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state."
"Kansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039 ft (1,231 m) tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County, at 679 ft (207 m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state – in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously said the state is ""flatter than a pancake"". Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of . This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state."
Rivers.
About of the Kansas's northeastern border is the Missouri River. The Kansas River is created by the junction of the Smoky Hill River and Republican River. This happens at Junction City. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at Kansas City. It goes across the northeastern part of the state.
The Arkansas River (pronunciation varies) starts in Colorado. It goes for about across the western and southern parts of Kansas.
"Kansas's has other rivers. There is the Saline River and the Solomon River. They are tributaries of the Smoky Hill River. The Big Blue River, the Delaware River, and the Wakarusa River flow into the Kansas River. The Marais des Cygnes River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between Riverton and Baxter Springs."
National parks and historic places.
Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include:
Plants and animals.
"In Kansas, there are currently 238 species of rare animals and 400 rare plants. Among those include: ""Boechera laevigata"", Virginia Rail, Cleft Ledge, Royal Fern, Turkey-tangle, Bobolink, Cave Salamander, Peregrine Falcon, and Black-footed ferret. Common animal species and grasses include: Crows, Deer, Lesser Prairie Chicken, Mice, Moles, Opossum, Prairie Dogs, Raccoon, ""Tripsacum dactyloides"", Prairie Dropseed, Indian Grass, Little Bluestem, Switch Grass, Northern Sea Oats, Tussock Sedge, Sideoats Grama, and Big Bluestem."
Weather.
"The Köppen climate classification says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a humid continental climate. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation happens during both the summer and the spring."
"The western 1/3 of the state – from about U.S. Route 83 to west of it – has a semiarid steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the range."
"The far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the Wichita area, have a humid subtropical climate. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get droughts and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter."
"Temperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the heat index can be deadly, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Salina, Russell, Hays, and Great Bend. Temperatures are often high in Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature."
"Temperatures of or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect make most summer days reach between and in Topeka, Lawrence, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day."
"Kansas has a varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56°F (13°C). The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121 °F (49.4 °C). This happened in Fredonia on July 18, 1936, and in Alton on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40 °F (-40 °C). This occurred in Lebanon on February 13, 1905. Kansas is in a temperate area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four distinct seasons."
"Kansas can have extreme weather in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley, where cold and warm air masses come together to make severe weather."
"In summer, Kansas has experienced severe droughts. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl."
"In winter, Kansas has snow in most parts of the state. The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches, with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8 inches. Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas."
Cities and Counties.
Kansas is organized into 105 counties. Each county has a county seat. There are 627 incorporated cities in Kansas.
"Wichita is the biggest city in Kansas; it has almost 400,000 people. It is in Sedgwick County, which has about 520,000 people. Sedgwick County has the biggest city in Kansas, but it does not have the most people of any county in Kansas; Johnson County has more than 600,000 people. Johnson County has four of the biggest cities in Kansas: Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, and Lenexa. They are all suburbs of nearby Kansas City. Topeka is the capital of Kansas. Lawrence is a college town between Kansas City and Topeka."

2005 United Kingdom general election
"The 2005 United Kingdom General Election was an election held on May 5, 2005 to elect 646 members to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The three main candidates to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom are shown to the right."
The election resulted in the Labour Party and it's leader Tony Blair winning a majority in the House of Commons for the third time in a row. The Labour Party did lose 47 of their seats in parliament and the amount of votes they got dropped by 5.5% from the 2001 General Election. Many people believe the Labour Party lost support because of Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's unpopular decision to send troops to Iraq in 2003.
Results.
"The constituencies of Blaenau Gwent and Wyre Forest elected Independent candidates. The seat of Glasgow East was won by the Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin, who is not considered to be of any political party."

"Ayden is located at (35.470973, -77.420740)."
"According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land."
History.
"In 1891, William Henry Harris asked the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to build a railroad depot on a portion of his farm in order to create a village. A parcel of land was divided into residential lots surrounding the depot in ""Harristown"". Harris owned every other lot in Harristown. Within the next several years, lots were sold and homes were built. Businesses began to open up to support the new residents, and on February 3, 1891, people in the town created a local government as ""Ayden."" Within a few years, the Carolina Christian College and the Free Will Baptist Seminary were established. By 1919, Ayden had full-time electricity supplied by the Ayden municipal light plant.

Megaron
"The megaron (, , plural ""megara"") is the rectangular great hall in Mycenaean and ancient Greek palace architecture. The hall was: 1) surrounded by four columns, 2) had an open portico with two columns in the front, and 3) had a central, open hearth venting through an oculus, or opening, in the roof."
"The megaron also had the throne-room of the ""wanax"", or Mycenaean Greek ruler, whose throne was in the main room with the central hearth. Similar architecture is found in the Near East but the open portico supported by columns is particular to the Aegean region. Megara are sometimes called ""long-rooms"" because of their rectangular shape and the position of their entrances. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and rooms storing wine, oil and wheat."
"The megaron was used for sacrifices, royal events, and court meetings."
Structure.
"Halls in the shape of rectangles were a defining theme of Greek architecture. The Mycenaean megaron originated from the ""megaroid"", or large hall-centered rectangular building, of Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Also, it was the architectural forerunner to ancient Greek temples. The megaron's structural layout included a columned entrance, a ""pronaos"", a central ""naos"" (or ""cella""), and one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof was supported by wooden beams. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet. The walls were built with bricks of mud, and were decorated with frescoes. There were metal doors often having two-leaved wood decorations. Footbaths were also used in the megaron as mentioned in Homer's ""Odyssey"" where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. The dimensions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to the early temples of the Dorian Greeks."
Examples.
"A famous megaron is in the king's large reception hall in the Bronze Age palace of Tiryns where the main room had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns supporting the roof. The Cretan elements in the megaron of Tiryns were adopted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Minoan palace architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show people eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic images of bulls, a common animal motif in Mycenaean vase painting, appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is shown at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae. Different Greek cultures had their own megara where, for example, the Greeks of the mainland separated their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Greeks of Crete did not do this."

"Ashford Black Marble is a kind of limestone which contains some carbon, and its particles are very small. Its dark color is from bitumen, and once cut and polished, the surface shines."
"At first the rock was mined from Arrock Mine, and later in 1832 from nearby Rookery Plantation, near Ashford-in-the-Water."
Manufacturing techniques.
"Ashford Black Marble can be manufactured into pots, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to make smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paper weights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery has collections of worked and part-worked items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This collection also includes pieces of stones which were cut and ready to put into the black marble background. Forget-me-not and lily of the valley were typically designed. Various stones were used with Ashford Black Marble: Greys, blues and purples stones are from Monyash. ""Rosewood"" from Nettler Dale in Sheldon is a kind of barytes and has red and white layers. Castleton Blue John from Crich is a kind of flourspar and has purple and yellow colors. ""Birds-Eye"" rock has a design made from the fossils in it. ""Duke's Red"" is so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here."
"In the late 1780s, Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid. These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals."
"William Martin was once a partner with Watson, and wrote the first scientific study of fossils. His ""Petrifacta Derbiensia"" says that White Watson's uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils ""crocodile tails"", because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles."
"In 2006, Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson. He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing."

Atlanta Compromise
"The Atlanta Compromise was an informal agreement, between the black people of the cotton-producing states of the United States, and the government of these states. It came after a speech by Booker T. Washington, given in 1895. The compromise is the following: The black people would tolerate means of racial segregation, most notably the Jim Crow laws. In exchange the white government of these states would allow them to get some basic education for free; this education was focused on technical jobs or basic training in jobs the industry needed. This would also improve the living conditions of the black peaople. Black people would no longer focus on fighting for egality, integration into society or justice. White people would finance educational institutions for black people, such as Tuskegee University. Even though people agreed on these points, their agreement was never written down."
"Shortly afterwards, arounf 1900, African-American leaders, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter, said that black people should instead focus on the stuggle for civil rights. It was Du Bois who coined the term to Atlanta Compromiise to refer to the speech by Brooker T. Washington."

"The Battle of Finnburg was a battle between the Frisians and the Danes. It was mentioned in two early medieval writings, the Finnesburg Fragment and ""Beowulf"". These may describe a real or a completelymythical event."
Story.
"According to the Finnesburg Fragment, the Danish prince Hnaef came with sixty followers to visit and spent the winter at the Finnburg. Finnburg was the fort of his brother-in-law Finn, king of the Frisians. There a fight started between the Frisians and the Danes. A battle took place that lasted for three days. The verses of the story that were found (which is thought to be a small part of the original work) do not explain why the fight started, nor do they give the outcome of the battle."
"In a passage of ""Beowulf"", a bard sings a song about the ending of the battle, here named ""Freswael"". This is the same story as in the Finnesburg Fragment. While in less detail, the ""Beowulf"" episode is complete. Here it is seen that the Frisians won the battle. The Danish prince Hnaef and Finn's son died in the battle. After the fighting, the parties make peace, and the new Danish leader ""Hingest"" (who some have identified as Hengest) is allowed to leave with the surviving Danes."
Moose River Plains Wild Forest
"The Moose River Plains Wild Forest is a forest in Adirondack Park, which is in the Hamilton and Herkimer counties in the U.S. state of New York. It is designated a Wild Forest by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation."
Caspar Wessel
"Caspar Wessel (June 8, 1745 – March 25, 1818) was a Danish-Norwegian mathematician."
"He was born in Jonsrud, Vestby, Akershus, Norway. In 1763, having completed secondary school, he went to Denmark for further studies (since Norway didn't have any university in 1763). In 1778 he got the degree of ""candidatus juris"", which is one law degree. In 1794 he was hired as a surveyor; in 1798, a Royal inspector of Surveying."
"As surveying is related to mathematics, he later studied the geometrical importance of complex numbers. His most important paper, ""Om directionens analytiske betegning"", (""On the Analytical Representation of Direction"") was published in 1799 by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. Since it was in Danish, it was not noticed by many people. Later, Jean-Robert Argand and Carl Friedrich Gauss's paper showed the same results."
"One of the more important, but missed ideas shown in Wessel's ""Om directionens analytiske betegning"" was vectors. Wessel's main thing he wanted to show in the paper was not this, but he felt that the concept of numbers, with length and direction would be needed. Wessel's thoughts on addition was: ""Two straight lines are added if we unite them in such a way that the second line begins where the first one ends and then pass a straight line from the first to the last point of the united lines. This line is the sum of the united lines"". Today, the same idea is used when adding vectors."
"His paper was printed in a French translation in 1899. It was released in English in 1999 as ""On the analytic representation of direction"" (ed. J. Lützen et al.)."
"Johan Herman Wessel, Wessel's brother was a famous person in Denmark-Norway."
Global Handwashing Day
Global Handwashing Day is a campaign to encourage people around the world to wash their hands with soap. It takes place on October 15 of each year. The campaign's goal is to raise awareness of handwashing with soap as a key way to prevent diseases with hygiene.
"The holiday was made at the annual World Water Week 2008, which was held in Stockholm from August 17 to 23. Out of this week came the Public Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW). The Global Handwashing Day took place for the first time on October 15, 2008, the date appointed by United Nations General Assembly to go along with the year 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation."
The theme for Global Handwashing Day’s inaugural year was Focus on School Children. The members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than seventy countries.
500 home run club
"In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a term given to the group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs. This record stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974. Aaron's ending career total, 755, stayed the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Albert Pujols is the most recent to reach 500 home runs; he hit his 500th home run on April 22, 2014. Twenty-six players are members of the 500 home run club."
"Of these 26 players, 14 were right-handed batters, 10 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters (meaning they could bat from either side of the plate). The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to have four players reach 500 home runs while on their roster: Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds. Four 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, and Rafael Palmeiro—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Alex Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to hit 500. Ted Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest."
"Being a member of the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years. Four club members who are now eligible for election to the Hall of Fame—Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Palmeiro—have not been elected. Eligibility requires that a player has ""been retired five seasons"" or be dead for at least six months. Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009. Also, several of these recent members have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall, the voters were starting a ""guideline"" on how they would treat players from the ""Steroid Era"". Since then, Bonds and Sosa have also failed to earn election. Most recently, Palmeiro became the first club member to be dropped from the Hall of Fame ballot, failing to earn enough votes (5% of votes cast) in the 2014 election to stay on the ballot."
Whittier Daily News
"The Whittier Daily News is the local daily newspaper for Whittier, California. The ""Daily News"" is a member of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group, a division of MediaNews Group. It is also part of the San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Group, along with the ""San Gabriel Valley Tribune"" and the ""Pasadena Star-News""."
"Thomson Newspapers purchased the newspaper in 1982. Thomson sold the ""Daily News"" to William Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group in 1996."
San Gabriel Valley Tribune
"Henriette struck hardest in the resort town of Acapulco. Though the storm never passed closer than to the town, heavy rains along the coast saturated the ground, leading to mudslides. Six people were reported dead as a result of rockslides in two suburban neighborhoods of the city and in the port itself. Three were killed by a huge rock hitting their house, and the other three were killed when their dwellings partially collapsed. In addition, flooding from the overflowing of the River La Sabana, led to the evacuation of at least one hundred families from around the river by the Consejo Estatal de Proteccion Civil."
"Jorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, reported that approximately 800 were injured during the passage of Henriette along the coast and that 337 people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoacán, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000 sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 Olive Ridley turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state."
"In Sonora, the hurricane destroyed 450 homes and damaged another 5,000 dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region to try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70 homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000 families were left homeless."
One woman died due to high surf near Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula. Two fishermen were reported killed off the Sonora coast.
"The road connecting Guaymas to Ciudad Obregón was closed due to damage from the overflow of the brook Cocoraque which stranded around 600 cars. Lázaro Cárdenas was affected when the Acalpican River broke its banks. At least 50 houses in the community of ""El Habillal"", were flooded by water levels of up to . The residents had to leave their houses and be relocated in provisional housing."
"The remnants of Henriette caused flash floods and surface water 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) deep which covered roads with depths up to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in the U.S. States of New Mexico and Texas. Hail also accumulated on roadways. Damage in Mexico totaled about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). The name ""Henriette"" was not retired from use by the World Meteorological Organization, and will be used again in 2013."
Charles Stewart Parnell
Charles Stewart Parnell (27 June 1846 – 6 October 1891) was an Irish member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He led the Irish Parliamentary Party. He played an important part in the fight for Home Rule for Ireland.
Background.
"Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale, County Wicklow. His family was upper class. He was the seventh child of John Henry Parnell and his American wife Delia Tudor Stewart. Parnell's great-grandmother was in the Tudor family so he was related to the British Royal Family."
"His parents separated when he was six. He was sent to different schools in England, where he was unhappy. His father died in 1859 and he inherited his fortune. He then studied at Cambridge University (1865-9) but never graduated. He was Sheriff of his county, Wicklow, prior to being an MP (member of the House of Commons)."
Member of Parliament.
"Charles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone."
Home Rule.
"Parnell fought for Ireland's right to be self-governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the ""Land League"") on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become independent for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics."
Personal life.
Katherine O'Shea.
"On 24 December 1889 Captain William O’Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea. O'Shea had already separated from his wife, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance."
"O'Shea at last filed for divorce. He claimed she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not reply to the claim, and the divorce was granted. Because divorce is not allowed by Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular."
"Parnell married Katherine after her divorce. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was 45 years old."
Haruki Murakami
"is a Japanese author and translator. He was born on January 12, 1949 in Kyoto, Japan. In 2006 he won the Franz Kafka Prize for his book ""Kafka on the Shore""."
Sinhala language
"Sinhala or Sinhalese, earlier referred to as Singhalese, is the language of the Sinhalese. They are largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family."
"Sinhala has two varieties/forms - Spoken and Written, the former being the most popular form. Spoken Sinhala is easier to learn and use because it is so much relaxed in grammatical formality and rigidity."
"Sinhala is spoken by about 19 million people in Sri Lanka, about 16 million of them are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, with Tamil. Sinhala has its own writing system (see Sinhala script) which is an offspring of the Indian Brahmi script."
The oldest Sinhala inscriptions were written in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC; the oldest existing literary works date from the 9th century AD.
"The closest relative of Sinhala is Dhivehi, the language of the Maldives, ."
"The word order of Sinhala language is SOV (subject-object-verb) just like Japanese, Korean and many other languages in Asia. It would be easy for people from that particular language style to learn Sinhala with a little time and practice."
"Modern Turkey's varied climate lets many kinds of food crops grow, and livestock and forestry are important industries. Turkey makes enough food to feed itself. Turkish manufactures include aeroplanes, electronics, cars, clothing and textiles for home and for other countries."
"Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometres of beaches on its Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, and many important historical places."
History.
Ancient Anatolia.
"The first major empire in the area was the Hittites (from the 18th century to the 13th century BCE). The Hittites, who spoke one of the Indo-European languages, developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the Sea People in the 11th century BCE and the successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia."
"From 1950 BCE, Armenians and Assyrians inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BCE). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until their empire was conquered by Babylonia in 612 BCE. Then Anatolia became home for various kingdoms including the Achaemenid Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms, Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), Seljuk Empire, and Mongol Empire."
The Ottoman Empire.
"During the 14th century, after the fall of the Mongol Empire, Gazi Osman built a new empire named after himself: the Ottoman Empire. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the Balkans, (Yugoslavia and Bulgaria) in Europe. The Empire was ruled by Islamic law, but other religions had certain minority rights."
"In World War I the Ottoman Empire was one of the Central Powers. During the war, 500,000 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called Armenian genocide. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that Atatürk led the newly formed Turkish army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks and ousted the imperial Ottoman family from Anatolia."
Republic of Türkiye.
"Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was the first President of Turkey. He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the changes that made life in Turkey more secular. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example. The opponents to Atatürk felt that he weakened Islam in the country. Later political disputes led to Coup d'état in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and several failed attempts."
"In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and later established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktaş became the first Turkish Cypriot president."
"On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was attempted."
"In 2022, the government of Turkey started to use the Turkish spelling of Türkiye in both Turkish and English. However, Turkey remains the more common name."
People.
About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are ethnic Turks. About 15% are ethnic Kurds. Many refugees from Syria (over 3 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the Syrian civil war. Many Romani live in Istanbul and Edirne (European part of Turkey).
The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. Much of the population in Turkey is made up of young adults and adults.
"According to religiosity poll conducted in Turkey in 2019 by OPTİMAR, 89.5% of the population identifies as Muslim, 4.5% believed in God but did not belong to an organized religion, 2.7% were agnostic, 1.7% were atheist, 0.5% were belonged to the other religions, and 1.1% did not answer. Another poll conducted by Gezici Araştırma in 2020 interviewed 1,062 people in 12 provinces and found that 28.5% of the Generation Z in Turkey identify as irreligious."
"Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as mantı (Turkish ravioli), döner, kebap, Turkish delight (lokum), baklava, lahmacun, börek, köfte, and other foods."
"According to a study, Anatolia is genetically more closely related to the Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of Anatolia (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from Central Asia."
Majority and minorities.
"Most people in Turkey are Turks. The largest minority is Kurds. Kurds live mostly in Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The second largest minority are the Romani, mostly live in East Thrace, the European side of Turkey."
Economy.
Turkey is in the OECD and the G-20 and is one of the 20 largest economies. The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.
"In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey."
"Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Özal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property. Turkey's international trade is mostly with the EU, the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey."
Turkey's exports in 2010 were worth 117 billion United States dollars.
"Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit. Turkey has no petroleum and not much natural gas so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Turkish Northern Cyprus."
"Rich cities in Turkey include Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Edirne, Konya, Mersin (also known as İçel), and Antalya."
Culture.
Language.
"Most people in Turkey speak Turkish. It is written in Latin script and it belongs to the Turkic language group, which also includes many other languages spoken across Asia, such as Azerbaijani and Tatar. The Turkish language came from Central Asia, but now it is a bit different from the languages spoken in Central Asia. Turks living by the Mediterranean have southern, much thicker, and more masculine accents than western Turkey. Northerners, by the Black Sea have softer accents."
"USAir Flight 1493 was a scheduled commercial flight that was involved in an accident at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on February 1, 1991, colliding with SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569. Both planes caught fire after the impact and 35 of their occupants died, and another 29 were injured, thirteen of them seriously."
Investigation.
"The conclusions of the accident investigation carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established several causes for the accident."
"The fact that the ground radar was out of service on the day of the incident was one such root cause, as it would otherwise have been able to detect the presence of the SkyWest aircraft on the runway in time to alert the incoming US Airways flight. Other decisive factors were the lack of synchronicity between the flight progress tabs available to the controllers and the actual position of the aircraft on the airport runways and taxiways, which made the flight aircraft 5569 received incorrect instructions due to its controller's incorrect perception of its location. The poor night lighting of the runways and the glare problems that this lighting caused in the operators of the airport control tower, reducing their ability to see small aircraft during their maneuvers on the taxiways, was another of the determining factors of the Sinister."
"The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the airport administration for not having enough staff to handle landings and takeoffs, especially during night operations."
Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas
"Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas (), better known by its acronym LAPA, was an Argentine airline. At its peak, it operated international flights to Atlanta, in the United States, Uruguay, and an extensive network of domestic flights throughout the country. It was the first airline to break the monopoly established by Aerolíneas Argentinas and its subsidiary Austral Líneas Aéreas."
"On August 31, 1999, its flight 3142 with origin in Buenos Aires and destination to Córdoba, crashed and caused the death of 65 people, one of the most serious accidents in the history of Argentine aviation. The airline went bankrupt and ceased operations on April 20, 2003."

R-7 (rocket family)
"There are about 8.4 million people in Switzerland. About 64% of the people speak Swiss German (German Alemannic) as their first language, in northern and central Switzerland. 19% of the people speak French as their first language, mainly in the west of Switzerland. 8% of the people speak Italian, in the south of Switzerland. Only 1% of the people speak Romansh, in the southeastern part of Switzerland. Romansh is an old language that is similar to Latin."
"The German-speaking people of Switzerland do not actually speak ""German"" as their native language. Swiss people speak something called Alemannic which has its own writing language and grammar but still is normally considered a German dialect. Alemannic may be difficult for Germans to understand. Swiss people do write like the people from Germany and also speak standard German very well, especially in the larger cities."
About 23% of the people in Switzerland do not come from Switzerland. They come from other places to usually work in Switzerland.
"The religion of most people in Switzerland is Christianity. 43% of the population follow Catholicism. 35% of the population follow Protestantism. 2% follow Eastern Orthodoxy. The religion of 4% of the population is Islam. The rest follow other religions, or they have no religion."
"Switzerland is famous for its chocolate, cheese, banking system, watches and mountains."
History.
"In 1291, people from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden wanted to be free. They signed a contract to work together called the ""Eternal Alliance"". Together, they could be free from the people of Habsburg, who were very strong. In 1315 the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and Näfels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all the battles."
"People from other areas signed the contract and joined the Eternal Alliance. More and more people worked together to be free. In 1648, other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the ""Peace of Westphalia"". More areas came to be part of Switzerland."
"Switzerland was important to the slave trade that forced black Africans to be sold as slaves. Swiss companies made indiennes, which are a kind of cloth. These cloths were sent to Africa and exchanged for captured slaves. Some Swiss also joined French companies already making indiennes or owned plantations with slaves in French colonies."
"In 1798, France invaded Switzerland. The ruler of France was Napoleon. He changed many laws. In 1815 Switzerland again became independent from France. Other countries agreed at the Congress of Vienna that Switzerland was free and neutral."
"The constitution of Switzerland that was made after a short civil war in 1848 was replaced in 1999. Switzerland did not fight in World War I or World War II. Since 2002, Switzerland is part of the United Nations. It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality."
Government.
"Switzerland is a republic. Switzerland does not have the same kind of president as the United States or France. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English, ""Bundesrat"" in German, ""Conseil Fédéral"" in French, ""Consiglio Federale"" in Italian and ""Cussegl Federal"" in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. At present 3 of the 7 people are women."
The seven people are:
"There are two parts of parliament in Switzerland. The ""Council of States"" and the ""National Council"". Only both together can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every full canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest 6 cantons can only send one person to the National Council."
"The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they do not like a new law or a law change. This is called a ""referendum"". If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the constitution. This is called an ""initiative"". The constitution is the basic law of a country."
Economy.
"Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but it is member of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a contract. This contract makes trade even easier. They recently made two other contracts."
"The banks of Switzerland and the insurance companies in Switzerland together produce eleven per cent of the gross domestic product. Tourism is important in Switzerland. There are many places for tourists. Davos, St. Moritz, Pontresina and Flims are in Switzerland. These towns are important both in winter (for skiing) and in summer. Tourists also like the cities of Lucerne, Geneva, and Zürich."
"In 2011 the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland directly and indirectly employed about 135,000 people. The companies Novartis and Roche are the second and third largest pharma companies in the world. They both have invented many life saving drugs because of well developed research and development facilities."
Literature.
The literature of Switzerland is divided according to the language used. Most Swiss literature was written in German from 1291 until 1798. French became popular in Bern and elsewhere in the 18th century and many words also in the German speaking parts of Switzerland come from the French and are not known to Germans. Italian language and Romansch-Latin literature are less common in Switzerland.
"Heidi, a book for children by Johanna Spyri, is the most famous book of Switzerland. It is in the mountains in Graubünden."
Sports.
"Skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland. Because of the large mountain range the nature of the country is well suited for such activities. Bobsleigh was invented in St. Moritz. The first world ski championships were held in Mürren (1931) and St. Moritz (1934). St. Moritz hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and in 1948. Among the most successful skiers and world champions are Pirmin Zurbriggen and Didier Cuche."
"Many Swiss are fans of football. The national team or 'Nati' is widely supported. Switzerland was the joint host, with Austria, of the Euro 2008 tournament. Many Swiss also follow ice hockey. In April 2009, Switzerland hosted the 2009 IIHF World Championship for the 10th time. The National League A is the most attended league in Europe."
"The many lakes in the country make Switzerland a good place for sailing. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the sailing team Alinghi. They were the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003. They also won in 2007. Tennis has become more popular. Swiss players such as Martina Hingis and Roger Federer have won multiple Grand Slams."
"Motorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland after the 1955 Le Mans disaster. There were exceptions for events such as Hillclimbing. This ban was overturned in June 2007. During this period, the country still had successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni, Sebastian Buemi, Jo Siffert and successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu. Switzerland also won the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the 125cc category."
"Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or ""Schwingen"". It is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some. Hornussen is another native Swiss sport. It is like a cross between baseball and golf. Steinstossen is the Swiss version of stone put, a competition in throwing a heavy stone. It is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. It is also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805."

Bahawalpur Division
"Bahawalpur Division () originally, Bahawalpur, was also an administrative division of the Punjab Province of Pakistan, from 1955 until the reforms of 2000 abolished the third tier of government."
Multan Division
"Multan Division () was an administrative division of the Punjab of Pakistan, until the reforms of 2000 abolished the third tier of government."
History.
"Multan Division was created during British Rule in the subcontinent. The division lay between 28°25' and 33°13 N and 69°19' and 73°39 E, the Sutlej divided it from Bahawalpur on the south-east, while the Indus flowed partly through the Division and partly along its border to the west. The headquarters of the Commissioner were at Multan, or, in the hot season, at. Fort Munro. The Division was abolished in 1884, but reconstituted in 1901.

Loveland used to be the president of the Colorado Central Railroad and lived in Golden. After retiring, he moved to the new area known as Lakewood."
"Up until 1969, this area known as Lakewood didn't have a city government. Instead, they relied on water districts, fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. This area known as Lakewood was more of a community and had been around for 80 years. Police protection was provided to them by the Jefferson County Sheriff and volunteers from fire districts."
"In 1969, the City of Lakewood was legally turned into Jefferson City. Not too long after, they held an election. They decided to change the city's name to Lakewood because the majority disliked ""Jefferson City,"" and believes it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri. At this time, the population was already over 90,000."
"Lakewood never had a traditional downtown area. West Colfax Avenue served the metropolitan area as U.S. Route 40 and the main route that joined Denver with the Rocky Mountains. Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. Originally, in Lakewood, there was only the Jewish Conspumtive Relief Society (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, a small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange. However, by the 1950s, grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots could be found as well.

"When the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"". It was first on ""Billboard"" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time."
"Although critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, ""Appetite for Destruction"" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too."
Background.
"Guns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985, shortly after forming, with ""Don't Cry"", a cover of ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Think About You"" and ""Anything Goes"". However, the EP did not happen, as original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band, being replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band."
"After playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP ""Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide"", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP."
"Singer Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for ""Appetite for Destruction"", such as ""Back Off Bitch"", ""You Could Be Mine"", ""November Rain"" and ""Don't Cry"". ""November Rain"" was not put on the album because ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad."
"Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record ""Nightrain"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Don't Cry"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Shadow of Your Love"". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)"
"The band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded ""Shadow of Your Love"" first with Clink as a test."
"In 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed &amp; Chris Pitman) to ""spruce up"" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie ""Big Daddy"" in 1999."

Romania
"Romania (old spelling: Rumania, Roumania; , ) is a country in southeastern Europe. It is north of the Balkan Peninsula, on the Lower Danube River. Western Romania is circled by the Carpathian Mountains. Romania also has a border on the Black Sea. Most of the Danube Delta is found inside Romania. Romania shares borders with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine to the far northeast, the Republic of Moldova to the near northeast, and Bulgaria to the south."
"Romania is a semi-presidential unitary state. It was created when Moldavia and Wallachia joined together in 1859. It was given its independence in the Treaty of Berlin of 1878. At the end of World War II, some of its land (close by what is now known as Moldova) was occupied by the USSR. After the Iron Curtain fell in 1989 Romania was liberated from the communist regime. During the 2000s, Romania made changes to the country, such as reform the democratic system, human rights acts, freedom of speech acts, economy and law. That let Romania join the European Union on January 1, 2007."
"Romania has the 9th biggest area of land and the 7th biggest population (with 19 million people) of the European Union member states. The capital and biggest city in Romania is Bucharest ( ), with a population of 1.6 million. One of the cities in Transylvania, Sibiu, was named a European Capital of Culture. Romania joined NATO on March 29, 2004."
Origin.
"The word ""Romania"" (""Rumania"" or ""România"") comes from the Romanian word ""Român"", which comes from the Latin word ""Romanus"" which means ""Roman"". English texts still used the word ""Rumania"" during World War II. This came from the French word ""Roumanie""."
History.
Prehistory and the Romans.
"Some of the oldest human remains found in Europe were discovered in Romania. They were about 42,000 years old. This may have been when the first Homo sapiens came to Europe."
"The world's first and oldest writing comes from people who lived in today's Romania. Approximately 5300 years BC. According to archaeology it is not a matter of symbols, but the world's first writings. It belonged to the Vinča culture which inhabited all of today's Serbia with over 150 Vinča sites and minor parts of Western Romania, northwestern Bulgaria, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and Southeastern Hungary."
"Herodotus in the fourth book of The Histories, written in about 440 . Herodotus wrote that the Getae were defeated by the Persian Emperor Darius the Great when he battled the Scythians. The Getae were called the Dacians by the Romans. They were Thracians who were living in Dacia, which is where Romania, Moldova and the northern part of Bulgaria are now. The Dacians attacked the Roman province, the border of which was formed by the Danube, in 87 . This was during Emperor Domitian's rule. The Dacians were defeated by the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan in two battles that lasted from 101 until 106 . The Roman Empire made Dacia into the province of Roman Dacia."
"A lot of ore, such as gold and silver, were found in Roman Dacia. A lot of gold and silver were found in the Western Carpathians. Trajan went back to Rome with 165 tons (330,000 pounds) of gold and 330 tons (660,000 pounds) of silver after his conquest."
There were many Romans living in the province of Roman Dacia. They spoke Vulgar Latin. They began to write the local languages using the Latin alphabet. Writing languages with the Latin alphabet is called romanization. This became the first version of Romanian.
"In the 3rd century, the province was attacked by groups of nomadic people like the Goths. They made the Roman Empire leave Dacia about 271 . This became the Roman Empire's first abandoned province."
The origin of modern Romanians is widely talked about by historians to this day. It is thought that the Romanians were formed from large ethnic groups that came from both the south and north parts of the Danube.
Dark Ages and Middle Ages.
"From 271 to 275, the Goths took over the abandoned Roman province. They lived in Dacia until the 4th century, when another group of wandering peoples, the Huns, came to Dacia. The Gepids, Avars, with the Slavic people, were in control of Transylvania through the 8th century. In the 8th century, however, the country was taken over by the Hungarian Empire. It was made part of the First Bulgarian Empire, which ended Romania's Dark Ages."
"The Bulgarians held Transylvania until the 11th century. The Pechenegs, the Cumans, and the Uzes were a few of the people later noted in the history of Romania."
"In 1310, now called the High Middle Ages, Basarab I started the Romanian principality of Wallachia. Moldavia was begun by Dragoş around 1352. During the Middle Ages, Romanians were living in three different areas: Wallachia (Romanian: ""Ţara Românească""—""Romanian Land""), Moldavia (Romanian: ""Moldova""), and Transylvania."
"Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary from around the 10th century until the 16th century, when it turned into the Principality of Transylvania. This lasted until 1711. Wallachia had been on the border of the Ottoman Empire since the 14th century. As the Ottoman Empire's influence grew, it gradually fell under the suzerainty (control) of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century."
"The best known ruler of this period was Vlad III the Impaler, also known as Vlad Dracula, or """", , Prince of Wallachia, during the years of 1448, 1456–62, and 1476. While he was the leader of his people, he had an agreement with the Ottoman Empire to stay independent. Many people in Romania during this time thought of him as a ruler with a great sense of justice and defense for his country."
"Moldavia was at its greatest when Stephen the Great was ruling between 1457 and 1504. He was a great military leader, winning 47 battles and losing only 2. After every battle he won, Stephen would build a church. Because he won 47 of the battles that he fought, he ended up building 48 churches. After Stephen the Great's death, Moldavia came under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century."
Independence and monarchy.
"When Transylvania was the organic part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire was in control of Wallachia and Moldavia, almost all of the Romanians had limited rights as a citizen. They stayed this way even when they made up most of the people in those areas."
"After the even more violent Revolution of 1848 did not succeed, so explained the Great Powers did not like the idea of Romania becoming a free nation and it was not a real possibility."
The people who voted in 1859 in Moldavia and Wallachia picked the same person – Alexandru Ioan Cuza – to be the prince in those areas. He managed to unite the people and nationalism was seen as a useful method.
Alexandru Ioan Cuza walked with cautious steps he was not proclaiming a declaration of independence immediately because he knew it would bring a new war. Instead he let Moldavia and Wallachia merged in the United Principalities of the Ottoman Empire and increasing self-government to a greater degree.
"The new union was at the front of today's Romania. With cautious steps we freed itself more and Bucharest was established as the capital.

"In July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's request. Schröder had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005."
"In October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing a bill. It would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership. The Bundestag passed this legislation but as president, Köhler was authorized to not sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006, he did not sign the Consumer Information Law, because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills. In most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history."
"In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector, stating that ""a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs""."

"In November 2009, Köhler refused to sign the ""Zugangserschwerungsgesetz"" (Access Impediment Act) into law without further information. The law, which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography, is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional."
Resignation.
"On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany. This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:"
"He came under criticism for his statement that Germany’s military missions abroad also served to secure trade. He afterwards stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favouring an unconstitutional position. After getting no support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010. He made a statement saying ""I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect."" The resignation was considered a ""surprise"". The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position."
"As written down in the German constitution, the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat, Jens Böhrnsen, until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010."

Foreign trips.
"Mrs. Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President. In 1961, the Kennedys began their official trip of Europe in France. After arriving in the country, many liked her. French President Charles de Gaulle liked her because she could speak French and because of her knowledge of French history. Seeing how popular she was, President Kennedy joked, ""I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris, and I have enjoyed it."""
"From France, the President and the First Lady traveled to Vienna, Austria, where Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was asked to shake the President's hand for a photo. He replied, ""I'd like to shake her hand first"". The U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith wanted Kennedy to begin a tour in India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962. President of Pakistan Ayub Khan gave her a horse named Sardar as a gift. He had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady both liked horses. Her popularity was compared to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II."
"Mrs. Kennedy would later travel to other countries across the world representing the United States. The First Lady spoke Spanish well, which she used when traveling to Latin American countries for events."
Death of Patrick Kennedy.
"In early 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy was again pregnant, with their third child. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented near the Kennedy Family Compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts."
"On August 7, five weeks before her due date, she went into labor. She gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, through an emergency Cesarean section at the Otis Air Force Base. The baby's lungs were not fully developed, so he was sent to Boston Children's Hospital. He died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline was at Otis Air Force Base to recover after Patrick was born. Her husband went to Boston to be with Patrick and was there when Patrick died. On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave a speech to thank nurses who had cared for her. As a thank you, Mrs. Kennedy gave the hospital staff gifts from the White House."
"The First Lady later had depression after Patrick's death. However, the loss of their child helped the Kennedys' marriage and brought the couple closer together. Before Patrick's death, Kennedy was not close with her husband because of rumors of him cheating on her. It was said that Kennedy had cheated on her with multiple women such as her secretary Pamela Turnure and actress Marilyn Monroe."
Assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy.
"On November 21, 1963, the Kennedys went on a political trip to Texas to get more support for her husband's November 1964 re-election campaign. They landed at Dallas's Love Field with Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. Jacqueline was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat, which President Kennedy personally picked for her to wear. A motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart. Kennedy was sitting next her husband in the presidential limousine."
"At 12:30 P:M, the motorcade turned to Dealey Plaza. The First Lady heard loud bangs and she thought it was a motorcycle backfiring. She did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Two more shots had been fired, three of them hit her husband in the head. She quickly began to climb onto the back of the limousine. Some believe she was reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Secret Service agent Clint Hill ran to the car telling her back to go back to her seat. She would later say that she did not remember climbing behind the car."
"Approximately at 1:00 P:M CST in Dallas, Texas at Parkland Hospital, President Kennedy died from his gunshot wounds, aged 46. After her husband died, Kennedy did not want to take off her blood-stained clothing. She told the new first lady, Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted ""them to see what they have done to Jack"". She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she went on Air Force One. She stood next to Lyndon B. Johnson when he took the oath of office as the 36th President of the United States. The suit was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964. It will not be seen by the public until 2103 because of an agreement from her daughter Caroline Kennedy, because she refused to let it be seen during this century."
"Jacqueline Kennedy planned her husband's state funeral. It was inspired by Abraham Lincoln's funeral. She wanted her husband's casket to be closed, even though her brother-in-law and Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy wanted it to be open. The funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington D.C. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Many respected her role and appearance at the funeral."
"A week after the assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote an executive order that created the Warren Commission. It was led by Chief Justice Earl Warren to investigate the assassination. Mrs. Kennedy did not care about the investigation. She said that even if they had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back. She spoke to the commission about the events of her husband's assassination."

Mourning period and later activities.
"On November 29, 1963, a week after her husband's assassination, Theodore H. White of ""Life"" magazine interviewed Kennedy at her home in Hyannis Port. During the interview, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur's Camelot. She said ""Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot. There'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another Camelot"". Her husband was nicknamed ""Camelot"" and his presidency the ""Camelot Era"" because of this."
"Jacqueline Kennedy and her two children stayed in the White House for two more weeks after the assassination. President Lyndon B. Johnson wanted to ""do something nice for Jackie"". He wanted to make her Ambassador to France, Mexico or the United Kingdom. Kennedy said no to any ambassador roles. Johnson renamed the Florida space center the John F. Kennedy Space Center a week after the assassination. Kennedy later thanked Johnson for his kindness to her."
"Jacqueline made few public appearances after her husband's death. Some believed she was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder. In the winter after the assassination, she and the children stayed at Averell Harriman's home in Georgetown. On January 14, 1964, she spoke on television thanking the public for the ""hundreds of thousands of messages"" she had gotten since the assassination. She bought a house for herself and her children in Georgetown, but sold it later in 1964. She bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to have more privacy."
"Jacqueline would go to a few memorial ceremonies dedicated to her husband. In 1967, she went to the opening ceremony of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier . She also went to a private ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery when her husband's coffin was moved to build a safer eternal flame. She also was in charge of the creation of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum."
"During the Vietnam War in November 1967, Kennedy was called an unofficial ambassador. This was because of her trip with David Ormsby-Gore to Cambodia. Many historians saw that her visit was to fix the relationship between the two countries. She also went to the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1968."
Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy.
"After her husband's assassination, Kennedy and her children became closer with her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy supported him staying in politics. She supported his 1964 campaign for United States senator from New York."
"When President Johnson became unpopular, many wanted Senator Kennedy to run for president in 1968. When Art Buchwald asked him if he wanted to run, Robert replied, ""That depends on what Jackie wants me to do"". She met with him around this time and she told him to run. However, she was worried about his safety."
"On June 5, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan shot Senator Kennedy in Los Angeles. Kennedy Onassis went to the hospital to be with Senator Kennedy's wife, Ethel Kennedy, her brother-in-law Ted Kennedy, and the other Kennedy family members. Robert Kennedy died the next day, aged 42."
Marriage to Aristotle Onassis.
"After Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Kennedy had depression again. She became worried about her life and of her two children. She said ""If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country""."
"On October 20, 1968, Jacqueline married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis. He was a rich Greek businessman who was able to give the privacy and security she wanted. They were married on Skorpios, Onassis's private Greek island in the Ionian Sea. After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis. She lost her right to Secret Service protection when she married Onassis. Many believed that Jacqueline might have been excommunicated by the Roman Catholic church. This was because she married a divorced man. Many did not approve her getting remarried and made her unpopular."
"During their marriage, Jacqueline and Aristotle had six different homes and his yacht Christina O."
"Aristotle Onassis's health became worse after the death of his son Alexander in 1973. He died in 1975. After a legal deal, Jacqueline Onassis got millions of dollars from her step-daughter Christina Onassis."

History.
"After the Indian Mutiny the British government created a new order of knighthood to honour Indian Princes and Chiefs, as well as British officers and administrators who served in India. On 25 June 1861, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation creating ""The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India"" to ""reward conspicuous merit and loyalty"""
The first appointees were:
"The Order of the Indian Empire, founded in 1877, was intended to be a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India; consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter."
"Appointments to the Orders relating to the British Empire in India ceased after 14 August 1947. The Orders have never been formally abolished and Elizabeth II succeeded her father George VI as Sovereign of the Orders when she ascended the throne in 1952. She remains Sovereign of the Order to this day. Today, there are no living members of the order:"
Composition.
"The British Sovereign was, and still is, Sovereign of the Order. The next-most senior member was the Grand Master; the position was held, ""ex officio"", by the Viceroy of India. When the Order was established in 1861, there was only one class of Knights Companions, who bore the postnominals KSI. In 1866, however, it was expanded to three classes. Members of the first class were known as ""Knights Grand Commanders"", rather than ""Knights Grand Cross"", so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order. All those surviving members who had already been made Knights Companions of the Order were made Knights Grand Commanders."
"Former Viceroys and other high officials, as well as those who served in the Department of the Secretary of State for India for at least thirty years were eligible for appointment. Rulers of Indian Princely States were also eligible for appointment to the Order. Some states were of such importance that their rulers were almost always appointed Knights Grand Commanders; such rulers included the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, the Maharaja of Baroda, the Maharajas of Gwalior, the Nawab of Bhopal, the Maharaja of Indore, the Maharana of Udaipur, the Maharaja of Travancore, the Maharana of Jodhpur and the Maharao of Cutch."
"Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh of Benares was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1892, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) in 1898, and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) for his services in the First World War in the 1921 New Year Honours."
"Rulers of other nations in Asia and the Middle East, including the Emir of Kuwait, the Maharajas of the Rana dynasty, the Khedive of Egypt, the King of Bhutan and the rulers of Zanzibar, Bahrain and Oman were also appointed to the Order. Like some rulers of princely states, some rulers of particular prestige, for example the Maharajas of the Rana dynasty or the Sultans of Oman, were usually appointed Knights Grand Commanders."
"Women, who were not princely rulers, could not be members of the Order. They were, admitted as ""Knights"", rather than as ""Dames"" or ""Ladies"". The first woman to be admitted to the Order was HH Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal; she was created a Knight Companion at the Order's foundation in 1861. The Order's statutes were specially amended to permit the admission of Queen Mary as a Knight Grand Commander in 1911."

Run batted in
"Runs batted in or RBI is a statistic used in baseball and softball to credit a batter when the outcome of his at bat results in a run being scored, except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play."
Major League Baseball Rules.
The official rulebook of Major League Baseball states in Rule 10.04:
Base on balls
"A base on balls (BB) is given to a batter and against a pitcher in baseball statistics when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls ""balls"". It is also known as a walk."
Intentional base on balls.
"Another version of base on balls is called intentional base on balls (IBB) or intentional walk. This is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls. As with any other walk, an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without being able to be put out, and entitles any runners to advance if forced. Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver, usually done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play (e.g., a home run, sacrifice fly, or RBI base hit), or to set up a double play or force out situation for the next batter. They do carry an inherent risk, however, as they give the offensive team another runner on base, without any effort on their part, who could potentially score a run."

Cold War
"The Cold War was the tense fighting between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union (also called the USSR) and its allies between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union. It is called the ""Cold"" War because the Americans and the Soviet Union never actually fought each other directly. Instead, they attacked each other in conflicts known as proxy wars in which powerful countries fight a foreign war but do not send their own troops."
Conflicting countries.
"Most of the countries on one side were allied by NATO, whose most powerful country was the United States. Most of the countries on the other side were allied by the Warsaw Pact, whose most powerful country was the Soviet Union."
"The Western Bloc was the name of the capitalist countries led by the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an alliance created in 1949 and included the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Greece, and Turkey. Other countries allied with the Western Bloc include Israel, Brazil, South Korea, Kenya (1960-1991), Bangladesh (1964-1968), Pakistan, North Yemen, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand."
"The Eastern Bloc was the group of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact was an alliance created in 1955 and included the USSR, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary (until 1976), Poland, and Romania. Other countries allied with the Eastern Bloc included Angola (1975–1991), Cuba, Bolivia, Cambodia (1977–1979), South Yemen, Tunisia, Nepal, Bhutan, Libya (1974–1991), Mongolia (1976–1988), Jamaica, North Korea, China and Laos (1975–1991)."
Background.
"In February 1917, Tsar Nicholas II of the Russian Empire was overthrown because people were unhappy with their living conditions (like being a serf), especially during World War I. The new government in Russia was a democratic socialist government. Unfortunately, it was ineffective, and people were still unhappy. In November 1917, a communist group called the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the new government and were supported by groups of workers called Soviets. The Bolsheviks created a new communist government called the Russian Soviet Federation Socialist Republic (also called simply Soviet Russia or the Russian SFSR)."
"However, not everyone supported the communists. Many countries that had been part of the Russian Empire had left, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Belarus. The Russian Civil War began, with the Soviet Russian Red Army fighting against the White Army of anticommunist Russians. The White Army was not very united or organized. The Allied Powers of World War I, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, invaded Russia to support the White Army and stop the Red Army. The Red Army eventually won the war in 1922, and established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also called the Soviet Union), along with the newly formed Socialist Republics of Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
The start of the Cold War in 1947 was caused by a belief that all governments would become either communist or capitalist. The Western Allies feared that the Soviet Union would spread communism to the rest of Europe and was very concerned that Soviet agents had learnt how to make atomic bombs after the war.
"Both nations had opposed Nazi Germany although the United States worked with Nazi scientists and Soviet Union had chosen not to fight with Germany in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the two occupied Poland in 1939. However, Germany turned against the Soviet Union in June 1941 and invaded it during Operation Barbarossa."
After World War II.
"After World War II, Germany was left in ruins. The victorious Allies that occupied it split it into four parts. in the western half of Germany, one part was given to the United States, one to the United Kingdom, and one to France. The eastern half was occupied by the USSR. The city of Berlin was also split among the four countries even though it was entirely within the eastern half."
"The Federal Republic of Germany (""Bundesrepublik Deutschland"" or BRD), or West Germany, was recognized by the Western Allies in June 1949 and was a capitalist democracy. West Berlin was considered a part of the country. The Soviets named their section of Germany the German Democratic Republic (""Deutsche Demokratische Republik"" or DDR), or East Germany, later in 1949; it was a communist dictatorship."
"From April 1948 to May 1949, the Soviets blockaded West Berlin to prevent the city from using West Germany's currency. The United States and its allies supplied the city by airplanes until September 1949 in what became known as the Berlin Airlift. Many East Germans wanted to live in West Germany for having greater quality of life and political freedom. In 1961, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, dividing the two halves of the city, and heavily guarded it to prevent more people from escaping to the west. The wall was considered a symbol of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain that divided Europe."
1950s.
"Espionage, or ""spying,"" has been around for a long time and was very important during the Cold War. After its successful nuclear espionage in the Manhattan Project, the Soviets created their spy organs, especially the KGB. The CIA led Americans efforts abroad, and the FBI led counterespionage. Catching foreign spies and fighting domestic subversion were KGB functions."
"In 1953, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin died, and Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev took his place. Khrushchev later took sole control of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's Secret Speech marked a period of de-Stalinization, and Khrushchev tried to undo many of the things done by Stalin (such as the Gulag prisons and Stalin's cult of personality)."
"In the United States, there was a ""Red Scare"", and when the Soviets detonated their own atom bomb, there was a big political fallout and the United States government made everybody scared about communists. Famous people in many fields who had been Communist sympathizers in the past like Larry Adler lost their positions. Many actors were 'blacklisted' and so were not hired to act in movies, which ruined their careers. US Senator Joseph McCarthy was believed by many when he accused some important Americans of being communists, including some high government officials."
The 1950s were the beginning of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. It began with the Soviets putting the Sputnik 1 satellite into orbit around the Earth as the first country in space. The United States responded by starting NASA and soon sent up its own satellites. The Soviets also sent the first man (Yuri Gagarin) into Earth orbit and claimed that proved communism to be the better ideology.
"In the 1950s, the United States (under President Dwight Eisenhower) created a policy called ""New Look"" to cut defense spending and to increase the number of nuclear weapons as a deterrent in order to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking the West. The Soviets also increased their nuclear force, which resulted in mutual assured destruction."

They speak different German dialects. They believed in Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism and hold much of the old Norse mythology. After World War II, most of the Danube Swabians were expelled by the order of the Potsdam Conference, to Allied-occupied Austria and Allied-occupied Germany. Only a few Danube Swabians live today in this country who once belongend to the Habsburger Monarchy. Most Danube Swabian descendants live in Austria and Germany, but also some in USA, Canada and Australia."

A miracle happens and her candle becomes magic, gets rid of the people chasing them, and creates a living house, the Casita, for them to live in, along with a magical village bordered by tall surrounding mountains— ""an ""encanto""."" The candle's magic gives ""Gifts"" to each Madrigal descendant, which they are to use to help the villagers. However, Bruno, who had the power of telling the future, disappeared aftee Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, did not get a gift, and ten years later Mirabel is still sad about not having one. Mirabel explains this with the song “The Family Madrigal”"
"On his fifth birthday, Pepa's youngest son, Antonio, gets the ability to talk with animals, and the family takes a picture with him but leaves out Mirabel. Mirabel then sings a song wishing she were also special. (""Waiting on a Miracle""). Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking and the candle's flame flickering, but is ignored when the Casita seems fine to the others. After overhearing Alma praying, Mirabel decides to save the miracle's magic. The next day, she talks to her super-strong older sister, Luisa, who admits that she has a hard time dealing with all the work she has to do (""Surface Pressure"") then suggests that Bruno's room may hold clues to the mystery. There, Mirabel finds a cave and gets pieces of a slab of emerald. After Mirabel gets out, Luisa realizes that her gift is weakening. After her family reminds her of the reasons that Bruno is not to be talked about (""We Don't Talk About Bruno""), Mirabel rebuilds the slab and discovers it is an image of Mirabel standing in front of a broken Casita. Mirabel takes this to mean that she will destroy the family."
"Later that evening, Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela, who can make plants and flowers grow at whenever she wants, is supposed to become engaged to their neighbour Mariano Guzmán. But then, Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores, who has superhearing, lets everyone know that she overheard Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno's vision. The Casita begins to crack again, causing everyone's powers to go out of control, ruining the night and Mariano's proposal when Pepa accidentally starts a rainstorm. As everyone runs, Mirabel follows a group of rats and finds a secret passage behind a portrait. There she meets Bruno, who tells that his vision of Mirabel would have gotten her in trouble with the family so he broke the vision and went into hiding to protect her, hiding himself inside the house's walls so he could still be near them. Bruno tells her that the vision could change, meaning that Mirabel would either destroy the Madrigal family or fix it. At Mirabel's urging, he reluctantly conjures another vision. At first, it goes the same way as the last one, with Mirabel still standing in front of a broken Casita. But a golden butterfly appears, and the vision changes into an image of Mirabel hugging a young woman, who seems to be Isabela."
"Mirabel apologizes to Isabela but accidentally gets her to admit that she does not want to marry Mariano and actually hates having to be perfect. Then Isabella creates a cactus and wonders if she should grow whatever plants she feels like growing. (""What Else Can I Do?""). After the song, they hug, fixing the candle and the cracks. But, Alma sees the two of them, with Isabela growing whatever she wants, and accuses Mirabel of causing the family's problems out of jealousy for not having a Gift. Mirabel blames Alma for the immense pressure she puts on the family. Their rising argument weakens the candle again and creates a wikt:fissure that splits a nearby mountain and destroys the Casita. Despite Mirabel's trying to save it, the candle dies in her hands, leaving all the Madrigals powerless. While the family and several locals look at the damage, Mirabel feels guilty and leaves the town."
"After a few hours of fruitless search, Alma finds a tearful Mirabel back at the river where Pedro died. She explains how, in her determination to preserve the magic, she ignored the toll it took on her family and finally takes responsibility for what happened (""Dos Oruguitas""). After hearing Alma's tragic backstory, Mirabel tells her that despite her flaws, she is the one who brought and protected the family together all these years. After a golden butterfly appears, they reconcile, and Bruno appears and confronts Alma to defend Mirabel, unexpectedly cheering her up with his return. They reunite with the Madrigals, and the townspeople arrive to help them rebuild the Casita (""All of You""). When the house is rebuilt, the Madrigals give Mirabel a gleaming doorknob with an M on it. When she places it in the front door, the magic springs back to life, restoring the Casita and all the family's Gifts and spreading through the village. The Madrigals pose for another family picture, this time with Mirabel and Bruno included."

Italian irredentism in Dalmatia
"Italian irredentism in Dalmatia is related to the tentative of accession to Italy of coastal Dalmatia, promoted by the Dalmatian Italians from the Napoleonic era to World War II."
History.
"With the rise of the Risorgimento, in all Italian areas that were excluded from the unification of Italy (and with Italian majority population) started to be widely diffused the Italian movement called ""Irredentism""."
"In the case of Dalmatia, after Napoleon, there was the development of Slav nationalism against Italian irredentism. But until 1848 there was still some convergence between these two ethnic groups, in order to create an independent Dalmatia inside the Hapsburg Empire."
"Dalmatian Italians always felt connected to the Italian Risorgimento, and among them were widely followed the ideas, intentions and ideals that flourished in the Peninsula. At Zara, in 1822, the Imperial Government made an 'Inquisition of State' to twenty-five Dalmatian Italians ""Carbonari"", another twenty-five were ""persecuted"" and sixty declared ""suspicious."" One of the supporters of this initial irredentism was Niccolo Tommaseo, born in Sebenico. He was an Italian Dalmatian linguist, journalist and essayist who become internationally famous because editor of the first Dizionario della Lingua Italiana."
"In 1848, many young Italians from Istria and Dalmatia formed a 'Legion', crossed the Adriatic, and fought with Niccolo Tommaseo for the ""Republic of Venice"". And in the same year, six Dalmatian Italians also fought for the ""Roman Republic"". One of them was Federico Seismit-Doda from Ragusa, who became a member of the Italian Parliament and even Finance Minister of the Kingdom of Italy under Benedetto Cairoli (1878) and Francesco Crispi (1889–1890). In the battle of Curtatone, as a first lieutenant of the Battalion 'Bande Nere', fought against the Austrians the Dalmatian Giurovich Marino: he was killed by the Austrian soldiers in Livorno as a promoter of the ideals of Giuseppe Mazzini. Twenty were the Dalmatians in the Italian independence war of 1859-1860 enrolled in the Italian army, or in the red shirts of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Among others, Marco Cossovich, a former lieutenant of the ""Guardia Nobile"" for the protection of Venice, fought in Calatafimi and Palermo: one of the few that Garibaldi recalled by name in his book ""I Mille"". In the third Italian war of Independence, George Caravan from Tenin (near Zara), commanded the 5th Regiment of Grenadiers; after promotion, he became adjutant general of the King of Italy Umberto I."

"Indigenously designed military aircraft in China during the war against Japan included the Kwangsi type 3, Chu XP-0 and Zhong 28-Qia while Russian American Zakharchenko designed Zhong 28-B and FuHsing AP-1 (Fuxing AP-1)."
"The Japanese let volunteers from Okinawa into their army since 1890 and in 1898 Okinawa was given universal military conscription and were parts of all arms of the Japanese military, unlike Koreans where there was no conscription until the very last year of World War II since the Japanese did not trust Koreans unlike Okinawans. Taiwanese were also distrusted by the Japanese, with volunteers from Taiwan only allowed in 1942 and conscription only implemented in 1945."
Wars with China and Russia.
"At the end of the 19th century, many Japanese believed that Japan needed to expand in order to face Western foreign powers. This resulted in wars with its neighboring counties. In 1894-1895, Japan and China had a war. Another war took place with Russia in 1904-1905. Japan became a world power after these wars. Russian influence continued to grow inside China."
Anglo-Japanese Alliance.
"By the beginning of the 20th century, Russian influence was increasing in China. Japan and the United Kingdom used to get economic and other benefits from their relationship with China. Japan and the United Kingdom did not like Russia’s growing influence in China. Japan and the United Kingdom formed a military alliance, called the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, on January 30th 1902. Russia was not happy at this type of agreement between Japan and the United Kingdom. Russia tried to form a similar military alliance with Germany and France. On March 6th 1902, Russia formed a military alliance with France but not Germany."
"The Russo-Japanese War began between Japan and Russia. Japan won the Russo-Japanese War. The United States mediated the peace negotiations between Japan and Russia. Japan got a number of concessions. In 1910, Japan invaded and annexed Korea."

World War II.
"Before the beginning of the Second World War, Japan was fighting with China. This is called Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). According to the United States government's own Department of State's Office of the Historian, the US did nothing to help China against the Japanese from 1937 to 1940 when Japan and China were engaged in total war. US officials and policymakers did not want to help. Meanwhile, Japan's military obtained the majority of its iron, steel and oil from the United States between 1937 and 1940. The treaty of commerce between the United States and Japan was not abrogated until January 1940 and even then the United States did not embargo Japan right away. The United States only began giving aid to China after 1940 when Japan and China already fought for three years. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Japan went to the side of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The fighting continued for years. When the USA dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan accepted defeat and surrendered in 1945."
World War II and Japanese occupation of the Philippines
"Japan launched a surprise attack on the Clark Air Base in Pampanga on December 8, 1941, just ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Aerial bombardment was followed by landings of ground troops on Luzon. The defending Philippine and United States troops were under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. Under the pressure of superior numbers, the defending forces withdrew to the Bataan Peninsula and to the island of Corregidor at the entrance to Manila Bay."
"On January 2, 1942, General MacArthur declared the capital city, Manila, an open city to prevent its destruction. The Philippine defense continued until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in April 1942 and on Corregidor in May of the same year. Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese at Bataan were forced to undertake the infamous Bataan Death March to a prison camp 105 kilometers to the north. It is estimated that about 10,000 Filipinos and 1,200 Americans died before reaching their destination."
"President Quezon and Osmeña had accompanied the troops to Corregidor and later left for the United States, where they set up a government in exile. MacArthur was ordered to Australia, where he started to plan for a return to the Philippines."
"The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the Philippine Executive Commission. They initially organized a Council of State, through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored republic headed by President José P. Laurel proved to be unpopular."
"Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East, continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war and was considered an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon."
"The occupation of the Philippines by Japan ended at the war's conclusion. The American army had been fighting the Philippines Campaign since October 1944, when MacArthur's Sixth United States Army landed on Leyte. Landings in other parts of the country had followed, and the Allies, with the Philippine Commonwealth troops, pushed toward Manila. However, fighting continued until Japan's formal surrender on September 2, 1945. The Philippines suffered great loss of life and tremendous physical destruction, especially during the Battle of Manila. An estimated 1 million Filipinos had been killed, a large portion during the final months of the war, and Manila had been extensively damaged."
Occupied Japan.
"After the end of the Second World War, Japan came under international control. Japan became an important friend of the US when it entered into the Cold war with Korea. Over next few years, many political, economic and social changes took place. Japanese Diet (legislature) came into being. In 1951, USA and 45 other countries signed an agreement with Japan, and Japan again became an independent nation with full power (a country with full sovereignty) on 28th April 1952."
"Japan experienced dramatic political and social transformation under the Allied occupation in 1945–1952. US General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers, served as Japan's de facto leader and played a central role in implementing reforms"
"As the new de facto ruler of Japan, Douglas MacArthur ordered the drafting of a new constitution for Japan in February 1946.[15]"
So great was his influence in Japan that he has been dubbed the Gaijin Shōgun
The Shinto Directive was an order issued in 1945[1] to the Japanese government by Occupation authorities to abolish state support for the Shinto religion.
"Yeah,"
I drink beer.
"have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ..."
"Yeah,"
whiskey is in liters.
Yes.
"And, and the next,"
"yeah,"
"point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,"
yeah.
"It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange."
Yeah.
What's a fifth of whiskey?
Yeah.
"I, I always wondered about that myself."
It was a marketing ploy.
"And, and they had quarts at the same time though."
Yeah.
"But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five"
"and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,"
Yeah.
"it's, uh, I find that interesting."
It's ...
"But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles"
Liters.
"and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational."
Yeah.
"It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop"
"and, uh, everything's still inches."
"Everything's still fractions of inches, or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ..."
Yeah.
"It's, it's hard to think  though."
"American Express does that, by the way."
"Oh, they do?"
"Yeah,"
"I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them."
"Well, sure it is."
"And that is an invasion of privacy,"
you're right.
That's right.
"Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere"
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever."
"Exactly,"
"magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing"
Uh-huh.
it's the way they make additional money.
That's right.
"But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh,"
"you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card,"
"so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling."
"Yeah,"
that's right.
"So, I don't know."
"What, what do you, where are you from?"
"Oh, I'm from Texas."
"Oh, okay,"
"well so,"
"yeah,"
"we live in the Dallas area, Richardson."
"Oh, we're in Plano."
Okay
"Well, you know, the only call I really got that, well, was out of state,"
"and, and, when you turn, When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it"
"And then, at a took that away as far as being,"
and the tax is a lot less.
Yeah.
"But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low, relatively low interest bearing investment."
"I mean, it's not making ten, fifteen percent like a business is today."
Huh-uh.
"Uh, me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it."
"Well, you can come over to my house and spend it"
"Well, you, well, do you, do you need some help spending yours?"
I wish I had some to spend.
No.
No.
I just don't have any.
"Oh, uh-huh."
"Well, that's my problem too."
"I'm, I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid."
Yeah.
That's the way it goes
"Well, I guess we probably talked just about long enough."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, let me ask you something."
Did you get a catalog or something from these people?
Yes.
You did?
Uh-huh.
"I've, everybody I've talked to has received one"
but I haven't gotten mine.
"Uh, I don't know."
"Um, well, anyway Ellen, it was nice talking to you."
You too.
"I really haven't,"
"no,"
huh-uh
I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.
"It was brand new, white,"
it was like a big marshmallow.
"When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you."
uh.
I mean they came in and up and out
"and I mean, they did whatever"
"and, and we went for a test drive in that"
and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.
"And I wanted it,"
but I had a choice of that or my house
"and I thought that I'd continue,  to live in my house"
so.
"Yeah,"
"there, there's something about having a place to live,"
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"you know, it's just necessary."
"And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical."
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
"Yeah,"
right
"So,"
"I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars."
"They are, they're pretty aren't they lately"
Yeah.
"And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive."
They really are.
"It really does, except when you have to fill them up"
and then you get those Visa bills in.
And
Yeah.
"So anyway, um, anything else about the area, about, um,"
"you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there."
Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.
This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five.
Yeah.
"So it's, it's,"
"Everybody has got a pretty good size yard,"
Yeah.
"I mean, I got probably the biggest,"
"if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it,  in the entire neighborhood."
Yeah.
That's nice.
That is nice.
"But, you know, too, the only bad thing, too, is that then you have to keep up, you know,"
"you have to,  the yard to deal with"
"Well, I,  I enjoy that though."
"and,"
Do you.
"You must have more time than, than I have."
I'm sitting out here right now.
We had this terrible rain
and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
and it seems like
"now that's, that's,"
"I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. You know,"
It's rained
Yeah.
"Well, um, I don't know, do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time?"
"Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. Uh,"
"here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up."
You're kidding.
Nope.
"They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company."
God.
"Well, if you,"
"I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,"
"but, uh,"
Not at all.
"especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated."
There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.
They don't even try to keep up with it.
No.
God.
Not a bit.
So you lived in Texas for a while.
Yes
sir.
Huh.
"I spent, uh, couple of years down there."
Moved down there in eighty-seven
and moved out in eighty-nine.
"Are, where you from originally."
"Uh, right here in Maryland."
"Huh,"
so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
"Yeah,"
"And, uh, then she could be at home"
and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.
"But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour"
"and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents"
and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
"Oh, no."
Yeah.
It's hardly worth your time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty bad.
The only time I baby-sat was in high school
"and it, you know,"
of course you don't
"I didn't pay taxes on that,"
so.
Right.
"It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,"
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and I'd just go over there.
"Every Thursday night, they went to the theater."
They had permanent tickets
"and they'd give me,"
"it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,"
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.
"Oh, wow."
"And, I mean, they'd, you know,"
it was great.
I'd go over there
"and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here."
"Watch, whatever you want."
"And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard."
Right.
Ran out of jeans
"I understand,"
that's funny
"So, does it change?"
No.
"Your dress,"
no.
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,"
Uh-huh.
"but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in,"
but that's for my husband's job and not mine
"Oh, I see,"
I understand.
"I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him,"
"but So,"
"Oh. Well, that's interesting."
"Let's see, uh, what else about this, uh,"
"it, it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two, like, two or three levels."
Uh-huh.
"That there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"I would, if you, if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research"
"and, uh, acorn squash are good winter keepers."
Yeah.
"I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste"
Uh-huh.
"you know, we eat it, we,"
just too much.
"She, she starts her own plants."
She plants a lot of tomatoes
Uh-huh.
"I let her do all the planting and putting,"
"and I, I do a lot of the, uh, a lot of the, the the back work, and stuff."
"But she does, she helps me a lot, too."
Uh-huh.
She puts a lot of financial.
She plans it all out.
Beans like to be near certain types of plants.
"Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, uh, peas,"
I don't know.
"Something,"
"Oh, really"
"because of like the cross-pollination,"
"or,"
"No,"
"it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans."
"I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off,"
they just don't like each other.
Huh.
"I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books,"
"so. I wish I knew more to tell you why,"
"but,"
"Huh. My mom put, uh, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once,"
and the got cross pollinated by the bees
not being able to put it off for fifteen years.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in"
"and they, they get off for good behavior"
"and, I don't know,"
"up in Minnesota where I am now, they don't have the death penalty."
"And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. Because they figure well, you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something."
"Uh, but then for,"
"if I, if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten."
"Oh, really?"
"Oh, sure, you know."
Goodness.
"I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh,"
"I don't know,"
I think that may solve a lot of that.
Yeah
"Maybe not solve it,"
"but, I don't know,"
"maybe ,"
"I, yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient."
Yeah.
"Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty."
Uh-huh.
What do you do Georgeanne?
I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas.
"Oh, okay."
Great.
What program you in?
Uh-huh.
And we have the things that are extras.
But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.
Yeah.
"And, well, you know, the auto budget,"
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.
Uh-huh.
"And insurance,"
is insurance bad there?
"Um, I've got, uh, two older cars."
"There both,"
one's a seventy-seven
and one's a seventy-eight.
"Well, we've got one eighty-nine."
"And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year."
"But when I moved to the new town I live in,"
"because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, uh, less, you know, less highways"
"and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned,"
"so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year."
Wow.
"That's not bad,"
four hundred and something a year.
"That's, that's,"
It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.
That's cheaper than we pay.
"Yeah,"
"I was down in Texas for two years,"
"and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance. Um,"
"Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault."
Yeah.
Do you have that there?
they have no fault in Maryland also.
Uh-huh.
"and the average, you know, the average, uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here"
"Oh, if you had it early."
but usually it's not until later
It's really strange.
"Yeah,"
I think we usually have a frost in October.
Yeah.
"Uh, but, you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting,"
"and it has not today,"
"but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day."
"Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?"
Flooding anywhere.
"I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere,"
"I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past,"
"but, uh, no,"
I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
"It's just kind of, uh,"
"we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange."
We haven't really had an autumn.
It's like we went into winter
Yes.
"you know, the poor trees, said what"
"Yes,"
"yeah,"
we had summer lasting long
"and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day."
"Yeah,"
"uh, it's,"
"Yeah,"
"there, you, you know,"
"usually there's, uh,"
very definitely.
And so you've got a real balance to make there.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
"Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old."
"They aren't really that old,"
"but they are, sort of wearing out."
My mamma is a dialysis patient
Uh-huh.
"and she is only about sixty-four,"
but she's had some pretty close calls
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she's phasing out ounds like
"and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,"
but my daddy keeps talking about it.
"I don't,"
"I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home."
ery faint.
"And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home."
"He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now"
Oh really.
and he's living by himself.
My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
"Oh, okay."
"so but, he's, you know,"
"as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home."
"Yeah,"
but it gets hard.
"My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Gosh,"
I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area
but you're right.
Yeah.
I grew up in a real small town in Florida.
Oh.
I mean a real small town
"And, uh, I think it was just"
"of course it was back in the, in the fifties"
and I think it was real prevalent back then.
"I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it."
Yeah.
"Well,"
"and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um, if we've lost some of that"
"and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,"
"maybe that's a way,"
"if, if young people had to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um,  is helping others"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
I do to.
I do to.
"I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for it though."
I think you would have to start younger.
Yeah.
"I, I don't know how young you'd have to go"
"but I think by the time they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now. At least around here."
"Yeah,"
"I think, uh, I think it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know"
"they're, um, things even just starting around the home.  You know"
Right.
little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
So he didn't go howl?
"No,"
"he wouldn't go howl,"
"so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him"
"Oh, how funny."
It is.
"It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,"
"and, and the relationship between the family is, is really now, now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them."
Huh.
"So it's,"
"our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it."
"But it really is, it moves real fast."
"It's a real short,"
"and there's always, like I say, a moral to it"
"and,"
"It's just a half hour,"
or is it hour?
"Well, half hour."
Oh.
"That, that's all there is to it."
"And, and, uh, they ..."
"There's not many half hour shows,"
"it seems like that,"
"Yeah,"
"it, it, they, they're trying to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. Uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth,"
Uh-huh.
"and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,"
but I didn't really see that in there.
"But what I've read about it, they talk about that."
"But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,"
"and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if I can do it,"
"Yeah,"
"Uh, I have a son that is in the fourth grade"
Huh.
"and, uh, they have just now taken up division."
Wow.
Yeah
And
That is slow.
"uh,"
my husband and I go to the store
"and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things"
"and I feel like, uh, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system."
"It is,"
What do you think's wrong to cause that?
"Well, well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system."
"And the money they do have, they're not, they do not use it wisely."
Yeah.
"Uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students."
Uh-huh.
And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal  with on an every day basis. Uh
Yeah.
Perhaps.
"but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children."
Yeah.
"And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It  it, you know, it can, it can really be bad."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's one thing I worry about ."
"Uh, also I think, we have a lot of, uh, Hispanics"
"There you go,"
uh-huh.
"and, uh, if I catch him I call him"
and he comes back.
"So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things."
Um.
Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
No
we never did.
"and,"
"I, I trained him on my own"
"and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult."
Uh-huh.
"We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,"
"but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,"
"so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,"
"but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well."
I never really to hit him or anything.
Uh-huh.
"Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things."
Huh.
Really?
"I, I see other people out there"
"and they hit their dogs and try to,"
"and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,"
"least I,"
Invisible what?
"Invisible fencing,"
have you heard of that?
"No,"
what is that?
"It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter"
Oh.
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
yeah.
That was hilarious.
"The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,"
Oh yes.
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.
"Yes,"
yes.
Unbelievable.
"Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also, uh, who can do most phenomenal things"
Yeah.
and everyone feels they are totally retarded.
"Yeah,"
"because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,"
That's right.
"but, boy there's a lots going on in there"
It's amazing
"Yeah,"
yeah
"and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only,"
Yes.
"an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,"
"and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example."
Yes
"and the,"
"Right,"
well the warmth that developed between them
"and again it, I think was a picture of relationships."
Yeah.
"Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident."
"Right,"
right.
"I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie"
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, I work in metal fab"
"and tenths of inches are, are normal."
"And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch."
"Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, uh, metric type things like ..."
"Yes,"
I am.
"I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle"
"and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years"
and the metric system comes easy to me.
But my ...
"I think it's interesting you you know, when you go out there"
and you're looking for a wrench
and you want the next size larger.

Right.
"Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch."
"But some of them, like, like, twenty-seven"
"and, and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, uh, don't translate."
"Yeah,"

"To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ..."

"I don't know,"
"do you, do you drink adult beverages?"

I was halfway listening while I was painting
Uh-huh.
"Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children"
Uh-huh.
"and they've now moved it to Washington, D C"
"and the, the doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care   and leaving them there."
Yeah.
Oh that would be hard.
"You know, so, um,"
"Well, they give a lot more leave."
"I work at N C N B now,"

"Uh, what, uh, possessed you to get the dog?"
"Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, you know, complications come with it."
Yeah.
"And then with our children, uh,"
"at the time they were, oh, grade five and, and grade eight,"
"so it was an age where it was, uh, we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"Uh,"
"Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
That's good.
That kind of builds some character a little bit.
"So ,"
"Well, that's the idea."
"I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,"
"uh, it depends on the, on everyone's discipline."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog"
"and, uh, we've had him about four years now."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but I think it does, it, it, you know,"
"it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly, uh,"

that's something that's important for sure.
Yeah.

"and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do,"
"but the, the actual,"
"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even"
"Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music"
"Yeah,"
I guess.
"um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it"
Uh-huh.
Um.
Do you like rap?
"Um, some of it, um,"
it depends.
"I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um,"
and they usually do a lot of satire
Yeah
um.
that kind I kind of like.
Right.

Lord Sastha, the presiding deity, as the divine protector of the whole village settlement, showered benediction on a cultured rave. He rode the boundaries of the settlement on His white charger; the pure, microcosmic soul. Full of devotion, the people reveled in the ineffable tenderness of Sastha. A peaceful refuge for the troubled soul that was Thiruvullakkavu."

An unending stream of devotees flow to this temple on Vijaya Dasami, the most auspicious morning of the year for those who seek academic excellence."

"David Gervan McMillan (26 February 1904 – 20 February 1951), known as Gervan McMillan, was a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party, and a medical practitioner."
"McMillan was born in 1904 in New Plymouth, the eldest child of Annie Gertrude Pearce and David McMillan, a dairy farmer near Stratford. He received his secondary education at Stratford Technical High School, where he was dux. With the help of the Taranaki Scholarship, he could afford to study medicine at the University of Otago, from where he graduated MB ChB in 1929. He was a medical practitioner, first practising in Kurow (1929–34) and then at 115 Highgate in Kaikorai, Dunedin (c.1935-36, after which the building was his electorate office to 1943, then again a medical practice after he had left parliament). The building was demolished after 1950 to make way for the Stuart Street extension."
"McMillan became involved with the Labour Party in 1923. In his view, good health extended beyond good medical support, but included educational, economic, and social factors."
"He represented the Dunedin West electorate from to 1943, when he retired. He was Minister of Marine (1940–1941) in the First Labour Government, and was responsible for much of the social security system introduced by Labour."
"In 1940 he ran for the position of Labour Party leader, being nominated by Arnold Nordmeyer, a friend from Kurow and a supporter of John A. Lee. Clyde Carr also ran, but the winner to replace Savage was his deputy, Peter Fraser."
"He was a Dunedin City Councillor for 1935–1938, 1938–1941, 1944–1947 and 1950–1951. He twice unsuccessfully stood for the Dunedin mayoralty; he was beaten by Andrew Henson Allen and Donald Charles Cameron in 1941 and 1944, respectively."
"McMillan died on 20 February 1951 at Dunedin from a heart disease. He was survived by his wife, Ethel McMillan, and their two sons. Two years after his death, his widow became a Member of Parliament for , also representing the Labour Party."

"Emma-Kate Davies, known as Emma Davies (born 7 March 1970), is an English actress. She is the daughter of actor Geoffrey Davies, of the television comedy series ""Doctor in the House"". She is notably recognised for her role of Anna De Souza in the ITV soap ""Emmerdale"" and for her portrayal of Diana Mitford-Guinness (later Lady Diana Mosley) in the Channel 4 mini series ""Mosley"". She currently resides in Barnes, South-West London with her husband Ross Allen, a garden designer and their daughter Camille."
"Davies' father, the stage and television actor Geoffrey Davies, influenced her choice of career immensely. He would often let her watch his stage performances from the wings as a child. She says that she ""watched his plays nearly every night"" and ""knew all the lines."""
"He also landed Emma her first television role at the age of 18 months on the 1970s sitcom, ""The Fenn Street Gang"". She says, ""I was in a pram and had to stuff an ice cream cone into someone's face!""."
She also appeared in a television advert for Colgate toothpaste when she was 14.
"She trained at the Corona Theatre School in London, and has been acting in small TV roles since the mid-1980s. In that time she has appeared in television series ""Heartbeat"", ""Doctors"" and Sky One's ""Dream Team""."
"Her first television role was as teenager Jo Daly in Central Television's Midlands based drama ""Boon"" between 1987 and 1989. She later played Juliette Bannerman in the ITV soap ""Families"" in 1993."
"In 1997, Emma portrayed the controversial historical figure Diana Mitford (later Diana Mitford-Guinness and Lady Diana Mosley) in the biographical Channel Four mini-series ""Mosley""."
"In 2001, she also had a small role in Michael Apted's popular film ""Enigma"". And in 2007 she was cast alongside David Morrissey, Lucy Cohu and Tristan Gemmill in the short-lived Channel Four drama ""Cape Wrath"", as regular character Abigail York."
"In June 2008 it was announced that she would join ""Emmerdale"" as Anna De Souza. She made her debut on the soap on 8 July. However, on 15 October 2008, it was announced that Emma would be leaving the show at the end of 2008. With the upcoming departures of her onscreen father Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston), and onscreen fiancé Matthew King (Matt Healy) and the axing of her onscreen brother, Miles De Souza, Anna would have been left as a singular character with no family, so it was decided that her contract would not be renewed."
"In an interview on ITV's chat show ""Loose Women"" on 12 December 2008, Emma announced that she would be starring alongside Laurence Fox, Matthew Macfadyen and Sally Hawkins in ITV's version of E. M. Forster's classic novel, ""A Passage To India"". However, less than a week later, ITV confirmed that the adaption had been axed before filming even began due to ""financial reasons""."
"Davies made her second appearance in the BBC drama ""Doctors"" starring alongside her father in an episode entitled ""Toys"" in which the pair played an estranged father and daughter."
"In 2010 she made an appearance in an episode of medical drama ""Holby City"" playing a distressed lawyer."
= = = Commodity value = = =
"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value."
"A commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility."
"Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law."
"Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become token."
"MLB. He signed with the Dodgers and made his MLB debut in 2014. He played primarily shortstop in Cuba, but played third base and left field for the Dodgers, who released him in 2016."
"As a member of Cuba's Las Tunas team in the Cuban National Series, Guerrero was named to the 2010–2011 All-Star team as well as playing for the Cuba national baseball team at the 2012 Haarlem Baseball Week and the 2011 World Port Tournament. He was part of the initial roster for the 2013 World Baseball Classic but did not make the final roster and reportedly sat out the regular season because he was upset at his snub."
"He defected from Cuba in 2013 and obtained residency in Haiti. He began training in the Dominican Republic and on September 9, 2013, it was reported that he had been cleared by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to sign with U.S. teams."
"Guerrero was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with early reports putting his deal in the seven-year, $32 million area. However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years. The deal included a $10 million signing bonus and allows him to become a free agent after his age 30 season. The Dodgers officially announced his signing on October 22."
"Guerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289."
"Guerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero. Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes."
"During a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital. In 65 games for the Isotopes, he played 51 games at second base, 9 in left field, 4 at shortstop and 1 at third base. He hit .329 with 15 homers and 49 RBI. The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats."
"In spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract that allowed him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on the opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense."
"In his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off of Óliver Pérez of the Arizona Diamondbacks."
"After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games."
"On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers."
"His production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average."
"Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8."
"On November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi record for most consecutive games with a homerun after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a homerun set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2."
"On December 17, 2017, Guerrero signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for a two-year 800 million yen ($USD million) deal."

"All Saints' Church, Narborough is a parish church in the Church of England in Narborough, Leicestershire."
"The current church in Narborough dates from the 13th century, although it is highly probable an even earlier church dating back to the 10th century or before stood on or near the site. A Saxon hogback tombstone was found near the church and is on display at the Jewry Wall Museum in Leicester."
"The church was largely rebuilt in 1856-1883. There are two aisles, nave, chancel and north vestry with a west tower containing a ring of six bells. The large nave of six bays has fine piers and strong shafts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1883 by F. Bacon. There is also an Ascension window by Theodora Salusbury from 1929 (Carlton church has another fine window by the artist) in the north aisle. The stained window has two fish hidden in the folds of the robes. The ornate reredos behind the altar is very fine as is the whole of the chancel area."
The church includes a number of memorials/windows to the Everard family.
"The original Norman south porch was rebuilt in 1860 at a cost of £60. The font which has moved three times dates from the 13th century, and has tracery panels of various kinds including one with two parallel tree trunks. There are also sedilia in the southern aisle and a piscina. The graveyard is closed to burials now as these have transferred to the cemetery next door. In the actual churchyard there is a gravestone to a Harry Baker who died aged 49 in 1901 after being ""thrown from a trap""."
"The parish is part of the benefice of Narborough and Huncote, within the Diocese of Leicester. The church has weekly Sunday services and other events, including a yearly Christmas Tree Festival. The church is normally locked, but regular events and open days are held."
All Saints' Church itself is a Grade II* listed building.

"All Saints' Church is the parish church in Normanton, West Yorkshire, England."
"The current church is believed to have existed since at least 1256, and thought to have been commissioned by Roger Le Peytevin of Altofts Hall. However, a prior church is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is likely that the current church stands on the lines of the original."
"In 1256, Le Peytevin, a Norman Baron, granted the church to the Hospital of St. John, of the Knights Hospitallers, at Newland."
"The building is in the perpendicular style, being built mainly of coursed dressed sandstone blocks under a stone slate roof and consists of a three-bay chancel with a south chapel adjacent, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory. A tower was added to the western end in the 15th century. In the 19th century, clergy and choir vestries were added as well as an organ chamber. The building was granted Grade II* listing in 1965. The church was internally re-ordered in 1991 and again in 2019. The latest re-ordering has returned the church to an east-facing orientation."
"The church houses the Freeston Tomb, the burial place of Sir John Freeston of Altofts (d 1594), who by his will provided for an almshouse at Kirkthorpe and a grammar school for Normanton and Warmfield. His benefice still provides funding for the current secondary school in Normanton, the Freeston Business and Enterprise College."
"In 1906, a medieval altar slab bearing five incised crosses was found under the sanctuary floor, where it had probably lain since the reformation. It now stands in the Lady Chapel and is used for weekly Eucharist."
"There is low octagonal stone Font, now standing at the west end of the nave."
"The window at the east end of the Lady Chapel depicting the fall of the Walls of Jericho, is a war memorial to the fallen of the Great War."
"The window to the left of the porch was an addition in the late 1970s as a memorial to the explorer, Martin Frobisher of nearby Altofts."
"All Saints' possesses two ancient silver cups, now housed in a collection at York Minster. The oldest was made in London in 1655 and is inscribed ""Normanton cupp 1674"". The second is two-handled porringer inscribed ""The Gift of Mrs Henry Favell of Pontefract to the Church of Normanton for ever 1699"""
"In ""Normanton, Past and Present,"" author Walter Hampson (1928) noted the monuments within the church: ""The chapel is the burial place of the Bunnys of Newland, Torres of Snydale, Favells of Normanton, Smiths (now Bosworths) late of Newland and the Mallets and Levetts of Normanton. The Favells were an important Normanton family and were resident here in the early part of the 17th century. On the south chancel floor are memorial slabs of the Favells bearing the dates 1698, 1714, 1777 and others in the 18th century. Here also is a large altar tomb of the Malletts and Levetts. The Mallets it would seem were a very ancient family, as we are told their ancestors flourished here in the middle of the 13th century. The tomb on the top bears the arms of the Levetts together with the arms of the Mallets.

"The Mallets and the Levetts had lived in Normanton for centuries. (The first High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1069 was William Malet; Speaker of the House of Commons, and High Sheriff of Yorkshire Sir Thomas Gargrave had married Elizabeth, daughter of William Levett of Normanton)."

"Sandy Green (born 18 June 1987), known professionally as Sandy, is an English singer and songwriter from Croydon, Surrey."
"Sandy’s interest in music began at an early age. Growing up with a father who was an avid music fan, Sandy became influenced by his rich and eclectic music collection. At the age of 12 Sandy formed a vocal group with two friends, called Xposia. Sandy was the lead singer and together the girls wrote and performed their music, performing at local venues. Sandy learnt to play the piano and continued her songwriting. After completing her GCSE’s, Sandy attended the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford, Surrey."
It was at this time that Sandy focused on her songwriting and performing skills with a view to releasing her music to the general public.
"Sandy’s debut single was released through the independent record label, Sandy Music, in February 2007 on digital download. The A-side, ""So into You"", was an uptempo R&B track. A video for the song was released and received airplay across Europe and on selected outlets in the United Kingdom."
"The B-side to the single featured a rap from Silvastone. Sandy's second single, ""You and Me"", was released on 23 July 2007 on digital download only, again through the Sandy Music label. Her debut album was released on 6 August 2007. The album ""Affairs of the Heart"", included tracks she had been performing on her live appearances. Featured guests on the album include Flawless (formerly of Big Brovaz), Chunks and Silvastone. Sandy is the chief songwriter on ""Affairs of the Heart"", with Silvastone as producer."

She has been interviewed on outlets that include BEN TV, BBC Radio London, Colourful Radio, ""South London Press"", ""The Voice"", ""Croydon Advertiser"", BBC Three Counties Radio and Passion TV."
= = = DragonHeart: Fire &amp; Steel = = =
"DragonHeart: Fire and Steel is a video game loosely based on the 1996 fantasy adventure film ""Dragonheart"". On most systems it is a 2D side-scrolling action game, but the Game Boy version is an adventure game with combat scenes, where adventure mode uses a first-person view and combat mode is a simple 2D fighting game."
"""DragonHeart: Fire and Steel"" follows the story of medieval dragonslayer Sir Bowen in his attempt to rid the world of a particularly evil king along with seven evil dragons that have ruled the world (the seven evil dragons never appeared in the movie). On the way, he befriends the last dragon to exist, Draco. Sir Bowen and Draco must join forces to defeat the king's army and rescue a damsel in distress. It drops out some of the movie's plot, but it is still a close match."
"After its release, ""Dragonheart"" spawned a spin-off 2D hack and slash game for the PlayStation and Saturn called ""Dragonheart: Fire & Steel"", made by Acclaim Entertainment. The game does not use the film's music, instead featuring an original score by Thomas Egeskov Peterson. It was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews due to simplistic gameplay, poor controls, and jerky animation. Though the graphics were praised, particularly the rendered backgrounds, critics agreed that the gameplay problems were an overriding problem. In late 1996, Acclaim ported a PC version of the game, which received similar criticism."
"""Maniac Games"" gave it a score of 28 out of 100."
"There was also an original Game Boy game based on the film, titled simply ""Dragonheart"". The four reviewers of ""Electronic Gaming Monthly"", while remarking that the Game Boy game is rather simple and lacking in challenge, especially the ""anticlimactic"" combat, concluded that it offers decent entertainment and longevity for a portable game. They especially praised the storyline, with Sushi X going so far as to say it was the main reason he kept playing the game."

"The Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, commonly referred to as the Pittsburgh Marathon, is an annual marathon footrace held on the first Sunday in May in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. The Marathon was first announced on October 3, 1984 with U.S. Steel and PNC Bank as sponsors. From 1985 to 2003, the race was held annually and named the UPMC/City of Pittsburgh Marathon, although serious financial difficulty within the City of Pittsburgh municipal budget and UPMC's withdraw from title sponsor led to suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008. In 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and renewed interest in the race."
"The 1988 and 2000 races were USA Olympic Trials for women and men, that were held separately from the regular event although both were held over the same course."
"Aside from the main marathon event, several races occur during the weekend of the marathon, including a half marathon, two to five person marathon relay, 5k race, and ""kids marathon."" All races except for the ""kids marathon"" and 5k utilize the same route and starting time as the marathon. Attendance and popularity of the events has risen greatly since the 2009 revival. The 2012 race had the largest field in the history of the race. Registration for 2012 closed with roughly 25,000 participants between all races, with 6,000 entrants in the full marathon, 13,000 entrants in the half marathon, and 800 teams in the marathon relay, with the remaining entrants distributed in the 5K. Additionally, an estimated 60,000 spectators lined the course, and 4,000 volunteers provided assistance. 2012 also marked the earliest sellout in the race's history with all events except the 5k selling out on or before March 6, 2012."
"Historically, the course has wound through the unique and hilly topography of the city. Crossing five different bridges, the course traverses all three rivers of Pittsburgh's at least once. The start and finish lines have changed many times, but have always been in either Downtown or North Shore. Previous finish lines have included Point State Park, David L. Lawrence Convention Center, and the 50 yard-line of Heinz Field. The current finish line is on the Boulevard of the Allies near Point State Park. Numerous other historic and well-known Pittsburgh neighborhoods are along the route, including the South Side, Oakland, Shadyside, East Liberty, Highland Park, Bloomfield, Lawrenceville, and the Strip District."
"Throughout the course, thousands of neighborhood residents show their support by lining the streets of the course and volunteering at aid stations. Neighborhood organizations are awarded financial grants for community-engaging celebrations along the route. Sixty bands, almost all of which are from the Greater Pittsburgh area, line the streets throughout the course, spanning a range of musical genres."
"The Pittsburgh Marathon hosted the United States Olympic Marathon Trials for men in 2000 and the US Olympic Trials for women in 1988. In addition, it has served as the site for the United States men's national championship three times, the National Wheelchair Championship in 1986, as well as the Olympic Marathon Trials for both Finland and Denmark in the 1980s."

The Kuha class minesweepers () is a series of six inshore minesweepers of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1974-1975. All the vessels of the class were modified and modernized in the late 1990s. This included a lengthening of the hull.
"The vessels have a glass fibre hull and are amongst the largest vessels built in this material. They are equipped with hydraulic machinery, and its engines are placed in the aft part of the superstructure. The engines are separated from the hull with rubber springs. The engine power is transferred to the propeller unit (which can turn 360 degrees) through two separate hydraulic valves; in this manner the vessels are as quiet as possible, and it has been possible to completely eliminate propeller axles, which are very difficult to silence and are easily damaged in mine explosions."
"The vessels are very lightly armed with only a twin anti-aircraft gun and a couple of heavy machine guns; ""Kuha 22"" is an exception, as it assumes an anti-aircraft readiness role. It is therefore equipped with a couple more guns than its sister vessels."
"The ""Kuha"" class vessels usually operate together with some vessels of the ""Kiiski"" class, and they can sweep both impact and influence mines."
"The ""Kuha"" class will be retired when the ""Katanpää"" class mine countermeasure vessels enter active service."

"Jandro was born in Mieres, Asturias. A product of Valencia CF's youth system, he played three times for the first team in a three-year span (with a stint at CD Numancia in between, where he did not appear. Subsequently, he had another La Liga spell with RC Celta de Vigo, also featuring sparingly during two seasons and being loaned in between."
"After helping Celta regain its top flight status in 2005, scoring 12 league goals, Jandro moved to Deportivo Alavés also in the top division, being immediately relegated. He signed with Gimnàstic de Tarragona in summer 2007 and, after two second level seasons with the Catalans as first-choice, continued in that tier as he joined Elche CF on a two-year contract."

"The 31st Reserve Field Artillery Regiment was a field artillery unit of the Southern Brigade Irish Reserve Defence Forces tasked with the defence of part of County Tipperary and also with providing support to the 1st FAR, a unit of the Irish Army."
"The Corps of Artillery of the Irish Army was founded in 1924, and based in Connolly Barracks in the Curragh Camp. The Patron saint of the corps is Saint Barbara, and she appears on the corps insignia sitting astride a cannon. The 31st FAR came into being on 1 October 2005, and was made up of units from the former reserve structure, the FCÁ. The units which were disbanded in order to form the new 31st FAR were the 8th FAR (Cork), 3rd FAR (Tipperary) and part of the 14th Infantry Battalion also from Tipperary."
The 8th FAR was originally formed in Ballincollig in 1979. It was made up of the reserve batteries which had once formed part of the 1st FAR. The regiment consisted of two batteries: 2nd Battery (25 Pounder field guns) and 21st Heavy Mortar Battery (120 mm Mortars). The unit moved to Collins Barracks in Cork City following the closure of Ballincollig Barracks. 2nd Battery and 21st Battery merged to become 1st Battery of the 31st FAR on 1 October 2005.
"The unit had both ceremonial and training commitments, with annual artillery practice held in the Glen of Imaal in Co Wicklow in July of each year. A camp was also held around Easter time which focused on small arms training. Reservists from this unit were often invited to participate in training courses outside the unit, and members also participated in Defence Forces sporting events and shooting competitions, and have won several medals across a variety of events."
"The Pistol Team from 1st Battery was in the forefront of army shooting competitions for some years. In January 2005, members of the 8th FAR (later the 1st Battery) were called upon to take part in a ceremonial 21-gun salute in honour of the City of Cork becoming the European Capital of Culture. Other ceremonial duties have included committing a contingent of reservists to represent the 1st Southern Brigade at the National Day of Remembrance ceremony at Kilmainham. Reservists in the 31st FAR were also trained in Infantry Tactics, Amphibious operations, Fighting in Built Up Areas (FIBUA) and Peace Support Operations."
"The unit used 25 Pounder field guns and L118 and L119 105 mm Light guns. Some smooth-bore Brandt 120 mm heavy mortars were in the unit's possession but this obsolete weapon was later removed from service, while the 25 pounder became an exclusively ceremonial weapon. The unit acquired a number of 120 mm Ruag mortars."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"This station, located atop an embankment, has two side platforms, two tracks and maintains a level grade. It lies at the northern portal of the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, which takes the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through the bedrock of Manhattan. North of the station, the terrain of Upper Manhattan drops abruptly and the line becomes elevated to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames at the center. A waist-level black fence runs along either side. The platforms are offset as the South Ferry-bound one inclines more to the north than the 242nd Street-bound one. Each platform has two ""DYCKMAN ST"" mosaics."
"This is one of only two aboveground Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line stations with two tracks (the other being 242nd Street). A center express track, which is currently unused in revenue service, forms just north of this station and runs nonstop to just south of 242nd Street. A spur track used to be located to the south of the station, but was removed when the platforms were extended."
"The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Substation 17."
"A 1991 artwork in the waiting area is called ""Flight"" by Wopo Holup. It features ceramic relief tiles depicting birds in flight."
"The station's only entrance is a station house slightly above ground level at the southern corner of Nagle Avenue, Dyckman Street, and Hillside Avenue. There is a ramp and stairs from street level to the station house. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to each platform, with an elevator to the southbound platform."
"In February 2014, as part of an ongoing rehabilitation, the MTA built a ramp from street level to the mezzanine and opened an elevator to connect the southbound platform to the mezzanine. The elevator, which was not originally planned in the station renovation, was built due to a lawsuit by the United Spinal Association. The elevator is of a ""machine room-less"" design and is the first of its type to be installed in the New York City Subway system. The renovations also included rehabilitation of the tunnel portal, realignment and rehabilitation of the platforms and installation of new cast iron lighting fixtures."
"The southbound elevator is located at the southwest corner of Hillside Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Fort George Hill, and is accessible by a ramp to the station house."
"This station is not accessible to the disabled on the northbound side because the suit was settled only after the northbound side was already renovated, and in any case, the area's geography made it prohibitively expensive to add an elevator to the northbound platform. Northbound accessibility was proposed in February 2019 as part of the MTA's ""Fast Forward"" program."

"In 2001 Ruddy was named to his first and only Pro Bowl. He was originally named a second alternate, but replaced the injured Tom Nalen of the Denver Broncos. He was the first Miami center to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Hall of Fame center Dwight Stephenson in 1987. The last few years of Ruddy's career were plagued with knee problems and his playing time was limited. Ruddy was released by Miami following the 2003 season. It was rumored he talked to a few teams after his departure from Miami but didn't sign with any team."

Different media will be more or less appropriate for different activities. It is necessary to determine the most suitable and cost-effective training media for the different areas."
"There have been many different approaches defined, however, the system approach to training has been the most successful."
Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is defined as the “Identification of training requirements and the most cost effective means of meeting those requirements”.
"A TNA should always be performed where a major new development in policy, equipment acquisition or procedures is deemed to have potential impact upon the current training regime."

It also allows close family members of the victims to come to the United States legally."
"The United States government estimated in 2002 that each year up to 50,000 people are trafficked illegally into the United States, mostly women and children, and are trapped in slavery-like situations. As a response, it enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA), which, among other things, allows such people to apply for 3-year temporary visas that lead to permanent resident status. In 2006, Congress modified 8 CFR 214.11(p) to now have the T-visa to be for 4 years. Although 5,000 are available per year, only 2,000 had been issued as of January, 2009.

Babies are brought into being through genetic engineering, and sexual desire is chemically suppressed. All memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, for the purpose of shielding the rest of the community from pain. The Receiver of Memory and his/her protégé are the only persons able to see in color, an ability otherwise eliminated from the community to prevent envy. The community is ruled by elders, including a Chief Elder."
"Jonas is a 16-year-old boy whose best friends are Asher and Fiona. On graduation day, Jonas is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver. During his training with the Giver, Jonas gradually learns about the past and about joy, pain, death, and love. Jonas stops taking his daily injections and begins to experience emotion. Those who leave the community are said to have been ""released to Elsewhere"", but Jonas learns that this is really a euphemism for death by lethal injection. Jonas also learns that the Giver's daughter, Rosemary, had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. When she began her training, however, Rosemary became so distraught from the memories she received that she asked to be euthanized."
"Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and shares the concept of emotion with her. Jonas then tells her to stop taking her daily injection. The next day, he kisses her; kissing is an antiquated action that is unknown to the community and which Jonas learned about through memories received from the Giver, and touching a non-family member is against the rules. Jonas also shares his memories with a baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father. He develops a close relationship with Gabriel after discovering that he shared the birthmark Jonas has—the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory."
"Appalled by the deception of his community and by the Elders' disregard for human life, Jonas comes to believe that everyone should have memories of the past. Eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is for Jonas to travel past the border of their land into the area called ""Elsewhere"". Doing this would release memories and color back into the community. When Jonas tries to leave his neighborhood, he encounters Asher. Asher tries to stop Jonas, but Jonas punches him. Jonas retrieves Gabriel—who is to be ""released"" for having failed to meet developmental markers—at the Nurturing Center; Fiona kisses Jonas and helps him escape with Gabriel."
"Meanwhile, Jonas' mother and Asher go to the Chief Elder to tell them Jonas is missing. Jonas steals a motorcycle and drives away with Gabriel. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and ""lose"" him. When Asher finds Jonas and Gabriel in the desert, Jonas implores Asher to trust him and let them go. Instead, Asher captures them with the drone, but then sets them free by dropping them into a river; when questioned by the Chief Elder, Asher lies and says that he has followed her orders."
"Fiona is condemned to be ""released"" for helping Jonas. Just as she is about to be ""released"" by Jonas's father, the Giver tries to persuade the Chief Elder that the Elders should free the community. Unmoved by the Giver's arguments, the Chief Elder asserts that freedom is a bad idea because left to their own devices, people make bad choices."
"Jonas and Gabriel enter a snowy area. Jonas falls to the ground, overcome by the cold weather. However, he sees a sled like the one that he rode in a memory he received from the Giver. Jonas and Gabriel ride the sled downhill and cross the border into Elsewhere, freeing their community. This action saves Fiona's life, as Jonas's father realizes what he is doing and stops short of ""releasing"" her. Jonas realizes that he has succeeded in his quest."
"Jeff Bridges initially wanted to film the movie in the mid-1990s, and a script was written by 1998. Various barriers marred the production of the film, including when Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007. The rights then ended up at The Weinstein Company and Walden Media."

The FIFA Order of Merit is the highest honour awarded by FIFA. The award is presented at the annual FIFA congress. It is normally awarded to people who are considered to have made a significant contribution to :association football.
"At FIFA's centennial congress they made one award for every decade of their existence. These awards were also handed out to fans, organisations, clubs, and one to African Football. These were referred to as the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit."

= = = Fadeaway = = =
"A fadeaway or fall-away in basketball is a jump shot taken while jumping backwards, away from the basket. The goal is to create space between the shooter and the defender, making the shot much harder to block."
"The shooter must have very good accuracy (much higher than when releasing a regular jump shot) and must use more strength (to counteract the backwards momentum) in a relatively short amount of time. Also, because the movement is away from the basket, the shooter has less chance to grab his own rebound."
"The shooting percentage is lower in fadeaway (because of the difficulty of the shot) and the shooter cannot get his own rebound. This leads many coaches and players to believe it is one of the worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the hardest methods of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender."
"Only a handful of great NBA players have been successful shooting fadeaways. Michael Jordan was one of the most popular shooters of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain, Patrick Ewing, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook."

"In the North American version, two monsters (Dalawa Bunny and Accident Rabbit) were taken out of the game, but not out of the monsters list, making it impossible to finish the game with 100% completion. The PAL version still contains this error, and is also known to crash in certain places when played in 50 Hz mode, leaving those areas potentially impassable to players whose television does not support 60 Hz PAL signals."
Some PAL copies also have another issue where triggering specific Material summons would freeze the game. A workaround is to disable the battle movies in the game's options. This bug affects both PAL and NTSC modes.
"The English localization copy is known to freeze when loading the area at the top of a ladder at ""The Great Wall"" roughly 5 hours into the game when played in PAL mode. A workaround can be achieved by saving the game in the area prior and loading the game in NTSC mode, going past and saving on the world map. No other areas are known to have this problem."

"The Kichai were most closely related to the Pawnee. French explorers encountered them on the Red River in Louisiana in 1701. By 1772, they were primarily settled around the east of the Trinity River, near present-day Palestine, Texas. After forced relocation, they came to share portions of southern and southwestern Oklahoma with the Wichita and in the Muscogee Creek Nation."
"The Kichai were part of the complex, shifting political alliances of the South Plains. Early Europeans identified them as enemies of the Caddo. In 1712, they fought the Hainai along the Trinity River; however, they were allied with other member tribes of the Caddoan Confederacy and intermarried with the Kadohadacho during this time."
"On November 10, 1837, the Texas Rangers fought the Kichai in the Battle of Stone Houses. The Kichai were victorious, despite losing their leader in the first attack."
"Caddo-Wichita-Delaware lands were broken up to individual allotments in the beginning of the 20th century. Kichai people's allotted lands were mainly in Caddo County, Oklahoma. Forty-seven full-blood Kichai lived in Oklahoma in 1950. There were only four at the end of the 20th century."
"The Kichai are not a distinct federally recognized tribe, but they are instead enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. These tribes live mostly in Southwestern Oklahoma, particularly in Caddo County, to which they were forcibly relocated by the United States Government in the 19th century."
"The Kichai language is a member of the Caddoan language family, along with Arikara, Pawnee, and Wichita."

He has also acted in many comedy and drama series including ""Perfect World"", ""French and Saunders"", ""Spaced"", ""EastEnders"", Coronation Street, ""Pie in the Sky"" with Richard Griffiths."
"Litten’s first sitcom was ""Benidorm"", which began airing on ITV in 2007. The series follows various groups of holiday makers and staff in the all-inclusive Solana resort located in Benidorm. The series starred actors and actresses such as Johnny Vegas, Sheila Reid, Chrissy Rock, Selina Griffiths and Sherrie Hewson. The series received strong ratings and later extended its runtime from 30 minutes to an hour. The show ran for 10 series ending in 2018."
"He wrote an episode of ""Not Going Out"", and is also the credited writer of an episode of the ""Only Fools and Horses"" spin-off ""Green Green Grass""."
"In 2013, a one-off sketch was produced for Sport Relief featuring the ""Benidorm"" cast. The sketch involved several of the characters singing on ""Britain's Got Talent""."
"Litten also wrote a remake episode of ""Are You Being Served?"" which three of the cast had previously appeared in ""Benidorm"", Sherrie Hewson, John Challis and Niky Wardley. It was poorly received by audiences and critics."
"Derren studied acting at The Central School of Speech and Drama where he met Catherine Tate. He left Central in 1993 and worked as a jobbing actor for 10 years appearing in shows such as ""Green Wing"", ""Pie In The Sky"", ""Spaced"", ""French & Saunders"", ""Doc Martin"", ""Eastenders"", ""Casualty"" and ""Perfect World"" but it was not until 2003 when Catherine asked Derren to write sketches for her TV show. Litten agreed despite having no experience in script writing, or indeed any formal qualifications at all having left Hessle High School (East Yorkshire) without a single O level or GCSE. In 2004 Derren was nominated for a BAFTA Craft award in the category of Best New Writer."
"After two series and a Christmas Special (2005) writing for and appearing in ""The Catherine Tate Show"", Derren met writer John Sullivan who asked if he would be interested in contributing to his ""Only Fools & Horses"" spin off ""The Green Green Grass"". Derren wrote one episode and co-wrote another with John."
"In 2006, Derren penned his own comedy for ITV based in a Spanish all inclusive holiday resort.

"At the time the song was written, Robert Smith was very interested in the work of Australian author Patrick White. According to a number of his fans, Smith was inspired to write ""The Love Cats"" after reading White's novel ""The Vivisector"" (1970), although this claim is difficult to verify. In the novel, the protagonist, Hurtle, is appalled when his lover's husband drowns a sack of stray cats. White draws a parallel between the way in which the cats are discarded, and the treatment of certain characters in the book; by extension, the cats symbolize the most innocent and vulnerable members of society, and the casual cruelty with which they sometimes meet their fate."
"The music video features a number of cats and a large lampshade falling on the head of bassist Phil Thornalley. There are many shots of a mansion which the band told a buyer they were interested in buying it. They returned the keys in the morning.

= = = Darwin (programming game) = = =
"Darwin was a programming game invented in August 1961 by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy. (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.) The game was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an IBM 7090 mainframe there. The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an ""ultimate"" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it."
"The game consisted of a program called the ""umpire"" and a designated section of the computer's memory known as the ""arena"", into which two or more small programs, written by the players, were loaded. The programs were written in 7090 machine code, and could call a number of functions provided by the umpire in order to probe other locations within the arena, kill opposing programs, and claim vacant memory for copies of themselves."
"The game ended after a set amount of time, or when copies of only one program remained alive. The player who wrote the last surviving program was declared winner."
"Up to 20 memory locations within each program (fewer in later versions of the game) could be designated as ""protected"". If one of these protected locations was probed by another program, the umpire would immediately transfer control to the program that was probed. This program would then continue to execute until it, in turn, probed a protected location of some other program, and so forth."
"While the programs were responsible for copying and relocating themselves, they were forbidden from altering memory locations outside themselves without permission from the umpire. As the programs were executed directly by the computer, there was no physical mechanism in place to prevent cheating. Instead, the source code for the programs was made available for study after each game, allowing players to learn from each other and to verify that their opponents hadn't cheated."
"The smallest program that could reproduce, locate enemies and kill them consisted of about 30 instructions. McIlroy developed a 15-instruction program that could locate and kill enemies but not reproduce; while not very lethal, it was effectively unkillable, as it was shorter than the limit of 20 protected instructions. In later games the limit on protected instructions was lowered because of this."
"The ""ultimately lethal"" program developed by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy. Once it successfully located the start of an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location. If it succeeded in killing the enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters. If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance. Any new copies were initialized with a successful value. In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy."

It ran from Midland Junction railway station through to the Darling Ranges and up into Kalamunda. It was later extended to Canning Mills and in 1912 to Karragullen. From Pickering Brook, a line branched off to Bartons Mill."
"On 1 July 1903, the line was taken over by the Western Australian Government Railways and became known as the Upper Darling Range Branch. The last service ran on 22 July 1949. The line was formally closed by the Railways (Upper Darling Range) Discontinuance Act 1950; it was dismantled in 1952."

"Be Here is the fourth studio album by New Zealand-born Australian country singer Keith Urban. It was released on 21 September 2004 via Capitol Nashville. With four million copies sold, the album is not only Urban's best-selling album, but also one of the best-selling albums in America by an Australian artist."
"Juana Manuel of Castile (1339 – 27 March 1381) was Queen consort of Castile from 1369 until 1379. She also was the heiress of Escalona, Villena, Peñafiel and Lara, as well as Lady of Biscay."
She was the daughter of the Infante Juan Manuel of Castile (1282–1348) and his second wife Blanca Núñez de Lara de La Cerda. Her mother Blanca (d. 1347) was a descendant of the Lords of Biscay and of Lara and of Alfonso X's eldest son (Fernando de la Cerda). She was the last legitimate member of the House of Ivrea.
"Her father had been for five years a serious enemy of King Alfonso XI, his former protégé, and the king wished to neutralize or absorb the might of the Peñafiel family. Although Juana was not the heiress (yet), already in her youth she had to go along with royal wishes. The king's very influential concubine, Leonor de Guzmán, wanted to obtain some high prestige and property to her eldest son and had her eyes on the young Juana. On 27 July 1350 her brother and guardian, Fernando Manuel of Peñafiel, had to marry his young sister to Henry (1333–79), eldest of the illegitimate sons of Alfonso XI of Castile. This brought Henry certain lands."
"However it was later that Juana's relatives' heirless deaths made Juana the great heiress she turned out to be, while her husband became threat to the royal power. In 1369, he became King Henry II of Castile, after he deposed and murdered his half-brother to take the throne."
They had the following children:
"In 1361 (at the death of her teenage niece Blanca, daughter of her brother Fernando Manuel who himself had died in c 1350 without other children) she inherited Villena, Escalona and Peñafiel. Because Juana was a maternal granddaughter of La Palomilla, from her another cousin, Isabel de Lara who was murdered in 1361 and her young daughter Florentina (d after 1365), she also inherited Lara and Biscay. In 1369, she became queen of Castile and León."
"When in 1381 she died and left her inheritance to her son, Biscay finally was united with Castile, and ultimately Spain. The Basque people remember her for that."
= = = Happy Sad (album) = = =
"Happy Sad is the third album by singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, released in 1969. It was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California and was produced by former Lovin' Spoonful members Zal Yanovsky and, coincidentally, his subsequent replacement Jerry Yester. It marked the beginning of Buckley's experimental period, as it incorporated elements of jazz that he had never used before. Many of the songs here represent a departure from the binary form that dominated much of his previous work. The sound of the album is characterized by David Friedman's vibraphone, an instrument which gives the album a more relaxed tone than Buckley's earlier work. The songs are much longer than on previous releases and this style continued through to later works. The vocals on the album are more drawn out than earlier performances and this represents the beginning of Buckley using his voice like an instrument. The lyrics on ""Happy Sad"" represent a change as Buckley stopped working with Larry Beckett, his lyricist on the two previous albums ""Tim Buckley"" and ""Goodbye and Hello"", and began writing the lyrics himself. Buckley's self-penned efforts stand in contrast to Beckett's occasionally political and literary-style work. Buckley would also go on to author all his own material on the following two albums."
"""Happy Sad"" shares much in common with his later albums, ""Lorca"" and ""Blue Afternoon"". Much of the material that would appear on those albums was written at the same time as the songs that appear on this album, representing the most productive and prolific period of Buckley's career. Buckley's musical tastes expanded during the period that the album was written and the first track, ""Strange Feelin"", was directly inspired by Miles Davis' ""All Blues"" from ""Kind of Blue"" and the melody of the song is directly taken from the song. ""Buzzin' Fly"" was written much earlier than the rest of the work and was originally performed with a group Buckley had during high school, the Harlequin 3, with bassist Jim Fielder and later lyricist, Larry Beckett."
"The third track, ""Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)"", is a song composed of various movements and this represents the second time Buckley wrote in this manner, his previous effort being the title track of ""Goodbye and Hello"". The segments of the song were written separately as ""Danang"" and ""Asbury Park"", as demonstrated on the later released demo sessions, """". The final version of the song is backed by an 'ocean' sound effect, however this was not originally intended to feature on the song. Buckley and the band were happy with the take of song but because of a recording problem the track had a slight electric buzzing in the background. The producer solved this by muffling the buzzing with the ocean overdub."
"""Dream Letter"" is as an ode and apology to his ex-wife, Mary Guibert, and his son Jeff Buckley. This is the second song Buckley wrote about the pair, the first being ""I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain"" on his previous LP, ""Goodbye and Hello"". In comparison to that song ""Dream Letter"" has a more apologetic tone, the lyrics reveal this with Buckley lamenting ""Does he ever ask about me?"" . It would be over five years later that Buckley would meet with his son again. The name of the song would later be used for a live album: posthumous release """". The concert features much of the same personnel from the ""Happy Sad""."
"""Gypsy Woman"" is a long track highlighting Buckley's vocal acrobatics and on the record has some qualities of a jam session. Buckley and his band were disappointed with its recording but the song would remain as part of Buckley's live repertoire for the following years. The closer of the album, ""Sing a Song For You"", is more similar to Buckley's work on ""Goodbye and Hello"" than to the songs on the rest of the album. It shares the verse/chorus style and folk leanings of ""Song to the Siren"", which though released on ""Starsailor"" was written around the same period."
"Released at the height of his popularity, ""Happy Sad"" was his highest charting album, reaching #81 in the US Pop albums chart, but Buckley's experimentation on this album would alienate some of the fanbase and his mainstream appeal he gained with ""Goodbye and Hello"". However, this was only the beginning of Buckley's experimentation with sound and genre, and subsequent releases would further reduce his mainstream popularity and see his sales take a downturn."

It serves all or portions of Palatine, Rolling Meadows, Hoffman Estates, Arlington Heights, Inverness, Schaumburg, and South Barrington."
"The district has one preschool early childhood center, 15 elementary schools, four junior high schools, and one alternative public day school."

"Plum Grove Junior High School was built in 1961 for the cost of $1.1 million; the school was opened in September 1962. It started as a 28,000 square foot, one-story, K-8 school with a partial basement. The school was designed for 380 students at the time. Gene Shull was chosen to be the first principal of the school, a position he held until 1969. It was heated by a main boiler and was ventilated by opening windows and doors. Fresh air was reduced for students and staff when fire codes demanded that doors be kept closed. In 1966, a $1.9 million referendum allowed the building to double in size and add newer classrooms that were equipped with small unit ventilators. The school reopened in the fall of 1968. In 1970, it was made exclusively a junior high school."
"In 1988, the junior high's heating and ventilation systems were upgraded. In 1993, a 6.5 million dollar renovation project at Plum Grove added a second floor, cafeteria, resource center, elevator, office, and student service area. This renovation doubled the school's size, making it 98,000 square feet."
"In June 1993, asbestos contractors started to remove the asbestos insulation and tiling. About 90 students had classes in these rooms; 10 students and teachers complained of odors in them. The district consulted TurnKey Environmental Consultants of Mount Prospect, Illinois, to sample the air for contaminants. In 1993, TurnKey submitted a report stating that the levels of alkanes were 133 times lower than the permissible exposure limit set by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The floors were sealed again but odor complaints still resumed. Students and teachers were moved out of these rooms and the floors were shot blasted and sealed with latex-epoxy paint."
"In 1994, The Chicago Tribune found that five employees had died from various forms of cancer, primarily breast cancer, between 1982 and 1994, and four current staff members had been diagnosed with cancer, three of which had been working in the building for ten years. In addition to that, teachers, staff, and students complained of bronchitis, colds, flus, asthma, and allergies. Incidents of asthma were so severe for students that some decided to transfer to different schools. The teachers wrote to the school board asking for an investigation. The administration immediately agreed to investigate the concerns. At this time, media coverage was heavy, placing pressure on the school district to take immediate action."
"A team, including Northwest Community Hospital and TurnKey Environmental Consultants were chosen to investigate the concerns. While the investigation by Northwest Community Hospital and Turnkey Environmental was going on (expected to end in late June), the Classroom Teachers Council (CTC), said it would push to conduct its own tests if the district's team found no problems. This statement was largely due to the revelation that yet another Plum Grove teacher had been diagnosed with cancer."
"In late June, the district announced that the results of the much anticipated investigation would be delayed three weeks. The teachers sent a formal request to the district to get the raw data from the environmental samples to conduct their own investigation. Although ties were found between ingesting certain types of common mold aspergillus and cancer, Dr. Peter Orris, a medical director the district hired for the investigation, denied that mold at the school had any link to cancer in a letter sent to teachers. However, teachers and parents were still concerned that Orris was basing his conclusions in part on a British Medical Journal published in 1976. In late August 1994, it was found by the investigation that there were no cancer-causing agents in Plum Grove, but the air quality of the building was very poor."
"On August 6, 1994, an unknown vandal pried open the school's doors and scattered chemicals and specimens in the science lab."
"In 1997, Plum Grove was recognized by the United States Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School. The school was also recognized by the Illinois Honor Roll with its Academic Excellence Award from 2007-2012."
"Each year, Plum Grove participates in a fundraiser for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) called ""Pennies for Patients"". During the fundraiser, organized by Maura Reid, students are encouraged to bring in donations in the form of pennies and other coins; the class with the donation that weighs the most is awarded a prize. Several activities are also held during the fundraiser to support the LLS. The school has participated in the fundraiser since 2002 and has been featured on CBS and in the ""Daily Herald"" for these actions. As of 2015, Plum Grove has raised over $143,000 for the charity."
"Plum Grove is featured in the book ""Code of Silence: Living a Lie Comes With a Price"" by Plum Grove alumnus Tim Shoemaker as the school at which the main characters attend. As a result of the popularity of the book and Shoemaker's success, he visited Plum Grove during the 2014-2015 school year to talk to the students about writing as a career."

"David Andrew Berg (born March 28, 1993) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he played college baseball for the UCLA Bruins baseball team. He was named an All-American and Pac-12 Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year in 2013. He set a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record for saves in a single season with 24. The Texas Rangers selected Berg in the 17th round of the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft. He did not sign with the Rangers and returned to UCLA for his senior season. He was then drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the sixth round of the 2015 MLB Draft."
"Berg attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, where he played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher. He struggled while attempting to work as a starting pitcher, and in his junior year, his coaches helped him achieve success as a middle relief pitcher when he learned to use the sidearm delivery. He led his school's baseball team to the sectional championship."
"Berg was only recruited by the University of California, Irvine and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Berg enrolled at UCLA, and walked on to the UCLA Bruins baseball team. In 2012, his freshman season, Berg set Bruins and Pac-12 Conference records for appearances while working in middle relief. As a sophomore, Berg became the closer for the 2013 UCLA Bruins, and pitched to a 7–0 win–loss record, 21 saves, and a 0.88 earned run average (ERA) during the regular season. His 21 saves set a Bruins record and his ERA tied for the best in college baseball. He was named the Pac-12 Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year and a finalist for the National Pitcher of the Year Award in 2013. He won the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Award. was named to the United States national collegiate baseball team in 2012 and 2013."
"With the Bruins, Berg competed in the 2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament, leading the team to the College World Series national championship against the Mississippi State Bulldogs.

At the Championship Series, Berg set a new NCAA single-season record with his 24th save on June 24, 2013 and he also made his 51st appearance of the season, becoming the first pitcher in NCAA history to record 50 or more appearances in two seasons. The Bruins defeated the Bulldogs for the national title and Berg was named to the tournament's All-West Region team."
"Berg missed time in his junior year due to a biceps strain. He finished the season with a 1.50 ERA and 11 saves. The Texas Rangers selected Berg in the 17th round, with the 516th overall selection, of the 2014 MLB Draft. He did not sign with the Rangers and returned to UCLA for his senior season."
"On May 15, 2015, James Kaprielian combined with Berg for the first no-hitter in UCLA history. Kaprielian pitched the first nine innings and Berg pitched the tenth inning to complete the no-hitter. He finished the year with a 0.68 ERA and 13 saves in 43 appearances, and won his second Stopper of the Year Award."

= = = DCEThreads = = =
DCEThreads is an implementation of POSIX Draft 4 threads.
"DCE/RPC was under development, but the POSIX committee had not finalised POSIX threads at the time. The Open Group had to make a decision about what to stick with, and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection."
"POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as MSRPC and also in DCOM. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially memory leaks, exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads."
"DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently, for all that it can accomplish, the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources."
"The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification, aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not, is thread cancellation. DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the ""Remote"" of RPC, such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way. Unfortunately, the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology, and, given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification, it is not surprising that it was removed."
"Linux, since the introduction of NPTL and the Linux 2.6 kernel, has proper support for thread cancellation."
DCEThreads now only realistically exists as an emulation layer.

"The Los Cerritos Center is a super regional shopping mall located in Cerritos, California. Since September 1971, the Los Cerritos Center has been an integral part of the city of Cerritos' tax revenue. The mall is the city's largest revenue source, producing $581 per square foot in sales ($296 million total) in 2010. The tax revenue generated from the Los Cerritos Center for its host city totals to approximately $3 million a year. The facility is owned by Macerich & GIC Private Limited."
"The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency initially invested $30 million for the development of the Los Cerritos Center area. The shopping area built at Gridley Road and South Street was developed by Ernest M. Hahn, Inc. in September 1971 with the Phase I opening of the corridor from The Broadway department store (currently Macy's) to Ohrbach's (first became a Mervyn's, currently a Forever 21) and J.W. Robinson's (became Robinsons-May in 1993) in addition to having an initial 150 specialty stores. Phase II followed in 1971 with the opening of the wing from Ohrbach's to Sears. In 1981, Phase III saw the opening of Nordstrom and its first wing. In November 1993, Phase IV was completed when the Palm Court Cafes debuted in the Center with 14 eateries."
"At its opening, the Los Cerritos Center was one of the area's first shopping malls and was noted for its high quality maintenance and complete climate-controlled environment."
"The original goal of the center was to bring thousands of dollars of sales tax revenue to the city of Cerritos. In its first four years, the city of Cerritos' retail sales grew tenfold, topping over $207 million in 1974."
"In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off its 235 properties, including the Sears at Los Cerritos Center, into Sertiage Growth Properties."
"Since the end of 2015, the center has been undergoing a large-scale renovation, which brought in new anchors such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Harkins Theatres, in-line stores, remodeled interiors, new furnishings and lighting, exterior landscaping, as well as art work and overall re-branding."
"The Macy's wing houses merchandise, confectionery, and services for the family, the main concourse holds more upscale fashion stores, restaurants and boutiques, and the Sears wing focuses on specialty shops in entertainment, younger consumers, as well as the newly renovated Dining Court."
"Forever 21, which opened in January 2010 from the old Mervyn's store, was the first flagship styled store for the retailer in the United States and opened to much acclaim."
"A brand new, relocated Nordstrom department store and wing opened in May 2010 on the site of a former Robinsons-May. The added wing made room for nine additional in-line shops and restaurants. The old Nordstrom site was demolished for redevelopment and is now the site of a 16-screen Harkins Theatres which opened in spring 2016, as well as The Cheesecake Factory, which opened in November 2015."
"Realizing the importance of multiculturalism and diversity in the region today, the Los Cerritos Center, in conjunction with the city of Cerritos, is home to the Festival of Friendship held every February. Cultural booths and performances are held annually with the goal of reaching out to the various diverse communities the center serves."
"In 2010, 8.5 million shoppers visited the mall with November 26 (Black Friday) marking the biggest day of the year with 79,682 visitors. The daily average attendance from January through November 2010 was 22,133 people a day. December 2010 saw an average of 35,631 a day. Los Cerritos Center is the most financially successful mall in the Southeast Los Angeles region."
"In early 2017, Red Robin closed to make way for a P. F. Chang's, which was opened in late 2017."
"On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide. The store closed on January 6, 2019."

= = = Sambha gompa = = =
"Kamtsang Dargye Choekhorling Monastery, known locally as Sambha (Samba, Sampa) gompa (goenpa), is situated in Mustang district, Tukuche Village development committee (VDC), in the Western Development Region, Nepal. It is about within Tukuche town on the Annapurna trekking route/ gravel road from Pokhara to Jomsom in the Dhaulagiri zone. In 2013 the local higher secondary school, Shree Yogendra HSS was being expanded, and the entrance to the gompa is within the school site; off the main Beni Jomson road, west of the Kali Gandaki river."
"The founder of Sambha gompa is understood to have come from the DoKham area of Tibet, but his name is unknown. He lived in the village of Tukuche for some time and died during a period of mediation. Seven days after his death he became a rainbow body confirming his achievement of enlightenment. In 1935 the gompa was re-established by members of the Tulachan family."
The first and second incarnations (tulku) are understood to have been born into the Kharghar caste and came from Tibet.
3rd incarnation: Bhattachan family
During the tenure of the third incarnation the location of the gompa was moved to its current location. At the time there was no bridge and the river was difficult to cross. Therefore the villagers offered land to the monks to relocate the gompa within Tukuche village to ease their access.
"4th incarnation: Was from the Tulachan family based in Tukuche, whose given name was Karma Tashi Singye, but known locally as Dr Mangal Singh, having gained a medical doctorate in Switzerland. He died aged 49."
"5th incarnation: Born 28 years after the death of the previous incarnation, also from the Tulachan family in Tukuche has the monastic name Karma Dhomchhe Norbu Tenpi Gyaltshen Palsamgpo Rinpoche. He is the nephew of current head lama (2016) of Chhairo gompa Shashi Dhoj Tulachan. He was recognised by three senior rinpoches including Tai Situpa Rinpoche. He was enthroned aged 8 in 2004 in India."
"He is currently studying at Palpung Monastery in Himachal Pradesh under Kenting Tai Situpa. In order for the young tulku to be accepted by the thakali community, he needs to be enthroned in Sambha gompa, requiring extensive reconstruction of the residential quarters of the monastery."
"Lama Chh'eon-che, of the Gtsag Bris school of painting, was responsible for paintings on the wall behind the altar c. 1994."
"Other frescoes in the gompa depicting the sixteen Arhat on the south, north and eastern walls are by Khaipa Chhogyal, a distant relative of Kamal Dhoj Tulachan, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan's late father."
"Khaipa of Lupra is believed to have painted the Sin-yeb, but this painting no longer remains."
"Damaged roof timbers mean that water ingress has damaged many paintings in recent years. Although roof repairs commenced in 2015, this has yet to be completed due to lack of funds."
In 2013 there was very limited monastic activity. Tukuche has lost much of its population due to changes in trade routes and rural urban migration suffered by many small villages. This first occurred in the 1960s when China tried to restrict movement of Tibetans and most recently during the 2008 Olympics.
"Lama Shashi Dhoj Tulachan an artist from Tukuche village, is responsible for the continued management of the gompa and is seeking support for its physical and spiritual renovation, in addition to the restoration work at Chhairo gompa which he is also responsible for."
"A nun (anim) who also takes care of Rani gompa, looks after the site."
There is a part time monk sponsored by the current Ven Gyalpo Rinpoche who undertakes monastic rituals as required.
To the south of the monastery are the historical residential quarters for the monk body.
These facilities are not currently habitable and the courtyard is used for general storage from the gompa next door.
The gompa was restored in the 2000s.
"A stupa was constructed in the courtyard in memory of a Japanese man, married to a local Nepali, who was a donor for the reconstruction works."
"""Cherry, Cherry"" is a song written, composed, and recorded in February - March 1966 by American musician Neil Diamond. The song (originally intended as a demo) was arranged by Artie Butler and produced by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich. It was issued as a 45 single in 1966 and became Diamond's first big hit, reaching #6 on both the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart, in October 1966, and the ""Cash Box"" chart. Ellie Greenwich came up with the chorus and can be heard as the prominent background voice, accompanied by Jeff Barry. Neil Diamond has stated that the song was inspired by an early relationship with a significantly older woman."
"In 1973 a live recording of ""Cherry, Cherry"" was issued as a 45 single from the Neil Diamond live album ""Hot August Night"" (1972). The live version hit #24 on the ""Cash Box"" chart and #31 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart."
"""Rolling Stone"" would later label ""Cherry, Cherry"" as ""one of the greatest three-chord songs of all time."""
"Session guitarist Al Gorgoni (who later played on ""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon & Garfunkel and ""Brown Eyed Girl"" by Van Morrison) contributed to the song."
"Two versions of ""Cherry, Cherry"" have been released. The version familiar to most listeners was recorded in late January 1966 and released by Bang Records in mid-1966, and was recorded as a demo, with Butler on keyboards, and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich on backing vocals and hand-claps. The other version, with different lyrics and originally intended to be released as the single, was finally released by Diamond and Sony Music Entertainment in 1996 on the compilation album ""In My Lifetime""."

"The museum, which is adjacent to the opera house in the Piazza della Scala, was opened on 8 March 1913 and was based on a large private collection which had been purchased at auction two years earlier, with funds raised both from government and private sources. The displays include costumes, set designs, autograph scores, and musical instruments of historical interest as well as paintings of musicians and actors, and a range of related paraphernalia including precious ceramic figures portraying characters from the ""commedia dell'arte"", and board games which used to be played in the theatre's foyer."
"The Biblioteca Livia Simoni, the museum's library, is situated at the II floor of the Museum. It was formed in 1952 with 40,000 volumes donated by author and ""Corriere della Sera"" critic Renato Simoni; it is named in honour of his mother. Today it holds some 140,000 works related to theatre history, opera and ballet including librettos, periodicals and the correspondence of musicians, actors and dancers, as well as books."

"SmartPOST is an Estonian logistics company which specializes in delivery of goods and self-servicing post offices. Founded in 2008, SmartPOST currently operates 46 self-servicing post offices over Estonia through a solution called ""Delivery Point Solution"" (DPS)."
"Currently, the DPS system is used by online shops for product delivery as an alternative to regular post services. Private customers can send their packages through the system as well and pay for the delivery on the spot with a debit or credit card. The system also encompasses an SMS-based notification system notifying clients when an item has been delivered. SmartPOST's solution was implemented in April 2009."
"Unlike other similar systems (such as the Packstation solution in Germany), SmartPOST has placed its Delivery Point Solution indoors (e.g. in shopping malls), making them convenient to use even with bad weather. In July 2009, SmartPOST reported it is in negotiations with an Italian company interested in licensing SmartPOST's Delivery Point Solution for usage in Italy."
Currently SmartPOST is servicing roughly two hundred distant selling companies and online shops in Estonia.
"During its first year of operation, SmartPOST reported a 13.8 million EEK (about 1.2 million USD) turnover with an 8.3 million ($740,000 USD) profit loss. SmartPOST's member of board Antti Oolup said that the loss was expected and planned, with monthly profits planned for the end of 2009. SmartPOST reported that over 33 thousand packages were sent through its service in Estonia in December 2009."
"SmartPOST was chosen as the Logistics Deed 2009 at the annual Purchase Management and Logistics Conference. At the end of 2009, SmartPOST also reported that it will expand its business to Finland. Currently, only one-way packages can be sent from Estonia."
"In November 2010, SmartPOST's CEO position was taken over from Indrek Oolup by Risto Eelmaa."
"In October 2009, Estonia's national postal company Eesti Post filed a complaint with the Estonian Consumer Union, claiming that SmartPOST's television advertisements were damaging the reputation of Eesti Post and also ""calling viewers up to violence against elderly people"". SmartPOST responded that the claim was untrue and damaging reputation or calls for violence were not their intention."
"In July 2010, the Estonian Development Fund (majority shareholder in SmartPOST) sold its share to the Finnish postal service and logistics company Itella. Raivo Vare, Head of the Estonian Development fund commented on the sale, saying: ""Risk investment is a field where there are few success stories, but SmartPOST is definitely one of them. Sale of SmartPOST is even better than it looks."" The Estonian Development Fund reportedly earned €1.3 million from sale of SmartPOST."
"Production and intellectual rights for the Delivery Point Solution remains in the hands of Cleveron, a separate entity from SmartPOST."

"The Dangerous Rescue by Jude Watson is the thirteenth in a series of young reader novels called """". The series explores the adventures of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi prior to """"."
"Obi-Wan Kenobi is joined by Jedi Master Adi Gallia and her Padawan Siri Tachi at Jenna Zan Arbor's secret laboratory on Simpla-12. Zan Arbor, who has been conducting experiments in an attempt to break the Force into its constituent parts, is holding captive Qui-Gon Jinn and the elderly Jedi Master Noor R'aya. The three rescuers attempt to smuggle themselves into the laboratory; however, despite the fact that Qui-Gon has managed to free himself, Zan Arbor escapes with the unconscious Noor."
"Later, Obi-Wan receives a message informing him that his companion Astri Oddo, who went to pursue the bounty hunter Ona Nobis, is injured on the planet of Sorrus. Qui-Gon and Adi send their Padawans to Sorrus to bring Astri home, but Obi-Wan learns that this was merely a trap set by Ona Nobis, and wisely chooses to run away from a fight. He and Siri are ordered to return to the Jedi Temple, but he convinces Siri that they should look for Astri since she's on Sorrus. They are transported to the far desert and investigate a cave where they find Astri and her three companions tied up. However, the cave collapses — another trap set by Ona Nobis. The party are eventually rescued by a member of a tribe that Astri once helped. The two Padawans learn that Ona Nobis is headed to Belasco, the homeworld of Senator Uta S'orn, Jenna Zan Arbor's only friend."
"On Belasco, the Jedi discover that the population is suffering unusually severely from bacteria that recur in the drinking supply every seven years. They find Senator S'orn caring for sick children, but she wants nothing to do with the Jedi. Eventually, they discover that S'orn has altered Galactic Senate transcripts for Zan Arbor, and that Zan Arbor is likely on the planet. Suspecting that Zan Arbor has bioengineered the bacteria in order to make a profit selling a cure, the four Jedi infiltrate the water purification plant, obtaining dated water samples as evidence."
"Obi-Wan and Siri then follow Uta S'orn as she delivers dinner to patients at the royal grounds, in the hope that she will lead them to the hiding place of Zan Arbor and Ona Nobis. After seeing Ona Nobis eat dinner, they report back to their Masters, who confront the Leader of Belasco and ask that S'orn's quarters be searched. There, the Jedi find Jenna Zan Arbor, along with the captive Noor R'aya. Zan Arbor is quickly captured, but Obi-Wan notices that Siri has left the room, and he goes to search for her. He finds her cornered by Ona Nobis on the palace roof, and the two Padawans manage to hold off the wily bounty hunter. Ona Nobis then tries to escape, but she falls to her death when Siri slashes through her whip."
= = = Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy = = =
"The Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy was a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft built in the United States and used for ferrying outsized cargo items, most notably NASA's components of the Apollo program. The Pregnant Guppy was the first of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. The design inspired other later designs, such as the jet-powered Airbus Beluga and Boeing Dreamlifter."
"In 1960, U.S. airlines were disposing of their obsolete piston-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruisers in favor of the newer jet-engined airliners. NASA was finding that barge transport of their increasingly large space program components from manufacturers on the West Coast to test and launch sites on the East Coast was slow and expensive. Aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf was stockpiling surplus Stratocruisers at Van Nuys prior to resale, and ex-USAF pilot John M. Conroy realized the potential of these aircraft to transport the large but relatively light rocket components."
"Conroy presented his plans for an extensively modified Stratocruiser to NASA, where an official commented that the bloated aircraft resembled a pregnant guppy. Although NASA was lukewarm on the concept, Conroy mortgaged his house and founded Aero Spacelines International to build and operate the concept aircraft."
"Conversion work was undertaken by On Mark Engineering. The Pregnant Guppy (registered N1024V) was built from an ex-Pan Am airframe with a five-m section from an ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft (G-AKGJ) added immediately behind the wing. The wing, engines, tail, nose, and cockpit were unchanged, but a new upper fuselage of 6 m diameter was added, giving the aircraft a ""triple-bubble"" appearance in front view. The entire rear section (including tail surfaces) was detachable to allow cargo to be loaded directly into the fuselage."
"The aircraft first flew on September 19, 1962, piloted by Conroy and co-pilot Clay Lacy. When Van Nuys traffic control realized that Conroy intended to take off, they notified police and fire departments to be on alert. However, the huge aircraft performed flawlessly, the only difference in handling being a slight decrease in speed caused by extra drag of the larger fuselage."
"Carrying the S-IV Saturn I rocket stage, the Guppy saved three weeks' transit time versus barge, for a cost of $16.00 (equivalent to $ today) per mile ()."
"In the summer of 1963, the Pregnant Guppy began flying NASA cargo. Among its early duties was transporting the first and second stages of the Gemini program's Titan II from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral. As the space program grew through the late 1960s, this one aircraft clearly could not handle the whole transport load, so 25 more Stratocruisers and ex-USAF C-97s were purchased to construct four Super Guppy aircraft, which were even longer and larger than the original."
"The various Guppy aircraft served throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, initially transporting space components, and later, as NASA scaled down its operations after the success of the Apollo program, transporting airliner sections."
The Pregnant Guppy was sold to American Jet Industries and registered N126AJ for scrap and it was finally scrapped at Van Nuys in 1979.

= = = Jōkō Ninomiya = = =
"Joko Ninomiya was born on January 27, 1954, in Yawatahama, Shikoku, Japan. Ninomiya was the youngest of 10 brothers and sisters. His family owned and tended to several fruit orchards. To augment the family's income, his father also worked as a carpenter."
"In seventh grade, at age 12, Ninomiya began training in a Judo class taught by a teacher at his junior high school. He earned his first degree black belt by the end of eighth grade. After turning 14, Ninomiya did extra Judo training at the local police station gym on weekends and holidays. It was there that he met the man who would become his teacher and mentor in karate- Hideyuki Ashihara. One year later, in 1969, Ninomiya began training in Ashihara's Kyokushin dojo."
"Hideyuki Ashihara began training in Kyokushin karate at the honbu dojo in 1971 when he was 16 years old. Kyokushin(kai) is a full contact, knockdown style of karate founded by Mas Oyama. Ashihara attained first degree black belt in Kyokushin in 1974. Two years after that he became an instructor, and two years after that he was allowed to open his own dojo in Ninomiya's home town of Yawatahama."
"During this time, Ashihara was developing his own approach to the Kyokushin curriculum he was teaching his students as well as adding additional movements and techniques that he had devised. His techniques involved using circular patterns to move outside of an opponent's attack and then to counterattack from a position of advantage. These techniques also involved parries and sweeps intended to use the opponent's momentum against him. He always stressed getting the maximum impact from a minimum amount of force. Ashihara called these techniques, ""Sabaki."" Although many of these techniques were prohibited in Kyokushin Knockdown karate tournament rules, he taught them to his students, including Ninomiya, so that they would be more effective, all-around karate fighters. Many renowned karate students came to train at Ashihara's dojo because of his reputation as an extremely effective instructor."
"When Ninomiya was 17, he received his brown belt in Kyokushin from Ashihara and was chosen to compete in the All-Japan Tournament as the youngest competitor. He lost in the second round to eventual tournament champion Katsuaki Satō."
"Ninomiya trained hard for the next year's tournament, including spending three weeks living and training alone at a beach some distance from his home town. At his second All-Japan tournament in 1972 he lost in the third round to eventual tournament champion Miyuki Miura."
"During this time, Ninomiya had continued to train and compete in judo, as well as in karate. However, with graduation from high school, he stopped training in judo and trained full-time in karate, when not working in various jobs, including as a nightclub security guard. Ninomiya was now a 1st degree black belt in Kyokushin. At the 1973 All-Japan tournament, he lost again in the third round, this time to eventual tournament champion Hatsuo Royama."
"One month after the 1973 tournament, Ninomiya was chosen, along with five others, to go to live and train at the three Kyokushin dojo in New York City. Two of the American fighters that trained with them there were William Oliver and Willie Williams. The other five members of the group returned to Japan after two months, but Ninomiya stayed in New York to teach and train. Because of visa problems, he was unable to compete in the 1974 All-Japan tournament."
"In October, 1975, 21-year-old Joko Ninomiya returned to Japan to compete in the first All-World Tournament. In the semi-finals, he once again faced Katsuaki Satō. After a three-overtime match, Satō won the match by judge's decision. Satō then won the subsequent title match against Hatsuo Royama. Ninomiya finished in third place. The tournament was filmed for a documentary, called ""Fighting Black Kings"" that also profiled several of the competitors, including William Oliver and Willie Williams."
"Ninomiya returned to New York and prepared for the next year's All-Japan tournament. At the tournament, his quarter-final match went to three overtimes before he was awarded the decision. His semi-final match went two overtimes before he was again awarded the decision. Extremely fatigued, Ninomiya had only 10-minutes to rest and prepare for the final match against Toshikazu Satō which Satō won. Ninomiya returned to New York to resume teaching and training."
"Ninomiya was unable to compete in the 1977 All-Japan due to a training accident involving a sword that almost severed his left thumb. Instead, he decided to move to Denver to open his own Kyokushin dojo. His first classes were held in a neighborhood health club. However, he was subsequently able to rent a vacant store to use as a training dojo. He soon had a dedicated core of students."
"The next year, Ninomiya returned to Japan briefly for his father's funeral. Seven months later, he returned again for the 1978 All-Japan Tournament. In the final match, Ninomiya defeated Keiji Sanpei to win the All-Japan championship. He then retired from tournament competition to concentrate full-time on teaching karate."
"In 1980 Hideyuki Ashihara left the Kyokushin organization and started his own style- Ashihara Karate. Ninomiya directed the US region of Ashihara Karate from Denver. Over the next eight years, Ashihara Karate slowly increased in size in the US and around the world."
"During this time, Ninomiya states that he had developed strategies and ideas of his own that he was eager to implement in his training curriculum. He also wanted to develop his own tournament format that would provide what he felt to be a ""true"" test of karate skills. Therefore, in May, 1988, Ninomiya decided to leave Ashihara Karate and start his own style. Most of the instructors and students of Ashihara in the US decided to follow Ninomiya into his new organization Enshin kaikan, providing a strong base for the new style- Enshin Karate."
"Since 1988, Enshin Karate has continued to be headquartered at Ninomiya's honbu in Denver. The organization has grown and now includes schools in Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East, as well as in the US. Ninomiya's idea for an open, knockdown-rules tournament that promotes the Sabaki method became the Sabaki Challenge which has been held annually in Denver since 1989."
"Ninomiya travels extensively in his position as director of the Enshin organization. He attends the openings of new dojo, presides over Enshin sabaki tournaments, and conducts seminars on the sabaki method. When not traveling he trains and instructs at the honbu in Denver."

"Maqsood Ahmed (26 March 1925 – 4 January 1999) was a Pakistani cricketer who played in 16 Test matches from 1952 to 1955. He was educated at Islamia College, Lahore."
"Maqsood Ahmed was a useful all rounder in the first ever cricket team of Pakistan. Before the creation of Pakistan, he played for Southern Punjab in India, scoring 144 in his very first match. An aggressive hitter of the ball, Maqsood played a vital role in the recognition of Pakistan as test playing nation when he made 137 against the visiting MCC in 1951–52."
"A right-handed middle-order batsman, Maqsood was a hard hitter of the ball and is one of the Test cricketers whose highest score was 99, which he made in the Third Test against India in 1954–55. Though a brilliant batsman, his performance in Test matches was rather irregular because of his carefree attitude. In England in 1952 he became the first Pakistani to play as a professional cricketer. The English press dubbed him ""Merry Max""."
"He played 16 Test matches, scoring a total of 507 runs. He was also a right-arm medium fast bowler with three wickets in test matches to his credit. His first-class record is better, with 3815 runs in 85 matches between 1945 and 1964, including six centuries. He also took 124 wickets, with 7 for 39 and 6 for 44 against Sargodha in 1962–63 his best bowling figures. He was the leading bowler in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1962–63 with 34 wickets at an average of 9.29. He captained Karachi Blues and Rawalpindi in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy."
"After retiring from cricket, Maqsood Ahmed worked as a commentator and sports journalist for PTV, BBC and Radio Pakistan. He also served as the Chief National Cricket Coach and coached many Test stars including Intikhab Alam, Asif Iqbal, Mushtaq Mohammad, Sadiq Mohammad and Majid Khan. He was the Chairman of the National Selection Committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board which selected the World Cup winning team in 1991–92."
"Strickland had libertarian, socialist and atheist ideas. His anti-British and anti-imperialist activities were widely reported in the English-speaking press, making him somewhat of a celebrity, while his wandering led him to be dubbed a ""gypsy."""
"Strickland believed he was the subject of assassination plots by the British. In a letter to a London newspaper, he wrote, ""The vulgar, ungentlemanly, and, indeed, murderous persecution to which I have been subjected is exclusively British."" According to British intelligence, Strickland was thought to be of ""doubtful sanity."""
"In 1909, Guy Aldred, founder of the Glasgow Anarchist Group, was sentenced to 12 months' hard labour for printing the August issue of ""The Indian Sociologist"", an Indian nationalist newspaper edited by Shyamji Krishnavarma. Strickland heard of Aldred's action and sent him a telegram of congratulations at the prison and a cheque for £10. Several of his writings were published in ""The Indian Sociologist"" between 1911–14."
As related by Albert Meltzer:
"""After the publication of Hyde Park in 1938 support for Aldred in London fell off and he had burned his bridges in London and Glasgow, but then an extraordinary chance ended his days of poverty. Sir Walter Strickland, a millionaire whose family practically owned Malta, had during the First World War taken to him and was disgusted with the British Government after the Versailles Treaty. In acknowledgment of the newly created State of Czechoslovakia, the first fruits of League of Nations liberal idealism, Strickland became naturalised Czech (1923), though he never went to that country. In 1938 Strickland died and left a fortune to Aldred, who promptly formed the Strickland Press, bought a hall, bookshop and machinery and proceeded reprinting all his old pamphlets, before actually getting the money. Then the Strickland relatives brought a suit saying the will was invalid. Strickland had said in his will he left the money to Aldred ""for socialist and atheist propaganda"", illegal under Czech law. There was a complicated legal case which ended as such things usually do, with the money in the hands of the lawyers. Aldred, used to defending his own cases personally and handling courts with ease on matters of obstruction and sedition, found himself outgunned among the moneyed lawyers."""
"According to John Taylor Caldwell: ""Walter was an eccentric. He preferred books to the pursuits of normal young men of his class, and had no interest in sport, drink, gambling or women. His father was disappointed and disgusted. One day when he was having it out with Walter (probably not for the first time) about his unsatisfactory life-style, and the fact that he was nearing forty and still not married, Walter rose from the table and, so the story goes, proposed to the first girl he met, who happened to be the kitchen maid."""
"He gave Sun Yat Sen £10,000 ""to help him start a revolt against the Emperor of China."""
"During the First World War, Strickland donated £10,000 to his friend Tomáš Masaryk's Czechoslovakian Independence Movement."

Kashubian Americans are Americans of Kashubian descent.
"The two earliest Kashubian American settlements in the United States were in the Winona, Minnesota area, including the towns of Fountain City, Pine Creek, Dodge, and Trempealeau across the Mississippi River in Wisconsin, and in Portage County, Wisconsin, including the towns of Polonia, Sharon, and Hull. The Winona settlement is traditionally dated to 1855, but actually began in 1859; the Portage County settlement can definitely be traced back to 1858. Winona is dubbed ""Kashubian Capital of America"", because of the largest population of Kashubians there."
"After the American Civil War and the German Kulturkampf of the early 1870s, Kashubians emigrated to the United States in much larger numbers. While some headed for the Winona area and for Portage County, many Kashubians wound up living in major urban centers such as Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, and Milwaukee. A smaller number of Kashubians settled in small farming communities scattered throughout Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana. By the turn of the century, Kashubian Americans tended to identify themselves completely as Polish Americans, although in Winona (at least) the Kashubian language would survive for another generation or two."

By his retirement, the evangelical Pentecostal denomination had grown from 29,000 members in 410 churches to 1.2 million members in more than 19,000 churches located in 63 countries."
"Rolf McPherson was born on March 23, 1913 in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the son of Harold Stewart McPherson and Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. He was the half-brother of Roberta Star Semple, the daughter of Aimee and her first husband Robert James Semple, who had died of malaria one month before the birth of his daughter. Rolf and his sister Roberta were part of many services and revivals when young. McPherson attended college, first studying engineering. He switched to religion in 1930 after his mother became ill, and also completed divinity school, earning a doctorate."
"McPherson began his career as a preacher. His mother groomed him to take over Foursquare after a management dispute resulted in Roberta being ousted from church leadership. After his mother's death in 1944, and for the next 44 years, McPherson led the denomination, headquartered at Angelus Temple, and brought it into the evangelical mainstream, which supported its tremendous development in the United States and expansion internationally."

= = = 1891 Atlantic hurricane season = = =
"The 1891 Atlantic hurricane season ran through the summer and the early winter of 1891. The season had ten tropical cyclones, seven of which became hurricanes including one which became a major Category 3 hurricane. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. The tracks of four of the ten known 1891 Atlantic cyclones were revised in 1996 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas. Following re-analysis in 2003, two storms previously considered distinct are now regarded as a single system, Tropical Storm 8. A number of other storms from 1891 were considered for inclusion in the Atlantic hurrice database, HURDAT, but are currently excluded due to a lack of evidence of tropical storm intensity."
"A tropical storm formed in Gulf of Mexico northwest of Campeche on July 3. By the evening of July 6 it was approaching the coastline of Texas and had become a Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall just west of Galveston and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. It dissipated near the Alabama-Tennessee state line two days later after further weakening to a tropical depression. Sections of Galveston were flooded by a storm surge. At Baton Rouge, tornados related to the hurricane demolished a hundred homes and caused two floors of the state penitentiary to collapse killing ten prisoners."
"A tropical storm formed south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 17 and travelled on a northwesterly path before dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean on August 29 without making a landfall. For the majority of this period it is believed to have been a minimal Category 1 hurricane based on readings taken at Bermuda, which it passed on August 27, the capsizing of a steamer, the ""Dunsmurry"" on August 29 and observations from another ship, ""La Touraine"", which ran into the rough seas left in the hurricane's wake on August 30 and 31st."

That night, the hurricane passed over Martinique, lashing the island for four hours. The hurricane killed more than 700 people alone in Martinique. After reaching its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 961 mb, the storm began to weaken, becoming a Category 2 storm early on August 20. That evening it passed to the south of Puerto Rico. Sustained winds were measured at 100-105 mph. As it began to turn northward, it made landfall on the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of . Around midnight on August 21, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk. During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around midnight when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind was blowing southerly, and steady rain was falling on the island."
"The hurricane continued to weaken whilst traveling northeastward through the Bahamas on August 22. The center of the storm passed directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. From August 23, a ridge of high pressure situated off the southeast coast of the United States prevented the, now Category 1, storm recurving to the north. Instead, it passed over the Florida Peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on August 24. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it dissipated on August 25."
"On Martinique, the storm destroyed houses, crops and trees across the entire island. Fifty boats in harbours around Martinque were damaged or destroyed. At Ducos, only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34 people lost their lives. At Fort de France, twenty people were killed. A military camp at Balata was destroyed, with a number of soldiers there sustaining injuries from airborne debris. In total, the death toll from this hurricane was put at 700. In South Florida, the cyclone also produced hurricane-force winds that blew boats ashore near present-day Cutler."
On September 2 a tropical storm formed northeast of the Leeward Islands. It began moving northwestward and reached category 2 hurricane strength by September 4. By September 7 the cyclone was off the coast of New England and was bringing heavy rain to that area. When the hurricane made landfall in Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland on September 8 it destroyed a number of small vessels but then quickly weakened and dissipated north of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea on September 10.
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 19°N 47°W on September 16, before developing into a Category 2 hurricane on September 20. This hurricane never made landfall but did pass within 100 km of Bermuda on the night of September 21. A ship was reported wrecked on the coast of the island that night. The hurricane became an extratropical storm on September 26 in the mid-Atlantic off Nova Scotia."
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 21°N 54°W on September 29. It moved northwestward becoming first a Category 1 hurricane then, October 3 a Category 2 hurricane. At this strength it passed to the south, then to the west, of Bermuda on October 4. It quickly weakened as it continued heading north and was already an extratropical storm when it made landfall in Nova Scotia on October 6. It also affected Newfoundland before dissipating in the Labrador Sea on October 8."
A moderate tropical storm formed in the Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica on October 4 and passed to the west of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before striking the Isla de la Juventud and Cuba on October 6. The next day it passed across southern Florida before travelling northeastward off the east coast of the United States and then decaying in the open Atlantic on October 8. Some vessels were driven ashore on the coast of Cuba and two people drowned in flooding on the island.
"A tropical depression formed north of Honduras on October 7 and strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. On October 9 it passed across Cuba and quickly weakened to become an extratropical storm. As an extratropical storm it made landfalls in Florida on October 10 and, five days later, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland where it dissipated."
"A tropical storm formed north of Grenada on October 12, and made landfalls on Saint Croix and the main Virgin Islands on October 14.The system strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane as it proceeded north. The storm centre passed west of Bermuda on October 18 at that strength but weakened to a tropical storm just before affecting the southern tip of Newfoundland on October 20."
"On November 3 a tropical storm formed northeast of present-day Nassau, Bahamas. It treked north, passing east of Bermuda on November 5. The storm never made a landfall before dissipating in the open Atlantic off Nova Scotia on November 6."
"= = = Eugene Maximilian, Prince of Hornes = = ="
"Eugene Maximillian, 1st Prince of Hornes (October 1, 1631 – March 10, 1709) was the son of Ambroise de Hornes, 2nd Count of Bassignies and Marie Marguerite de Bailleul de Lesdaing. He was a great-grandson of Philip de Lalaing, 3rd Count of Lalaing"
"He was made a Prince of the Empire on October 19, 1677, and his domain elevated to the Principality of Hornes. It was an enclave of Liege. He was married to Princess Anne Marie Jeanne of Croÿ and had one son, Philippe Emanuel, Prince of Hornes. He died 14 October 1718."
"Trenary placed 5th in her first senior national championships in 1986. Later that summer she won the U.S. Olympic Festival. In fall 1986 she placed second to Elizabeth Manley at the St. Ivel International. At the U.S. championships in 1987, she finished second in both the compulsory figures and short program, where she landed a triple flip jump for the first time in her combination. In the long program Trenary landed four clean triple jumps, including the triple flip, and she upset reigning world champion Debi Thomas to take her first senior national title. At the 1987 World Championships, she rallied from 11th in the compulsory figures to place fourth in the short program, again landing the triple flip jump in combination, and fifth in the long program, to place 7th overall. In 1988, Thomas regained the U.S. title, with Trenary finishing second. Trenary placed 4th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. She was 5th at the 1988 World Championships, where she fell on the triple flip in both her short and long programs. Due to her strength in compulsory figures, Trenary again won the U.S. Championships in 1989, although she was defeated by Kristi Yamaguchi in the free skating. Trenary won bronze at the 1989 World Championships."
"In 1990, Trenary won both the U.S. and World titles. Her strength in the compulsory figures was the deciding factor at the 1990 World Championships. She was 5th in the short program and second in the free skate to Midori Ito but her top placement in the figures kept her in the lead overall. The International Skating Union eliminated figures after that season. After she won her World title, her coach, Carlo Fassi, returned to live in his home country, Italy, and Trenary began working with Kathy Casey."
"Trenary's triple jumps included the toe loop, salchow, and flip, which was quite competitive for a female singles skater in the mid-to-late 1980s. One of her signature moves was a combination of a one-foot axel into a triple salchow."
"In January 1991, Trenary underwent surgery to drain her ankle after she developed a staph infection. As a result, she withdrew from the 1991 U.S. Championships. In March 1991, Trenary moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to work with Carol Heiss Jenkins."
"With the elimination of compulsory figures—formerly Trenary's strength—from competition, the technical standard for jumping in women's skating had risen greatly, with the top skaters all attempting five or six different triples. Trenary's injury was slow to heal and she had problems regaining her former standard of jumps, much less learning new ones. She planned to compete at the 1992 U.S. Championships, beginning her comeback in fall 1991 at Skate Canada, where she finished second in the short program to Surya Bonaly, but dropped to fourth overall after the long program, where she was unable to successfully land any triple jumps. She qualified for the 1992 U.S. Nationals by winning the 1991 Midwestern Sectional Championships with an uneven performance: after a strong short program in which she landed a triple flip combination, she was unable to land any triple jumps in the long program. She ended her bid to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in December 1991."
"After turning professional, Trenary toured with the Tom Collins Tour of Champions and Stars on Ice for several years. Prior to the 1993 World Championships, the eventual winner and soon-to-be Olympic champion, Oksana Baiul, cited Trenary as her favorite skater for her beauty and style. Although Trenary's early professional competitive career was uneven, in 1996 she skated particularly strong programs, choreographed by her then-husband, Christopher Dean, to George Winston's ""Variations on a Theme by Pachelbel"", and to Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin' as part of the U.S. team in its victory over the world team in Ice Wars."
Trenary retired from skating in 1997 after developing a life-threatening blood clot in her shoulder.
"Trenary married British ice dancer Christopher Dean on October 15, 1994. They have two sons, Jack Robert and Sam Colin. Dean's agent confirmed in March 2010 the couple had separated."
= = = Wisconsin tornado outbreak of 2005 = = =
"The Wisconsin tornado outbreak of 2005 was an outbreak of tornadoes that occurred primarily in southern Wisconsin on August 18, 2005. A system of storms unleashed a total of 28 tornadoes, 27 of which were confirmed in southern Wisconsin, and 1 confirmed in Minnesota. This outbreak set a new record for the most tornadoes observed in the state in a single day, breaking the previous record of 24 tornadoes set on May 8, 1988. The system generating the Stoughton tornado was also accompanied by many reports of severe winds and hail throughout the region. The Stoughton tornado was documented on an episode of The Weather Channel's ""Storm Stories""."
"By far the most significant tornado of the day developed 2.0 miles (3.2 km) north of Oregon at 6:15 p.m.. This large, intense multiple-vortex tornado tracked 20.0 miles (32.2 km) into Jefferson County from Dane County, devastating the town of Stoughton."
"East of Oregon the tornado tore through several farms before impacting residential subdivisions in Stoughton. One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor. Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton. As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed. As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Several vehicles were flipped and tossed as well. Some homes in town were completely leveled, and an F4 rating was considered. Further investigation revealed that the homes were not well-built, and the slow (sometimes nearly stationary) forward movement of the tornado negated a rating higher than F3. After striking Stoughton, the tornado caused damage to trees and crops north of Busseyville before dissipating. Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha. 23 people were injured."
"Ten years later to the day, three tornadoes touched down outside of Lake Geneva, Big Bend, and Waukesha. There were no injuries or fatalities from those tornadoes."

"It took Girls Aloud five months to release ""No Good Advice"". Nadine Coyle said in an interview with The Lipster, ""We were No.1 for a month straight and then getting songs from all these other producers and we were, 'Nah, don't like it'. We waited from December to May before releasing a second single because we knew it had to be our strong point or we might as well kiss our careers goodbye."" Kimberley Walsh further exclaimed, ""We knew it was strong enough to come back with."" Girls Aloud reportedly had to re-record ""No Good Advice"" because ""it features rude words"", such as ""damn"" and ""shit"". However, the line ""Here I am / Dirty hands, I don't give a damn"" was kept intact. An explicit version of the song appears on the special edition bonus disc of ""The Sound of Girls Aloud"", replacing the lyric ""shut your mouth because it might show"" with ""shut your mouth because your shit might show"". Furthermore, an early demo of the song appears on a singles boxset released in 2009; this demo including the clean lyric in the first bridge and the explicit lyric in the second bridge."
"The song was released as a CD single, featuring an exclusive b-side entitled ""On a Round"", which was later covered by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai under the title ""Run Run"" for her 2009 compilation album ""Jeneration"". The CD format also includes the Dreadzone Vocal Mix of ""No Good Advice"" and its music video. The DVD single did not actually feature the ""No Good Advice"" music video, just a photo gallery and behind-the-scenes footage. It did, however, include audio of the track and the video to ""Sound of the Underground"". Another remix, the Doublefunk Vocal Mix, was later featured on the ""Life Got Cold"" single and the remix album ""Mixed Up""."
"""No Good Advice"" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. A BBC review described the song as ""better than anything else [...] in the charts."" Unlike many other songs, it was said to be ""not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together"" that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. It was said to be ""just as good, if not better"" than ""Sound of the Underground"". It provides ""more brassy and in-your-face lyrics of defiance and determination [...] Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits."" On a less positive side, Tourdates.co.uk said that ""No Good Advice"" was a failure at adding attitude to Girls Aloud's music and imitates ""as many songs as possible."" The song has been compared to The Knack's ""My Sharona""."
"In 2003, the song won the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year. Popjustice founder Peter Robinson wrote that the song ""established a motif that would saturate Girls Aloud's string of subsequent singles: an unpredictable and triumphantly contrary desire to push and pull the band in exciting new directions at every turn."""
"""No Good Advice"" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, held off by R. Kelly's ""Ignition Remix"". The song slipped to number five in its second week on the chart. The single lasted two more weeks in the top twenty at numbers eleven and seventeen respectively. Overall, ""No Good Advice"" was inside the top forty for six weeks; it spent an additional eight weeks in the top 75, selling over 105,000 copies. ""No Good Advice"" suffered a similar fate on the Irish Singles Chart, peaking at number two behind Ireland's Eurovision finalist Mickey Joe Harte. It spent three consecutive weeks at number three, behind Harte and R. Kelly. The song fell to number seven in its fourth week on the Irish chart. It spent four further weeks in the top twenty."
"The song also charted in the top fifty in Belgium and the Netherlands, placing at numbers 45 and 26 respectively."
"The video for ""No Good Advice"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed ""Sound of the Underground"" and would also direct ""Life Got Cold"". It features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits (which are seen on the cover of the original release of their album Sound of the Underground). Girls Aloud fade in and out like holograms, centered around a rusty old car parked near a phone booth. They are joined by several men playing electric guitar, whom they flirt with while in various other poses. In a separate scene, while a black background with bright pinkish lights being emitted from behind, all five girls shake tambourines and dance. The last two scenes are intertwined with neon-coloured animated special effects the background, finally ending with an explosion scene."
"In a special programme shown exclusively on MTV to promote their second album ""What Will the Neighbours Say?"", Girls Aloud confessed that they hated the ""No Good Advice"" video shoot. According to the group, both Cheryl and Sarah's trousers ripped and the make-up artist shouted at them. The group woke with bruised thighs the following day. The music video can be found on the group's 2005 DVD release ""Girls on Film"". In the group's 2007 DVD ""Style"", which also features the music video, Girls Aloud were horrified by the video upon watching it again. Regardless, viewers of FHM TV voted the video for ""No Good Advice"" as the fifth sexiest music video of all time in 2006."
"""No Good Advice"" was performed live for the first time on """" on 5 April 2003, a month ahead of the single's release. Girls Aloud sang in front of a checkered background in red outfits with black accents, as seen on the single's artwork. The group returned to the show three more times to perform ""No Good Advice"", including a performance using taxi cabs as a prop and another using phone booths. It was performed on ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" twice, as well as its parent show. Girls Aloud also visited ""Blue Peter"" and ""Popworld"". It was also performed at a number of live events in 2003, such as Spring Break, Pepsi Silver Clef, Party in the Park, the West Belfast Festival, and a festival in Belgium. Girls Aloud also sang the song on Germany's ""VIVA Interaktiv"". In the United Kingdom, Girls Aloud later performed at the Children in Need telethon and on ""Popworld""'s Christmas special."
"Girls Aloud performed ""No Good Advice"" on their first three concert tours. For their first tour, 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say? Live, Girls Aloud performed the song in school uniforms. The rendition featured an introlude taken from part two of the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"". The following year, ""No Good Advice"" was featured as the second track on the Chemistry Tour. The group, who were created by mad scientists in the show's opening sequence, wore lab coats. The performance, influenced by Broadway, was set in a laboratory as each member was paired with a male dance partner. After a dance break, the mad scientist dancers performed a ""magic trick"" in which he made Cheryl Cole ""disappear"" and then reappear. For 2007's """", Girls Aloud performed ""No Good Advice"" in lingerie. The stage featured pedestals and platforms which Girls Aloud were on. For 2009's Out of Control Tour, ""No Good Advice"" was included in a greatest hits medley which closed the show. The song was also performed on the band's 2013 reunion tour, Ten - The Hits Tour 2013. It was performed as the second song in the show after the opener ""Sound of the Underground""."

"David Michael Brown (born February 25, 1970 in Summit, New Jersey) is a former professional American football quarterback who played for Duke University and later in the National Football League for the New York Giants and Arizona Cardinals."
"Brown grew up in Westfield, New Jersey and played high school football at Westfield High School, graduating in 1988."
"After his career in football, Dave went on to become a director at New York Life Investment Management. In 2008, Dave joined Lehman Brothers where he served as a Senior Vice President of Lehman's Private Fund Marketing Group. He left Lehman Brothers in 2008 to become the Co-Head of Greenhill's Private Capital Advisory Group. In 2015, he joined Moelis & Company to lead their new private equity fundraising business."
"Brown had a successful career at Duke University. In his November 4, 1989, starting debut he threw for 444 yards against Wake Forest University, including a 97-yard touchdown to wide receiver Clarkston Hines to establish Duke's longest play from scrimmage. Later that month, Brown set a school single-game record with 479 passing yards against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, upending Duke's rival, 41-0, to finish the year with seven straight wins and a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. The Blue Devils subsequently received a bid to play in the All-American Bowl, Duke's first bowl game in almost 30 years. In 1991, Brown was chosen as the recipient of Duke's Carmen Falcone Team MVP Award."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football quarterbacks: pass attempts in a season (#4, 437), pass attempts in a career (#5, 845), pass attempts in a game (#8, 54), pass completions in a game (#5, 33), pass completions in a season (#5, 230), pass completions in a career (#5, 463), passing yards in a game (#1, 479), passing yards in a season (#5, 2,794), passing yards in a career (#5, 5,717), touchdown passes in a game (#2, 4), touchdown passes in a season (#3, 20), touchdown passes in a career (#4, 42), 300-yard passing games in a season (#2, 4), 400-yard passing games in a career (#3, 8), 400-yard passing games in a season (#1, 2), and 400-yard passing games in a career (#2, 2)."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football offensive players: total offensive yards in a season (#5, 2,851), total offensive yards in a career(#5, 5,770), total offensive yards in a game (#2, 470), and two-point attempts in a game (#1, 3)."
"Brown was drafted by the Giants as the top overall selection in the 1992 Supplemental Draft. His first start came on December 12, 1992, when he was forced into the lineup due to injuries of Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler, and Kent Graham, dropping a 19–0 decision to the Phoenix Cardinals. To make matters worse, Brown himself was injured during the game and didn't play a down the rest of the season."
"Following Simms' retirement after the following season, Brown won the starting job in 1994 and helped guide his team to a 9–7 record, including a season-ending six-game winning streak. However, the Giants won only a combined 11 games in the next two seasons and their offense finished statistically worst in the league in 1996. This finish led to the firing of Dan Reeves, and the hiring of noted QB guru Jim Fassel."
"After injuring his chest during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Brown lost his starting job in 1997 and was never able to re-claim it. Jim Fassel went the rest of the season with Danny Kanell at quarterback and had an unexpected run to the playoffs and division title. In the off-season Brown was signed by the Arizona Cardinals to play primarily as a backup, and he ended up finishing his career in 2001 with Arizona."
"Following his career in professional football, Brown moved on to investment management."

"""As Sombrero Pillbox III"" is located on Matapang Beach west of Matapang Park, about in from the high tide line. It is a two-room pillbox with a ""complex configuration"" of six walls; its west-facing wall is thick and has a gun port commanding the center of Tumon Bay. Entrance and an air vent come through the east wall. It was built of steel-reinforced concrete including beach rubble, and, as of the NRHP listing date, was in ""excellent"" condition. There are ""impressions of tabi prints and a possible Japanese character"" in the cement roof, which is about thick."
"It is not clear whether any of these pillboxes engaged directly in the 1944 battle for Guam. These pillboxes were clearly designed to repel invaders coming from the sea. The U.S. invasion beginning on July 21, 1944, however, was further to the south and west; the area of these pillboxes was over-run by U.S. forces coming from the south, on about August 2, 1944."

= = = Nelson Diversity Surveys = = =
"The Nelson Diversity Surveys (NDS) are a collection of data sets that quantify the representation of women and minorities among professors, by science and engineering discipline, at research universities. They consist of four data sets compiled by Dr. Donna Nelson, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma during fiscal years (FY) 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012. These surveys were each complete populations, rather than samples. Consequently, the Surveys quantified characteristics of the faculty which had never been revealed previously, drawing great attention from women and minorities. Furthermore, the Surveys initially came at a time when these underrepresented groups were becoming concerned and vocal about perceived inequities in academia. At the time the Surveys were initiated, (1) the MIT Study of 1999, expressing the concerns of women scientists (including Nancy Hopkins), had just been issued, and (2) underrepresented minority (URM) science faculty noticed URM students increase among PhD recipients without a corresponding increase among recently hired professors. Because the NDS were complete populations, which disaggregated faculty by race, by rank, by gender, and by discipline, URM faculty had the documentation to support their concerns."
"The NDS quantified the degree to which women and minorities are underrepresented on science and engineering faculties at research universities. Because the surveys were complete populations and disaggregated, the degree of underrepresentation was revealed, in ways it had never been revealed previously. For example, the FY 2002 survey showed that there were no Black, Hispanic, or Native American tenured or tenure track women faculty in the top 50 computer science departments. It also revealed that there were no Black or Native American assistant professors in the top 50 chemistry departments. Analogous surveys were carried out for top 100 departments in each of 15 science and engineering disciplines in fiscal years (FY) 2005, 2007 and 2012."
"The Nelson Diversity Surveys made it possible for the first time to know the level and rate of faculty diversification, disaggregated by race, by rank, and by gender. Researchers in the 15 areas of science surveyed were enthusiastic to use these disaggregated faculty data, in order to compare against analogous student data, which had been available from NSF for decades. Many new programs to increase the representation of women and minorities among professors were implemented and PhD and MS research was based on data revealed by the NDS. The NDS were utilized by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, US Congress, Sloan Foundation, the National Organization for Women, universities, and many other organizations interested in diversity in academics. A new area of research was spawned – the Science of Broadening Participation."

= = = My Fellow Americans = = =
"My Fellow Americans is a 1996 American comedy film starring Jack Lemmon and James Garner as feuding ex-presidents. Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Esther Rolle, John Heard, Wilford Brimley, Bradley Whitford and Jeff Yagher are also in the cast. It is named for the traditional opening of Presidential addresses to the American people."
"Lemmon's perennial collaborator, Walter Matthau, was slated to costar. Health problems kept him from appearing so Garner was chosen to star opposite Lemmon for their first project together."
"Republican Senator Russell Kramer of Ohio (Jack Lemmon) wins the Presidential election, narrowly defeating archrival Democratic Governor Matt Douglas of Indiana (James Garner). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer. Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), defeats Douglas. His Vice President, Ted Matthews (John Heard), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. A further three years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce."
"Meanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about ""Olympia"", codename for a series of bribes from defense contractor Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a Presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his Chief of Staff Carl Witnaur (Bradley Whitford) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation."
"NSA agent Colonel Paul Tanner (Everett McGill) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board Marine One by White House officials, claiming to be taking them to Camp David at the request of Haney. During the flight Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes."
"Kramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's Presidential Library in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio to obtain records the overly-frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner and Haney. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin (Sela Ward), a Fox News journalist, but Douglas, based upon their adventures, convinces Kramer go to the White House to confront Haney, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents."
"They manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the White House Executive Chef Rita (Esther Rolle) and make it to the Executive Residence only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by Secret Service Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming (Jeff Yagher), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure, and disobeys orders to shoot them."
"Douglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances. The pair confront Matthews who admits that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Matthews explains that his stupidity was just an act, but Douglas secretly records his confession on tape. Matthews is sent to prison."
"Nine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as independents in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for president. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and takes to the podium to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to the chagrin of Kramer."
"Most of the principal filming for the film was done in the mountains of western North Carolina. Scenes were filmed along the Broad River where it flows into Lake Lure in Rutherford County, Dillsboro, along the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad; Waynesville, where a giant clown sign crashes through their windshield as they try to flee and where they find the baby in the stolen car is in Marshall, North Carolina; and in Asheville, at the Biltmore Estate."
"In Asheville, North Carolina, the downtown area stands in for an unnamed town in West Virginia. There, the Western Carolina University Marching Band portrays the ""All Dorothy Marching Band"" (a fictional group based upon gay icon Judy Garland's character in ""The Wizard of Oz""), at a gay pride parade."
"In his memoirs, Garner wrote that he enjoyed working with Lemmon but felt the director ""was a self appointed genius who didn't know his ass from second case and Jack and I both knew it."""
The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10.
"Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" praised the performances of Lemmon and Garner but felt the movie was ""a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities"". However, he said that ""a lot of the cheap shots are funny, and maybe the climate is wrong for sharply barbed political satire. I dunno. This is not a great comedy and will be soon forgotten, but it has nice moments."" James Berardinelli of ""ReelViews"" also complimented the actors, writing ""Lemmon and Garner slip comfortably into their roles"" and saying the movie has ""some good one-liners"", but he criticized the ""failed attempts to inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into the story"" and also felt the political satire was ""weak and obligatory"". Mick LaSalle of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" described ""My Fellow Americans"" as a ""pleasing but mediocre film, with a great cast, a great story and a misguided script."""

= = = Mr. Blotto = = =
"Mr. Blotto is a jam band from Chicago, Illinois. They blend hard rock, original rock, southern rock, folk music, and country rock. They formed in 1991, and continue to tour extensively in the midwest area. Along with their seven album releases and four DVDs, they have also released four ""official bootleg"" albums of their live recordings. Their most recent release ""Live at the Leaf"" chronicles a weekend in New Orleans playing at the legendary Maple Leaf. It was released in 2018."
"The core of Mr. Blotto is the brother songwriting team of Mike and Paul Bolger, who had played together in garage rock bands throughout high school. They went in separate directions musically when they attended different colleges, Mike leaning towards the hardcore punk stylings of Hüsker Dü, and Paul focusing on the resurgence of 70s rock like Aerosmith, while eventually discovering Crosby, Stills and Nash and the Grateful Dead, who would later become huge influences. After Paul graduated he decided to pursue the life of a full-time musician while Mike opted to become a lawyer. Paul landed a gig as the house singer in a Polish club in Chicago called ""The Cardinal Club."" It was here that Paul met guitarist Bob Georges and they decided to begin playing together."
"Earlier the Bolger brothers played in the 1980s in a group called Fred, alongside future members of the Freddy Jones Band."
"Paul and Bob found drummer Alan Baster at a jazz night, and hired him on. After several auditions for a bass player yielded no results, Paul convinced Mike to be an interim bass player. The band as a four-piece started hitting Chicago area open mic nights and outlying bars, developing their roots-oriented jamband sound and weaving a large amount of reworked Grateful Dead songs into their sets to supplement the originals being penned by Paul, Mike and Bob. As their audience grew, Mike quit being a lawyer and became a full-fledged member."
"They released Parking Karma and found their way into the larger bars and venues of the Chicago scene. After the album was released, Dave Allen - an old college bandmate of Paul's - joined on keyboards, filling out the bass-acoustic guitar-electric guitar-keyboards-drums ensemble that has remained consistent through personnel changes since."
"In addition to Piano, Synths, & Hammond B-3, Dave supplied another singing voice and an ability to improvise lyrics that complemented a long-standing element of the early Blotto show, the ""Reggae Rap,"" in which Paul would freestyle over a rock-steady type of beat."
"In the mid-90s, they released a second CD, ""Bad Hair Day,"" and continued their process of steadily playing shows in the Chicago area. By the end of the decade they had built their audience to the point that they were a significant draw at local performances and festivals."
"1998 saw a third CD, Ancient Face; in 1999 Bob Georges was replaced by Mark Hague. The introduction of Mark (who had played with the Freddy Jones Band) marked a creative period for the band, and he helped pen the next generation of Mr. Blotto tunes. Paul, Mark & Mike started meeting every Monday to work on new original ideas. In these sessions, any idea would be chased down and put to tape. These songs became Cabbages and Kings, the 4th CD which (93.1) WXRT called the band's best release yet."
"Around this time, the band addressed the constant demand for a Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog to digital converter, a distribution amplifier, and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain board patch in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often in advance of the band—this is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour."
"Seeing as not everyone had a portable CD burner or DAT, Mr. Blotto began issuing Live Shows and Compilations. The Bootleg Series is a single CD of songs handpicked by the band for their unique characteristics, where the Just Did It series is made up of double disc sets from one particular show or run of shows."
"A flashmob event known as The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever was officially created in 2016 and is held annually. Fans gather in locations around the world to recreate the ""red dress"" video."
"The song has been interpreted by comedians Steve Coogan and Noel Fielding in 2011 as part of the BBC fundraising telethon Comic Relief. Coogan sang the song in the 1999 show as part of a medley of other Bush material in character as Alan Partridge. Fielding performed to the song in the 2011 series of Let's Dance for Comic Relief, placing in the final of the competition."

= = = The Impossible Voyage = = =
"The Impossible Voyage (), originally released in the US as An Impossible Voyage and in the UK as Whirling the Worlds, is a 1904 French silent film directed by Georges Méliès. Based in part on Jules Verne's play ""Journey Through the Impossible"" and modeled in style and format on Méliès's earlier, highly successful ""A Trip to the Moon"", the film is a satire of scientific exploration in which a group of geographers attempt a journey into the interior of the sun."
"Since the film is silent and has no intertitles, the proper names and quotations below are taken from the English-language description of the film published by Méliès in the catalog of the Star Film Company's New York Branch."
"A geographic society called the Institute of Incoherent Geography plans to make a world tour in such a way as to ""surpass in conception and invention all previous expeditions undertaken by the learned world."" At a meeting headed by President Polehunter, ""assisted by Secretary Rattlebrain, by the Archivist Mole, by the Vice-president Humbug, the members of the office, Easily-fooled, Daredevil, Schemer, etc., etc.,"" the members listen to Professor Daredevil's plan for the world tour, but reject it for being out-of-date. The president then welcomes the eccentric engineer Crazyloff (in French, Mabouloff; ""maboul"" is French for ""crazy"" or ""crackpot""), who explains his project for a new ""impossible"" voyage, using ""all the known means locomotion—railroads, automobiles, dirigible balloons, submarine boats…"" The unusual plan is accepted enthusiastically, and preparations begin."
"When work is complete, the machines and travelers are loaded onto a train and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. The first board an automobile, the Auto-Crazyloff, and journey through the mountains. In an attempt to run over the summit of the Rigi, the travelers crash at the bottom of a precipice. They are saved by mountaineers and rushed to a Swiss hospital."
"After they have recovered, they board a train with their vehicles, and make a second attempt at running over a summit: this time, the Jungfrau. Getting higher and higher every minute, with dirigible balloons attached to the train, they rise into space and are swallowed by the Sun. The travelers land with a crash. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much. All but one of the travelers are loaded into an icebox but are suddenly frozen. The remaining traveler, Crazyloff himself, finds a bundle of straw among the debris and starts a fire to melt the ice. The travelers thaw and are happily moved over to the expedition's submarine, which is launched off a cliff on the Sun, plummets through space, and falls into an ocean on Earth."
"After a few minutes of underwater travel, a boiler problem causes the submarine to explode. The travelers are thrown up into the air, landing safely at a seaport amid the wreckage of the submarine. They return in triumph to the Institute of Incoherent Geography, where a grand rejoicing is held for them."
"An optional 50-meter-long epilogue, ""Supplément ""Voyage à travers l'impossible"""" (advertised in the US as ""Supplementary Section of the ""Impossible Voyage""""), was sold separately. The epilogue begins in Crazyloff's study, where he is criticized by the Institute of Incoherent Geography for losing so much transportation equipment during the voyage. At the top of the Institute's tower, he presents his plan for recovering the equipment: a powerful magnet able to attract the automobile lost in Switzerland, the train that was eaten by the Sun, and the submarine destroyed at sea. The plan is a success and is celebrated at a banquet where Crazyloff is applauded by his scientific colleagues."
"The supplementary section was believed lost until the 1970s when the Méliès scholar John Frazer discovered and examined it in the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among surviving negatives from Star Film's New York offices. However, a 2008 Méliès filmography by Jacques Malthête lists the supplement as lost."
"""The Impossible Voyage"" was made during the summer of 1904. The film, running to 374 meters, was Méliès's longest film to date, and cost about 37,500 (7,500) to make. In its staging and design, the film is symmetrical with Méliès's ""A Trip to the Moon"": while the astronomers' progress toward the moon in that film is consistently depicted as left-to-right motion, the Institute of Incoherent Geography's progress toward the sun in ""The Impossible Voyage"" is consistently right-to-left. While most of the film was shot inside Méliès's glass studio, the scene at the foot of the Jungfrau was filmed outdoors, in the garden of Méliès's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis."
"A print of the film (though not the supplemental epilogue) was deposited for American copyright at the Library of Congress on October 12, 1904, and the film was sold in French, American, and British catalogs by the Star Film Company. As with at least 4% of Méliès's entire output (including such films as ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Rajah's Dream"", ""The Kingdom of the Fairies"", and ""The Barber of Seville""), some prints were individually hand-colored and sold at a higher price."
"Genetic data indicate the ""molestus"" form in the London Underground appear to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest above-ground population. Byrne and Nichols' working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London once only – many hurdles must be overcome to become adapted to the subterranean environment, and understandably it would occur rarely. This hypothesis implies that local adaptation would be expected in different locations around Europe and beyond, as each local population evolved an offshoot that overcame the problems of living underground."
"However, more recently collected genetic evidence reported by Fonseca and others suggests a single ""C. molestus"" form has spread throughout Europe and beyond, since populations over a large area share a common genetic heritage. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest the underground form developed recently; a single mtDNA difference is shared among the underground populations of 10 Russian cities, and a single fixed microsatellite difference occurs in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the Middle East, and the Atlantic islands. This worldwide spread might have occurred after the last glaciations or may be even more recent, due to the insects hitchhiking on world trade routes; one possibility is the international secondhand tire trade. The tires retain water in which the larvae can survive, and completely removing water from an old tire can be difficult."
"Now, the persistence of hybrids in northern climates apparently may be another evolutionary problem that can be solved, but only rarely: the Fonseca paper obtained genetic evidence that the recent colonization of America by ""Culex"" mosquitoes actually involves a strain derived from a rare successful hybridization between ""C. pipiens"" and ""C. molestus"". They suggest hybridization may explain why the American form bites both birds and humans (this interpretation is controversial, see letter from Spielman ""et al."" and the response that follows it in ""Science""). The consequences of this more indiscriminate feeding hit the news in 1999 with the outbreak of human encephalitis in New York, caused by West Nile virus. It was the first documented introduction of this virus into the Western Hemisphere; perhaps because in the longer established populations, the Old World northern above-ground ""C. pipiens"" almost exclusively bites birds, with the human-biting ones being incarcerated below ground."
"""Culex molestus"" has been observed in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Its country of origin is thought to be Egypt, although it has likely spread via trade and colonial passages over the past centuries."
"In the summer of 2011, an invasion of ""Culex molestus"" appeared on the Upper West Side in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. The mosquito is well known for being commonly found in sewers of New York and thriving throughout the year feeding on humans. Residents of older brownstones found the mosquitoes coming from the underground into basements and then through air vents and other openings into their homes. The city government did not make this infestation of the pest a top priority because they tested negative for West Nile virus and because of the high cost of mosquito control."
"In Australia, ""Culex molestus"" was first recorded in the 1940s, and has since spread across all southern states, causing a significant biting nuisance in urban areas. Unlike most Australian urban mosquitos, ""molestus"" is active through all 12 months of the year. Its introduction was likely through military movements into Melbourne during World War II, and genetic studies have indicated its most likely passage was from eastern Asia and Japan. It has also been identified as a potential vector for several Australian blood-borne diseases, such as Ross River virus."

= = = Alison Saunders = = =
"Dame Alison Margaret Saunders, (born 14 February 1961) is a British barrister and a former Director of Public Prosecutions. She was the first lawyer from within the Crown Prosecution Service and the second woman to hold the appointment. She was also the first holder of this office not to be a Queen's Counsel. She was previously the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London. Her term of office ended 31 October 2018."
"Saunders was born on 14 February 1961 in Aberdeen, Scotland to Hugh Colin Brown and Margaret Bennett Brown. She attended primary school in Brixton, London and St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff. Saunders then studied at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire. She read law at the University of Leeds from 1979 to 1982. She graduated Bachelor of Laws (LLB hons)."
"Having completed her pupillage and thereby becoming a qualified barrister, Saunders began working for Lloyd's of London. She joined the newly formed CPS in 1986. In 1991, she joined the CPS policy division. She was appointed Branch Crown Prosecutor for Wood Green in 1997, and Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS London South in 1999. She took up the appointment of Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex in 2001 overseeing the case made against Roy Whiting, who was convicted of murdering Sarah Payne. Between 2003 and 2005, she served as Deputy Legal Advisor to the Attorney General. She then became head of prosecutions for the Organised Crime division of the CPS. She was the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London from 2009 until 2013. During that time, she was involved in the 2011 to 2012 retrial, and subsequent conviction, of the killers of Stephen Lawrence."
"On 23 July 2013, it was announced that she would become the new Director of Public Prosecutions in succession to Sir Keir Starmer, taking up the appointment on 1 November 2013. She was the first head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to be appointed from within the service and the second woman to hold the appointment."
"As the Director of Public Prosecutions, Saunders has faced criticism and controversy around the handling of trials for rape and sexual assault. The CPS has been criticised for the case of Eleanor de Freitas, who killed herself after the CPS decided to take over a private prosecution brought against her by the man she accused of rape. Saunders said that the ""evidence in this case was strong and having considered it in light of all of our knowledge and guidance on prosecuting sexual offences and allegedly false rape claims, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for perverting the course of justice"". Saunders has also stated that the number of rape prosecutions being brought to court will increase by a third in the year 2015 and has argued that this increase follows improvements in the treatment received by victims by police, courts and the CPS."
"In 2014, Saunders announced the CPS would be seeking to fight against criminals hiding assets abroad and appointed a team of six specialist lawyers to work with legal authorities overseas to recover assets from countries including Spain and the United Arab Emirates."
"In April 2015, Saunders was criticized for her decision not to prosecute Greville Janner on child sexual abuse charges despite his meeting the evidential test for prosecution, citing his poor health, as well as for dropping charges against nine journalists as part of the Operation Elveden case. Saunders defended herself saying, ""I’m not here to make popular decisions. I always feel under pressure to make the right decision."" In June 2015, ""The Guardian"" reported that, following a review, the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner would in fact be overturned. Simon Danczuk, then MP for Rochdale, told the Guardian that ""if the report is accurate, Saunders will now have to consider her position"" as a result of the scrutiny that her initial decision would now be placed under. The decision marks the first time a DPP has had a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. Amid calls for her resignation, she told the BBC that she would not resign. Saunders blamed failings within her department and the police for the collapse of three different police inquiries between 1991 and 2007. Theresa May (then the home secretary, later Prime Minister) said in a radio interview: “I was very concerned when I heard about this decision. It is not my decision, it is entirely a decision for the director of public prosecutions.”"
"In 2015, a case was brought against Saunders in the High Court. The Plaintiff, Nikki Kenward, argued that Saunders had amended prosecution policy outside of the democratic process. Saunders released the alleged amendment in October, 2014. In it she suggested that the guidelines on assisted suicide prosecution be understood such that a doctor who is not the patient's immediate care provider, should not be as likely to face prosecution as a doctor who is the patient's immediate care provider. This prompted a backlash from anti-assisted suicide groups who argued that this was a substantial change, which would allow for businesses similar to Dignitas to operate in the UK. Saunders' defence was that she had only clarified the existing guidelines. Nevertheless, Kenward was granted the judicial review against Saunders in April, 2015. It went to the High Court in November, 2015 where the case against Saunders was dismissed."
"As of 2018, Saunders was paid a salary of between £210,000 and £214,999."
"On 2 April 2018, it was announced that Saunders was to stand down at the end of her term as head of the CPS and on 1 November 2018 she was succeeded as Director of Public Prosecutions by Max Hill QC."
"In June 2015, Saunders was accused by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer of a crusade to criminalise ""drunken sexual encounters"". In December 2017, ""The Daily Telegraph"" journalist Allison Pearson called for Saunders to resign following the scandal of several high-profile rape cases falling apart or convictions being overturned due to police withholding key information regarding the innocence of the accused."
"On 23 January 2018, however, Saunders was criticised by victims and survivors' groups because her words could be taken to mean that silence equates to consent."
"After it was announced that Saunders would not be reappointed for a second term, ""The Daily Telegraph"" also reported in April, 2018 that crime statistics tracking burglary, violent crime and shoplifting all rose significantly under Saunders' tenure ever since she first became Director of Public Prosecutions."
"On 29 December 2018 ""The Telegraph"" reported that Alison Saunders will be ""the first former head of the Crown Prosecution Service not to receive a senior honour after her tenure was marked by a series of scandals"". (All of her predecessors ""became a knight or a dame either during their tenure, or immediately after their departure."") A week after she stepped down as head of the CPS, it was announced that the CPS had agreed to a five-figure settlement with broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree and bailed repeatedly for a year over unfounded sex charges before being told he would not be charged. Samuel Armstrong, a former Conservative MP's chief of staff who was acquitted of rape, said the settlement was a ""damning indictment"" that ""should act as the final nail in the coffin for her hopes of a damehood."" He added: ""Saunders' one-woman crusade to shift the scales of justice in sex cases not only ruined the lives of dozens of young men but of Paul Gambaccini as well."""
In 2019 Saunders joined the law firm Linklaters as Dispute Resolution Partner.
"Saunders is married to Neil Saunders, a lawyer, and has two sons."
"Saunders was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 2013 New Year Honours ""for services to Law and Order especially after the 2011 London Riots"" and Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (DCB) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to criminal justice."

"The Prophecies of Nostradamus is a 1979 television film based on the writings of Nostradamus. It was also known as ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow""."
"After this victory the whole Italian Kingdom lied on the mercy of the Hungarians. With no Italian army to oppose them, the Hungarians decided to spend the mild winter in Italy, continuing to attack monasteries, castles and cities, trying to conquer them, like they did before they had started to be chased by Berengar's army."
"On 13 December 899 they attacked Vercelli, where the bishop of Vercelli and archchancellor of the Carolingian Empire, Liutward, trying to escape them, taking with him his treasures, accidentally stumbled upon them, so he was killed and his treasures taken away. On 26 January 900 they conquered Modena, and two days later the Abbey of Nonantola, where they burned the monastery and the church, and killed monks."
"In the meantime, on 8 December 899, emperor Arnulf died in Regensburg, so the alliance between East Francia and the Principality of Hungary lost its validity. The Hungarian envoys sent from the new home of the Hungarians, the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, to negotiate the renewal of the alliance, were seen as spies by the guardian and councillor of the new king, the 6 year old Louis the Child, Hatto I, Archbishop of Mainz and his advisers, and sent home, having achieved nothing. This started a state of war between the two political communities, so the Principality of Hungary needed the Hungarian army from Italy, which, because they became an important task in the conquest of Pannonia, which was planned by the Hungarians. They had to attack the Bavarian province from South West in the same time when another Hungarian army attacked it from East."
"Before the Hungarians left Italy, in the spring of 900, they concluded peace with Berengar, who gave them in exchange for they departure hostages, and money for the peace. After this defeat, or at the latest from 904, Berengar started to pay them tribute regularly, and until his death in 924, and in exchange the Hungarians helped him against every enemies that he had. As Liuprand writes, the Hungarians became Berengar's friends. It seems that, in time, some of the Hungarian leaders became his personal friends."
"On their way back home, the Hungarians accomplished a military performance, which was never even tried by a land army in the history. Having no ships, boats or any kind of water crafts, on 29 June 900, they ""embarked"" on a sea campaign against Venice. As ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon writes that with their horses and ""leather ships"" to attack first the cities from the coast, then also the city of Venice itself. The ""leather ship"" here refer to an animal skin (goat, sheep, maybe cow) tied up to form something like a huge bota bag, filled with air, tied on their horses sides, which helped the warrior and his horse to float, with which the Hungarians and the warriors of other nomadic societies usually used to cross rivers. They first attacked and burned the coastal towns like Equilio, Cittanova, Fine, Capo d'Argine, then tying the filled animal skins to their horses, they crossed the waters of the Lagoon of Venice, and sacked the island town of Chioggia, which was a part of the Dogado (homeland of the Republic of Venice). Then on the day of the martyrdom of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (29 June), on their ""leather ships"", they tried to enter Rialto and Malamocco, but before they reached the islands, on the place called Albiola the doge of Venice Pietro Tribuno met them with the Venetian war fleet, forcing them to retreat. Although they lost this unusual sea battle, the Hungarians achieved something what was never done by a land army: attacking islands lying in the sea. And although the attack from 29 June was unsuccessful, they succeeded in the attack on the island of Chioggia. This attack was not a violation of the agreement with Berengar, because at that time Venice was not part of the Italian kingdom, but was an autonomous republic under Byzantine influence."
"Historians disagree about the route taken by which the army returned to the Hungarian lands. On one hand György Szabados believes that the Hungarian army turned back home from Italy without entering Pannonia, avoiding it from the south, because in his opinion they were exhausted of continuous fighting in Italy in the last year, and were loaded up with plunders, so they would not be capable to accomplish such an important mission. The same opinion had György Györffy too in 1974."
"On the other hand, Gyula Kristó and István Bóna think that the Hungarian army returning from Italy took part in the conquest of Pannonia, but in different ways. Kristó believes that the returning Hungarian army had the task only to plunder the land, weakening the capability of the inhabitants to withstand the final attack, then crossed the Danube, turning home, and after that two new Hungarian armies, coming from East accomplished the occupation. Bóna believes that the returning Hungarian army played an active role in the conquest of Pannonia, coming from the southwest, when other armies coming from east, from the Eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, crossed the Danube, attacking it from the north and east. He thinks that the Hungarian army came back from Italy because they received an order from home to come help in the conquering of Pannonia, accomplishing it with an encircling movement."

= = = Yarnell Hill Fire = = =
"The Yarnell Hill Fire was a wildfire near Yarnell, Arizona, ignited by lightning on June 28, 2013. On June 30, it overran and killed 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. Just one of the hotshots on the crew survived -- he was posted as a lookouot on the fire and was not with the others when the fire overtook them. The Yarnell Hill Fire was one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the 1991 East Bay Hills Fire, which killed 25 people, and the deadliest wildland fire for U.S. firefighters since the 1933 Griffith Park Fire, which killed 29 ""impromptu"" civilian firefighters drafted on short notice to help battle that Los Angeles area fire."
"Yarnell also killed more firefighters than any incident since the September 11 attacks on 9/11. That disaster killed 343 firefighters. The Yarnell Hill Fire is the sixth-deadliest American firefighter disaster in history, the deadliest wildfire ever in the state of Arizona, and (at least until 2014) was ""the most-publicized event in wildland firefighting history."""
"At 5:36 p.m. MST (23:36 UTC) on June 28, 2013, dry lightning ignited a wildfire on Bureau of Land Management lands near Yarnell, Arizona, a town of approximately 700 residents located about northwest of Phoenix. On June 30, strong winds reaching more than pushed the fire from to over . A long-term drought affecting the area contributed to the fire's rapid spread and erratic behavior, as did temperatures of ."
"By July 1, the fire had grown to over and prompted the evacuation of the nearby community of Peeples Valley. The fire was still completely uncontrolled, with more than 400 firefighters on the line. On July 2, the fire was estimated at 8% containment and had not grown in the past 24 hours. By the end of the day on July 3, the fire was reportedly 45 percent contained and not growing, thus allowing Peeples Valley residents to return to their homes on July 4. Four days later, on July 8, Yarnell residents were permitted to return. The fire was declared 100% contained on July 10."
"The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said that 127 buildings in Yarnell and two in Peeples Valley had been destroyed. A ""flash point"" of the fire was the Glen Ilah neighborhood of Yarnell, where fewer than half of the structures were burned. Officials shut down of Arizona State Route 89 shortly after the fire started, and of State Route 89 remained closed as of June 30."
"A total evacuation of Yarnell and partial evacuation of Peeples Valley was ordered. At least 600 people were under mandatory evacuation orders. An evacuation shelter was set up at Yavapai College in Prescott, with members of the Red Cross providing cots and blankets for overnight stays, along with meals and medical assistance."
"A second evacuation shelter was set up at Wickenburg High School in nearby Wickenburg, because the closure of State Route 89 made it impossible for some people to reach the first shelter. Officials from the Red Cross said that 351 people spent at least one night at one of the shelters."
"On June 30, firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire. Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots. The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters against the burnover, which reached over , but not all of the bodies were found inside them. The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1."
"The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough. He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC captain. Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew's entrapment."
"After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew."
"According to the National Fire Protection Association, it was the greatest loss of life for firefighters in a wildfire since the 1933 Griffith Park fire, the greatest loss of firefighters in the United States since the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the deadliest wildfire of any kind since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire. The number of total fatalities—although not of firefighters—has since been surpassed by California's 2018 Camp fire which killed 85 civilians."

Vice President Joe Biden, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, and the team's lone surviving firefighter, Brendan McDonough, spoke at a memorial in Prescott on Tuesday, July 9. That memorial was attended by thousands, including representatives from over 100 hotshot crews across the country, and was streamed live by several media outlets. Individual memorial services were scheduled for later in the hometowns of the 19 firefighters."
"A nine-member investigative team of forest managers and safety experts arrived in Arizona on July 2. Their mission was to ""understand what happened as completely as possible"" to prevent similar incidents. Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each hotshot, are united by chains."
"A second memorial has been placed at the intersection of State Route 89 and Hays Ranch Road in Peeples Valley. On March 3, 2019, the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football retired the No. 19 jersey in honor of the nineteen fallen Granite Mountain Hotshots."
"After the fire, the Federal Emergency Management Agency ruled that the fire did not qualify for disaster aid to homeowners because most of the homes that burned were insured. Under federal law, federal disaster relief is not available if there is insurance, and FEMA said: ""damage to uninsured private residences from this was not beyond the response and recovery capabilities of the state (and) local governments and voluntary agencies."" Brewer appealed to President Obama to overturn the decision."
"Following a three-month investigation, the state's Forestry Division released a report and briefing video on September 28, 2013, which found no evidence of negligence nor recklessness in the deaths of the 19 firefighters and revealed that an airtanker carrying flame retardant was directly overhead as the firefighters died. The investigation did find some problems with radio communications due to heavy radio traffic and the fact that some radios were not programmed with appropriate tone guards."
"On December 4, 2013, the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which oversees workplace safety, blamed the state's Forestry Division for the deaths of the 19 firefighters, based on an investigation by the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The Commission said that state fire officials knowingly put protection of property ahead of safety and should have pulled crews out earlier. The commission levied a $559,000 fine."

Brody further points out ""battles that the Hotshots’ widows have faced over health insurance, taxes, labor law, and budgets, involving the online harassment of women""."

"Niall Matter ( ; born October 20, 1980) is a Canadian-American actor."
"Following recovery from a serious accident sustained while working on an oil rig, Matter chose to pursue a full-time acting career. He received his first significant break in 2007, with a main role in teen drama ""The Best Years"". Later in the same year, he joined the cast of ""Eureka"" as bad-boy genius Zane Donovan. In 2009 he had a small supporting role in Zack Snyder's film ""Watchmen"". He went on to star as Evan Cross in the short-lived 2012 series """". His career subsequently moved away from science fiction, seeing him star in several television movies, as well as joining Canadian series such as ""Remedy"", ""Arctic Air"" and ""When Calls the Heart""."
"Born in Edmonton, Alberta, of Irish and Russian descent, Matter grew up on his parents' dairy farm. He is a third-generation oil rigger, having worked on the oil rigs in Northern Alberta for eight years. On the recommendation of a school teacher, he enrolled in drama classes at age thirteen, going on to win the Best Actor prize at a provincial drama championship in 1999. However, after getting himself in trouble at age 17, his parents sent him for a three-month stint on the oil rigs to work with his grandfather. He has acknowledged that it was this experience that helped him to focus on his studies and pass his high school exams. He continued to work on the oil rigs alongside his grandfather and brother Trevor until the age of 25, while simultaneously moving to Vancouver and attending Vancouver Film School in pursuit of his long-term goal of an acting career."
"At the age of 25 Matter had a serious accident while working on the oil rigs, where he was nearly crushed inside the cab of a 17-ton drilling rig. His quad muscle had been detached from his femur, and he nearly lost his right leg. It took six months for him to be fully rehabilitated, having to go through extensive physio therapy to fully regain his ability to walk. On returning to the oil rigs, he witnessed another accident in which a man lost both his legs. This convinced him that it was time to move on, so he quit, returning to Vancouver, where he lied his way into a bar tending job before landing his first acting role."
"Matter landed his first professional acting job in 2007 playing the lead role of baitshop owner Josh Riley in the Syfy original film ""Loch Ness Terror"", (broadcast as ""Beyond Loch Ness""), which also starred Brian Krause and Don S Davis. While filming ""Loch Ness"" he sent an audition tape to the producers of ""The Best Years"" which lead to him gaining the main cast role of bar tender, and cocaine addict, Trent Hamilton in the series first season. He went on to play the role of USAF airman Lieutenant Kemp in a two-episode guest spot on the Syfy television series ""Stargate Atlantis""."
"He subsequently auditioned for the Syfy series ""Eureka"". for what he understood was a one-episode guest star role. By his own admission, Matter took risks in the audition, playing the character as more flirtatious than he was written. The risks paid off, and he was cast in the role of bad boy genius Zane Donovan, first appearing in the season two episode ""E=MC...?"". The character would go on to develop a romantic relationship with the town's Deputy Sheriff Jo Lupo played by Erica Cerra. His role was recurring throughout seasons two and three. Season four saw a soft reboot of the show - following a time traveling incident, the characters return to an alternate timeline, with character dynamics and relationships shifting. This led to Matter's role as Zane being expanded as he became part of the main cast, which continued through to the show's fifth and final season."
"During this time, he also had guest roles on ""Warehouse 13"", portraying one half of a married couple alongside ""Eureka"" castmate Cerra and on NBC's ""Fear Itself"", playing a lovelorn zombie.

"From 2012 to 2013, Matter played the lead character of Evan Cross, a millionaire inventor searching for anomalies following the brutal killing of his wife by an Albertosaurus, in Space's science fiction series """", a spin-off of the British series ""Primeval"". In 2013, this role earned him a Constellation Award in the Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode category, for his performance in the episode ""Truth"". He was also nominated for a Leo Award in the Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series category, for the same episode. Due to low ratings, the series was not renewed for a second season."
"In March 2014, ""Deadline Hollywood"" announced that he had landed the role of Lieutenant Graden Hales in the TNT commissioned pilot of Marcia Clark's ""Guilt by Association"" alongside Julia Stiles, which TNT ultimately declined to pick up."
"He subsequently appeared in guest roles in various American and Canadian series. In CTV's ""Motive"" he played a man driven to murder in revenge for his sister's death; in the short-lived NBC series ""Constantine"" he played a father struggling to deal with the supernatural and in the TNT police procedural ""Rizzoli and Isles"" he portrayed a Detective turned murderer.

= = = Boomer Sooner = = =
"""Boomer Sooner"" is the fight song for the University of Oklahoma (OU). The lyrics were written in 1905 by Arthur M. Alden, an OU student and son of a local jeweler in Norman. The tune is taken from ""Boola Boola"", the fight song of Yale University (which was itself borrowed from an 1898 song called ""La Hoola Boola"" by Robert Allen (Bob) Cole and Billy Johnson). A year later, an additional section was appended, borrowed from the University of North Carolina's ""I'm a Tar Heel Born""."
"The phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" refers to the Land Run of 1889, in which the land around the modern university was settled. ""Boomers"" were people who campaigned for the lands to be opened (or tried to enter the lands) before passage of the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889. ""Sooners"" were land thieves who settled before the lands were officially opened, giving them an unfair advantage on finding, fencing, and claiming farm land. If the charge of early entry was proven, they would lose their claimed land."
"The OU marching band plays the fight song when the team takes the field and when the team scores a touchdown, a field goal, makes a big play, or makes a play in general. They also play it along with other fight songs while the Oklahoma defense is on the field to encourage the crowd to get loud. Some fans have informally counted it being played between 70 and 90 times a game."
"ESPN writer Doug Ward has called the combined effect of ""Boomer Sooner"" and OU's horse-drawn Sooner Schooner wagon ""as potent a one-two fight song/mascot punch as you'll find in college football."""
"On October 15, 1983 the University of Oklahoma football team visited Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Sooner squad played poorly at first, and within 10 minutes Oklahoma State was winning by a score of 20-3. A policeman escorted Gene Thrailkill, the Oklahoma band director, off the field for not having a sideline pass. Before he was forced to leave, Thrailkill shouted to the band members, ""I want you to start playing and don't stop 'til the team's ahead!"" The band complied, and played ""Boomer Sooner"" non-stop roughly 300 times. The team responded by scoring 15 unanswered points against Oklahoma State. After an OSU fumble with 1:17 left in the game, Oklahoma scored a field goal to win 21-20. OU coach Barry Switzer awarded the game ball to the band (known as ""The Pride of Oklahoma"") for the non-stop effort and labeled it ""The Day The Pride Won""."
"AEW commentator and Oklahoma native Jim Ross uses the fight song as his entrance theme. He also often uses the phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" to signify a good moment."
"In recent years, ""Boomer Sooner"" has been adopted as a chant at Sooner football and basketball games. One side of Owen Field or the Lloyd Noble Center chants ""Boomer!"" with the other side chanting ""Sooner!"" The chant has frequently been heard at recent Heisman Trophy presentations, led by 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims."
"The tune of the song is also used for Albania's popular national song, ""Shqipëri, atdhe i dashur!"" (""Albania, dear fatherland!""), also known as the Alphabet Hymn. The tune was borrowed by Parashqevi Qiriazi, who penned patriotic lyrics to fit it, after the historic Congress of Manastir which decided the Albanian alphabet."
= = = Larry Tanenbaum = = =
Lawrence M. Tanenbaum (born 1945) is a Canadian businessman and chairman of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). He owns a 25% stake in MLSE through his holding company Kilmer Sports Inc.
"Tanenbaum was born to a Jewish family, son of Max (owner of York Steel) and Anne Tanenbaum. and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Cornell University in 1968."
"The family's patriarch, Abraham Tanenbaum, left Parczew, Poland, north of Lublin, for New York in 1911. Two Toronto-bound friends from the same town persuaded Abraham to join them. Shortly after arriving in Toronto, Abraham was driving a horse and cart through residential and industrial areas of Toronto looking for scrap metal. By 1914, just before the war in Europe, Abraham had saved enough to bring his wife, Chippa Sura, and two young sons Joseph and Max to accompany him in Toronto. Abraham prospered and constructed the Runnymede Iron and Steel Company into a major steel fabrication company and real estate empire. His son, Max, who founded his own company, York Steel, had seven children, among them Larry, who studied economics at Cornell University."
"Tanenbaum is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as president and CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction, Kilmer developed into a multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries covered road building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer's road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer's wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited."
"Tanenbaum served as chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada's largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren's activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America's largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As a result of this merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the board and chaired its finance committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA."
"Today, Kilmer's roots in construction are expressed through innovative real estate development and leading edge public private partnerships (P3). Its Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund reclaims contaminated land in the urban context, through sophisticated risk management and optimizing for highest and best use. Its Kilmer Developments is currently managing three P3's: The Quickload Container Examination Facility in Prince Rupert, B.C.; the 20 Ontario Highway Service Centre locations under the ONroute banner, in partnership with HMS Host and Canadian Tire; and in partnership with Dream, designed, financed and constructed the 2015 Pan Am Games Athletes’ Village, which has been converted into condominiums as part of the Canary District Project. Kilmer is also part of the consortium that has acquired the passenger terminal operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport."
"Kilmer has a long history of private equity investment, beginning in 1975 as a significant shareholder of CUC Broadcasting, where Tanenbaum served on the board of directors and the executive committee of the company. At the time of its sale in 1994 CUC was Canada's fifth largest cable company, with operations that included paging, publishing, satellite, and radio broadcasting."
"Most recently, Kilmer, in partnership with Heartland Coca-Cola Bottling out of Kansas, acquired the Coca-Cola bottling and distribution operations for all of Canada. The new operation, Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited, is owned by Tanbridge Partners LP, of which Tanenbaum is co-chairman."
"Kilmer's other current private equity investments include Chaleur Sawmills Limited Partnership, Fornebu Lumber Company Inc. and Cypress Five Star Inc., the Canadian franchisee of Five Guys Burgers and Blaze Pizza."
"In addition to its direct investing activities, in 2000 Kilmer founded Kilmer Capital Partners Limited, a private equity investment fund manager, which established two funds to provide equity capital to small and mid-market companies. Tanenbaum is chairman of Kilmer Capital. Kilmer Capital's investments have included Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp., McGregor Industries Inc., Unisync Corp. Inc., Vansco Electronics Ltd., Atelka Enterprises Inc., Altasciences Inc., Compact Power Inc. and Tribal Sportswear."
"Tanenbaum recently served as a member of the advisory council, Toronto Board of Trade. He also served as a member of the Ontario Investment and Trade Advisory Council; as a member of the advisory committee, Toronto Prosperity Initiative; and as a member of the independent fiscal review panel of the City of Toronto; and the Mayor's Economic Competitiveness Advisory Committee of the City of Toronto."
"Tanenbaum has had a long-standing interest in the sports and entertainment area and to that end in 1991 he spearheaded the effort to bring an NBA franchise to Toronto. In 1996 an interest was acquired in the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and arena. In 1998 Tanenbaum was an active force in the acquisition of the Toronto Raptors basketball team and the Scotiabank Arena, which, with the Toronto Maple Leafs formed Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. Tanenbaum is chairman of MLSE, chairman of the board of the National Basketball Association, and a governor and member of the executive committee of the National Hockey League, the NBA, and Major League Soccer (Toronto FC professional soccer club, which MLSE also owns). He is Co-Chair – Toronto 2026 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the board of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario."
"Prior to joining Belle & Sebastian, Jackson was a member of the now-defunct The Moondials, a band that released a single on Electric Honey, a label that would later issue Belle & Sebastian's first album, ""Tigermilk"". The Moondials experience was a pleasant one for Jackson, and it took a great deal of work for nominal Belle & Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch to convince him to join his group. At the time, Murdoch was playing the open mic circuit in Glasgow as a solo act, and it was at one of these performances, at The Halt Bar, that Jackson first saw Murdoch play."
"In the beginning, Belle & Sebastian existed mostly as an outlet for Murdoch's songwriting. Since the band's third album, ""The Boy With The Arab Strap"", other members have begun to contribute, Jackson chief amongst them. All of the band's subsequent full-lengths have featured compositions by Jackson, and he wrote the band's 2001 single ""Jonathan David"" as well as ""To Be Myself Completely"" for 2006's ""The Life Pursuit""."
"In 2012 Jackson, accompanied by members of the Glasgow band The Wellgreen, recorded a version of George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"" for a fundraising cd titled ""Super Hits Of The Seventies"" for US radio station WFMU. Jackson has undertaken several collaborative works with Roy Moller."

"Christopher B. Galvin (born March 21, 1950) is an American businessman. He served as the chairman and chief executive officer of Motorola from 1997 to 2003."
"Christopher Galvin is the grandson of Paul Galvin, the founder of Motorola, and the son of Robert Galvin, who served as CEO of Motorola from 1959 to 1990. He received his BS in political science from Northwestern University and his M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University."
"From 1967 to 1973, during college, Galvin held part-time summer assignments at Motorola. From 1973 to 1983, he served full-time positions in sales, sales management, marketing management and mobile two-way radio product management, taking leave 1975–77 to attend graduate business school full-time. From 1983 to 1985, he became marketing director then general manager of the Tegal semiconductor equipment unit owned by Motorola Inc. In 1985, he became vice-president and director of Motorola's radio paging Division, where he sponsored the team that created one of the first virtually completely automated manufacturing operations in the US, called Project Bandit. Galvin was promoted to corporate vice-president and general manager of paging. In 1988, he was named chief corporate staff officer of the corporation, later senior vice president and appointed to the Policy and Operating Committees of Motorola Inc. In 1990, he was promoted to assistant chief operating officer and joined as the third member of the office of the CEO of Motorola Inc. In 1993, he was elevated to president and chief operating officer. In 1997, he became CEO. In 1999, he added the role of chairman of the board to that of CEO."
"Following the dot.com crash in 2000, he led a massive three-year restructuring of Motorola that included large lay-offs, closure of manufacturing facilities and reducing break-even costs. Simultaneously, Galvin led the renewal of Six Sigma Quality through Digital Six Sigma and introduced Motorola's MOTO language advertising campaign in 2002. The RAZR cellular phone was designed by Galvin's innovators in new product development methodologies created during the 2001–2003 timeframe. RAZR was introduced July 27, 2004. The innovations behind the RAZR was so cutting edge that even Galvin's eventual successor, Ed Zander, stated “There was a small team developing the RAZR before I got there. When I saw the technology, it blew me away.”"
"On September 19, 2003, the board of directors announced publicly it would seek another CEO. Galvin stated his objection to the board's view of Galvin's turnaround efforts, and stated, ""The Board and I do not share the same view of the pace, strategy and progress at this stage of the turnaround.”"
"Sixteen working days later, on October 13, 2003, Motorola Inc. reported that its global customer new product orders were up 25% company-wide and up 44% for cellular mobile phones in Q3 2003 compared to Q3 2002. Similarly, on January 20, 2004, Motorola Inc. reported on Galvin's last full quarter serving as CEO and the quarter of the board's search for a new CEO, Q4 2003, that Motorola's collection of global telecom, semiconductor, automotive, broadband-media and public safety customers increased new product line orders by 42% and by 64% in their cellular mobile phone business compared to Q4 2002."
"He was forced to resign on January 4, 2004. Seventy-seven working days later, on April 20, 2004, Motorola announced its financial performance for Q1, 2004, the quarter of Galvin's departure. The data showed that the then $30 billion run rate in annual revenue resulted in a 42% increase in sales corporatewide revenue growth, a 532% improvement in operating earnings, $0.9B in pre-tax earnings, $0.7B in free cash flow, and a resulting $0.9B net cash position on the balance sheet. Motorola Inc.’s cellular mobile phone business recorded an uptick of 67% sales revenue growth ($4.1B in quarterly sales) and earned a 9.8% operating margin for the period, three months before the RAZR phone was to be announced. At the time Motorola Inc.’s business portfolio included four Fortune 500 sized multi-billion business sectors compared to its six business sectors at the time. Zander, who assumed the CEO role on January 5, 2004, stated after the announcement of Q1 2004 financial results ""The first 90 days I talked to everybody. My agenda was very simple: learning the business as fast as I could. I did not want to shoot from the hip."""
"The following quarter, the financial performance initiated by Galvin proved sustainable and repeatable. On July 20, 2004, Motorola reported Q2 2004 results of increased sales revenue growth by 41% to $8.7B, an improvement in operating earnings by 394%, $800 M in pre-tax earnings, $800 M in free cash flow, and a $1.8B net cash position on the balance sheet. The cellular mobile phone business recorded an increased sales revenue growth of 67%, equating to $3.9B in quarterly sales while maintaining a 10.2% operating margin."
"In 2008, several years after Galvin's departure, a study was completed by the Monitor-Global Business Network consulting company to identify and compare the best + $5B in revenue global high tech corporate turnarounds since 1990. In comparing six-year periods including three years of turnaround actions and the corresponding companies’ resulting financial performance, the study placed Galvin's turnaround of Motorola as one of the top five large high tech turnarounds. The companies compared were IBM, Apple, Xerox, HP and Motorola."
"In 2010, he was featured in the Andrea Redmond book ""Comebacks: Powerful Lessons from Leaders Who Endured Setbacks and Recaptured Success on Their Terms"" (), which details his unplanned departure from Motorola, and how he responded."
"In 2014 Alan Murray, deputy managing editor and executive editor, online for ""The Wall Street Journal"", posted his review of ""Boards that Lead"", published by Harvard Business Review Press. The authors were Ram Charan, business advisor, Dennis Carey, vice chairman of Korn Ferry, and Michael Useem, professor at the Wharton Business School. Murray wrote, “Not all the book’s examples are success stories. Inevitably, Messrs. Charan, Carey and Useem devote a few pages to monumental failures. The authors tell the story of the board of Motorola Inc., which the authors blame for destroying the company. In 2004, it pushed out CEO Christopher Galvin (a grandson of the founder) just as his strategy was starting to deliver success, then replaced him with CEOs who enjoyed some early successes based on Mr. Galvin’s efforts, and then presided over the company’s decline and breakup.” The authors attribute this blunder to not backing a bet on solid technology or strategy, of which investment in technology had been the heart and soul of the Motorola culture, and having a reflexive response to the demands of investors, some of whom where short-term traders."
"After departing Motorola, he served as chairman of Navteq Inc. (2004–2008). In mid-2004 Navteq Inc. went public with an IPO. In July 2008, Navteq closed a $8.1B gross cash sale to Nokia generating a positive 255% return to shareholders in at the time of Navteq's IPO."
"Prior to Cleversafe's sale to IBM in late 2015, Galvin was chairman of Cleversafe Inc., a digital storage company. IBM paid more than $1.3 billion in cash acquire Cleversafe Inc., thereby adding data-storage software that works for both public and private cloud-computing systems. This was IBM's largest deal in 2015."
"In 2005, he co-founded Harrison Street Real Estate Capital LLC, a real estate private equity firm, with his brother Michael P. Galvin and Christopher N. Merrill. Harrison Street Real Estate has launched a series of focused and differentiated closed-end opportunity funds. The company's focus is investing in sectors of the real estate market that have their own compelling demand generators.

= = = Earl of Bellomont = = =
"Earl of Bellomont, in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came on 9 December 1680 when Charles Kirkhoven, 1st Baron Wotton, was made Earl of Bellomont. He had already been created Baron Wotton, of Wotton in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England on 31 August 1650. He was childless and both titles became extinct on his death in 1683."
"The second creation came on 2 November 1689 Richard Coote, 2nd Baron Coote, later Governor of New York, was made Earl of Bellomont. He was the son of Richard Coote, who had been created Lord Coote, Baron of Coloony, in the County of Sligo, in the Peerage of Ireland on 6 September 1660. Lord Coote was a younger son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and the younger brother of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath (see Coote baronets for more information on this branch of the family). Lord Bellomont was succeeded by his elder son, Nanfan, the second Earl, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the third Earl. The earldom became extinct when the latter died without surviving male issue in 1766."
"The late Earl was succeeded in the barony of Coote by his first cousin once removed, Charles Coote, who became the fifth Baron. Charles was the son of Charles Coote (1695–1750), Member of Parliament for County Cavan, son of the Honourable Thomas Coote, a Justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), younger son of the first Baron. On 4 September 1767 the earldom of Bellomont was created for the third time when Charles was made Earl of Bellomont (although the title was probably erroneously spelled ""Bell""a""mont"" in the letters patent). On 18 May 1774 Lord Bellomont was created a Baronet, of Donnybrooke in the County of Dublin, in the Baronetage of Ireland, with remainder to his illegitimate son Charles Coote. On his death in 1800 the barony and earldom became extinct as he left no surviving legitimate male issue. He was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his illegitimate son, Charles, the second Baronet (see Coote baronets for further history of this title)."

"He was the editor of ""Molecular Physics"" for 11 years."
"He has directed 123 Ph.D. students, as well as many postdoctoral associates and visiting professors, now working at 42 academic institutions around the world."
"Research within the Schaefer group involves the use of computational hardware and theoretical methods to solve problems in molecular quantum mechanics. His contributions to the field of quantum chemistry include a paper challenging, on theoretical grounds, the geometry of triplet methylene as assigned by Nobel Prize-winning experimentalist Gerhard Herzberg; the development of the Z-vector method simplifying certain calculations of correlated systems; and a wide body of work undertaken in his research group on the geometries, properties, and reactions of chemical systems using highly accurate ""ab initio"" quantum chemical techniques. Many of these papers have predicted, or forced a reinterpretation of, experimental results."
"Schaefer was awarded the American Chemical Society's ACS Award in Pure Chemistry in 1979 ""for the development of computational quantum chemistry into a reliable quantitative field of chemistry and for prolific exemplary calculations of broad chemical interest"". The Pure Chemistry Award is given to the outstanding chemist in America under the age of 35. In 1983 he received the Leo Hendrik Baekeland award for the most distinguished North American chemist under the age of 40. In 1992, he was awarded the Centenary Prize of the Royal Society of Chemistry, London, with a citation that included ""the first theoretical chemist successfully to challenge the accepted conclusion of a distinguished experimental group for a polyatomic molecule, namely methylene."""
"In 2003, Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Award in Theoretical Chemistry and the Ira Remsen Award of Johns Hopkins University. In 2004, a six-day conference was convened in Gyeongju, Korea on the “Theory and Applications of Computational Chemistry: A Celebration of 1000 Papers of Professor Henry F. Schaefer III.” Schaefer was honored with the $10,000 Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in 2005 by the University of Wisconsin's Theoretical Chemistry Institute, joining a distinguished list of some of the best-known scientists in the field."
"In 2011 Schaefer received the prestigious Ide P. Trotter Prize of Texas A&M University. Previous recipients of the Trotter Prize include Nobelists Francis Crick, Charles Townes, Steven Weinberg, William Phillips, and Roald Hoffmann."
"In 2012 he received a Humboldt Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, and on March 29, 2012 he received the $20,000 SURA Distinguished Scientist Award, given to the outstanding scientist in any field in the 17 southern states of the US, for fulfilling SURA's mission of fostering excellence in scientific research."
In 2013 Schaefer received the Chemical Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Chemists.
"On March 18, 2014, Professor Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Peter Debye Award in Physical Chemistry."
"In March 2015, Professor Schaefer was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Research Society of India. He returned to India to give his CRSI Honorary Fellow award lecture on February 6, 2016, at Panjab University in Chandigahr."
"Schaefer received the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal on May 8, 2019."
"Schaefer is also an active Protestant Christian educator who regularly speaks to university audiences (over 500 to date), Christian groups and the public on science/faith issues. In 2003, he published ""Science and Christianity: Conflict or Coherence?"", a collection of essays and talks on the subject. A second edition appeared in 2016. He is a member of the Christian Faculty Forum at the University of Georgia."
"On January 25. 2008, Schaefer was invited to present a lecture entitled 'The Big Bang, Stephen Hawking and God' at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, during TECHFEST, Asia's largest technology festival. This evoked a response from a group of six atheist students in the form of handbills. Schaefer was, however, invited to return to IIT Bombay to present an Institute Lecture in February 2014. In 2016, Schaefer was again invited to present a plenary lecture at TECHFEST. His lecture on December 17, ""The Life of a Scientist,"" was presented to a large audience without incident. On December 14, 2018, Schaefer gave another plenary lecture at TECHFEST."
"There has been some controversy concerning the designation of Schaefer as a ""five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize."" The original source of this estimate is a December 23, 1991 cover article from U.S. News & World Report."
"The names of nominees and other information about the Nobel nomination process cannot be revealed for 50 years following the nomination discussions, so such a designation is speculative."
= = = Cubbon Park = = =
"Cubbon Park, officially called Sri Chamarajendra Park is a landmark 'lung' area of Bengaluru city, located () within the heart of the city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief Engineer of Mysore state, it covered an area of and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported now is about . It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts."
"This public park was first named as Meade’s Park after Sir John Meade, the acting Commissioner of Mysuru in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State, in 1927, the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), during whose rule the park came into existence."
"The landscaping in the park creatively integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive bamboos, with grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment. Tourists visiting this park in the city of Bengaluru have nicknamed the city itself as 'Garden City'."
The importance of the park to the city's environment is best stated by two urban architects who have won the national competition to design 'Freedom Park'.
"The park is accessible from M.G. Road, Kasturba road, Hudson Circle and Ambedkar Veedhi (Road). The motorable roads which run through the park are allowed for light motor vehicles only. All locations of the park are accessible through walking paths."
The Park is open to the public at all times but the roads around the park are closed for traffic from 5:00 to 8:00 am every day to provide more safety and fresh environment for morning walkers and exercisers.
Indigenous and exotic botanical species found in the park are about 68 genera and 96 species with a total of around 6000 plants/trees. Indigenous species found in the park are:
"artocarpus, cassia fistula, ficus, polyalthias etc., and exotic species such as araucaria, bamboo, castanospermum australe, grevillea robusta, millettia, peltophorum, schinus molle, swietenia mahagoni, tabebuia. sp etc."
"Amongst the ornamental and flowering exotic trees lining the roads in the park are the Grevillea robusta (silver oak)—the first oaks introduced to Bangalore from Australia—and the delonix or the gulmohar tree (bright red flowers with long petals) along the Cubbon road in the park, which is a widely cultivated tropical ornamental tree around the world."
"The avenue of araucarias along with canna beds on either sides of the road from the Central Public Library to Hudson circle, avenue of Swieteninas in the Northern side of the park, the Java fig avenue along the road leading to the Government Museum, polyalthia avenue along the road from Queen Victoria’s statue to King Edward VII's statue and the chestnut tree avenue from the Chamarajendra statue to Siddalingaiah circle are testimony to the botanical richness of the park. Other attractions at the Park are the Ringwood circle, lotus pond and bamboo grove nook."
"The formal gardens, from the central hall of the original Attara Kacheri (means 18 government offices) now the Karnataka High Court, extends along the ceal promenade developed symmetrically with avenues, to the Museum building. Another impressive artistic structure is Iyer Hall, which houses the Central Library with a rose garden as a frontage. It is undisputedly the largest public library in the state as evidenced by the college students thronging to read here, and has the world's most extensive collection of Braille books. Other buildings located within or at the periphery of the park are 1) the Indira Priyadarshini Children’s Library, 2) the Venkatappa Art Gallery, 3) the Aquarium (stated to be the second largest in India), 4) the YMCA, 5) Yuvanika — the State Youth Centre, 6) Century Club, 7) Press Club, 8) Jawahar Bal Bhavan, 9) Tennis Pavilion, 10) the Cheshire Dyer Memorial Hall and 11) the Ottawa Chatter."
"A bandstand, in an octagonal shape made with cast-iron, was built in the early part of the 1900s. Before India’s Independence, the British Royal Air Force used to play western band music at the band stand every Saturday evening."
"An attraction for children is the well planned children's amusement park as part of Jawahar Bal Bhavan, which has the toy train, Puttani Express that runs (0.75 miles or 1.2 km) within the Park, the Doll museum and a boating facility. A 20-million-year-old fossilized tree — a gift from the Geological Survey of India, is also reported at the park."
"Memorials in the form of marble statues in honour of Queen Victoria (installed in 1906), King Edward VII (installed in 1919), Major General Sir Mark Cubbon, Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (installed in 1927) and Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer (installed (in 1913) are seen located in front of the historical buildings within the park."
"Unlike the Indo-European languages, the native Semitic name for Syria has always been distinct from Assyria. During the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC), Neo-Sumerian Empire (2119–2004 BC) and Old Assyrian Empire (1975–1750 BC) the region which is now Syria was called ""The Land of the Amurru"" and ""Mitanni"", referring to the Amorites and the Hurrians. Beginning from the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1020 BC), and also in the Neo Assyrian Empire (935–605 BC) and the succeeding Neo-Babylonian Empire (605–539 BC) and Achaemenid Empire (539–323 BC), Syria was known as Aramea and later Eber Nari. The term ""Syria"" emerged only during the 9th century BC, and was only used by Indo-Anatolian and Greek speakers, and solely in reference to ""Assyria""."
"According to Tsereteli, the Georgian equivalent of ""Assyrians"" appears in ancient Georgian, Armenian and Russian documents, making the argument that the nations and peoples to the east and north of Mesopotamia knew the group as Assyrians, while to the West, beginning with Luwian, Hurrian and later Greek influence, the Assyrians were known as Syrians."
"Historically, the Syriac Christians have been referred to as ""Syrian"", ""Aramean"", ""Chaldean"", and ""Assyrian""."
"Purely theological terms such as Nestorian, ""Jacobite"" and Chaldean Catholic referred only to specific groups. ""Nestorian"" emerged after the Nestorian Schism that followed the First Council of Ephesus in 431 AD, ""Jacobite"" after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD, and ""Chaldean Catholic"" only in the late 18th century AD, subsequent to groups in northern Iraq breaking from the Church of the East. These three terms are solely denominational, and not ethnic in any sense, and were applied to Syriac Christians by Europeans."
"The historical English term for the group is ""Syrians"" (as in, e.g., Ephraim the Syrian). It is still in use, not only in India, where it is applied especially to the various groups of Saint Thomas Christians, but also generally, although, after the 1936 declaration of the Syrian Arab Republic, the term ""Syrian"" has come also to designate citizens of that state regardless of ethnicity, with Syriac-Arameans and Assyrians only being indigenous ethnic minorities within that nation. The designation ""Assyrians"" has also become current in ""English"" besides the traditional ""Syrians"" since the late 19th century and particularly after the Assyrian genocide and the resulting Assyrian independence movement."
"The adjective ""Syriac"" properly refers to the Syriac language (founded in 5th century BC Assyria) exclusively and is not a demonym. The OED explicitly still recognizes this usage alone:"
"Etymologically, it is generally accepted that the term ""Syrian"" (and thus derivatives such as ""Syriac"") derive from ""Assyrian"". The 21st-century discovery of the Çineköy Inscription appears to conclusively prove the already largely prevailing position that the term ""Syria"" derives from the Assyrian term ""Aššūrāyu"". (see Etymology of Syria)."
"The noun ""Syriac"" (plural ""Syriacs"") has nevertheless come into common use as a demonym following the declaration of the Syrian Arab Republic to avoid the ambiguity of ""Syrians"". Limited ""de facto"" use of ""Syriacs"" in the sense of ""authors writing in the Syriac language"" in the context of patristics can be found even before World War I. Many modern scholars similarly use ""Aramaic"" a linguistic term without prejudicing particular identities."
"Since the 1980s, a dispute between, on the one hand, the East Aramaic speaking Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians, who are indigenous Christians from northern Iraq, northwestern Iran, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria and the Caucasus, and derive their national identity from the Bronze and Iron Age Assyria. On the other hand, the now largely Arabic-speaking, but previously West Aramaic speaking Arameans, who are mainly from central, south, west and northwestern Syria, south-central Turkey, and Israel, emphasizing their descent from the Levantine Arameans instead) has become ever more pronounced. In the light of this dispute, the traditional English designation ""Assyrians"" has come to appear taking an Assyrianist position, for which reason some official sources in the 2000s have come to use emphatically neutral terminology, such as ""Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac"" in the US census, and ""Assyrier/Syrianer"" in the Swedish census."
"Another distinction can be made: unlike the Assyrians, who emphasize their non-Arab ethnicity and have historically sought a state of their own, some urban Chaldean Catholics are more likely to assimilate into Arab identity. Other Chaldeans, particularly in America, identify with the ancient Chaldeans of Chaldea rather than the Assyrians. In addition, while Assyrians self-define as a strictly Christian nation, Aramaic organizations generally accept that Islamic Arameans exist and that many Muslims in historic Aramea were converts (forced or voluntary) from Christianity to Islam. An exception to the near-extinction of Western Aramaic are the Lebanese Maronite speakers of Western Neo-Aramaic, however, they largely identify with the Phoenicians (the ancient people of Lebanon) and not Arameans. Some Muslim Lebanese nationalists espouse Phoenician identity as well."
"In the Aramaic language, the dispute boils down to the question of whether ""Sūrāyē/Sūryāyē"" (""Syrian"") or ""Āṯūrāyē"" (""Assyrian"") is the preferred use, or whether they are used synonymously, with Assyrians using them interchangeably."
"During the 2000 United States census, Syriac Orthodox Archbishops Cyril Aphrem Karim and Clemis Eugene Kaplan issued a declaration that their preferred English designation is ""Syriacs"". The official census avoids the question by listing the group as ""Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac"". Some Maronite Christians also joined this US census (as opposed to Lebanese American)."
"In Sweden, this name dispute has its beginning when immigrants from Turkey, belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church emigrated to Sweden during the 1960s and were applied with the ethnic designation ""Assyrians"" by the Swedish authorities. This caused many from outside Iraq who preferred the indigenous designation Suryoyo (who today go by the name Syrianer) to protest, which led to the Swedish authorities began using the double term assyrier/syrianer."
"An Assyrian identity is today maintained by followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Assyrian Evangelical Church, and Eastern Aramaic speaking communities of the Syriac Orthodox Church (particularly in northern Iraq, north eastern Syria and south eastern Turkey) and to a much lesser degree the Syriac Catholic Church. Those identifying with Assyria, and with Mesopotamia in general, tend to be Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic speaking Christians from northern Iraq, north eastern Syria, south eastern Turkey and north west Iran, together with communities that spread from these regions to neighbouring lands such as Armenia, Georgia, southern Russia, Azerbaijan and the ""Western World""."
"The Assyrianist movement originated in the 19th to early 20th centuries, in direct opposition to Pan-Arabism and in the context of Assyrian irredentism. It was exacerbated by the Assyrian Genocide and Assyrian War of Independence of World War I. The emphasis of Assyrian antiquity grew ever more pronounced in the decades following World War II, with an official Assyrian calendar introduced in the 1950s, taking as its era the year 4750 BC, the purported date of foundation of the city of Assur and the introduction of a new Assyrian flag in 1968. Assyrians tend to be from Iraq, Iran, southeast Turkey, northeast Syria, Armenia, Georgia, southern Russia and Azerbaijan, as well as in diaspora communities in the US, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Sweden, Netherlands etc."
"Assyrian continuity, the idea that the modern Christians of Mesopotamia are descended from the Ancient Assyrians, is supported by Assyriologists H.W.F. Saggs, Robert D. Biggs, and Simo Parpola, Tom Holland and Iranologist Richard Nelson Frye. It is denied by historian John Joseph, himself a modern Assyrian, and Semitologist Aaron Michael Butts,"
"Eastern Syriac Christians are on record, but only from the late nineteenth century, calling themselves ""Aturaye"", Assyrians, and the region now in Iraq, northeast Syria and southeast Turkey was still known as Assyria (Athura, Assuristan) until the 7th century AD."
"Writing in 1844, the year following the first press reports of the magnificent Assyrian palace reliefs discovered by Paul-Émile Botta and Austen Henry Layard, the first inklings of which had been made known to the West by Claudius Rich in 1836, Horatio Southgate commented that in 1841 he had found that Armenians referred to those whom he called ""the Syrians"" (the West Syriacs of the Syriac Orthodox Church, as distinct from the East Syriacs of the Church of the East, whom he called ""Nestorians"" or ""Chaldeans"", as distinct from those he called ""Papal Chaldeans"") as ""Assouri"", a name that Southgate associated with the ancient Assyrians: ""I began to make inquiries for the Syrians. The people informed me that there were about one hundred families of them in the town of Kharpout, and a village inhabited by them on the plain. I observed that the Armenians did not know them under the name which I used, ""Syriani""; but called them ""Assouri"", which struck me the more at the moment from its resemblance to our English name ""Assyrians"", from whom they claim their origin, being sons, as they say, of Assour, (Asshur,) who 'out of the land of Shinar went forth, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resin between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city'."" In reality, ""Assouri"" means simply Syrian, the Armenian word for ""Assyrian"" is ""Asorestants’i"". This shows that in the mid-nineteenth century Jacobite Syrian Christians, while not self-identifying as Assyrians, considered themselves of Assyrian descent, although systematic use of ""Assyrians"" to mean Syriac Christians appears for the first time in the context of an effort by the ""Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission to the Assyrian Christians"" to avoid using the term ""Nestorian"" for the members of the Church of the East not in communion with Rome."
"Southgate indicates elsewhere that, while he calls the West Syrian churches ""Jacobite"" and ""Syrian Catholic"" and uses the national term ""Syrian"" for both conjointly, the East Syrians are ""Chaldeans"" (their traditional national term) or ""Nestorians"". The Chaldeans, he says, consider that they themselves are descended from the Assyrians and that the Jacobites are descended ""from the Syrians, whose chief city was Damascus""."
"The term ""Syriac"" was historically taken mainly as a linguistic (Syriac language) and liturgical (Syriac rite) term, referring to Neo-Aramaic-speaking Christians from the Near East in general. In an ethnic sense, Syriac Christians identified as ""Assyrian"", ""Aramean"", or ""Syrian"", but in light of the use of the term ""Syrian"" as a demonym for residents of the Syrian Arab Republic, some Syriac Christians have also advocated the term ""Syriac"" as an ethnic identifier, particularly members of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church' and to a much lesser degree, the Maronite Church, in a way of preserving their historic endonym while distinguishing themselves from Arab Syrians. Those self-identifying as ""Syriacs"" tend to be from western, northwestern, southern, and central Syria, as well as south-central Turkey."
"In 2000, the Holy Synod of the Syriac Orthodox Church ruled that in English this church should be called ""Syriac"" after its official liturgical Syriac language (i.e. Syriac Orthodox Church)."
"Organisations such as the Syriac Union Party in Lebanon and Syriac Union Party in Syria, as well as the European Syriac Union, espouse a Syriac identity. Syriac identity has become closely merged with the Aramean identity in some quarters, whilst being accepted by Assyrians also, due to the etymological origin of the term."
"What is now referred to as Biblical Aramaic was until recently called Chaldaic or Chaldee, and East Syrian Christians, whose liturgical language was and is a form of Aramaic, were called Chaldeans, as an ethnic, not a religious term. Hormuzd Rassam applied the term ""Chaldeans"" to the ""Nestorians"", those not in communion with Rome, no less than to the Catholics. He stated that ""the present Chaldeans, with a few exceptions, speak the same dialect used in the Targum, and in some parts of Ezra and Daniel, which are called 'Chaldee'."""
"Until at least the mid-nineteenth century, the name ""Chaldean"" was the ethnic name for all the area's Christians, whether in or out of communion with Rome. William Francis Ainsworth, whose visit was in 1840, spoke of the non-Catholics as ""Chaldeans"" and of the Catholics as ""Roman-Catholic Chaldeans"". For those Chaldeans ""who retained their ancient faith"", Ainsworth said, the name ""Nestorian"" was invented in 1681 to distinguish them from those in communion with Rome. A little later, Austen Henry Layard also used the term ""Chaldean"" even for those he also called Nestorians. The same term had earlier been used by Richard Simon in the seventeenth century, writing: ""Among the several Christian sects in the Middle East that are called Chaldeans or Syrians, the most sizeable is that of the Nestorians"". As indicated above, Horatio Southgate, who said that the members of the Syriac Orthodox Church (West Syrians) considered themselves descendants of Asshur, the second son of Shem, called the members of the divided Church of the East Chaldeans and Papal Chaldeans."
"""Chaldean"" was the term used, much earlier, to speak of the Christians from northern Mesopotamia who entered an ephemeral union with the Catholic Church in Cyprus in the 15th century, and those who in their ancestral towns entered into communion with the Catholic Church between the 16th and 18th centuries."
"As indicated above, it was only towards the end of the 19th century that the term ""Assyrian"" became accepted, largely through the influence of the ""Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission to the Assyrian Christians"", at first as a replacement for the term ""Nestorian"", but later as an ethnic description. Today, even members of the Chaldean Catholic Church accept ""Assyrian"" as an indication of nationality, while ""Chaldean"" has for them become instead an indication of religious confession. Raphael Bidawid, patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church from 1989 to 2003 stated: ""When a portion of the Church of the East became Catholic in the 17th Century, the name given was ‘Chaldean’ based on the Magi kings who were believed by some to have come from what once had been the land of the Chaldean, to Bethlehem. The name ‘Chaldean’ does not represent an ethnicity, just a church... We have to separate what is ethnicity and what is religion... I myself, my sect is Chaldean, but ethnically, I am Assyrian."" Before becoming patriarch, he said in an interview with the ""Assyrian Star"" newspaper: ""Before I became a priest I was an Assyrian, before I became a bishop I was an Assyrian, I am an Assyrian today, tomorrow, forever, and I am proud of it."""
"That was a sea change from the earlier situation, when ""Chaldean"" was a self-description by prelates not in communion with Rome: ""Nestorian patriarchs occasionally used 'Chaldean' in formal documents, claiming to be the 'real Patriarchs' of the whole 'Chaldean Church'."""
"""Assyro-Chaldeans"", a combination of the newer term ""Assyrian"" and the older ""Chaldean"", was used in the Treaty of Sèvres, which spoke of ""full safeguards for the protection of the Assyro-Chaldeans and other racial or religious minorities""."
"The Chaldean Syrian Church in India, which since the early 20th century is part of what since 1976 is officially called the Assyrian Church of the East, has kept the description as Chaldean."
"Hannibal Travis states that, in recent times, a small and mainly United States-based minority within the Chaldean Catholic Church have begun to espouse a separate Chaldean ethnic identity."
"Advocated by a number of Syriac Christians most notably members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church, modern Arameans claim to be the descendants of the ancient Arameans who emerged in the Levant during the Late Bronze Age, who following the Bronze Age collapse formed a number of small ancient Aramean kingdoms before they were conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the course of the 10th to late 7th centuries BC. They have maintained linguistic, Aramean and cultural independence despite centuries of Arabization, Islamization as well as Turkification, although Levantine Western Aramaic now has very few native speakers. They were among the first peoples to embrace Christianity during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. During Horatio Southgate's travels through Mesopotamia, he encountered indigenous Christians and stated that the Jacobites in the region of Levant called themselves for Syrians ""whose chief city was Damascus""."
"Such an Aramean identity is mainly held by a number of Syriac Christians in southcentral Turkey, southeastern Turkey, western, central, northern and southern Syria and in the Aramean diaspora especially in Germany and Sweden."
