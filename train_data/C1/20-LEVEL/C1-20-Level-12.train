Yeah.
"Anything over that, you know mine is going up towards the seven into the red."
The red on that's about ten.
Yeah.
The material
"That, it's down to there, yes"

"The pine and that, yes."
But also people had put nails in the veneer and bits had fallen off and
"Ruined it, yeah."

Felt like a bit of challenge there.
Well you know me  nothing

Well
"get as much as Thatcher, say he gets  forty thousand"
"Well no, I didn't know  no you don't"

"Now I, I have said to, I have said to you"
He's a rich man

Mm.
But you all said  that it depends on his skill or his what's his name
Or how many kids he's got.
"If I've got twenty five kids and you've only got one yo , I need more than you!"
So how can you possibly all earn the same?
Why not?
"Well you wouldn't have enough would you, to su sustain all those"

Mhm.
It's delicious.
"So many people  when they eat it, they can't actually  decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger."
Yes.
It's very subtle.
I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.
Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger  peels it
Really?
and chops it
and puts it with a pound of  Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken  outside  it's just lightly rubbed with oil
Mm mm.
and then about two ounces of powdered ginger  sprinkled over it.

Because  how does M Mark know?
"Mark right, he's got up this morning and he's gone to Tenby."
And he's gone to look around Tenby.
While he's gone those men have gone in there.

Oh you don't understand!
In the meantime  the men have took the water heater off the wall.
"They've put it from that wall, and they've stuck it on to this wall."
Oh let's connect it up  see if it works.
Now in the meantime there's gas seeping through that fire there with no light.
Oh.
So you've blown your caravan.
"Well then again, there's Mark and Sally."
You could take the mattresses and put them in their caravan in the spare bedroom.
Is there a spare bedroom?
Well no.

It's still a good thing to try.
"Yeah, we do a  well of course we,we used to make contact with who, were having a dinner party that we went to."
That's why we do all our entertaining   one at a time.
Why do you only use Marks and Spencers' chickens.
Sheila says they're the best in England.
Really?
She won't have anything else in the hotel.
"If there's a chicken dish in the hotel  chickens don't come from our suppliers, they come from Marks and Spencers."

"As X becomes a very very very small number, or a large negative number, if you like to think of it that way, where X is very large."
"So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one."
Mm.
Any idea what that graph would be?
X squared.
"Erm, what would   not quite the right shape   what would that graph be?"
Y equals something  plus X squared.
"Right, there'd be some X squared in it."
"And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant"
Mm.
Yeah.
cos when X is zero still there's Y has still got a value.
So that's going to be minus something
Mm.
so it's about minus three.
X squared  cuts
the X axis in two points.
Two points.
This one
Three points.
It's
So?
X cubed.
"So this is, there's going to be an X cubed term in here somewhere, and there might be X squared and Xs and anything else, but if it cuts it three places, it's got three r three roots."
So it's X cubed.
What about this one?
I have to sketch curves  This sort of thing.
Just touches.
Y equals X squared.
"Something like, it's going to have an X squared in it somewhere."
"It's a bit lopsided, but it's"
"Where's the X, where's the Y?"
Almost hardly worth their while but
If you look at the tonnage kept out of the landfill
Yeah.
it might work.

"But if someone's going there next week, that's  two beds, three beds."
You could put them in the sitting room.
"Difficult situation or whatever! and saying  oh yes, hello Mark!"
Are you going to read me a story and show me your bedroom?
"Oh goodo Right, well, better be off then,bye !"
But like
She must be really picky if she's doing that!
I know!
"But mum said like  she's  she's divorced  so sh , she's forty  she's got like a six year old kid  and the kid is really brainy!"
"And I'm sort of thinking, oh my God, modern woman!"
Mm.

And that she's got
And thinking oh my God this kid's gonna be better than me!
"Yeah, she's got this  gentleman friend."

"I mean, I'd mean I'd do it, in a week"
"Yeah, that's what , that's what she said, the woman going  well I suppose that's a bit late in the week really, she's got school the next day?"
"And mum just goes, yeah."
"She goes, well I didn't know if you'd wanna do it so I just said that."
"And you know er  but she goes like, she's like, like she said to me, once you've done it once  she'll expect you to do it again, and again!"
"And like, it's alright say like, once  every so often but like  once or twice"
"a week or whatever  in, like staying out late, cos that means I wouldn't be back till like, quarter to twelve!"
And get ready for bed
"It's too much , yeah!"
"Anyway he's just rotting his bowel, he'll be rotting his liver next!"
"Yeah  I said to him   Cliff, I think it's tragic mate!"
"I said that's none of my business, nothing to do with me  but I said I should think it's a tragic waste for you  and I say, it wastes your money  but that's  entirely down to you."
And what did he say?
Nothing.
"He didn't say a word, no."
Well it is a shame innit?
"Mm  I mean, you know when he gave up the drink"
He was a different man.
"he was a different bloke, yeah."
Mm.
"And the trouble is you see  they all make laugh of it  old Cliff, old Cliff, old Cliff!"
"And that makes him worse, really."
"Yeah well I said to him, what you don't realise is Cliff  they laugh at you  to your face"
But they talk
at the
behind your back!
end of the day when you do something wrong they're the first to nip in that office and say what you've done wrong  and why you've done it wrong.
"Yeah,."
But I think I shall have a quiet word with him tomorrow morning when I get to work.
Gonna see him?
Yeah.
And say what?
"Well, you know  I just can't sort of let it go on."
Well he perhaps won't do it any more now you've told him.
"As soon he gets his mouth round a Guinness bottle mate, that's it!."
"Well for heaven's sake, how many does he have?"
"Well it's roughly about five pound and, one pound and  I thought he said one pound forty a pint."
How many bottles does he have?
Well he got through fifty quid on Saturday and Sunday  so that's forty pints innit?
That's twenty pints each day
What and  forty pints in a night !
Occasionally.
"I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me?"
That's it.
That's appalling though!
"And on , on erm  Thursday  Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark  she came home at  just about half one."
She came and made me a ham sandwich  and the maid just look at her   to eat it now.
Brilliant!
There really was not a scrap of .
That's awful!
"Because the housekeeper  sorts all that out, so when she's away no one does it?"
"But she bought all these things for me from Marks and Spencers, you know breaded chicken and"
Mm mm.
Mm.
breasts.
Yeah.
I put them all in the deep freeze.
"Unless you think about it, you know the day before  or the"
Yeah
Yeah.
morning you come in.
But surely you can just defrost it in the microwave?
She doesn't have a microwave.
Does she not?
Why doesn't she use a
She doesn't like them.
microwave?
Doesn't like them.
But she bought you one.
She get you one.
That was quite funny because  it was our first Christmas down there  and I was saying to the housekeeper that I  I wouldn't mind having people come and stay and    not a problem because we've got a lovely cooker  and we're going to bring our microwave down from .
"Said it's electric, I'm just going to unplug it and bring it down and put it on the work top."
The only thing is that it's chocolate brown and my kitchen's all white.
I don't think she's fat though
I know she doesn't eat that much but what she is eating i everything's sweet.
Chocolate
Pardon?
Well sh I don't know.
.
"if anyone offered me a chocolate when I was nursing, yes I would eat it but there was always ."
"Which reminds me, I meant to get weighed this morning before I had my breakfast and I forgot."
"Remind me tomorrow, before I eat anything."
I think I'd better put some washing in before I go out.
Are those ankle boots dry?
What?
achilles tendon
It's better now.
"I d on Wednesday I did the erm  said to me don't do the high heel part if you think it's going to hurt again, you can still have the support under it, but I managed ok."
It didn't hurt.
"The pink one's the dish cloth, the little one's the one I wipe up small spills off the floor."
I wonder how Bryony is?
What?
"I said, I wonder how Bryony is?"
She wasn't very well yesterday.
"Every time she got a bump or a knock off one of the others, she was howling instead of clouting them back."
"And Richard had, I don't think Richard's very well either."
"I said I don't, well stop running the tap."
I said I don't think Richard's very well either.
He cried more than usual.
I wonder what kind of a night Trevor had with them on his own?
What do you think of Granny Jean offering offering again to get Martin from school to save Trevor walking him home?
I don't know.
I like her.
Mhm?
I like her
I don't know  but they must of done it sometime.
"It weren't when, the other when we got all pissed?"
"No, but I mean"
Why's she think she's pregnant then?
"I mean, didn't they use anything for"
Yeah!
"But she  well she didn't, I mean she didn't tell me the intimate details or anything  I don't even know whether she has, she wo , she might have ju ge , been getting over dramatic or something!"
But she  but  her period was a week and half late  and she started well panicking!
"Yeah, well she"
"And you know , you know when we thought, yeah  well she'd, she'd just come on when she came down to my house  and she was really, really, really in a happy mood!"
"And er  you know, you know when we saw them two walking"
Yeah.
the other day?
"That was what she was upset about  she thought, oh dear,Scotty's a going to be a daddy !"
"Fucking hell,!"
I hope she hadn't done it that Saturday when we all were outside and we watching
"She might not have done it, done it  but like  she might have"
like
like  yeah.
"Cos you never know, I mean  Andrew  wipe spunk all over somebody, you know!"
"Yeah, I I should think she like  she's done some  done naughty things"
Well we all do  though
"and, yeah"
"If she's given him a blow job, I mean"
"But I mean, she's probably done something like that  and  she's just got over dramatic about it!"
Guess what  she's said she's gonna write to go on the pill!
Did she?
Well not to me !
"She did and she says, she goes, I wanna go on the pill while I've got the courage!"
But I don't think I can rely on myself to take them everyday!
"If you was there you could take them, too pissed I should think!"
Probably!
"Dunno, well that's the situation."
"I think you're allowed  you're allowed to make thirty pound a week profit  fifteen hundred pound a year, anything over fifteen hundred pound  on your business  they   gotta pay tax."
Well you had a loss.
.
God!
So a I said it's a shock
Ken lost
"we didn't know you see, well Geoff paid it last year, well he di he di he didn't have to!"
My name is Jonathan  .
"So that's like dad said, I mean  things"
Dad?
are not always
Can you pass me the
"the people that have  left are sort of in the recession and that now, there's all the  really big business people and that  that have come down to the same level as everybody else."
That's right.
And they're all creating but  you know
Yeah.
there's been a lot of people that have been  on that level for a long while.
That's right.
Yeah we have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"You know, but now cos all tha all them estate agents that had  all the boom and everything didn't they?"
Yeah.

And now he's nowhere  earning
That's it.
nowhere near that amount.
He says he worked like a pansy he said and now he says I go
Mm.
Again if I collect more material than I have to use no problem.
Got an item on media watch there did anyone notice that the Green Party was actually mentioned in the Guardian today?
No.
Quite a celebration.
Wow.
About two lines commenting on the Government's erm you know growing strategy.

Wow.
First mention I've actually seen in months.

No problem I'm sure.
In future I'll try both to get the dates that are supposed to be in in there and get the copy into my mouth rather than my compatriots.
Okay do we have any other matters arising from the minutes?

Would you like Paul to buy presents  tomorrow?
For me at the fair?

To give to me on Sunday.

Still put that aside .
Oh Trevor was quite good he di he d he would've got his big pay rise today an didn't  push it too much I don't think  perhaps it's Nick though
Why's got a big one?
"However you decide to, by instalments or by"
"Mm, mm."
"one, one big lump."
Mm.
"But at the end of the day, it ain't really what I want to do."
No.
"I mean I, I want to get into mental health care."
Mm.
"And and erm  if I  I'm hoping I'll like it when I get in there, but something tells me I would."
Well as I say I went for this interview and she phoned me last Sunday didn't she?
"I went on the Monday for the, to the house."
Then on the Tuesday I went to the hospital.
And erm  she phoned me up on the Sunday.
She said I'm  I'm just ringing to tell you Joy that you didn't get  you you haven't been successful with your application this time.
"But she said  erm I wanna just tell you  all the others  that haven't made it, we've just said well I'm sorry."
That's it.
"But, with you, we feel you've got so much to offer  and we don't really wanna just say no and  and  and it would make you feel oh blow it I'm not gonna do it."
Mm.
"She said I feel that  there is a place for you in the health, in this mental health service."
But she said  what it is is basically we're all just starting from the bottom because this new idea of where they're buying small homes and making them small communities
Yeah.
erm  they're all starting from new.
They're all been institutionalized up till recently.
That's right yeah.
So they're gradually buying houses in certain areas.
And she said I'm sure you'll get in.
"But you see it's like everything else, we're in a recession."
"You, you go for a job and there's two hundred people going for that one job."
Mm.
Mm.
"That's right, yeah."
There's three hundred and eighty went for a job up the Hilly Home Where they have the spastic kids.
I like being in with my family.
He said I like being in with me boys.
"He said, and it's really good, he said, cos I'm, I'm celebrating my fortieth birthday, he said, and I ring my boys, he said, and they listen to the same sort of music I do."
"He said, whereas my mum over there in the corner, he said, if she had a bash I had to listen to bloody Frank Sinatra, wouldn't I?"
"And I'd go, yeah."
It's like yeah.
"He said, yeah, I like being home with the family."
"He said, but I'm only going back out there another  he said, so it won't be too long."
"I said, yeah."
it's not.
Fancy Jane going and having a bust-up down the
"I'm not surprised, Christ."
"She's relaying all marital problems, to everyone, wouldn't she."
"They're alike though, ain't they?"
Did you see her when she
Busting out of her dress.
"Erm, your, I think it was Dwayne or was it, it's either Dwayne, or erm, er Bob knocked a glass over, and er,Jane was like erm, trying to like, she was like going Edward move away, I'm trying to sh I'm trying, look, I'm trying to stop people dancing round here, and like, these, all this, this er, glass on the floor, right, Jane was standing there going like this, dancing round all this glass, and like she was going like this, and everyone that walked past, she was going,broken glass   and she was saying, and  she was, she kept on going broken glass, they done it."
"And she's still dancing, it's really funny ."
She's  ain't she?
Oh dear.
She started crying one
"Yeah, I know she did, I saw her."
Shouldn't keep smoking and fighting in the middle of the front room.
She was crying in the pub.
Talking about how much she hated
The bloke
"He's so drunk, he don't ."
"She goes,piss off ."
Yeah.
"So they had another big fight down there, didn't they?"
Oh dear.
"Yeah, I went in the kitchen, and"
"Right, so  me and Jim had a chat the other day  just looking at the  the roadside entries and the counts and I was sort of saying  if we work on the basis that we want between ten and twelve people, twelve people maximum"
Mm.
erm I think we're be able to do all the counts with that number of people including the  St David's roundabout and
Mm.
but we do need to clarify exactly what you want on that.
"Whether you want  samples doing cos that's gonna take more people, or whether you're just doing ins and outs  and stuff like that."
Well
And on the other roundabout for that matter.
Are you off?
Yeah I've got a  seminar in Manchester .
Oh right.
How did it go?
Fine.
Probably find that  traffic  percent
"we're just talking now this, this is, this is one we're discussing."
Oh well just south of Caernarvon on the first section erm between Caernarvon and ?
Yes.
Yeah.
Gwyneth haven't really started on doing any of that work yet.
work.
And they need to do traffic.
"And also they need to confirm the traffic erm turning  099 junction at er  I can never pronounce it, beginning with an L."
Yeah .
"And er maybe count, maybe  do their traffic counts out of that as well."
So the guy that was in charge of those schemes with Gwyneth
Yeah.
was at the meeting or came into the meeting to explain about the schemes.
What's his name?
Erm
Peter will know.
Peter's got his name down.
Cos that was one of the things we talked about
"Right, so that's the temporary staff."
Yep.
"So what we haven't made any progress on  beyond, on that side of things is erm  if we do the coding over in Caernarvon, where that will be."
Yeah.
Erm like I think we all sort of ruled out er
I don't think it's big enough is it?
"Because of the size, no."
Er just out of interest I did ring  the other day
Yeah right.
"Er  the  the room, the smallest room they have is for twenty five to thirty people"
Mm.
which I mean even that may be too big for what we want.
Erm in any case that is in use every week on a Monday and a Wednesday.
So already you're only talking
There was a thing about exams.
Wasn't it  didn't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something?
No.
That must be something
Something goes on in that room on a Monday and a Wednesday.
Which room is that?
"That's  the, I've got it in the file, a small conference room or something like that, or the committee room or something it's called."
Cos there is a room called the navigation room.
No that wasn't an  that wasn't an option.
There was this one for twenty five to thirty people and then there was another one for say forty or fifty and then it  zoomed up to like a hundred.
And even if we were to use this
"Oh I know now, yes."
"small room, you couldn't leave anything on the walls so it would all be a  come down at night, back up in the morning"
What erm er did you look in the file and see what they hired last time?
Erm  no.
Cos it may
I mean I've probably seen it
Yeah.
I've spent too much money already so
"Did you get my message, then?"
Yes.
It's about an asylum.
He's a really nice chap.
Is it her
He was very young.
He was right along the end without a sink.
Ah.
Yes.
"without a sink, he's got the only room without a sink"
"He, he said, I said is Joanne in, and he went, oh, I don't think she is, actually."
"And I went, there's a message here for her, if Rebecca phones, I went, yes, I'm Rebecca, oh, right, okay."
"You leave a message like, and it's like, erm, I'll pop over and see you,and I was like, I mean, he just paused for breath, and I went, well, what time, and he went, well hang on, the message hasn't finished yet."
"So I went sorry, sorry, and he went, it's alright, and he went in, oh, thanks for that, thanks very much."
"He went, okay, then."
"He said, I'll give her the message, I tell her that everything's fine."
"I said, yeah, tell her that I got the message, and that you know, it's all fine."
"Okay then, right, see you later."
Bye.
I spoke to him last night as well.
"I mean, when I think I was  with my bags and things and he went,Jo, the message has gone through, everything's fine  I went,your sister, I relayed that little message which I thought was  which I thought was rather comical, you see, and I said, oh did you, and he said yeah."
"He said, everything's okay, she's got measles."
He's a nice bloke.
Yeah.
He seems like fluid poems.
Her and Kate will come and see me at four o'clock  and her and Kate will come and visit you.
"They will not be coming to the cinema, and I was like, what time are they gonna come, and he was like, hang on, I haven't finished yet."
"four o'clock, and he was like read it and he   oh,only fed ten P in and I got all the information that I needed to know."
"Yeah, I've written it all out in block."
Mm.
"He was only seventeen, wasn't he?"
Can see me tonight can't you?
"Ah you are going to be so arsed, it's going to be so funny."
"I won't be that bad, I won't have any ci er  get one  gotta get some, have to  now cos we're not gonna have any."
I doubt if I'm gonna get  Phyllis is there.
Phyllis and Johnnie  .
"I call them  but it's not, it's ."
Oh I've got a sore knee ooh
It's no wonder!
"I've got fluid on it, it hurts."
Ooh
"Well you go to sleep bef when they've gone, when they go out"
"Yeah, have a bit of a kip for a bit can't I?"
I doubt if erm we'll be down here before she goes up to mine  I don't reckon.
When?
"Yeah she is, she's dropping in"
"for after, after mum and dad go  have the hand slapping and the  yeah they've gone!"
Anyway I wanna have a bit of a talk to her.
What about?
Well about all this business with Shrimpy.
"Yeah but you, you must admit Shrimpy's trying his damn hardest."
"I, I, I mean I don't know, I wasn't there for half the things she was talking about last night, I mean I was upstairs for three quarters of an hour trying to go to sleep"
"Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did was they didn't say anything to each other, in the same room, just acted totally normally but didn't say anything to each other ."
Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try and let this drop and just .
"We all know he still fancies her  he's just trying to, you know  keep it  he's just trying to forget it and try and act as normal as possible with her and hopefully things will get back to be back to  what, what they were."
"But flipping Scott, mister interferior"
Interferior ?
Yeah interferer.
"Flipping  no, it really annoys me that does."
They're always going on about how much Shrimpy  gets other people involved and  can't  stick up for himself aren't they?
And bloody  Scott runs rushing off and thinks he's mister hard man.
What sort of things are you gonna say anyway?
"Well I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna say that Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy  which is true"
"You know, he'll come running  glasses."
Yeah.
I can't do it.
"And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he looked just like your dad, and then a few days later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart attack out there."
"I said, why, and he said, he turned round with these glasses on, then he said it was just like John's stood there."
"I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same thing to me the other day, and it were only within a couple of days of each other."
"When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's his double."
"I think it's the way he looks, like, if you know what I mean, you know like  pull his face and like, look over glasses, I mean,he did it to me when  did it to Johnny."
He probably thought  like.
"He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no patience, and our Colin's just like him."
"Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways."
I haven't got a lot of patience.
"But where  where we're better off 'cos Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered"
Yeah.
"Where, when I start, Albert's"
"He, I tell you want he doesn't do, I shouldn't let you hear, but, when he, when him and me are arguing when we were younger, and me dad used to wind Colin up, and wind me up, and I'd get madder and madder, and me dad used to love it."
"But looking back, you know, and now, that's what Colin does to me, he winds me bloody up,but I can't help it, because he gets me that wild, I should just, I should, I mean, how can you change his temperament."
"I mean, I should just turn round and tell him where to go, but."
I think Colin winds you up summat chronic
I know.
And instead of just
Ignoring him.
Ignoring him.
"You don't, he  and he  going through bloody"
"Yeah, I know."
What
A  where
No.
Bird pooh on window.
"But,I mean, er,"
Where the birds have poohed on me window flying past.
Oh God.
Another one at Holgate Road fifteen erm York Road Acomb twenty.
Walmgate twelve pounds and Hull Road twelve pounds.
Er Fulford Road eighteen pounds.
Presto Main Street Haxby eighteen pounds.
Another couple at Acomb for twenty pounds and then they also give just a cost for Ripon and Scarborough.
So I don't know about anybody else but that's cheaper than I expected it to be.
Yes absolutely.
And the fact that they're several in Fulford that I'd say are very good sites.
I always read them erm when I  about Fulford .
At Fulford Road or Fishergate would be the best one to go for.
Yes.
Are these the sort of the like to the end of bus stops?
Well from what I can gather the cheaper one on Fishergate is a bus stop size one.
There's one actually at the bus stop by the Police Station and there's another one on the corner of the erm just before you turn into  Terrace there's there's a free standing one outside the shop there.
And I think the eighteen pound one is probably the big one on the side of Jacksons building.
Erm actually high up you know full size billboard.
Which I'd say is less useful in fact than the little ones.
I think the little ones might  noticed.
Cos I mean I all whenever I'm going travelling into into York and they've changed that billboard I always look at it.
Yeah.
People in cars will notice the big one a lot better .
Yeah that's true.
Which is our target audience
Obviously yes.
wait at bus stops.
Right could be a policy decision this couldn't it?
Anyway I suppose before we decide we really need to know how much the National Party are going to charge us if anything for the actual posters and what the posters look like.
Yeah.
And how many posters they what size and shape of posters they're doing which will affect which site of course.
That's right.
no good.
So I'll give
Ha!
"I mean, even in France, and I mean, in fact, in fact"
"East Germany, poor devils they"
"in France it's more  it's worse  in in  some respects because er  it seems to be more powerful the erm  the rate of  you know, the feeling of ."
"I mean what can you, what can we do?"
"If, it's happening, I mean  what was the Soviet Union I mean it's"
"Well I said to Margaret, I wonder"
news on it  it's death and destruction there isn't it?
All these minority
I wonder
groups.
"with the Western Groups  after the euphoria of saying oh there, well we've cracked it now!"
We've destroyed communism.
Are they now regretting it?
"And, I don't"
To some degree.
Well
"No, no I think they've"
"And, and the fact that they don't know what's gonna happen, how to contain all this"
Well I think in some respects
stress.
"they, they wanted the downfall of communism"
Oh they did want it!
but  nevertheless it's better the devil you know!
"But, having said that  you know, that  I should imagine that the military  are  regretting it."
"Well I mean, the military will definitely"
"regretting it, in in   the west"
Didn't actually want it to go this far.
because it means  a reduction in forces in in  all these
Yeah.
"countries  erm, and as you say, I mean ha  you know, whether they're American generals or or  the Soviet  generals, whatever  er they're all, they're all feeling the pinch now because er"
"Oh I didn't mean that, I mean"
That's what I mean.
Just say no and if he  again say no.
when I come out .
"When I , but he won't  I put them all out, in fact ."
.
Ah  oh.
Go on.
No I won't  cos the police were at the car  no  .
Sounds like it were a robbery.
"come out again  police come out of the ca er er they were at the car there  oh I said that's my car, he said oh yeah, I said yeah, he said, what's your name?"
felt like it.
"checked with his radio, he goes alright then  phoned back to the police station on his  radio, he said it's not stolen the owner's now here  he said, can you please get it moved?"
"I said well I'm trying to  I said this bloke what happens to be my oldest brother I said, and he won't even tow it for me!"
"So he said, oh why not?"
"Steven thinks that just be I only just got in he said, I'm having my tea  and he said there's no way I'm gonna do nothing like that at this time of night when I've been fourteen hours at work  So then he stormed off back home again  so he said well you'll have to move it cos it's obstructing the dual carriageway  someone might come round that corner fast and hit it."
"He said it's not an offence he said if you've broke down, you can't help, he said  but you've gotta really move it  so I went round to Paul  and  there was about seven or eight blokes that pushed it all the way round to Bernie's."
No you don't forget Helen  he could come down
I don't forget things like that.
"and ask for any help in doing his car  don't go to work  or can he borrow this, just say  no I'm sorry  you couldn't help us  and I'm your sister  so now I can't"
I know
help you.
He has been like that for  since he's been with her  he has
I know about it.
"He used to help us with anything  before he got with her  he'd always help me  he always looked happy, now he"
Mum mum mum !
"But now he's with her, he don't wanna now."
"Well, you can just do the same with him."
I
You're not that bothered are you?
Well no  but I like to think that Steven's still my brother.
Yeah well I  my son but he don't treat a mother.
But he's not he's not that when he's with her.
Yeah well that don't help with getting your money though does it?
"No  and what's happened is, he's been up the bank  and er  the thing has"
Saved his money.
"and the thingo's gobbled up his card  as he said, well if it hasn't  gobbled your card  then  no problem."
If it has
There's a problem.
"we'll have to re-issue another one which could take sort of, you know, this time of year it's over a week  so  he said well it definitely has."
"Did he say, I'm desperate for my money!"
Yeah  so he said well  what do erm    and he said the woman up there didn't really ask what had happened!
It was A T S.
Why did it gobble his card up then?
Well because A T S  had gone  straight to the bailiff  and the courts  to freeze his account.
Ooh my God!
Mm  because his account was frozen  as soon as he put his card in  it took it in!
Oh!
"So he said, can I get a new card?"
Could you have that done to you then?
No.
You couldn't have that done to you?
"Oh sorry, I thought you said did I have it done."
Well no cos I ain't got one of them sort of cards have I?
His was like sort of a bank credit card  but bank said he put the cheque card in  and that was only a fifty quid thing anyway.
But he
Alright.
could draw it up to a  a thousand pounds  on that card  I mean
"And you said he's only just paid it, well"
"That's what he said, if I'd known what I know now, he said I wouldn't of paid it!"
He says I'd better go and check the money  so he said erm  but what he couldn't understand was  they wrote to him and said that  they haven't paid the cheques  but they didn't say anything about freezing his account!
"Well they should by law, surely!"
Well  dunno.
So he said erm  I said to the woman  I went to the court this morning  so he said   when you explain to me  he said I've got money in my pockets cos I borrowed it from dad  tha he said I owed sixty two pound  so he said I said to the woman   in the  court  how can I pay this  the sixty two pounds  when you've frozen my account?
"She said, that's your problem!"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children  with mothers then  so they would like perhaps a play facility there."
"And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the"
"or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty"
Yes.
there's very limited facilities for children to play.
So  but I also coaxed Mrs  about  the Wandsbergh .
"Anyway, she  wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible  and  because there was an arts appeal and  for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things."
So  I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be  she thought that that would be the best idea.
Not the children's things at the  Cottage Hospital.
"I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital  and  the children from  will be invited to the hospital for that day  that week, sorry."
It's gonna be a week  .
So she wanted to know what date it is.
"So I, I asked Mrs  to  but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details."
"And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all."
"And that she was going on Wednesday, I think."
Up she went  you know
Hold on.
Which one was going to see which
It's
one?
Mrs  was going to see Miss
Was going to see Miss
.
Oh.
I see.
I didn't know which one.
But I give them a  so then I saw Mrs  on Tuesday    when I was at Ashington.
And she came up with all sorts of things that  she would like for the  the new Wandsbergh development.
"But on a  but there's nothing ready of course, so th there's, there's a  giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards  and it's a giant one  it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of  things in, in the  in the courtyard that make up the  the time."
"So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the  of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth."
"I said well what you do in your private life it's up to you  if you want to get drunk  and you want to spend money  then that's fine  but once you step over  that clock tower I said and you start interfering with my work it's a different thing, I said well I've   and I've just said nothing because  although you ain't worked right, at least you've sort of you've work in this factory sort of in the morning, you've got over it but"
and then
Yeah
.
there's been disaster tonight  ain't gonna put up with it!
So what he say?
Didn't say anything.
"I said you know, I think you've gotta sort yourself out Lee  and everybody went sort of quiet  but  Paul said  I've never had a rollocking!"
"I said well in all fairness Paul, you ain't actually  bloody got , I said I don't do it for the fun of it  I said and I don't like doing it  but I see, he just sort of"
Well that's silly comment  can't be doing him any good!
I said well the thing  is discipline.
If grandma went
If the transport
into the  she'd  sherry each.
Cor!
I said if the transport get that load of L T M thrown back  Robin is gonna get it right in the neck!
And if Robin gets it in the neck  I shall get it in the neck  and I shall be getting it in the neck because of you!
So I said I think
Well then what did he say?
"I said I can assure mate, I said I shall make sure there's hell to pay!"
I said but I shall be wrong  for not saying anything about you coming to work drunk.
So I said I'll leave you to think about that.
"Well he must of had that amount  he must be contin , he must have alcohol in the body  continuously."
"Of course he has  he was drinking Saturday afternoon to Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and the Sunday night  not Monday night  but  again last night."
So he never gets over it does he?
And he went to bed half past  two.
And got up at four.
"Before then I should think, quarter to four."
I should think he looked like nothing on earth did he?
Yeah.
Well he's gonna kill his self isn't he?
That's right.
I don't know why they bother.
"There's a signal box, from which the other picture was taken."
No doubt a lamp and  store there.
"Er this taken from where the signal box used to be, and that's where the line out to  is over there."
"There's hardly a trace of it, whoops."
And there you see er  really that was the old erm remains of the platform going towards er .
That's all that's left.
And again that's the  er er platforms as it is now looking towards .
Oh and they sorry the other way round.
That's the other end of it.
"And the er house there,."
Quite a fair erm service on the Nottingham Lincoln line.
Erm there's a sort of typical timetable of the nineteen twenties.
". Now moving over to to , er what is  Castle now, used to be quite a nice er well the the actual building   Erm that building is still here, and the bulk of that er station building is still there, er but erm I'm afraid all the er the buildings this side have gone, erm and er a lot of this has a lot of this has gone."
Again you you've got er lamps erm and water columns and barrier here.
"In the background, erm a big goods shed which is still there."
I think er it won't be long before that goes I think.
"There you can see, early B R days, erm as it shows it's  Castle, it wasn't  Castle, it was just  in the old days."
Water tower here.
There was never a turntable at er at .
"Er but er rather nice er buildings here, and er canopies, which I say have been completely er removed."
And er the level crossing of the old A one used to be here.
"The goods shed at the back, and the train just coming in from Lincoln there."
And the old semaphore bracket signal there.
"Er in B R days, a lot of the er traffic between Nottingham and Lincoln and Derby, er was hauled by locomotives from Lincoln depot, and when the erm  Region took that over, they closed the  or the  er shed down and used erm er Lincoln  region locomotives."
"This is an old  express passenger four four O, director class."
Er in York station erm on a er Lincoln to Derby train.
"Erm very attractive er locos they were and extremely successful, they were the mainstay of er the er er  line, and er outperformed many of the Robinson four six Os er that were built subsequently."
"Erm very attractive building, and I think in fact ten years ago when I took that photograph."
Erm I don't think it's changed much.
coming back er along the line.
And that's how it was in earlier days.
Erm a farmer bought a new tractor yesterday
"A farmer bought a new tractor yesterday, good, right can you read the next four out, er Trevor"
"Bother, winner, winter,dr driver"
That's okay
The river was very cold
"The river was very cold, right, can you do the next one four  Charlie"
"Never, number"
The blazer was very warm
"The blazer was very warm, right, yeah, erm"
"Erm, I have a, a warm jersey"
"I have a warm jersey, good"
"Remember, Jack,"
"helicopter, er the helicopter was very big"
"The helicopter was very big, good, so you've all had a chance to use one set."
"Can we have a look at the ones underneath, in the orange block and will you do the first one Heather?"
The bomber opens the gates to attract the driver
"Good and the next one, Charlie"

"But that details of that actually has a  but I don't think it's a total story okay so I'll, I'll put it all down on, on paper and then we'll take it from there, okay, thanks, bye ."
Matters arising proposed and seconded that they be accepted  recommendations
"Yeah  no no, because there was no matters arising."
Just put that on so you can  proposing and seconding .
"Confusing, isn't it?"
"No, not really!"
Right
Secretary's report
Can we have the secretary's report.
Yeah.
"Erm  secretary's report, it's much the same as last year  er, we had two trips  this year  two coach trips  one to the Yorkshire Aquarist Festival in Ap was it April?"
"I think it was April, wasn't it?"
And one to the British Aquarist Festival in October.
"They were both enjoyable  erm  I can't really say which I enjoyed the most  er, I thought they were both very good  and of course good value for the money  because they don't charge very much for the fares  well I don't think they do."
"Erm  then we had the  three-way inter-club  table show  with Hulton and Skelmersdale and St Helens  erm  the first one was  St Helens  and that was the only  wasn't it, about April  and we won that  we, we  it was a whitewash really, wasn't it?"
"Erm  then we had one at Sk Hulton in July  and we won that  er, not quite as much of a whitewash was it?"
Nevertheless we won handsomely.
And the third one was at Skelm
Which was not organized because we don't know anyone
"which was   we don't know who won  we don't know what the score was but we think that   but we're, we're assuming that that's because they bring out all their secret showmen  who don't sh travel  they have a little core, hard core of  that don't travel  but they, they bring them out"
"they bring them out at their own table shows and, and it's"
Appropriate that we should  that much
Well that appears to be so .
I never cared for results  never cared for results at all.
Robert is
We never saw a fish either.
No.
"I don't think erm  on reflection, I don't think that a three-way table show is a good thing."
"I would prefer to see an inter-club with Skelm and an inter-club with Hulton I think they get too big, two clubs is too difficult to organize when there's three  cos you, you're getting  it's not , it's the"
It's not that   the show secretary was er  at  club  had not done his job.
At Skelmersdale?
Yeah.
I mean he's in the auction when he should be with them  writing the labels.
I saw him around two weeks ago at Wetherby and er I think he'll run well.
He was ten to one earlier in the week and the rain will have helped.
Yes I mean if it if it does go to good to soft he will like the ground.
There's a couple in there that would prefer it faster.
Mm.
Erm but at that sort of price I think he's opposable.
Well let's see what we can oppose him with.
"Bradley Star is a very nice horse he's a classy performer this one, Josh Gifford's horses are in tremendous form and I was talking to the man who who rides him Deckland Murphy he's my next door neighbour he thinks he'll run a big race."
"He would be my pick I must say, of them  He's he's"
The trouble is he's run he's run some marvellous races but somehow when it comes to the crunch and er in in in better class races he just gets just gets beat.
He loves Cheltenham though I mean he's had four firsts and a second
"Erm, he's only won I admit"
yeah
he's only once been beaten at Cheltenham .
Erm another I know er I've spoken to Deckland Murphy as well being the Newmarket's jumps jockey and erm they think he's the Gold Cup horse well if he is he's gonna have to put in a good performance today then I'd stick with him.
Think he's gonna win?
Yeah exactly.
It's a it's a very very good race this and one of the good horses is a horse called General Idea.
Now what a training performance this would be if this horse could win because he's trained by Dermott Wilde and do you remember ten days ago he sent out Vintage Crop to win the Melbourne Cup down in Australia.
Well the word from Ireland this week is that this horse is jumping out of its skin.
The only problem is that the ground now might well have gone against this horse.
But he did win the Galway Plate earlier this summer.
This is fast ground
At Galway and that's the problem with General Idea as you say Derek er if it gets softer like at Cheltenham that will be very much against him.
But er it doesn't look like a steeplechase but  it is in fact
a two mile  steeplechase the Galway Plate and General Idea running really well from  and  Express  but the ground's the problem.
and lighter weight as well last year and has more weight today so he's had he would have had to have improved about four or five pounds to win today?
That's right.
And there's very li very little between him and er the the other ex-Irish horse Second Schedule.
Exactly.
Well let's have a look we've got er Second Schedule.
Now he's recently joined David Nicholson's stable.
"They're not very flattering  they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid  I think er  you tried to get away from the traditional type of"
Oh I see these one that they send in
Mm
Yes I er
by the thousands
I don't go a lot on them myself
"Oh poetry   some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad."
"Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name"
about the gas and that
Oh to be honest I can't remember the
"Mm, very poignant"
"Mm, but er"
anti war
what was the one about the erm  oh  it was about the assembling of the gun
"Oh yes, oh"
do you remember that?
And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts
That's right yes
and er
Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now
Mm
horrible.
"There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs"
Mm
which are supposed to be erm
Come here
seventeenth century
come here scallywag
"They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually"
Mm
you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on
and the guy that's faked it has done all this
Er into the er into the bunker.
"In actual fact in later times erm, possibly when that er when this was no longer in use, erm they er put five, instead of two or three coal rails, on the bunker, erm they put five on at least a couple of the engines."
"To so it could accommodate more coal, erm and not have to return to base so frequently."
"Erm there's another picture, showing the er water er water crane, with a barrel."
Er and the erm and the hose and er and and lighting and so on.
And this was a little stage er for people to go and to erm transfer coal across.
"Now you can see on there, there's something at the back isn't there?"
Oh yes.
But I I don't know what it is.
I suspect it's er it's it's er it's some sort of little office at a guess.
But I would very very much like to er to find out er and get a picture of what is up there.
Or somebody could tell me.
Now that's a bit of a grotty picture put er it's useful to er er to give an idea of what was there.
"Now after the er there was a incident at erm the er engine shed, er the stabling of the locomotive was transferred away, erm and it used to travel at the end of the day over to the  er or , or  er engine shed, where it er stayed for the stayed for the night."
"Er and this is a picture of it and the  engine shed, with some ex-  locos."
Er which were normal at that time.
"Erm and er and basically that engine shed is where  's clothing factory is, erm just er at the side of  Road,."
And by the  Hill Bridge.
"A nineteen twenty four timetable, erm not many trains between  er and er and ."
"I say originally there were four, but by nineteen er thir nineteen twenty nine, erm basically the passenger service had ceased, although er we did get  there were minor special and so on, that that were run and race days, the stations and the er were used, but basically erm er the er the line beyond er  was er virtually entirely erm colliery er and and goods traffic."
But I say it it it became er quite increasingly important right up to its closure er of of er particularly for for catering for Bl for erm  pit.
"Er and indeed er a a triangle or a curve was put in near  to er bring to bring trains or enable trains to er er to turn round or go round and face Nottingham or come from Nottingham from  yard, and so on."
there's quite a quite a good service as you can see er between erm at least er  junction and .
virtually everything.
And that was maintained right through to the end.
"Erm a late picture, say on or about the day befor when it packed up which was erm July nineteen fifty nine for passenger servicing."
"And that was a sad day, erm and I've got the details, I think it was nineteen eighty one, er that it was finally bulldozed."
"And I think a lot of that er of the hard core and er went, and was buried near the rifle range, up erm at  's place."
Er just off  Road.
I think I'm right in that.
You can see that erm   good job of the knocking all the er stonework down and so on.
Rather sad .
"Right then  could we have the minutes from the previous A G M, please."
The minutes of the annual general meeting held at  Labour Club   on Monday the seventh of December  nineteen ninety two.
"There were thirteen members present,in the chair  apology er apologies from Joe and Emily  and Robert who were injured in a car crash on the way here."
Minutes of the A G M on the second of December nineteen ninety one were read  proposed Jack   and seconded    that they be accepted.
All in favour  there were none against  and no abstentions.
Matters arising  there were no matters arising  unusually.
Secretary's report  the secretary thanked Joan and Reg  for the club during the year  especially for donating items for the open show for the  and Christmas social.
It was a very hard job holding everything together  and it required tremendous dedication from everyone concerned.
Difficulties had arisen over the Globe Hotel in February last year  and we have been forced to move yet again.
We were once more experiencing difficulties  hopefully  they would all be  out before too long.
We hadn't managed to get any speakers this year  but had all enjoyed the previous meeting in Oc in October.
"There had been a trip to Yorkshire in April  and another to the British Aquarist Festival  in November, both of which had been enjoyed by all."
This concluded the secretary's report.
"Brian  proposed  Wilf  seconded that the be, the, seconded that the report be accepted  all in favour, there were none against and no abstentions."
Show secretary's report  in the show secretary's absence  due to the accident  on route tonight  the chairman said  Mrs  had done a fantastic job over the year  and he wished to record his thanks to her.
The fish on the bench have increased over the year  and he asked everyone to bring out just one fish  every meeting.
The secretary would phone to find out if they were alright  after the accident and if nec necessary  contact the chairman.
"Treasurer's report  the balance sheets were circulated to all and the treasurer went through each item  of expenditure, explaining in detail."
There was a healthy balance  for nineteen ninety three  and this was mainly due to members supporting raffles  and the fact that we have not put the show stand off  at the British Aquarist Festival for a couple of years.
This had built up the present balance to what it now was.
Mr  proposed  seconded that the report be accepted.
All in favour  none against and no abstentions.
This concluded the reports.
There was no librarian's report  due to Mr  being absent.
The chairman thanked all those who had worked hard and tirelessly over the last year  for the benefit of the club and its members.
Election of the committee.
"Now I don't propose to go through  erm the proposers and seconders, I shall just go through  the nominees  er  and there was no opposition."
"So  er presumably  er you understand that it was, they were all elected."
"The chairman  Peter   vice chairman, Bill    secretary, H    treasurer  A B   show secretary, E   assistant show secretary, R   librarian, Jane   committee  J   M   W   and J ."
All these members were elected unanimously and unopposed.
"Now, any other business."
We were asked to try to arrange an inter-club table show  with Hulton Aquarist Society.
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
Joanna !
"Nay , by the sacred rood !"
where is she ?
"Host , where is that girl ? ''"
"`` Girl , Sir Daniel ? ''"
cried the landlord .
"`` Nay , sir , I saw no girl . ''"
"`` Boy , then , dotard ! ''"
cried the knight .
`` Could ye not see it was a wench ?
"She in the murrey-coloured mantle -- she that broke her fast with water , rogue -- where is she ? ''"
"`` Nay , the saints bless us !"
"Master John , ye called him , '' said the host ."
"`` Well , I thought none evil ."
He is gone .
I saw him -- her -- I saw her in the stable a good hour agone ; ' a was saddling a grey horse . ''
"`` Now , by the rood ! ''"
"cried Sir Daniel , `` the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more . ''"
"`` Sir knight , '' observed the messenger , with bitterness , `` while that ye are here , roaring for five hundred pounds , the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` Selden , fall me out with six cross-bowmen ; hunt me her down ."
"I care not what it cost ; but , at my returning , let me find her at the Moat House ."
Be it upon your head .
"And now , sir messenger , we march . ''"
"And the troop broke into a good trot , and Selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley , with the staring villagers ."
CHAPTER II -- IN THE FEN It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way .
The sky was all blue ; the jolly wind blew loud and steady ; the windmill-sails were spinning ; and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn .
"He had been all night in the saddle , but his heart was good and his body sound , and he rode right merrily ."
"The path went down and down into the marsh , till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him , and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before ."
"On either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows , pools of water shaking in the wind , and treacherous bogs , as green as emerald , to tempt and to betray the traveller ."
The path lay almost straight through the morass .
"It was already very ancient ; its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery ; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk , and every here and there , for a few hundred yards , it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen ."
A handful of archers are but now come to the ferry ; murrey and blue is their wear ; they are our butts -- they shall all taste arrows -- no man of them shall struggle through this wood .
"For , lads , we are here some fifty strong , each man of us most foully wronged ; for some they have lost lands , and some friends ; and some they have been outlawed -- all oppressed !"
"Who , then , hath done this evil ?"
"Sir Daniel , by the rood !"
Shall he then profit ?
shall he sit snug in our houses ?
shall he till our fields ?
shall he suck the bone he robbed us of ?
I trow not .
"He getteth him strength at law ; he gaineth cases ; nay , there is one case he shall not gain -- I have a writ here at my belt that , please the saints , shall conquer him . ''"
Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second horn of ale .
"He raised it , as if to pledge the speaker ."
"`` Master Ellis , '' he said , `` y ' are for vengeance -- well it becometh you !"
"-- but your poor brother o ' the greenwood , that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon , looketh rather , for his poor part , to the profit of the thing ."
He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory . ''
"`` Lawless , '' replied the other , `` to reach the Moat House , Sir Daniel must pass the forest ."
"We shall make that passage dearer , pardy , than any battle ."
"Then , when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us -- all his great friends fallen and fled away , and none to give him aid -- we shall beleaguer that old fox about , and great shall be the fall of him ."
'T is a fat buck ; he will make a dinner for us all . ''
"`` Ay , '' returned Lawless , `` I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand ; but the cooking of them is hot work , good Master Ellis ."
And meanwhile what do we ?
"We make black arrows , we write rhymes , and we drink fair cold water , that discomfortable drink . ''"
"`` Y ' are untrue , Will Lawless ."
"Ye still smell of the Grey Friars ' buttery ; greed is your undoing , '' answered Ellis ."
`` We took twenty pounds from Appleyard .
We took seven marks from the messenger last night .
A day ago we had fifty from the merchant . ''
"`` And to-day , '' said one of the men , `` I stopped a fat pardoner riding apace for Holywood ."
Here is his purse . ''
Ellis counted the contents .
`` Five score shillings ! ''
he grumbled .
"Take him by the knees , good Master Shelton , while I lift him by the shoulders , and let us lay him in his house ."
This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver ; he will turn paper colour ; he will pray like a windmill . ''
"They took up the old archer , and carried him between them into his house , where he had dwelt alone ."
"And there they laid him on the floor , out of regard for the mattress , and sought , as best they might , to straighten and compose his limbs ."
Appleyard 's house was clean and bare .
"There was a bed , with a blue cover , a cupboard , a great chest , a pair of joint-stools , a hinged table in the chimney corner , and hung upon the wall the old soldier 's armoury of bows and defensive armour ."
Hatch began to look about him curiously .
"`` Nick had money , '' he said ."
`` He may have had three score pounds put by .
I would I could light upo n't !
"When ye lose an old friend , Master Richard , the best consolation is to heir him ."
"See , now , this chest ."
I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein .
"He had a strong hand to get , and a hard hand to keep withal , had Appleyard the archer ."
Now may God rest his spirit !
"Near eighty year he was afoot and about , and ever getting ; but now he 's on the broad of his back , poor shrew , and no more lacketh ; and if his chattels came to a good friend , he would be merrier , methinks , in heaven . ''"
"`` Come , Hatch , '' said Dick , `` respect his stone-blind eyes ."
Would ye rob the man before his body ?
"Nay , he would walk ! ''"
"Hatch made several signs of the cross ; but by this time his natural complexion had returned , and he was not easily to be dashed from any purpose ."
"It would have gone hard with the chest had not the gate sounded , and presently after the door of the house opened and admitted a tall , portly , ruddy , black-eyed man of near fifty , in a surplice and black robe ."
"`` Appleyard '' -- the newcomer was saying , as he entered ; but he stopped dead ."
`` Ave Maria ! ''
he cried .
`` Saints be our shield !
What cheer is this ? ''
"`` Cold cheer with Appleyard , sir parson , '' answered Hatch , with perfect cheerfulness ."
"`` Shot at his own door , and alighteth even now at purgatory gates ."
Ay !
"there , if tales be true , he shall lack neither coal nor candle . ''"
"Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool , and sat down upon it , sick and white ."
`` This is a judgment !
was the answer .
"`` Howsoever , so be it , amen ! ''"
"After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer ."
"`` It 's the custom , sir , '' he added apologetically ."
"And not long after , without another word , he passed away ."
"In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores -- the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log-book , and pounds of tobacco ."
"He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle ."
"Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours ."
This seemed mightily to relieve him .
He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed .
"But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body ."
"`` Do n't you take on , sir , '' he said , shaking the squire 's hand ."
`` All 's well with him ; no fear for a hand that 's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner .
"It may n't be good divinity , but it 's a fact . ''"
Then he pulled me aside .
"`` Dr. Livesey , '' he said , `` in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ? ''"
"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later ."
"`` You can calculate for yourself , '' I said ."
"`` Why , yes , '' returned the captain , scratching his head ; `` and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of Providence , I should say we were pretty close hauled . ''"
`` How do you mean ? ''
I asked .
"`` It 's a pity , sir , we lost that second load ."
"That 's what I mean , '' replied the captain ."
"`` As for powder and shot , we 'll do ."
"But the rations are short , very short -- so short , Dr. Livesey , that we 're perhaps as well without that extra mouth . ''"
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag .
"Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood ."
`` Oho ! ''
said the captain .
`` Blaze away !
"You 've little enough powder already , my lads . ''"
"At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage ."
"In the pool of Corri-Bui swims a salmon with a skin that shines like silver , and whose gills are red -- bring them all to me , and then you shall know where dwell your brothers and your sister ! '"
` To-morrow at cock-crow I will begone ! '
answered Covan .
"The way to the mountain lay straight before him , and when he had climbed high he caught sight of the roe with the white feet and the spotted sides , on the peak in front ."
"Full of hope he set out in pursuit of her , but by the time he had reached that peak she had left it and was to be seen on another ."
"And so it always happened , and Covan 's courage had well-nigh failed him , when the thought of the Dog of Maol-mor darted into his mind ."
"` Oh , that he was here ! '"
he cried .
And looking up he saw him .
` Why did you summon me ? '
asked the Dog of Maol-mor .
"And when Covan had told him of his trouble , and how the roe always led him further and further , the Dog only answered : ` Fear nothing ; I will soon catch her for you . '"
And in a short while he laid the roe unhurt at Covan 's feet .
` What will you wish me to do with her ? '
said the Dog .
"And Covan answered : ` The old man bade me bring her , and the duck with the golden neck , and the salmon with the silver sides , to his cottage ; if I shall catch them , I know not ."
"But carry you the roe to the back of the cottage , and tether her so that she can not escape . '"
"` It shall be done , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"Then Covan sped to the lake which led to the land of the Sun , where the duck with the green body and the golden neck was swimming among the water-lilies ."
"` Surely I can catch him , good swimmer as I am , ' to himself ."
"But , if he could swim well , the duck could swim better , and at length his strength failed him , and he was forced to seek the land ."
` Oh that the black raven were here to help me ! '
he thought to himself .
And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder .
` How can I help you ? '
asked the raven .
And Covan answered : ` Catch me the green duck that floats on the water . '
"And the raven flew with his strong wings and picked him up in his strong beak , and in another moment the bird was laid at the feet of Covan ."
"This time it was easy for the young man to carry his prize , and after giving thanks to the raven for his aid , he went on to the river ."
In the deep dark pool of which the old man had spoken the silver-sided salmon was lying under a rock .
"` Surely I , good fisher as I am , can catch him , ' said Covan son of Gorla ."
"And cutting a slender pole from a bush , he fastened a line to the end of it ."
"`` Silver , '' said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut rope -- `` Silver , '' says he , `` you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook ."
And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ?
Not you !
"As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand ."
If I turn agin my dooty -- '' And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise .
"I had found one of the honest hands -- well , here , at that same moment , came news of another ."
"Far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , long-drawn scream ."
"The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had re-established its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon ."
"Tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but Silver had not winked an eye ."
"He stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring ."
`` John ! ''
"said the sailor , stretching out his hand ."
`` Hands off ! ''
"cried Silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast ."
"`` Hands off , if you like , John Silver , '' said the other ."
`` It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me .
"But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? ''"
`` That ? ''
"returned Silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pin-point in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass ."
`` That ?
"Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . ''"
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero .
`` Alan ! ''
he cried .
`` Then rest his soul for a true seaman !
"And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more ."
"If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty ."
"You 've killed Alan , have you ?"
"Kill me too , if you can ."
But I defies you . ''
"And with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach ."
But he was not destined to go far .
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory .
"However , to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way , and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found they could sleep thus with security ."
"Indeed they would have slept longer , but Peter tired quickly of sleeping , and soon he would cry in his captain voice , ` We get off here . '"
"So with occasional tiffs , but on the whole rollicking , they drew near the Neverland ; for after many moons they did reach it , and , what is more , they had been going pretty straight all the time , not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was out looking for them ."
It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores .
"` There it is , ' said Peter calmly ."
"` Where , where ? '"
` Where all the arrows are pointing . '
"Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing out the island to the children , all directed by their friend the sun , who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night ."
-LSB- Illustration : `` LET HIM KEEP WHO CAN '' -RSB- Wendy and John and Michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their first sight of the island .
"Strange to say , they all recognised it at once , and until fear fell upon them they hailed it , not as something long dreamt of and seen at last , but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays ."
"` John , there 's the lagoon . '"
"` Wendy , look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand . ' '"
"I say , John , I see your flamingo with the broken leg . '"
"` Look , Michael , there 's your cave . '"
"` John , what 's that in the brushwood ? '"
` It 's a wolf with her whelps .
"Wendy , I do believe that 's your little whelp . '"
"` There 's my boat , John , with her sides stove in . '"
"` No , it is n't ."
"Why , we burned your boat . '"
"` That 's her , at any rate ."
"I say , John , I see the smoke of the redskin camp . '"
` Where ?
"Show me , and I 'll tell you by the way the smoke curls whether they are on the war-path . '"
"` There , just across the Mysterious River . ' '"
I see now .
"Yes , they are on the war-path right enough . '"
"Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much ; but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand , for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them ?"
"It came as the arrows went , leaving the island in gloom ."
In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime .
"Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread ; black shadows moved about in them ; the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now , and above all , you lost the certainty that you would win ."
`` What my mother hopes .
"John , what are -- '' But Hook had found his voice again ."
`` Tie her up ! ''
he shouted .
It was Smee who tied her to the mast .
"`` See here , honey , '' he whispered , `` I 'll save you if you promise to be my mother . ''"
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise .
"`` I would almost rather have no children at all , '' she said disdainfully -LSB- scornfully -RSB- ."
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast ; the eyes of all were on the plank : that last little walk they were about to take .
"They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully , for the capacity to think had gone from them ; they could stare and shiver only ."
"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed , and took a step toward Wendy ."
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one .
"But he never reached her , he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her ."
He heard something else instead .
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile .
"They all heard it -- pirates , boys , Wendy ; and immediately every head was blown in one direction ; not to the water whence the sound proceeded , but toward Hook ."
"All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone , and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators ."
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him .
It was as if he had been clipped at every joint .
He fell in a little heap .
"The sound came steadily nearer ; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought , `` The crocodile is about to board the ship ! ''"
Even the iron claw hung inactive ; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted .
"Left so fearfully alone , any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell : but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working , and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go ."
"The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him , and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke ."
`` Hide me ! ''
he cried hoarsely .
"They gathered round him , all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard ."
They had no thought of fighting it .
It was Fate .
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship 's side to see the crocodile climbing it .
Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights ; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid .
It was Peter .
"Alan Douglas was a sincere man , with himself as well as with others , yet there are some motives that lie , in their first inception , too deep even for the probe of self-analysis ."
He had not as yet the faintest suspicion as to the real source of his interest in Lynde Oliver -- in his sudden forceful desire to be of use and service to her -- to rescue her from spiritual peril as he had that day rescued her from bodily danger .
"She must have a lonely , unsatisfying life , he thought ."
It is my duty to help her if I can .
It did not then occur to him that duty in this instance wore a much more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience .
"* * * * * Alan did not mean to be oversoon in going back to Four Winds , but three days later a book came to him which Captain Anthony had expressed a wish to see ."
It furnished an excuse for an earlier call .
After that he went often .
"He always found the Captain courteous and affable , old Emily grimly cordial , Lynde sometimes remote and demure , sometimes frankly friendly ."
"Occasionally , when the Captain was away in his yacht , he went for a walk with her and her dogs along the shore or through the sweet-smelling pinelands up the lake ."
He found that she loved books and was avid for more of them than she could obtain ; he was glad to take her several and discuss them with her .
She liked history and travels best .
"With novels she had no patience , she said disdainfully ."
She seldom spoke of herself or her past life and Alan fancied she avoided any personal reference .
"But once she said abruptly , `` Why do you never ask me to go to church ?"
I 've always been afraid you would . ''
"`` Because I do not think it would do you any good to go if you did n't want to , '' said Alan gravely ."
`` Souls should not be rudely handled any more than bodies . ''
"She looked at him reflectively , her finger denting her chin in a meditative fashion she had ."
`` You are not at all like Mr. Strong .
"He always scolded me , when he got a chance , for not going to church ."
I would have hated him if it had been worthwhile .
I told him one day that I was nearer to God under these pines than I could be in any building fashioned by human hands .
He was very much shocked .
But I do n't want you to misunderstand me .
Father does not go to church because he does not believe there is a God .
But I know there is .
Mother taught me so .
"I have never gone to church because Father would not allow me , and I could not go now in Rexton where the people talk about me so ."
"Oh , I know they do -- you know it , too -- but I do not care for them ."
I know I 'm not like other girls .
I would like to be but I ca n't be -- I never can be -- now . ''
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say `` Mother '' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh , how exquisitely delicious it would be to her ."
That I am afraid is how Peter regarded it .
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
"How proud of him they are ; and very right and proper , too ."
"But why does Peter sit so long on the rail , why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but , on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say `` Peter , '' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"If she said `` Peter '' again , he meant to cry `` Mother '' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when next he peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said `` Peter , '' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , `` Oh , Peter , how exquisitely you play . ''"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
"` It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her , and if he returns without finding her , his head will be the forfeit ."
"Either way , he will be out of MY path . '"
"So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king , to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance ."
"The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay , and bade him state what he had to say , and to be quick about it ."
"` Oh , sire !"
"the Princess Bella-Flor -- ' answered the man , and then stopped as if afraid ."
` What of the Princess Bella-Flor ? '
asked the king impatiently . '
I have heard -- it is whispered at court -- that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding . ' '
"I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me , ' cried the king , eagerly ."
"` Speak on , knave ; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret ? '"
"` It is not I , but my brother , who knows , ' replied the traitor ; ` if your majesty would ask him -- ' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall ."
"` Order Jose to appear before me instantly , ' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders , so great was the noise his majesty had made ; and when Jose entered the hall , wondering what in the world could be the matter , the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement ."
"` Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment , ' stammered he , ` for if you return without her I will have you drowned ! '"
"And without another word he left the hall , leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror ."
` How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her ? '
thought he .
"` But it is no use staying here , for I shall only be put to death . '"
And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse .
"There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls , and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other , wondering which he should choose , when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach ."
"` Take me , ' it said in a gentle whisper , ` and all will go well . '"
Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk .
Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable .
"He was about to mount on his back , when the animal spoke again : ` Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there , and put them in your pocket . '"
"Jose did as he was told , and being in a great hurry to get away , asked no questions , but swung himself into the saddle ."
"They rode far without meeting any adventures , but at length they came to an ant-hill , and the horse stopped ."
"` Crumble those three loaves for the ants , ' he said ."
But Jose hesitated .
"` Why , we may want them ourselves ! '"
answered he .
` Never mind that ; give them to the ants all the same .
Do not lose a chance of helping others . '
"`` Oh , dear !"
"you said you 'd take good care of me , '' he sighed , as the sun seemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden ."
`` Well I am taking good care of you as hard as I can .
"Do n't be cross , child ; I 'll go in a minute , '' said Nan , who considered five-year-old Robby a mere infant compared to herself ."
"So little Rob sat looking anxiously about him , and waiting patiently , for , spite of some misgivings , he felt great confidence in Nan ."
"`` I guess it 's going to be night pretty soon , '' he observed , as if to himself , as a mosquito bit him , and the frogs in a neighboring marsh began to pipe up for the evening concert ."
`` My goodness me !
so it is .
"Come right away this minute , or they will be gone , '' cried Nan , looking up from her work , and suddenly perceiving that the sun was down ."
"`` I heard a horn about an hour ago ; may be they were blowing for us , '' said Rob , trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill ."
`` Where was it ? ''
"asked Nan , stopping short ."
`` Over that way ; '' he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely wrong direction .
"`` Let 's go that way and meet them ; '' and Nan wheeled about , and began to trot through the bushes , feeling a trifle anxious , for there were so many cow-paths all about she could not remember which way they came ."
"On they went over stock and stone again , pausing now and then to listen for the horn , which did not blow any more , for it was only the moo of a cow on her way home ."
`` I do n't remember seeing that pile of stones do you ? ''
"asked Nan , as she sat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation ."
"`` I do n't remember any thing , but I want to go home , '' and Rob 's voice had a little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him gently down , saying , in her most capable way , `` I 'm going just as fast as I can , dear ."
"Do n't cry , and when we come to the road , I 'll carry you . ''"
`` Where is the road ? ''
and Robby wiped his eyes to look for it .
`` Over by that big tree .
Do n't you know that 's the one Ned tumbled out of ? ''
`` So it is .
May be they waited for us ; I 'd like to ride home would n't you ? ''
and Robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the great pasture .
"`` No , I 'd rather walk , '' answered Nan , feeling quite sure that she would be obliged to do so , and preparing her mind for it ."
"Another long trudge through the fast-deepening twilight and another disappointment , for when they reached the tree , they found to their dismay that it was not the one Ned climbed , and no road anywhere appeared ."
`` Are we lost ? ''
"quavered Rob , clasping his pail in despair ."
`` Not much .
"I do n't just see which way to go , and I guess we 'd better call . ''"
"Presently Wendy took the hat , because John said it struck against his knee as he flew ; and this , as we shall see , led to mischief , for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy ."
"In the black topper the light was completely hidden , and they flew on in silence ."
"It was the stillest silence they had ever known , broken once by a distant lapping , which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford , and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together , but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives ."
Even these noises ceased .
To Michael the loneliness was dreadful .
` If only something would make a sound ! '
he cried .
"As if in answer to his request , the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard ."
The pirates had fired Long Tom at them .
"The roar of it echoed through the mountains , and the echoes seemed to cry savagely , ` Where are they , where are they , where are they ? '"
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true .
"When at last the heavens were steady again , John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness ."
"John was treading the air mechanically , and Michael without knowing how to float was floating ."
` Are you shot ? '
John whispered tremulously . '
"I have n't tried yet , ' Michael whispered back ."
We know now that no one had been hit .
"Peter , however , had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea , while Wendy was blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell ."
It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat .
"I do n't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink , or whether she had planned it on the way , but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction ."
"Tink was not all bad : or , rather , she was all bad just now , but , on the other hand , sometimes she was all good ."
"Fairies have to be one thing or the other , because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time ."
"They are , however , allowed to change , only it must be a complete change ."
At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy .
"What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand , and I believe some of it was bad words , but it sounded kind , and she flew back and forward , plainly meaning ` Follow me , and all will be well . '"
What else could poor Wendy do ?
"She called to Peter and John and Michael , and got only mocking echoes in reply ."
She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman .
"And so , bewildered , and now staggering in her flight , she followed Tink to her doom ."
"CHAPTER V THE ISLAND COME TRUE Feeling that Peter was on his way back , the Neverland had again woke into life ."
"We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened , but woke is better and was always used by Peter ."
In his absence things are usually quiet on the island .
"The sheriff 's officer had run back at the first sound of the shot , to hasten the coming of the soldiers ."
"At last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road , and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger ."
"I believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses ; for he had no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill , crying out , `` The murderer !"
the murderer ! ''
"So little a time had elapsed , that when I got to the top of the first steepness , and could see some part of the open mountain , the murderer was still moving away at no great distance ."
"He was a big man , in a black coat , with metal buttons , and carried a long fowling-piece ."
`` Here ! ''
I cried .
`` I see him ! ''
"At that the murderer gave a little , quick look over his shoulder , and began to run ."
"The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches ; then he came out again on the upper side , where I could see him climbing like a jackanapes , for that part was again very steep ; and then he dipped behind a shoulder , and I saw him no more ."
"All this time I had been running on my side , and had got a good way up , when a voice cried upon me to stand ."
"I was at the edge of the upper wood , and so now , when I halted and looked back , I saw all the open part of the hill below me ."
"The lawyer and the sheriff 's officer were standing just above the road , crying and waving on me to come back ; and on their left , the red-coats , musket in hand , were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood ."
`` Why should I come back ? ''
I cried .
`` Come you on ! ''
`` Ten pounds if ye take that lad ! ''
cried the lawyer .
`` He 's an accomplice .
He was posted here to hold us in talk . ''
"At that word -LRB- which I could hear quite plainly , though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it -RRB- my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror ."
"Indeed , it is one thing to stand the danger of your life , and quite another to run the peril of both life and character ."
"The thing , besides , had come so suddenly , like thunder out of a clear sky , that I was all amazed and helpless ."
"The soldiers began to spread , some of them to run , and others to put up their pieces and cover me ; and still I stood ."
"`` Jock * in here among the trees , '' said a voice close by ."
* Duck .
"Indeed , I scarce knew what I was doing , but I obeyed ; and as I did so , I heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches ."
"Just inside the shelter of the trees I found Alan Breck standing , with a fishing-rod ."
He gave me no salutation ; indeed it was no time for civilities ; only `` Come ! ''
"says he , and set off running along the side of the mountain towards Balachulish ; and I , like a sheep , to follow him ."
Now we ran among the birches ; now stooping behind low humps upon the mountain-side ; now crawling on all fours among the heather .
Rilla felt Carl 's going keenly .
They had always been cronies and playmates .
He was only a little older than she was and they had been children in Rainbow Valley together .
She recalled all their old pranks and escapades as she walked slowly home alone .
"The full moon peeped through the scudding clouds with sudden floods of weird illumination , the telephone wires sang a shrill weird song in the wind , and the tall spikes of withered , grey-headed golden-rod in the fence corners swayed and beckoned wildly to her like groups of old witches weaving unholy spells ."
"On such a night as this , long ago , Carl would come over to Ingleside and whistle her out to the gate ."
"`` Let 's go on a moon-spree , Rilla , '' he would say , and the two of them would scamper off to Rainbow Valley ."
"Rilla had never been afraid of his beetles and bugs , though she drew a hard and fast line at snakes ."
"They used to talk together of almost everything and were teased about each other at school ; but one evening when they were about ten years of age they had solemnly promised , by the old spring in Rainbow Valley , that they would never marry each other ."
"Alice Clow had `` crossed out '' their names on her slate in school that day , and it came out that `` both married . ''"
"They did not like the idea at all , hence the mutual vow in Rainbow Valley ."
There was nothing like an ounce of prevention .
Rilla laughed over the old memory -- and then sighed .
That very day a dispatch from some London paper had contained the cheerful announcement that `` the present moment is the darkest since the war began . ''
"It was dark enough , and Rilla wished desperately that she could do something besides waiting and serving at home , as day after day the Glen boys she had known went away ."
"If she were only a boy , speeding in khaki by Carl 's side to the Western front !"
"She had wished that in a burst of romance when Jem had gone , without , perhaps , really meaning it ."
She meant it now .
"There were moments when waiting at home , in safety and comfort , seemed an unendurable thing ."
The moon burst triumphantly through an especially dark cloud and shadow and silver chased each other in waves over the Glen .
"Rilla remembered one moonlit evening of childhood when she had said to her mother , `` The moon just looks like a sorry , sorry face . ''"
"She thought it looked like that still -- an agonised , care-worn face , as though it looked down on dreadful sights ."
What did it see on the Western front ?
In broken Serbia ?
On shell-swept Gallipoli ?
"`` I am tired , '' Miss Oliver had said that day , in a rare outburst of impatience , `` of this horrible rack of strained emotions , when every day brings a new horror or the dread of it ."
"No , do n't look reproachfully at me , Mrs. Blythe ."
There 's nothing heroic about me today .
I 've slumped .
I wish England had left Belgium to her fate -- I wish Canada had never sent a man -- I wish we 'd tied our boys to our apron strings and not let one of them go .
Oh -- I shall be ashamed of myself in half an hour -- but at this very minute I mean every word of it .
Will the Allies never strike ? ''
"I turned my back , accordingly , upon the sea , and did not look again till I had counted many hundreds ."
The boat was still heading for the island .
"The next time I counted the full thousand , as slowly as I could , my heart beating so as to hurt me ."
And then it was out of all question .
She was coming straight to Earraid !
"I could no longer hold myself back , but ran to the seaside and out , from one rock to another , as far as I could go ."
"It is a marvel I was not drowned ; for when I was brought to a stand at last , my legs shook under me , and my mouth was so dry , I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout ."
All this time the boat was coming on ; and now I was able to perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday .
"This I knew by their hair , which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black ."
"But now there was a third man along with them , who looked to be of a better class ."
"As soon as they were come within easy speech , they let down their sail and lay quiet ."
"In spite of my supplications , they drew no nearer in , and what frightened me most of all , the new man tee-hee 'd with laughter as he talked and looked at me ."
"Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while , speaking fast and with many wavings of his hand ."
"I told him I had no Gaelic ; and at this he became very angry , and I began to suspect he thought he was talking English ."
"Listening very close , I caught the word `` whateffer '' several times ; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and Hebrew for me ."
"`` Whatever , '' said I , to show him I had caught a word ."
"`` Yes , yes -- yes , yes , '' says he , and then he looked at the other men , as much as to say , `` I told you I spoke English , '' and began again as hard as ever in the Gaelic ."
"This time I picked out another word , `` tide . ''"
Then I had a flash of hope .
I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the Ross .
`` Do you mean when the tide is out -- ? ''
"I cried , and could not finish ."
"`` Yes , yes , '' said he ."
`` Tide . ''
"At that I turned tail upon their boat -LRB- where my adviser had once more begun to tee-hee with laughter -RRB- , leaped back the way I had come , from one stone to another , and set off running across the isle as I had never run before ."
"In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the creek ; and , sure enough , it was shrunk into a little trickle of water , through which I dashed , not above my knees , and landed with a shout on the main island ."
"A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid ; which is only what they call a tidal islet , and except in the bottom of the neaps , can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours , either dry-shod , or at the most by wading ."
"Even I , who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay , and even watched for the ebbs , the better to get my shellfish -- even I -LRB- I say -RRB- if I had sat down to think , instead of raging at my fate , must have soon guessed the secret , and got free ."
It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me .
"The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion , and taken the trouble to come back ."
I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours .
"But for the fishers , I might have left my bones there , in pure folly ."
I do n't mind as long as Grandma is all right .
"She is away to-night , or I should not be here , '' he added , as if some excuse was necessary ."
"Merry needed no hint , for her tender heart was touched by the vision of her friend in a garret , and she suddenly rejoiced that there was ham and eggs for supper , so that he might be well fed once , at least , before he went away to feed on artistic crusts ."
"`` Being here , come in and spend the evening ."
"The boys will like to hear the news , and so will father ."
"Do , now . ''"
"It was impossible to refuse the invitation he had been longing for , and in they went to the great delight of Roxy , who instantly retired to the pantry , smiling significantly , and brought out the most elaborate pie in honor of the occasion ."
"Merry touched up the table , and put a little vase of flowers in the middle to redeem the vulgarity of doughnuts ."
"Of course the boys upset it , but as there was company nothing was said , and Ralph devoured his supper with the appetite of a hungry boy , while watching Merry eat bread and cream out of an old-fashioned silver porringer , and thinking it the sweetest sight he ever beheld ."
"Then the young people gathered about the table , full of the new plans , and the elders listened as they rested after the week 's work ."
"A pleasant evening , for they all liked Ralph , but as the parents watched Merry sitting among the great lads like a little queen among her subjects , half unconscious as yet of the power in her hands , they nodded to one another , and then shook their heads as if they said , -- `` I 'm afraid the time is coming , mother . ''"
"`` No danger as long as she do n't know it , father . ''"
"At nine the boys went off to the barn , the farmer to wind up the eight-day clock , and the housewife to see how the baked beans and Indian pudding for to-morrow were getting on in the oven ."
"Ralph took up his hat to go , saying as he looked at the shade on the tall student lamp , -- `` What a good light that gives !"
"I can see it as I go home every night , and it burns up here like a beacon ."
"I always look for it , and it hardly ever fails to be burning ."
"Sort of cheers up the way , you know , when I 'm tired or low in my mind . ''"
`` Then I 'm very glad I got it .
"I liked the shape , but the boys laughed at it as they did at my bulrushes in a ginger-jar over there ."
"I 'd been reading about ` household art , ' and I thought I 'd try a little , '' answered Merry , laughing at her own whims ."
"`` You 've got a better sort of household art , I think , for you make people happy and places pretty , without fussing over it ."
"This room is ever so much improved every time I come , though I hardly see what it is except the flowers , '' said Ralph , looking from the girl to the tall calla that bent its white cup above her as if to pour its dew upon her head ."
`` Is n't that lovely ?
I tried to draw it -- the shape was so graceful I wanted to keep it .
But I could n't .
Is n't it a pity such beautiful things wo n't last forever ? ''
and Merry looked regretfully at the half-faded one that grew beside the fresh blossom .
`` I can keep it for you .
It would look well in plaster .
May I ? ''
asked Ralph .
"`` Thank you , I should like that very much ."
The pace was deadly : my heart seemed bursting against my ribs ; and I had neither time to think nor breath to speak with .
"Only I remember seeing with wonder , that Alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height and look back ; and every time he did so , there came a great far-away cheering and crying of the soldiers ."
"Quarter of an hour later , Alan stopped , clapped down flat in the heather , and turned to me ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` it 's earnest ."
"Do as I do , for your life . ''"
"And at the same speed , but now with infinitely more precaution , we traced back again across the mountain-side by the same way that we had come , only perhaps higher ; till at last Alan threw himself down in the upper wood of Lettermore , where I had found him at the first , and lay , with his face in the bracken , panting like a dog ."
"My own sides so ached , my head so swam , my tongue so hung out of my mouth with heat and dryness , that I lay beside him like one dead ."
CHAPTER XVIII I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE Alan was the first to come round .
"He rose , went to the border of the wood , peered out a little , and then returned and sat down ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` yon was a hot burst , David . ''"
"I said nothing , nor so much as lifted my face ."
"I had seen murder done , and a great , ruddy , jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment ; the pity of that sight was still sore within me , and yet that was but a part of my concern ."
"Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated ; here was Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops ; and whether his was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered , signified but little ."
"By my way of it , my only friend in that wild country was blood-guilty in the first degree ; I held him in horror ; I could not look upon his face ; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold isle , than in that warm wood beside a murderer ."
`` Are ye still wearied ? ''
he asked again .
"`` No , '' said I , still with my face in the bracken ; `` no , I am not wearied now , and I can speak ."
"You and me must twine , '' * I said ."
"`` I liked you very well , Alan , but your ways are not mine , and they 're not God 's : and the short and the long of it is just that we must twine . ''"
* Part .
"`` I will hardly twine from ye , David , without some kind of reason for the same , '' said Alan , mighty gravely ."
"`` If ye ken anything against my reputation , it 's the least thing that ye should do , for old acquaintance ' sake , to let me hear the name of it ; and if ye have only taken a distaste to my society , it will be proper for me to judge if I 'm insulted . ''"
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` what is the sense of this ?"
Ye ken very well yon Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road . ''
"He was silent for a little ; then says he , `` Did ever ye hear tell of the story of the Man and the Good People ? ''"
-- by which he meant the fairies .
"`` No , '' said I , `` nor do I want to hear it . ''"
"`` With your permission , Mr. Balfour , I will tell it you , whatever , '' says Alan ."
"`` The man , ye should ken , was cast upon a rock in the sea , where it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went through to Ireland ."
"The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore , and it 's not far from where we suffered ship-wreck ."
"Well , it seems the man cried so sore , if he could just see his little bairn before he died !"
"that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him , and sent one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke * and laid it down beside the man where he lay sleeping ."
"`` Come on , Nat , '' he said , and slouched out again ."
"`` Thank you , ma'am , '' added Nat , as he followed him , feeling without quite understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his ungracious friend ."
`` The fellows are having a circus out in the barn ; do n't you want to come and see it ? ''
"he asked , as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn ."
`` Are they big fellows ? ''
said Dan .
`` No ; the big ones are gone fishing . ''
"`` Fire away , then , '' said Dan ."
"Nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set , who were disporting themselves among the half-empty lofts ."
"A large circle was marked out with hay on the wide floor , and in the middle stood Demi with a long whip , while Tommy , mounted on the much-enduring Toby , pranced about the circle playing being a monkey ."
"`` You must pay a pin apiece , or you ca n't see the show , '' said Stuffy , who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band , consisting of a pocket-comb blown upon by Ned , and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by Rob ."
"`` He 's company , so I 'll pay for both , '' said Nat , handsomely , as he stuck two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as money-box ."
"With a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards , and the performance went on ."
"After the monkey act , Ned gave them a fine specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair , and running up and down ladders , sailor fashion ."
Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity beautiful to behold .
"Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy , and speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground ."
"After this , Tommy proudly advanced to turn a somersault , an accomplishment which he had acquired by painful perseverance , practising in private till every joint of his little frame was black and blue ."
"His feats were received with great applause , and he was about to retire , flushed with pride and a rush of blood to the head , when a scornful voice in the audience was heard to say , `` Ho !"
that ai n't any thing ! ''
"`` Say that again , will you ? ''"
and Tommy bristled up like an angry turkey-cock .
`` Do you want to fight ? ''
"said Dan , promptly descending from the barrel and doubling up his fists in a business-like manner ."
"`` No , I do n't ; '' and the candid Thomas retired a step , rather taken aback by the proposition ."
`` Fighting is n't allowed ! ''
"cried the others , much excited ."
"`` You 're a nice lot , '' sneered Dan ."
"`` Come , if you do n't behave , you sha n't stay , '' said Nat , firing up at that insult to his friends ."
"`` I 'd like to see him do better than I did , that 's all , '' observed Tommy , with a swagger ."
"`` Clear the way , then , '' and without the slightest preparation Dan turned three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet ."
"`` You ca n't beat that , Tom ; you always hit your head and tumble flat , '' said Nat , pleased at his friend 's success ."
"Before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more somersaults backwards , and a short promenade on the hands , head down , feet up ."
"Here 's Dan now , full of stories about birds , and bugs , and so on ; let him take care of the museum , and once a week the rest of you take turns to read a composition , or tell about some animal , mineral , or vegetable ."
"We should all like that , and I think it would put considerable useful knowledge into our heads ."
"What do you say , Professor ? ''"
"`` I like it much , and will give the lads all the help I can ."
"But they will need books to read up these new subjects , and we have not many , I fear , '' began Mr. Bhaer , looking much pleased , planning many fine lectures on geology , which he liked ."
`` We should have a library for the special purpose . ''
"`` Is that a useful sort of book , Dan ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , pointing to the volume that lay open by the cabinet ."
"`` Oh , yes !"
it tells all I want to know about insects .
I had it here to see how to fix the butterflies right .
"I covered it , so it is not hurt ; '' and Dan caught it up , fearing the lender might think him careless ."
"`` Give it here a minute ; '' and , pulling out his pencil , Mr. Laurie wrote Dan 's name in it , saying , as he set the book up on one of the corner shelves , where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail , `` There , that is the beginning of the museum library ."
"I 'll hunt up some more books , and Demi shall keep them in order ."
"Where are those jolly little books we used to read , Jo ?"
"` Insect Architecture ' or some such name , all about ants having battles , and bees having queens , and crickets eating holes in our clothes and stealing milk , and larks of that sort . ''"
`` In the garret at home .
"I 'll have them sent out , and we will plunge into Natural History with a will , '' said Mrs. Jo , ready for any thing ."
`` Wo n't it be hard to write about such things ? ''
"asked Nat , who hated compositions ."
"`` At first , perhaps ; but you will soon like it ."
"If you think that hard , how would you like to have this subject given to you , as it was to a girl of thirteen : A conversation between Themistocles , Aristides , and Pericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of Delos for the ornamentation of Athens ? ''"
said Mrs. Jo .
"The boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names , and the gentlemen laughed at the absurdity of the lesson ."
`` Did she write it ? ''
"asked Demi , in an awe-stricken tone ."
"`` Yes , but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it , though she was rather a bright child . ''"
"`` I 'd like to have seen it , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Perhaps I can find it for you ; I went to school with her , '' and Mrs. Jo looked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was ."
Hearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled the boys to the thought of writing about familiar things .
"Wednesday afternoon was appointed for the lectures , as they preferred to call them , for some chose to talk instead of write ."
"Mr. Bhaer promised a portfolio in which the written productions should be kept , and Mrs. Bhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure ."
"The doctor and his wife went to the Manse , Shirley and Miss Oliver went they alone knew where , Susan went to the store for household supplies , and Jims went to Dreamland ."
"Rilla put on her georgette gown , knotted up her hair and bound a little double string of pearls around it ."
Then she tucked a cluster of pale pink baby roses at her belt .
Would Ken ask her for a rose for a keepsake ?
She knew that Jem had carried to the trenches in Flanders a faded rose that Faith Meredith had kissed and given him the night before he left .
Rilla looked very sweet when she met Ken in the mingled moonlight and vine shadows of the big veranda .
The hand she gave him was cold and she was so desperately anxious not to lisp that her greeting was prim and precise .
How handsome and tall Kenneth looked in his lieutenant 's uniform !
"It made him seem older , too -- so much so that Rilla felt rather foolish ."
"Had n't it been the height of absurdity for her to suppose that this splendid young officer had anything special to say to her , little Rilla Blythe of Glen St. Mary ?"
"Likely she had n't understood him after all -- he had only meant that he did n't want a mob of folks around making a fuss over him and trying to lionize him , as they had probably done over-harbour ."
"Yes , of course , that was all he meant -- and she , little idiot , had gone and vainly imagined that he did n't want anybody but her ."
"And he would think she had manoeuvred everybody away so that they could be alone together , and he would laugh to himself at her ."
"`` This is better luck than I hoped for , '' said Ken , leaning back in his chair and looking at her with very unconcealed admiration in his eloquent eyes ."
"`` I was sure someone would be hanging about and it was just you I wanted to see , Rilla-my-Rilla . ''"
Rilla 's dream castle flashed into the landscape again .
This was unmistakable enough certainly -- not much doubt as to his meaning here .
"`` There are n't -- so many of us -- to poke around as there used to be , '' she said softly ."
"`` No , that 's so , '' said Ken gently ."
"`` Jem and Walter and the girls away -- it makes a big blank , does n't it ?"
But -- '' he leaned forward until his dark curls almost brushed her hair -- `` does n't Fred Arnold try to fill the blank occasionally .
I 've been told so . ''
"At this moment , before Rilla could make any reply , Jims began to cry at the top of his voice in the room whose open window was just above them -- Jims , who hardly ever cried in the evening ."
"Moreover , he was crying , as Rilla knew from experience , with a vim and energy that betokened that he had been already whimpering softly unheard for some time and was thoroughly exasperated ."
When Jims started in crying like that he made a thorough job of it .
Rilla knew that there was no use to sit still and pretend to ignore him .
He would n't stop ; and conversation of any kind was out of the question when such shrieks and howls were floating over your head .
"Besides , she was afraid Kenneth would think she was utterly unfeeling if she sat still and let a baby cry like that ."
He was not likely acquainted with Morgan 's invaluable volume .
She got up .
"`` Jims has had a nightmare , I think ."
He sometimes has one and he is always badly frightened by it .
Let 's have a go of the rum . ''
"`` Dick , '' said Silver , `` I trust you ."
"I 've a gauge on the keg , mind ."
There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . ''
"Terrified as I was , I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him ."
"Dick was gone but a little while , and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook 's ear ."
"It was but a word or two that I could catch , and yet I gathered some important news , for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : `` Not another man of them 'll jine . ''"
Hence there were still faithful men on board .
"When Dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one `` To luck , '' another with a `` Here 's to old Flint , '' and Silver himself saying , in a kind of song , `` Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff . ''"
"Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and looking up , I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted , `` Land ho ! ''"
12 Council of War THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck .
"I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slipping in an instant outside my barrel , I dived behind the fore-sail , made a double towards the stern , and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow ."
There all hands were already congregated .
A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon .
"Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills , about a couple of miles apart , and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill , whose peak was still buried in the fog ."
All three seemed sharp and conical in figure .
"So much I saw , almost in a dream , for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before ."
And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders .
The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east .
"`` And now , men , '' said the captain , when all was sheeted home , `` has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ? ''"
"`` I have , sir , '' said Silver ."
`` I 've watered there with a trader I was cook in . ''
"`` The anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? ''"
asked the captain .
"`` Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they calls it ."
"It were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it ."
"That hill to the nor ` ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill ; there are three hills in a row running south ` ard -- fore , main , and mizzen , sir ."
"But the main -- that 's the big un , with the cloud on it -- they usually calls the Spy-glass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon . ''"
"`` I have a chart here , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` See if that 's the place . ''
"Long John 's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment ."
"This was not the map we found in Billy Bones 's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all things -- names and heights and soundings -- with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes ."
"I should , I think , have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face ."
"It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness -- a haggard old man 's smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work ."
"26 Israel Hands THE wind , serving us to a desire , now hauled into the west ."
We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet .
"Only , as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther , time hung on our hands ."
"The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to ; after a good many trials I succeeded , and we both sat in silence over another meal ."
"`` Cap'n , '' said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile , `` here 's my old shipmate , O'Brien ; s ` pose you was to heave him overboard ."
"I ai n't partic ` lar as a rule , and I do n't take no blame for settling his hash , but I do n't reckon him ornamental now , do you ? ''"
"`` I 'm not strong enough , and I do n't like the job ; and there he lies , for me , '' said I. `` This here 's an unlucky ship , this HISPANIOLA , Jim , '' he went on , blinking ."
`` There 's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA -- a sight o ' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol .
"I never seen sich dirty luck , not I ."
"There was this here O'Brien now -- he 's dead , ai n't he ?"
"Well now , I 'm no scholar , and you 're a lad as can read and figure , and to put it straight , do you take it as a dead man is dead for good , or do he come alive again ? ''"
"`` You can kill the body , Mr. Hands , but not the spirit ; you must know that already , '' I replied ."
"`` O'Brien there is in another world , and may be watching us . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
says he .
"`` Well , that 's unfort ` nate -- appears as if killing parties was a waste of time ."
"Howsomever , sperrits do n't reckon for much , by what I 've seen ."
"I 'll chance it with the sperrits , Jim ."
"And now , you 've spoke up free , and I 'll take it kind if you 'd step down into that there cabin and get me a -- well , a -- shiver my timbers !"
"I ca n't hit the name on ` t ; well , you get me a bottle of wine , Jim -- this here brandy 's too strong for my head . ''"
"Now , the coxswain 's hesitation seemed to be unnatural , and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy , I entirely disbelieved it ."
The whole story was a pretext .
He wanted me to leave the deck -- so much was plain ; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine .
"His eyes never met mine ; they kept wandering to and fro , up and down , now with a look to the sky , now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien ."
"All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty , embarrassed manner , so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception ."
"I was prompt with my answer , however , for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end ."
`` Some wine ? ''
I said .
`` Far better .
Will you have white or red ? ''
Then pare your squash and potatoes . ''
"`` There is only one potato , '' giggled Sally ."
"`` Cut it in four pieces , so it will go into the little kettle , and put the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them . ''"
`` Do I soak the squash too ? ''
"`` No , indeed !"
"Just pare it and cut it up , and put in into the steamer over the pot ."
"It is drier so , though it takes longer to cook . ''"
"Here a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it , when Kit appeared with a covered basket in his mouth ."
`` Here 's the butcher boy ! ''
"cried Daisy , much tickled at the idea , as she relieved him of his load , whereat he licked his lips and began to beg , evidently thinking that it was his own dinner , for he often carried it to his master in that way ."
"Being undeceived , he departed in great wrath and barked all the way downstairs , to ease his wounded feelings ."
"In the basket were two bits of steak -LRB- doll 's pounds -RRB- , a baked pear , a small cake , and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled , `` For Missy 's lunch , if her cookin ' do n't turn out well . ''"
"`` I do n't want any of her old pears and things ; my cooking will turn out well , and I 'll have a splendid dinner ; see if I do n't ! ''"
"cried Daisy , indignantly ."
`` We may like them if company should come .
"It is always well to have something in the storeroom , '' said Aunt Jo , who had been taught this valuable fact by a series of domestic panics ."
"`` Me is hundry , '' announced Teddy , who began to think what with so much cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something ."
"His mother gave him her workbasket to rummage , hoping to keep him quiet till dinner was ready , and returned to her housekeeping ."
"`` Put on your vegetables , set the table , and then have some coals kindling ready for the steak . ''"
"What a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot ; to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer ; to whisk open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on , and at last when the coals were red and glowing , to put two real steaks on a finger-long gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork ."
"The potatoes were done first , and no wonder , for they had boiled frantically all the while ."
"The were pounded up with a little pestle , had much butter and no salt put in -LRB- cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment -RRB- , then it was made into a mound in a gay red dish , smoothed over with a knife dipped in milk , and put in the oven to brown ."
"So absorbed in these last performances had Sally been , that she forgot her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato , then a wail arose , for alas !"
alas !
the little pies were burnt black !
"`` Oh , my pies !"
My darling pies !
They are all spoilt ! ''
"cried poor Sally , wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work ."
"The tart was especially pathetic , for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in all directions from the blackened jelly , like the walls and chimney of a house after a fire ."
"`` Dear , dear , I forgot to remind you to take them out ; it 's just my luck , '' said Aunt Jo , remorsefully ."
"`` Do n't cry , darling , it was my fault ; we 'll try again after dinner , '' she added , as a great tear dropped from Sally 's eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart ."
"Jims writhed in those big , firm , capable hands of Mary -- oh yes , she is capable all right -- and choked and wheezed -- and choked and wheezed -- and I felt that he was being tortured to death -- and then all at once , after what seemed to me an hour , though it really was n't long , he coughed up the membrane that was killing him ."
Mary turned him over and laid him back on his bed .
He was white as marble and the tears were pouring out of his brown eyes -- but that awful livid look was gone from his face and he could breathe quite easily . ''
` Was n't that some trick ? '
said Mary gaily . '
"I had n't any idea how it would work , but I just took a chance ."
"I 'll smoke his throat out again once or twice before morning , just to kill all the germs , but you 'll see he 'll be all right now . '"
"`` Jims went right to sleep -- real sleep , not coma , as I feared at first ."
"Mary ` smoked him , ' as she called it , twice through the night , and at daylight his throat was perfectly clear and his temperature was almost normal ."
When I made sure of that I turned and looked at Mary Vance .
She was sitting on the lounge laying down the law to Susan on some subject about which Susan must have known forty times as much as she did .
But I did n't mind how much law she laid down or how much she bragged .
"She had a right to brag -- she had dared to do what I would never have dared , and had saved Jims from a horrible death ."
It did n't matter any more that she had once chased me through the Glen with a codfish ; it did n't matter that she had smeared goose-grease all over my dream of romance the night of the lighthouse dance ; it did n't matter that she thought she knew more than anybody else and always rubbed it in -- I would never dislike Mary Vance again .
I went over to her and kissed her . ''
` What 's up now ? '
she said . ''
"` Nothing -- only I 'm so grateful to you , Mary . ' ''"
"` Well , I think you ought to be , that 's a fact ."
"You two would have let that baby die on your hands if I had n't happened along , ' said Mary , just beaming with complacency ."
"She got Susan and me a tip-top breakfast and made us eat it , and ` bossed the life out of us , ' as Susan says , for two days , until the roads were opened so that she could get home ."
"Jims was almost well by that time , and father turned up ."
He heard our tale without saying much .
Father is rather scornful generally about what he calls ` old wives ' remedies . '
"He laughed a little and said , ` After this , Mary Vance will expect me to call her in for consultation in all my serious cases . '"
"`` So Christmas was not so hard as I expected it to be ; and now the New Year is coming -- and we are still hoping for the ` Big Push ' that will end the war -- and Little Dog Monday is getting stiff and rheumatic from his cold vigils , but still he ` carries on , ' and Shirley continues to read the exploits of the aces ."
"Oh , nineteen-seventeen , what will you bring ? ''"
"CHAPTER XXV SHIRLEY GOES `` No , Woodrow , there will be no peace without victory , '' said Susan , sticking her knitting needle viciously through President Wilson 's name in the newspaper column ."
"`` We Canadians mean to have peace and victory , too ."
"You , if it pleases you , Woodrow , can have the peace without the victory '' -- and Susan stalked off to bed with the comfortable consciousness of having got the better of the argument with the President ."
But a few days later she rushed to Mrs. Blythe in red-hot excitement .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , what do you think ?"
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"`` Brave , brave ! ''"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight came on , and scores and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , `` So that 's all right . ''"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"She was about to say , `` I never knew you could speak ! ''"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , `` I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? ''"
"and the elm replied , `` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , '' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca Holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her .
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , when Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this , he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow ."
"`` Oh , you naughty , naughty child ! ''"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but the chrysanthemums heard her , and they all said so pointedly `` Hoity-toity , what is this ? ''"
"When the dusk came , Ernest and Maxwell had to catch the last train for town , and the other guests went home , with the exception of Bertha , who was to stay all night ."
"Just as soon as her resignation could be effected , she was to join her brother ."
"`` Meanwhile , I 'll see about getting a house to put you in , '' said Max ."
"`` No more boarding out for me , Ernest ."
You may consider me as a family man henceforth . ''
Frances and Alma talked it all over before they went to sleep that night .
"`` Just think , '' said Frances , `` if we had n't asked her here today she might never have found her brother !"
"It 's all Mother 's doing , bless her !"
"Things do happen like a storybook sometimes , do n't they , Al ?"

A Correspondence and A Climax At sunset Sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking .
She had milked eight cows and pumped water for the milk-cans afterward in the fag-end of a hot summer day .
"She did that every night , but tonight she had hurried more than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the early farm bedtime ."
She had been thinking it out while she milked the cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn .
This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life .
"Existence would have been , so Sidney thought , a dreary , unbearable blank without it ."
She cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to her rosy fingertips .
As she slipped into her blue-print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below .
Sidney ran out to the dark little entry and leaned over the stair railing .
"Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing , crying , quarrelling children , and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl 's disgusted nostrils ."
Aunt Jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year-old baby clinging to the other .
She was a big shapeless woman with a round good-natured face -- cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions .
"`` I want to run over and see how Mrs. Brixby is this evening , Siddy , and you must take care of the baby till I get back . ''"
Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby .
It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it .
"She had all her aunt 's sweetness of disposition , if she resembled her in nothing else ."
"She had not grumbled because she had to rise at four that morning , get breakfast , milk the cows , bake bread , prepare seven children for school , get dinner , preserve twenty quarts of strawberries , get tea , and milk the cows again ."
"All her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went , but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly ."
But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter .
"She carried the baby to her room , spread a quilt on the floor for him to sit on , and gave him a box of empty spools to play with ."
"Fortunately he was a phlegmatic infant , fond of staying in one place , and not given to roaming about in search of adventures ; but Sidney knew she would have to keep an eye on him , and it would be distracting to literary effort ."
She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow .
Dick exclaimed .
`` Small blame to him .
"Ye look liker maid than man ; and I tell you more -- y ' are a strange-looking rogue for a boy ; but for a hussy , Jack , ye would be right fair -- ye would ."
Ye would be well favoured for a wench . ''
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , `` ye know right well that I am none . ''"
"`` Nay , I know that ; I do but jest , '' said Dick ."
"`` Ye 'll be a man before your mother , Jack ."
"What cheer , my bully !"
Ye shall strike shrewd strokes .
"Now , which , I marvel , of you or me , shall be first knighted , Jack ?"
"for knighted I shall be , or die for ` t. ` Sir Richard Shelton , Knight ' : it soundeth bravely ."
But ` Sir John Matcham ' soundeth not amiss . ''
"`` Prithee , Dick , stop till I drink , '' said the other , pausing where a little clear spring welled out of the slope into a gravelled basin no bigger than a pocket ."
"`` And O , Dick , if I might come by anything to eat !"
-- my very heart aches with hunger . ''
"`` Why , fool , did ye not eat at Kettley ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` I had made a vow -- it was a sin I had been led into , '' stammered Matcham ; `` but now , if it were but dry bread , I would eat it greedily . ''"
"`` Sit ye , then , and eat , '' said Dick , `` while that I scout a little forward for the road . ''"
"And he took a wallet from his girdle , wherein were bread and pieces of dry bacon , and , while Matcham fell heartily to , struck farther forth among the trees ."
"A little beyond there was a dip in the ground , where a streamlet soaked among dead leaves ; and beyond that , again , the trees were better grown and stood wider , and oak and beech began to take the place of willow and elm ."
"The continued tossing and pouring of the wind among the leaves sufficiently concealed the sounds of his footsteps on the mast ; it was for the ear what a moonless night is to the eye ; but for all that Dick went cautiously , slipping from one big trunk to another , and looking sharply about him as he went ."
"Suddenly a doe passed like a shadow through the underwood in front of him , and he paused , disgusted at the chance ."
"This part of the wood had been certainly deserted , but now that the poor deer had run , she was like a messenger he should have sent before him to announce his coming ; and instead of pushing farther , he turned him to the nearest well-grown tree , and rapidly began to climb ."
Luck had served him well .
"The oak on which he had mounted was one of the tallest in that quarter of the wood , and easily out-topped its neighbours by a fathom and a half ; and when Dick had clambered into the topmost fork and clung there , swinging dizzily in the great wind , he saw behind him the whole fenny plain as far as Kettley , and the Till wandering among woody islets , and in front of him , the white line of high-road winding through the forest ."
The boat had been righted -- it was even now midway on the ferry .
"Beyond that there was no sign of man , nor aught moving but the wind ."
"He was about to descend , when , taking a last view , his eye lit upon a string of moving points about the middle of the fen ."
"Plainly a small troop was threading the causeway , and that at a good pace ; and this gave him some concern as he shinned vigorously down the trunk and returned across the wood for his companion ."
"CHAPTER IV -- A GREENWOOD COMPANY Matcham was well rested and revived ; and the two lads , winged by what Dick had seen , hurried through the remainder of the outwood , crossed the road in safety , and began to mount into the high ground of Tunstall Forest ."
"The trees grew more and more in groves , with heathy places in between , sandy , gorsy , and dotted with old yews ."
"`` I did so , sir , for my sins , '' said I ; `` for it was by his means and the procurement of my uncle , that I was kidnapped within sight of this town , carried to sea , suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships , and stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement . ''"
"`` You say you were shipwrecked , '' said Rankeillor ; `` where was that ? ''"
"`` Off the south end of the Isle of Mull , '' said I. `` The name of the isle on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"says he , smiling , `` you are deeper than me in the geography ."
"But so far , I may tell you , this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that I hold ."
But you say you were kidnapped ; in what sense ? ''
"`` In the plain meaning of the word , sir , '' said I. `` I was on my way to your house , when I was trepanned on board the brig , cruelly struck down , thrown below , and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea ."
"I was destined for the plantations ; a fate that , in God 's providence , I have escaped . ''"
"`` The brig was lost on June the 27th , '' says he , looking in his book , `` and we are now at August the 24th ."
"Here is a considerable hiatus , Mr. Balfour , of near upon two months ."
It has already caused a vast amount of trouble to your friends ; and I own I shall not be very well contented until it is set right . ''
"`` Indeed , sir , '' said I , `` these months are very easily filled up ; but yet before I told my story , I would be glad to know that I was talking to a friend . ''"
"`` This is to argue in a circle , '' said the lawyer ."
`` I can not be convinced till I have heard you .
I can not be your friend till I am properly informed .
"If you were more trustful , it would better befit your time of life ."
"And you know , Mr. Balfour , we have a proverb in the country that evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders . ''"
"`` You are not to forget , sir , '' said I , `` that I have already suffered by my trustfulness ; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that -LRB- if I rightly understand -RRB- is your employer ? ''"
"All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor , and in proportion as I gained ground , gaining confidence ."
"But at this sally , which I made with something of a smile myself , he fairly laughed aloud ."
"`` No , no , '' said he , `` it is not so bad as that ."
"Fui , non sum ."
"I was indeed your uncle 's man of business ; but while you -LRB- imberbis juvenis custode remoto -RRB- were gallivanting in the west , a good deal of water has run under the bridges ; and if your ears did not sing , it was not for lack of being talked about ."
"On the very day of your sea disaster , Mr. Campbell stalked into my office , demanding you from all the winds ."
I had never heard of your existence ; but I had known your father ; and from matters in my competence -LRB- to be touched upon hereafter -RRB- I was disposed to fear the worst .
"Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you ; declared -LRB- what seemed improbable -RRB- that he had given you considerable sums ; and that you had started for the continent of Europe , intending to fulfil your education , which was probable and praiseworthy ."
"Interrogated how you had come to send no word to Mr. Campbell , he deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past life ."
"Further interrogated where you now were , protested ignorance , but believed you were in Leyden ."
That is a close sum of his replies .
"I am not exactly sure that any one believed him , '' continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile ; `` and in particular he so much disrelished me expressions of mine that -LRB- in a word -RRB- he showed me to the door ."
"We were then at a full stand ; for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain , we had no shadow of probation ."
"So saying , the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door ."
"I was very uneasy and alarmed , as you may fancy , and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself ."
He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath ; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat .
"At last in strode the captain , slammed the door behind him , without looking to the right or left , and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him ."
"`` Bill , '' said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big ."
"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us ; all the brown had gone out of his face , and even his nose was blue ; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost , or the evil one , or something worse , if anything can be ; and upon my word , I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick ."
"`` Come , Bill , you know me ; you know an old shipmate , Bill , surely , '' said the stranger ."
The captain made a sort of gasp .
`` Black Dog ! ''
said he .
`` And who else ? ''
"returned the other , getting more at his ease ."
"`` Black Dog as ever was , come for to see his old shipmate Billy , at the Admiral Benbow inn ."
"Ah , Bill , Bill , we have seen a sight of times , us two , since I lost them two talons , '' holding up his mutilated hand ."
"`` Now , look here , '' said the captain ; `` you 've run me down ; here I am ; well , then , speak up ; what is it ? ''"
"`` That 's you , Bill , '' returned Black Dog , `` you 're in the right of it , Billy ."
"I 'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here , as I 've took such a liking to ; and we 'll sit down , if you please , and talk square , like old shipmates . ''"
"When I returned with the rum , they were already seated on either side of the captain 's breakfast-table -- Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one , as I thought , on his retreat ."
He bade me go and leave the door wide open .
"`` None of your keyholes for me , sonny , '' he said ; and I left them together and retired into the bar ."
"For a long time , though I certainly did my best to listen , I could hear nothing but a low gattling ; but at last the voices began to grow higher , and I could pick up a word or two , mostly oaths , from the captain ."
"`` No , no , no , no ; and an end of it ! ''"
he cried once .
"And again , `` If it comes to swinging , swing all , say I. '' Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises -- the chair and table went over in a lump , a clash of steel followed , and then a cry of pain , and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight , and the captain hotly pursuing , both with drawn cutlasses , and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder ."
"Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut , which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow ."
You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day .
That blow was the last of the battle .
"Once out upon the road , Black Dog , in spite of his wound , showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute ."
"The captain , for his part , stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man ."
Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house .
"`` Jim , '' says he , `` rum '' ; and as he spoke , he reeled a little , and caught himself with one hand against the wall ."
`` Are you hurt ? ''
"We can count , I take it , on your own home servants , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
"`` As upon myself , '' declared the squire ."
"`` Three , '' reckoned the captain ; `` ourselves make seven , counting Hawkins here ."
"Now , about the honest hands ? ''"
"`` Most likely Trelawney 's own men , '' said the doctor ; `` those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver . ''"
"`` Nay , '' replied the squire ."
`` Hands was one of mine . ''
"`` I did think I could have trusted Hands , '' added the captain ."
`` And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! ''
broke out the squire .
"`` Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . ''"
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' said the captain , `` the best that I can say is not much ."
"We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout ."
"It 's trying on a man , I know ."
It would be pleasanter to come to blows .
But there 's no help for it till we know our men .
"Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . ''"
"`` Jim here , '' said the doctor , `` can help us more than anyone ."
"The men are not shy with him , and Jim is a noticing lad . ''"
"`` Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , '' added the squire ."
"I began to feel pretty desperate at this , for I felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstances , it was indeed through me that safety came ."
"In the meantime , talk as we pleased , there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely ; and out of these seven one was a boy , so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen ."
PART THREE -- My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed .
"Although the breeze had now utterly ceased , we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast ."
Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface .
"This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands , and by many tall trees of the pine family , out-topping the others -- some singly , some in clumps ; but the general colouring was uniform and sad ."
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock .
"All were strangely shaped , and the Spy-glass , which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island , was likewise the strangest in configuration , running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on ."
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell .
"The booms were tearing at the blocks , the rudder was banging to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jumping like a manufactory ."
"I had to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turned giddily before my eyes , for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on , this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach ."
"Perhaps it was this -- perhaps it was the look of the island , with its grey , melancholy woods , and wild stone spires , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach -- at least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us , and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea , my heart sank , as the saying is , into my boots ; and from the first look onward , I hated the very thought of Treasure Island ."
"I know that Jem and Jerry are in the trenches -- that Ken and Walter will be soon -- that if one of them does not come back my heart will break -- yet I go on and work and plan -- yes , and even enjoy life by times ."
"There are moments when we have real fun because , just for the moment , we do n't think about things and then -- we remember -- and the remembering is worse than thinking of it all the time would have been ."
"`` Today was dark and cloudy and tonight is wild enough , as Gertrude says , to please any novelist in search of suitable matter for a murder or elopement ."
"The raindrops streaming over the panes look like tears running down a face , and the wind is shrieking through the maple grove ."
`` This has n't been a nice Christmas Day in any way .
"Nan had toothache and Susan had red eyes , and assumed a weird and gruesome flippancy of manner to deceive us into thinking she had n't ; and Jims had a bad cold all day and I 'm afraid of croup ."
He has had croup twice since October .
"The first time I was nearly frightened to death , for father and mother were both away -- father always is away , it seems to me , when any of this household gets sick ."
"But Susan was cool as a fish and knew just what to do , and by morning Jims was all right ."
That child is a cross between a duck and an imp .
"He 's a year and four months old , trots about everywhere , and says quite a few words ."
He has the cutest little way of calling me `` Willa-will . ''
"It always brings back that dreadful , ridiculous , delightful night when Ken came to say good-bye , and I was so furious and happy ."
Jims is pink and white and big-eyed and curly-haired and every now and then I discover a new dimple in him .
"I can never quite believe he is really the same creature as that scrawny , yellow , ugly little changeling I brought home in the soup tureen ."
Nobody has ever heard a word from Jim Anderson .
If he never comes back I shall keep Jims always .
Everybody here worships and spoils him -- or would spoil him if Morgan and I did n't stand remorselessly in the way .
Susan says Jims is the cleverest child she ever saw and can recognize Old Nick when he sees him -- this because Jims threw poor Doc out of an upstairs window one day .
"Doc turned into Mr. Hyde on his way down and landed in a currant bush , spitting and swearing ."
"I tried to console his inner cat with a saucer of milk but he would have none of it , and remained Mr. Hyde the rest of the day ."
Jims 's latest exploit was to paint the cushion of the big arm-chair in the sun parlour with molasses ; and before anybody found it out Mrs. Fred Clow came in on Red Cross business and sat down on it .
Her new silk dress was ruined and nobody could blame her for being vexed .
"But she went into one of her tempers and said nasty things and gave me such slams about ` spoiling ' Jims that I nearly boiled over , too ."
But I kept the lid on till she had waddled away and then I exploded . ''
"` The fat , clumsy , horrid old thing , ' I said -- and oh , what a satisfaction it was to say it . ''"
"` She has three sons at the front , ' mother said rebukingly . '' '"
"I suppose that covers all her shortcomings in manners , ' I retorted ."
But I was ashamed -- for it is true that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too ; and she is a perfect tower of strength in the Red Cross .
It 's a little hard to remember all the heroines .
"Just the same , it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when everybody is -- or should be -- trying to ` save and serve . '"
`` I had to bring out my green velvet hat again lately and begin wearing it .
"Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their altered situation ; ten men , it was decided between them , should be reserved , not only to garrison the Moat House , but to escort the priest across the wood ."
"In the meantime , as Bennet was to remain behind , the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton ."
"Indeed , there was no choice ; the men were loutish fellows , dull and unskilled in war , while Dick was not only popular , but resolute and grave beyond his age ."
"Although his youth had been spent in these rough , country places , the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver , and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command ."
"Bennet had always been kind and helpful ; he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies , but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends ; and now , while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write , in his swift , exquisite penmanship , a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master , Sir Daniel Brackley , Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise ."
"`` Ye must go the long way about , Master Shelton , '' he said ; `` round by the bridge , for your life !"
"Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you , to draw shots ; and go softly till y ' are past the wood ."
"If the rogues fall upon you , ride for ` t ; ye will do naught by standing ."
"And keep ever forward , Master Shelton ; turn me not back again , an ye love your life ; there is no help in Tunstall , mind ye that ."
"And now , since ye go to the great wars about the king , and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life , and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below , I give you my last counsels now at your riding ."
Keep an eye on Sir Daniel ; he is unsure .
"Put not your trust in the jack-priest ; he intendeth not amiss , but doth the will of others ; it is a hand-gun for Sir Daniel !"
Get your good lordship where ye go ; make you strong friends ; look to it .
And think ever a pater-noster-while on Bennet Hatch .
There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet .
"So , God-speed ! ''"
"`` And Heaven be with you , Bennet ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Ye were a good friend to me-ward , and so I shall say ever . ''"
"`` And , look ye , master , '' added Hatch , with a certain embarrassment , `` if this Amend-All should get a shaft into me , ye might , mayhap , lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul ; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory . ''"
"`` Ye shall have your will of it , Bennet , '' answered Dick ."
"`` But , what cheer , man !"
"we shall meet again , where ye shall have more need of ale than masses . ''"
"`` The saints so grant it , Master Dick ! ''"
returned the other .
`` But here comes Sir Oliver .
"An he were as quick with the long-bow as with the pen , he would be a brave man-at-arms . ''"
"Sir Oliver gave Dick a sealed packet , with this superscription : `` To my ryght worchypful master , Sir Daniel Brackley , knyght , be thys delyvered in haste . ''"
"And Dick , putting it in the bosom of his jacket , gave the word and set forth westward up the village ."
"BOOK I -- THE TWO LADS CHAPTER I -- AT THE SIGN OF THE SUN IN KETTLEY Sir Daniel and his men lay in and about Kettley that night , warmly quartered and well patrolled ."
"But the Knight of Tunstall was one who never rested from money-getting ; and even now , when he was on the brink of an adventure which should make or mar him , he was up an hour after midnight to squeeze poor neighbours ."
"He was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances ; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant , and then , by the favour he curried with great lords about the king , procure unjust decisions in his favour ; or , if that was too roundabout , to seize the disputed manor by force of arms , and rely on his influence and Sir Oliver 's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched ."
"we 'll say hunting -- they found a little damsel lying on the snow , half dead with cold , they thought ."
"She was the child of a poor woman who lived in the forest -- a wild little thing , always dancing and singing about ; as hard to catch as a squirrel , and so fearless she would climb the highest trees , leap broad brooks , or jump off the steep rocks to show her courage ."
"The boys carried her home to the palace , and the queen was glad to have her ."
"She had fallen and hurt herself , so she lay in bed week after week , with her mother to take care of her -- '' `` That 's you , '' whispered Jack , throwing the white carnation at Jill , and she threw back the red one , with her finger on her lips , for the tale was very interesting now ."
"`` She did not suffer much after a time , but she scolded and cried , and could not be resigned , because she was a prisoner ."
"The queen tried to help her , but she could not do much ; the princes were kind , but they had their books and plays , and were away a good deal ."
"Some friends she had came often to see her , but still she beat her wings against the bars , like a wild bird in a cage , and soon her spirits were all gone , and it was sad to see her . ''"
`` Where was your Saint Lucy ?
"I thought it was about her , '' asked Jack , who did not like to have Jill 's past troubles dwelt upon , since his were not ."
`` She is coming .
"Saints are not born -- they are made after many trials and tribulations , '' answered his mother , looking at the fire as if it helped her to spin her little story ."
"`` Well , the poor child used to sing sometimes to while away the long hours -- sad songs mostly , and one among them which the queen taught her was ` Sweet Patience , Come . '"
"`` This she used to sing a great deal after a while , never dreaming that Patience was an angel who could hear and obey ."
"But it was so ; and one night , when the girl had lulled herself to sleep with that song , the angel came ."
"Nobody saw the lovely spirit with tender eyes , and a voice that was like balm ."
"No one heard the rustle of wings as she hovered over the little bed and touched the lips , the eyes , the hands of the sleeper , and then flew away , leaving three gifts behind ."
"The girl did not know why , but after that night the songs grew gayer , there seemed to be more sunshine everywhere her eyes looked , and her hands were never tired of helping others in various pretty , useful , or pleasant ways ."
"Slowly the wild bird ceased to beat against the bars , but sat in its cage and made music for all in the palace , till the queen could not do without it , the poor mother cheered up , and the princes called the girl their nightingale . ''"
`` Was that the miracle ? ''
"asked Jack , forgetting all about his slippers , as he watched Jill 's eyes brighten and the color come up in her white cheeks ."
"`` That was the miracle , and Patience can work far greater ones if you will let her . ''"
`` And the girl 's name was Lucy ? ''
"`` Yes ; they did not call her a saint then , but she was trying to be as cheerful as a certain good woman she had heard of , and so the queen had that name for her , though she did not let her know it for a long time . ''"
"`` That 's not bad for a Sunday story , but there might have been more about the princes , seems to me , '' was Frank 's criticism , as Jill lay very still , trying to hide her face behind the carnation , for she had no words to tell how touched and pleased she was to find that her little efforts to be good had been seen , remembered , and now rewarded in this way ."
`` There is more . ''
`` Then the story is n't done ? ''
cried Jack .
"`` Oh dear , no ; the most interesting things are to come , if you can wait for them . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , this is the moral part ."
"Now keep still , and let us have the rest , '' commanded Frank , while the others composed themselves for the sequel , suspecting that it was rather nice , because Mamma 's sober face changed , and her eyes laughed as they looked at the fire ."
"`` The elder prince was very fond of driving dragons , for the people of that country used these fiery monsters as horses . ''"
"`` And got run away with , did n't he ? ''"
"I was so thinking when , upon a sudden , Mr. Rankeillor cried out , clapped his hand to his pockets , and began to laugh ."
"`` Why , '' he cries , `` if this be not a farcical adventure !"
"After all that I said , I have forgot my glasses ! ''"
"At that , of course , I understood the purpose of his anecdote , and knew that if he had left his spectacles at home , it had been done on purpose , so that he might have the benefit of Alan 's help without the awkwardness of recognising him ."
"And indeed it was well thought upon ; for now -LRB- suppose things to go the very worst -RRB- how could Rankeillor swear to my friend 's identity , or how be made to bear damaging evidence against myself ?"
"For all that , he had been a long while of finding out his want , and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through the town ; and I had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well ."
"As soon as we were past the Hawes -LRB- where I recognised the landlord smoking his pipe in the door , and was amazed to see him look no older -RRB- Mr. Rankeillor changed the order of march , walking behind with Torrance and sending me forward in the manner of a scout ."
"I went up the hill , whistling from time to time my Gaelic air ; and at length I had the pleasure to hear it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush ."
"He was somewhat dashed in spirits , having passed a long day alone skulking in the county , and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas ."
"But at the mere sight of my clothes , he began to brighten up ; and as soon as I had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part I looked to him to play in what remained , he sprang into a new man ."
"`` And that is a very good notion of yours , '' says he ; `` and I dare to say that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than Alan Breck ."
"It is not a thing -LRB- mark ye -RRB- that any one could do , but takes a gentleman of penetration ."
"But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man will be somewhat wearying to see me , '' says Alan ."
"Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor , who came up alone and was presented to my friend , Mr. Thomson ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , I am pleased to meet you , '' said he ."
"`` But I have forgotten my glasses ; and our friend , Mr. David here '' -LRB- clapping me on the shoulder -RRB- , `` will tell you that I am little better than blind , and that you must not be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow . ''"
"This he said , thinking that Alan would be pleased ; but the Highlandman 's vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that ."
"`` Why , sir , '' says he , stiffly , `` I would say it mattered the less as we are met here for a particular end , to see justice done to Mr. Balfour ; and by what I can see , not very likely to have much else in common ."
"But I accept your apology , which was a very proper one to make . ''"
"`` And that is more than I could look for , Mr. Thomson , '' said Rankeillor , heartily ."
"`` And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise , I think we should come into a nice agreement ; to which end , I propose that you should lend me your arm , for -LRB- what with the dusk and the want of my glasses -RRB- I am not very clear as to the path ; and as for you , Mr. David , you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with ."
"Only let me remind you , it 's quite needless he should hear more of your adventures or those of -- ahem -- Mr. Thomson . ''"
"Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk , and Torrance and I brought up the rear ."
Night was quite come when we came in view of the house of Shaws .
"Ten had been gone some time ; it was dark and mild , with a pleasant , rustling wind in the south-west that covered the sound of our approach ; and as we drew near we saw no glimmer of light in any portion of the building ."
"It seemed my uncle was already in bed , which was indeed the best thing for our arrangements ."
"We made our last whispered consultations some fifty yards away ; and then the lawyer and Torrance and I crept quietly up and crouched down beside the corner of the house ; and as soon as we were in our places , Alan strode to the door without concealment and began to knock ."
"CHAPTER XXIX I COME INTO MY KINGDOM For some time Alan volleyed upon the door , and his knocking only roused the echoes of the house and neighbourhood ."
"At last , however , I could hear the noise of a window gently thrust up , and knew that my uncle had come to his observatory ."
"By what light there was , he would see Alan standing , like a dark shadow , on the steps ; the three witnesses were hidden quite out of his view ; so that there was nothing to alarm an honest man in his own house ."
"For all that , he studied his visitor awhile in silence , and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"The room was nearly dark , for the lantern burned badly ; they could not laugh loud nor move about much , for Silas slept next door in the shed-chamber , and altogether the party was dull ."
"In the middle of a deal Dan stopped suddenly , and called out , `` Who 's that ? ''"
"in a startled tone , and at the same moment drew the slide over the light ."
"A voice in the darkness said tremulously , `` I ca n't find Tommy , '' and then there was the quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from the wing to the main house ."
`` It 's Demi !
"he 's gone to call some one ; cut into bed , Tom , and do n't tell ! ''"
"cried Dan , whisking all signs of the revel out of sight , and beginning to tear off his clothes , while Nat did the same ."
"Tommy flew to his room and dived into bed , where he lay , laughing till something burned his hand , when he discovered that he was still clutching the stump of the festive cigar , which he happened to be smoking when the revel broke up ."
"It was nearly out , and he was about to extinguish it carefully when Nursey 's voice was heard , and fearing it would betray him if he hid it in the bed , he threw it underneath , after a final pinch which he thought finished it ."
"Nursey came in with Demi , who looked much amazed to see the red face of Tommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow ."
"`` He was n't there just now , because I woke up and could not find him anywhere , '' said Demi , pouncing on him ."
"`` What mischief are you at now , bad child ? ''"
"asked Nursey , with a good-natured shake , which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly , `` I only ran into Nat 's room to see him about something ."
"Go away , and let me alone ; I 'm awful sleepy . ''"
"Nursey tucked Demi in , and went off to reconnoitre , but only found two boys slumbering peacefully in Dan 's room ."
"`` Some little frolic , '' she thought , and as there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs. Bhaer , who was busy and worried over little Teddy ."
"Tommy was sleepy , and telling Demi to mind his own business and not ask questions , he was snoring in ten minutes , little dreaming what was going on under his bed ."
"The cigar did not go out , but smouldered away on the straw carpet till it was nicely on fire , and a hungry little flame went creeping along till the dimity bedcover caught , then the sheets , and then the bed itself ."
"The beer made Tommy sleep heavily , and the smoke stupified Demi , so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them , and they were in danger of being burned to death ."
"Franz was sitting up to study , and as he left the school-room he smelt the smoke , dashed up-stairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left wing of the house ."
"Without stopping to call any one , he ran into the room , dragged the boys from the blazing bed , and splashed all the water he could find at hand on to the flames ."
"It checked but did not quench the fire , and the children wakened on being tumbled topsy-turvy into a cold hall , began to roar at the top of their voices ."
"Mrs. Bhaer instantly appeared , and a minute after Silas burst out of his room shouting , `` Fire ! ''"
in a tone that raised the whole house .
"A flock of white goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall , and for a minute every one was panic-stricken ."
"Then Mrs. Bhaer found her wits , bade Nursey see to the burnt boys , and sent Franz and Silas down-stairs for some tubs of wet clothes which she flung on the bed , over the carpet , and up against the curtains , now burning finely , and threatening to kindle the walls ."
"Most of the boys stood dumbly looking on , but Dan and Emil worked bravely , running to and fro with water from the bath-room , and helping to pull down the dangerous curtains ."
"The peril was soon over , and ordering the boys all back to bed , and leaving Silas to watch lest the fire broke out again , Mrs. Bhaer and Franz went to see how the poor boys got on ."
"Demi had escaped with one burn and a grand scare , but Tommy had not only most of his hair scorched off his head , but a great burn on his arm , that made him half crazy with the pain ."
"Demi was soon made cosy , and Franz took him away to his own bed , where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as cosily as a woman ."
"Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night , trying to ease his misery , and Mrs. Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy with oil and cotton , paregoric and squills , saying to herself from time to time , as if she found great amusement in the thought , `` I always knew Tommy would set the house on fire , and now he has done it ! ''"
When Mr. Bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things .
"But I thought he seemed crestfallen ; indeed , he was clutching at every straw , and all the time , I dare say , saw the faces of his hereditary foes on the bench , and in the jury-box , and the gallows in the background ."
"`` Well , sir , '' says Alan , turning to me , `` what say ye to that ?"
Ye are here under the safeguard of my honour ; and it 's my part to see nothing done but what shall please you . ''
"`` I have but one word to say , '' said I ; `` for to all this dispute I am a perfect stranger ."
"But the plain common-sense is to set the blame where it belongs , and that is on the man who fired the shot ."
"Paper him , as ye call it , set the hunt on him ; and let honest , innocent folk show their faces in safety . ''"
"But at this both Alan and James cried out in horror ; bidding me hold my tongue , for that was not to be thought of ; and asking me what the Camerons would think ?"
"-LRB- which confirmed me , it must have been a Cameron from Mamore that did the act -RRB- and if I did not see that the lad might be caught ?"
`` Ye havenae surely thought of that ? ''
"said they , with such innocent earnestness , that my hands dropped at my side and I despaired of argument ."
"`` Very well , then , '' said I , `` paper me , if you please , paper Alan , paper King George !"
"We 're all three innocent , and that seems to be what 's wanted ."
"But at least , sir , '' said I to James , recovering from my little fit of annoyance , `` I am Alan 's friend , and if I can be helpful to friends of his , I will not stumble at the risk . ''"
"I thought it best to put a fair face on my consent , for I saw Alan troubled ; and , besides -LRB- thinks I to myself -RRB- , as soon as my back is turned , they will paper me , as they call it , whether I consent or not ."
"But in this I saw I was wrong ; for I had no sooner said the words , than Mrs. Stewart leaped out of her chair , came running over to us , and wept first upon my neck and then on Alan 's , blessing God for our goodness to her family ."
"`` As for you , Alan , it was no more than your bounden duty , '' she said ."
"`` But for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst , and seen the goodman fleeching like a suitor , him that by rights should give his commands like any king -- as for you , my lad , '' she says , `` my heart is wae not to have your name , but I have your face ; and as long as my heart beats under my bosom , I will keep it , and think of it , and bless it . ''"
"And with that she kissed me , and burst once more into such sobbing , that I stood abashed ."
"`` Hoot , hoot , '' said Alan , looking mighty silly ."
"`` The day comes unco soon in this month of July ; and to-morrow there 'll be a fine to-do in Appin , a fine riding of dragoons , and crying of ` Cruachan ! '"
* and running of red-coats ; and it behoves you and me to the sooner be gone . ''
* The rallying-word of the Campbells .
"Thereupon we said farewell , and set out again , bending somewhat eastwards , in a fine mild dark night , and over much the same broken country as before ."
"CHAPTER XX THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE ROCKS Sometimes we walked , sometimes ran ; and as it drew on to morning , walked ever the less and ran the more ."
"Though , upon its face , that country appeared to be a desert , yet there were huts and houses of the people , of which we must have passed more than twenty , hidden in quiet places of the hills ."
"When we came to one of these , Alan would leave me in the way , and go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at the window with some sleeper awakened ."
"This was to pass the news ; which , in that country , was so much of a duty that Alan must pause to attend to it even while fleeing for his life ; and so well attended to by others , that in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard already of the murder ."
"In the others , as well as I could make out -LRB- standing back at a distance and hearing a strange tongue -RRB- , the news was received with more of consternation than surprise ."
"For all our hurry , day began to come in while we were still far from any shelter ."
"It found us in a prodigious valley , strewn with rocks and where ran a foaming river ."
"Wild mountains stood around it ; there grew there neither grass nor trees ; and I have sometimes thought since then , that it may have been the valley called Glencoe , where the massacre was in the time of King William ."
"But for the details of our itinerary , I am all to seek ; our way lying now by short cuts , now by great detours ; our pace being so hurried , our time of journeying usually by night ; and the names of such places as I asked and heard being in the Gaelic tongue and the more easily forgotten ."
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all."
This made her very tired.
"The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry."
"One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying."
"Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron, there came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each other."
"""I heard nothing,"" said he."
"""Neither did I,"" said she."
"But the noise grew louder and the two were so anxious not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and she began to sing to the baby a thing she had not had the heart to do for weeks."
"But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had to. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring, purring and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where."
"""It can't be anything in the dungeon,"" said the blacksmith, wiping his face. ""Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute."""
"""There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?"" said his wife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it."
"Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals."
"""I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"""
"said he, ""but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal."""
"""I quite understand,"" said his wife, who had brought the coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust."
"So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that the dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual, except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it was full of was Dragon."
"""It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows where,"" said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried to creep back up the winding stairs."
"But the dragon was too quick for him it put out a great claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes."
"""No you don't,"" said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp squib."
"""Deary, deary me,"" said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw of the dragon. ""Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!"""
The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.
"""Do you mind saying that again?"" said he, quite politely."
"So John said again, very distinctly:"
"""Here is a nice end for a respectable blacksmith."""
"""I didn't know,"" said the dragon. ""Fancy now! You're the very man I wanted."""
"""So I understood you to say before,"" said John, his teeth chattering."
"""Oh, I don't mean what you mean,"" said the dragon, ""but I should like you to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out of it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights?"""
"""I might, sir,"" said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a possible customer, even if he be a dragon."
"""A master craftsman you are a master, of course? can see in a minute what's wrong,"" the dragon went on. ""Just come around here and feel my plates, will you?"""
"John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly wanted riveting."
"The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt and under it he seemed to be covered with something furry."
"All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease."
"For some time they had fair wind and fine weather, but after that they lay wind-bound under a rocky island. So the sailors went ashore and strolled about to spend the time, and there they found a huge egg, almost as big as a little house. So they began to knock it about with large stones, but, after all, they couldn't crack the shell. Then the lad came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about, and when he saw the egg, he thought it a trifle to crack it; so he gave it one blow and the egg split, and out came a chicken as big as an elephant."
"""Now we have done wrong,"" said the lad; ""this can cost us all our lives;"" and then he asked his sailors if they were men enough to sail to Arabia in four-and-twenty hours if they got a fine breeze. Yes!"
"they were good to do that, they said, so they set sail with a fine breeze, and got to Arabia in three-and-twenty hours. As soon as they landed, the lad ordered all the sailors to go and bury themselves up to the eyes in a sandhill, so that they could barely see the ships."
The lad and the captains climbed a high crag and sate down under a fir.
"In a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws, and let it fall down on the fleet, and sunk every ship. After it had done that, it flew up to the sandhill and flapped its wings, so that the wind nearly took off the heads of the sailors, and it flew past the fir with such force that it turned the lad right about, but he was ready with his sword, and gave the bird one blow and brought it down dead."
"After that he went to the town, where every one was glad because the King had got his daughter back; but now the King had hidden her away somewhere himself, and promised her hand as a reward to any one who could find her, and this though she was betrothed before. Now as the lad went along he met a man who had white bear-skins for sale, so he bought one of the hides and put it on; and one of the captains was to take an iron chain and lead him about, and so he went into the town and began to play pranks. At last the news came to the King's ears, that there never had been such fun in the town before, for here was a white bear that danced and cut capers just as it was bid. So a messenger came to say the bear must come to the castle at once, for the King wanted to see its tricks. So when it got to the castle every one was afraid, for such a beast they had never seen before; but the captain said there was no danger unless they laughed at it. They mustn't do that, else it would tear them to pieces. When the King heard that, he warned all the court not to laugh. But while the fun was going on, in came one of the King's maids, and began to laugh and make game of the bear, and the bear flew at her and tore her, so that there was scarce a rag of her left. Then all the court began to bewail, and the captain most of all."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" said the King; ""she's only a maid, besides it's more my affair than yours."""
"When the show was over, it was late at night. ""It's no good your going away, when it's so late,"" said the King. ""The bear had best sleep here."""
"""Perhaps it might sleep in the ingle by the kitchen fire,"" said the captain."
"""Nay,"" said the King, ""it shall sleep up here, and it shall have pillows and cushions to sleep on."" So a whole heap of pillows and cushions was brought, and the captain had a bed in a side room."
"But at midnight the King came with a lamp in his hand and a big bunch of keys, and carried off the white bear. He passed along gallery after gallery through doors and rooms, up-stairs and down-stairs, till at last he came to a pier which ran out into the sea. Then the King began to pull and haul at posts and pins, this one up and that one down, till at last a little house floated up to the water's edge."
"There he kept his daughter, for she was so dear to him that he had hid her, so that no one could find her out. He left the white bear outside while he went in and told her how it had danced and played its pranks."
"She said she was afraid, and dared not look at it; but he talked her over, saying there was no danger if she only wouldn't laugh. So they brought the bear in, and locked the door, and it danced and played its tricks; but just when the fun was at its height, the Princess's maid began to laugh. Then the lad flew at her and tore her to bits, and the Princess began to cry and sob."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" cried the King; ""all this fuss about a maid!"
"I'll get you just as good a one again. But now I think the bear had best stay here till morning, for I don't care to have to go and lead it along all those galleries and stairs at this time of night."""
"""Well!"" said the Princess, ""if it sleeps here, I'm sure I won't."""
"But just then the bear curled himself up and lay down by the stove; and it was settled at last that the Princess should sleep there too, with a light burning. But as soon as the King had well gone, the white bear came and begged her to undo his collar. The Princess was so scared she almost swooned away; but she felt about till she found the collar, and she had scarce undone it before the bear pulled his head off. Then she knew him again, and was so glad there was no end to her joy, and she wanted to tell her father at once that her deliverer was come. But the lad would not hear of it; he would earn her once more, he said. So in the morning when they heard the King rattling at the posts outside, the lad drew on the hide and lay down by the stove."
"""Well, has it lain still?"" the king asked."
"""I should think so,"" said the Princess; ""it hasn't so much as turned or stretched itself once."""
"When they got up to the castle again, the captain took the bear and led it away, and then the lad threw off the hide, and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a prince; and when they were fitted on he went to the King, and said he wanted to find the Princess."
"""You're not the first who has wished the same thing,"" said the King, ""but they have all lost their lives; for if any one who tries can't find her in four-and-twenty hours his life is forfeited."""
"Yes; the lad knew all that. Still he wished to try, and if he couldn't find her, 'twas his look-out. Now in the castle there was a band that played sweet tunes, and there were fair maids to dance with, and so the lad danced away."
"When twelve hours were gone, the King said:"
"""I pity you with all my heart. You're so poor a hand at seeking; you will surely lose your life."""
"""Stuff!"" said the lad; ""while there's life there's hope! So long as there's breath in the body there's no fear; we have lots of time!"" and so he went on dancing till there was only one hour left."
Then he said he would begin to search.
"""It's no use now,"" said the King; ""time's up."""
"""Light your lamp; out with your big bunch of keys,"" said the lad, ""and follow me whither I wish to go. There is still a whole hour left."""
"So the lad went the same way which the King had led him the night before, and he bade the King unlock door after door till they came down to the pier which ran out into the sea."
"""It's all no use, I tell you,"" said the King; ""time's up, and this will only lead you right out into the sea."""
"""Still five minutes more,"" said the lad, as he pulled and pushed at the posts and pins, and the house floated up."
"Well, the story soon spread, and came up to the castle; and when the King heard the woman's grief and its cause, he sent down to say he would take care of the child, and see if he couldn't save it."
"So the months went on and on, and when her time came the fisher's wife had a boy; so the king took it at once, and brought it up as his own son, until the lad grew up. Then he begged leave one day to go out fishing with his father; he had such a mind to go, he said. At first the King wouldn't hear of it, but at last the lad had his way, and went. So he and his father were out the whole day, and all went right and well till they landed at night. Then the lad remembered he had left his handkerchief, and went to look for it; but as soon as ever he got into the boat, it began to move off with him at such speed that the water roared under the bow, and all the lad could do in rowing against it with the oars was no use; so he went and went the whole night, and at last he came to a white strand, far far away."
"There he went ashore, and when he had walked about a bit, an old, old man met him, with a long white beard."
"""What's the name of this land?"" asked the lad."
"""Whiteland,"" said the man, who went on to ask the lad whence he came, and what he was going to do. So the lad told him all."
"""Aye, aye!"" said the man; ""now when you have walked a little farther along the strand here, you'll come to three Princesses, whom you will see standing in the earth up to their necks, with only their heads out. Then the first she is the eldest will call out and beg you so prettily to come and help her; and the second will do the same; to neither of these shall you go; make haste past them, as if you neither saw nor heard anything. But the third you shall go to, and do what she asks. If you do this, you'll have good luck that's all."""
"When the lad came to the first Princess, she called out to him, and begged him so prettily to come to her, but he passed on as though he saw her not. In the same way he passed by the second; but to the third he went straight up."
"""If you'll do what I bid you,"" she said, ""you may have which of us you please."""
"""Yes;"" he was willing enough; so she told him how three Trolls had set them down in the earth there; but before they had lived in the castle up among the trees."
"""Now,"" she said, ""you must go into that castle, and let the Trolls whip you each one night for each of us. If you can bear that, you'll set us free."""
"Well, the lad said he was ready to try."
"""When you go in,"" the Princess went on to say, ""you'll see two lions standing at the gate; but if you'll only go right in the middle between them they'll do you no harm. Then go straight on into a little dark room, and make your bed. Then the Troll will come to whip you; but if you take the flask which hangs on the wall, and rub yourself with the ointment that's in it, wherever his lash falls, you'll be as sound as ever. Then grasp the sword that hangs by the side of the flask and strike the Troll dead."""
"Yes, he did as the Princess told him; he passed in the midst between the lions, as if he hadn't seen them, and went straight into the little room, and there he lay down to sleep. The first night there came a Troll with three heads and three rods, and whipped the lad soundly; but he stood it till the Troll was done; then he took the flask and rubbed himself, and grasped the sword and slew the Troll."
"So, when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth up to their waists."
"The next night 'twas the same story over again, only this time the Troll had six heads and six rods, and he whipped him far worse than the first; but when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth as far as the knee."
"The third night there came a Troll that had nine heads and nine rods, and he whipped and flogged the lad so long that he fainted away; then the Troll took him up and dashed him against the wall; but the shock brought down the flask, which fell on the lad, burst, and spilled the ointment all over him, and so he became as strong and sound as ever again. Then he wasn't slow; he grasped the sword and slew the Troll; and next morning when he went out of the castle the Princesses stood before him with all their bodies out of the earth."
"So he took the youngest for his Queen, and lived well and happily with her for some time."
At last he began to long to go home for a little to see his parents.
"His Queen did not like this; but at last his heart was so set on it, and he longed and longed so much, there was no holding him back, so she said:"
"""One thing you must promise me. This only to do what your father begs you to do, and not what mother wishes;"" and that he promised."
"Then she gave him a ring, which was of that kind that any one who wore it might wish two wishes. So he wished himself home, and when he got home his parents could not wonder enough what a grand man their son had become."
"Now, when he had been at home some days, his mother wished him to go up to the palace and show the King what a fine fellow he had come to be. But his father said:"
"""No! don't let him do that; if he does, we shan't have any more joy of him this time."""
"But it was no good, the mother begged and prayed so long that at last he went. So when he got up to the palace he was far braver, both in clothes and array, than the other king, who didn't quite like this, and at last he said:"
"""All very fine; but here you can see my Queen, what like she is, but I can't see yours: that I can't. Do you know, I scarce think she's so good-looking as mine."""
"""Would to Heaven,"" said the young King, ""she were standing here, then you'd see what she was like."" And that instant there she stood before them."
"But she was very woeful, and said to him:"
"""Why did you not mind what I told you; and why did you not listen to what your father said? Now, I must away home, and as for you, you have had both your wishes."""
"With that she knitted a ring among his hair with her name on it, and wished herself home, and was off."
"Then the young King was cut to the heart, and went, day out day in, thinking and thinking how he should get back to his Queen. ""I'll just try,"" he thought, ""if I can't learn where Whiteland lies;"" and so he went out into the world to ask. So when he had gone a good way, he came to a high hill, and there he met one who was lord over all the beasts of the wood, for they all came home to him when he blew his horn; so the King asked if he knew where Whiteland was."
"""No, I don't,"" said he, ""but I'll ask my beasts."" Then he blew his horn and called them, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay. But there was no beast that knew."
"Boston ladies gave up tea and used the dried leaves of the raspberry, and the girls of 1777 graduated in homespun. Could the iron heel of despotism crunch such a spirit of liberty as that? Scarcely. In one family at Newport four hundred and eighty-seven yards of cloth and thirty-six pairs of stockings were spun and made in eighteen months."
"When the war broke out it is estimated that each Colonial soldier had twenty-seven pairs of blue woollen socks with white double heels and toes. Does the intelligent reader believe that ""Tommy Atkins,"" with two pairs of socks ""and hit a-rainin',"" could whip men with twenty-seven pairs each? Not without restoratives."
"Troops were now sent to restore order. They were clothed by the British government, but boarded around with the Colonists. This was irritating to the people, because they had never met or called on the British troops. Again, they did not know the troops were coming, and had made no provision for them."
"Boston was considered the hot-bed of the rebellion, and General Gage was ordered to send two regiments of troops there. He did so, and a fight ensued, in which three citizens were killed."
"In looking over this incident, we must not forget that in those days three citizens went a good deal farther than they do now."
"The fight, however, was brief. General Gage, getting into a side street, separated from his command, and, coming out on the Common abruptly, he tried eight or nine more streets, but he came out each time on the Common, until, torn with conflicting emotions, he hired a Herdic, which took him around the corner to his quarters."
"On December 16, 1773, occurred the tea-party at Boston, which must have been a good deal livelier than those of to-day. The historian regrets that he was not there; he would have tried to be the life of the party."
"England had finally so arranged the price of tea that, including the tax, it was cheaper in America than in the old country. This exasperated the patriots, who claimed that they were confronted by a theory and not a condition. At Charleston this tea was stored in damp cellars, where it spoiled. New York and Philadelphia returned their ships, but the British would not allow any shenanegin', as George III. so tersely termed it, in Boston."
"Therefore a large party met in Faneuil Hall and decided that the tea should not be landed. A party made up as Indians, and, going on board, threw the tea overboard. Boston Harbor, as far out as the Bug Light, even to-day, is said to be carpeted with tea-grounds."
"George III. now closed Boston harbor and made General Gage Governor of Massachusetts. The Virginia Assembly murmured at this, and was dissolved and sent home without its mileage."
"Those opposed to royalty were termed Whigs, those in favor were called Tories. Now they are called Chappies or Authors."
"On the 5th of September, 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia and was entertained by the Clover Club. Congress acted slowly even then, and after considerable delay resolved that the conduct of Great Britain was, under the circumstances, uncalled for. It also voted to hold no intercourse with Great Britain, and decided not to visit Shakespeare's grave unless the mother-country should apologize."
"In 1775, on the 19th of April, General Gage sent out troops to see about some military stores at Concord, but at Lexington he met with a company of minute-men gathering on the village green. Major Pitcairn, who was in command of the Tommies, rode up to the minute-men, and, drawing his bright new Sheffield sword, exclaimed, ""Disperse, you rebels! throw down your arms and disperse!"" or some such remark as that."
"The Americans hated to do that, so they did not. In the skirmish that ensued, seven of their number were killed."
"Thus opened the Revolutionary War, a contest which but for the earnestness and irritability of the Americans would have been extremely brief. It showed the relative difference between the fighting qualities of soldiers who fight for two pounds ten shillings per month and those who fight because they have lost their temper."
"The regulars destroyed the stores, but on the way home they found every rock-pile hid an old-fashioned gun and minute-man. This shows that there must have been an enormous number of minute-men then. All the English who got back to Boston were those who went out to reinforce the original command."
"The news went over the country like wildfire. These are the words of the historian. Really, that is a poor comparison, for wildfire doesn't jump rivers and bays, or get up and eat breakfast by candle-light in order to be on the road and spread the news."
"General Putnam left a pair of tired steers standing in the furrow, and rode one hundred miles without feed or water to Boston."
"Twenty thousand men were soon at work building intrenchments around Boston, so that the English troops could not get out to the suburbs where many of them resided."
I will now speak of the battle of Bunker Hill.
"This battle occurred June 17. The Americans heard that their enemy intended to fortify Bunker Hill, and so they determined to do it themselves, in order to have it done in a way that would be a credit to the town."
"A body of men under Colonel Prescott, after prayer by the President of Harvard University, marched to Charlestown Neck. They decided to fortify Breed's Hill, as it was more commanding, and all night long they kept on fortifying. The surprise of the English at daylight was well worth going from Lowell to witness."
"Howe sent three thousand men across and formed them on the landing. He marched them up the hill to within ten rods of the earth-works, when it occurred to Prescott that it would now be the appropriate thing to fire."
"He made a statement of that kind to his troops, and those of the enemy who were alive went back to Charlestown. But that was no place for them, as they had previously set it afire, so they came back up the hill, where they were once more well received and tendered the freedom of a future state."
"Three times the English did this, when the ammunition in the fortifications gave out, and they charged with fixed bayonets and reinforcements."
"The Americans were driven from the field, but it was a victory after all. It united the Colonies and made them so vexed at the English that it took some time to bring on an era of good feeling."
"Lord Howe, referring afterwards to this battle, said that the Americans did not stand up and fight like the regulars, suggesting that thereafter the Colonial army should arrange itself in the following manner before a battle!"
"The clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard that, so he cried in a very gruff voice, “Thou shalt not have him! Thou shalt not have him!” The maiden thought that the child Mary who stood by her mother Anne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried, “Fiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your mother speak!”"
140 Domestic Servants
"“Whither goest thou?” “To Walpe.” “I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
"“Hast thou a man? What is his name?” “Cham.” “My man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a child; how is he styled?” “Wild.” “My child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a cradle? How callest thou thy cradle?”"
"“Hippodadle.” “My cradle Hippodadle, my child Wild, thy child Wild, my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
“Hast thou also a drudge? what name has thy drudge?”
"“From-thy-work-do-not-budge.” “My drudge, From-thy-work-do-not-budge:"
"my child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.”"
141 The Lambkin and the Little Fish
"There were once a little brother and a little sister, who loved each other with all their hearts. Their own mother was, however, dead, and they had a step-mother, who was not kind to them, and secretly did everything she could to hurt them. It so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house. The children ran about it, and caught each other, and played at counting out."
"“Eneke Beneke, let me live, And I to thee my bird will give."
"The little bird, it straw shall seek, The straw I’ll give to the cow to eat."
"The pretty cow shall give me milk, The milk I’ll to the baker take."
"The baker he shall bake a cake, The cake I’ll give unto the cat."
"The cat shall catch some mice for that, The mice I’ll hang up in the smoke, And then you’ll see the snow.”"
"They stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to whom the word snow fell, had to run away and all the others ran after him and caught him. As they were running about so merrily the step-mother watched them from the window, and grew angry. And as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both, and changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb. Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and was very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow, and was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass. Thus passed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the castle. The false step-mother thought, “This is a good opportunity,” and called the cook and said to him, “Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors.” Then the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently. When he had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step to kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards and forwards in the water, in front of the kitchen-sink and looking up at him. This, however, was the brother, for when the fish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam along the pond to the house; then the lamb cried down to it,"
"“Ah, brother, in the pond so deep, How sad is my poor heart!"
Even now the cook he whets his knife To take away my tender life.”
"The little fish answered,"
"“Ah, little sister, up on high How sad is my poor heart While in this pond I lie.”"
"When the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such sad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought this could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked woman in the house. Then said he, “Be easy, I will not kill thee,” and took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and conveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related all that he had seen and heard."
"The peasant was, however, the very woman who had been foster-mother to the little sister, and she suspected at once who the lamb was, and went with it to a wise woman. Then the wise woman pronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by means of which they regained their human forms, and after this she took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where they lived alone, but were contented and happy."
142 Simeli Mountain
"There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children. Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement."
"While he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen. The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut. After a short time, however, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away."
"When they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. So he went up to it and said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow."
"And now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain. He lived joyously and uprightly, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one. When, however, the money came to an end he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things. When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother. The rich man had, however, long been envious of his brother’s possessions, and of the handsome way of living which he had set on foot, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure. Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. He at once went to his brother and asked him, “What hast thou been measuring in the bushel measure?” “Corn and barley,” said the other. Then he showed him the piece of money, and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice. The poor man then told him everything, just as it happened. The rich man, however, ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures."
"When he came to the mountain he cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open.” The mountain opened, and he went inside it. There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first. At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. He wished to carry his burden outside, but, as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried, “Simeli mountain, Simeli mountain, open.” That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut. Then he was alarmed, but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and his treasures were no more of any use to him. In the evening the mountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him they laughed, and cried out, “Bird, have we caught thee at last! Didst thou think we had never noticed that thou hadst been in here twice? We could not catch thee then; this third time thou shalt not get out again!” Then he cried, “It was not I, it was my brother,” but let him beg for his life and say what he would, they cut his head off."
143 Going A-Travelling
"There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, “How canst thou travel? We have no money at all for thee to take away with thee.” Then said the son, “I will manage very well for myself; I will always say, Not much, not much, not much.”"
"So he walked for a long time and always said, “Not much, not much, not much.” Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, “God speed you! not much, not much, not much.” “What sayst thou churl, ‘not much?’” And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish."
"So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, “Hast thou never seen me threshing?” “What ought I to say, then?” asked the youth."
"On the third day, at one P.M., Lee opened with one hundred and fifty guns on Cemetery Ridge. The air was a hornet's nest of screaming shells with fiery tails. As it lulled a little, out of the woods came eighteen thousand men in battle-array extending over a mile in length. The Yankees knew a good thing when they saw it, and they paused to admire this beautiful gathering of foemen in whose veins there flowed the same blood as in their own, and whose ancestors had stood shoulder to shoulder with their own in a hundred battles for freedom."
"Their sentiment gave place to shouts of battle, and into the silent phalanx a hundred guns poured their red-hot messages of death. The golden grain was drenched with the blood of men no less brave because they were not victorious, and the rich fields of Pennsylvania drank with thirsty eagerness the warm blood of many a Southern son."
"Yet they moved onward. Volley after volley of musketry mowed them down, and the puny reaper in the neglected grain gave place to the grim reaper Death, all down that unwavering line of gray and brown."
"They marched up to the Union breastworks, bayoneted the gunners at their work, planted their flags on the parapets, and, while the Federals converged from every point to this, exploding powder burned the faces of these contending hosts, who, hand to hand, fought each other to death, while far-away widows and orphans multiplied to mourn through the coming years over this ghastly folly of civil war."
"Whole companies of the Confederates rushed as prisoners into the arms of their enemies, and the shattered remnant of the battered foe retreated from the field."
"While all this was going on in Pennsylvania, Pemberton was arranging terms of surrender at Vicksburg, and from this date onward the Confederacy began to wobble in its orbit, and the President of this ill-advised but bitterly punished scheme began to wish that he had been in Canada when the war broke out."
"In April of the same year Admiral Dupont, an able seaman with massive whiskers, decided to run the fortifications at Charleston with iron-clads, but the Charleston people thought they could run them themselves. So they drove him back after the sinking of the Kennebec and the serious injury of all the other vessels."
"General Gillmore then landed with troops. Fort Wagner was captured. The 54th Regiment of colored troops, the finest organized in the Free States, took a prominent part and fought with great coolness and bravery. By December there were fifty thousand colored troops enlisted, and before the war closed over two hundred thousand."
It is needless to say that this made the Yankee unpopular at the time in the best society of the South.
"General Gillmore attempted to capture Sumter, and did reduce it to a pulp, but when he went to gather it he was met by a garrison still concealed in the basement, and peppered with volleys of hot shingle-nails and other bric-à-brac, which forced him to retire with loss."
He said afterward that Fort Sumter was not desirable anyhow.
"This closed the most memorable year of the war, with the price of living at the South running up to eight hundred and nine hundred dollars per day, and currency depreciating so rapidly that one's salary had to be advanced every morning in order to keep pace with the price of mule-steaks."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
LAST YEAR OF THE DISAGREEABLE WAR.
"General Grant was now in command of all the Union troops, and in 1864-5 the plan of operation was to prevent the junction of the Confederates, General Grant seeking to interest the army in Virginia under General Lee, and General Sherman the army of General Joseph E."
Johnston in Georgia.
"Sherman started at once, and came upon Johnston located on almost impregnable hills all the way to Atlanta. The battles of Dalton, Resaca, Dallas, Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw Mountain preceded Johnston's retreat to the intrenchments of Atlanta, July 10, Sherman having been on the move since early in May, 1864."
"Jefferson Davis, disgusted with Johnston, placed Hood in command, who made three heroic attacks upon the Union troops, but was repulsed."
"Sherman now gathered fifteen days' rations from the neighbors, and, throwing his forces across Hood's line of supplies, compelled him to evacuate the city."
"The historian says that Sherman was entirely supplied from Nashville via railroad during this trip, but the author knows of his own personal knowledge that there were times when he got his fresh provisions along the road."
"This expedition cost the Union army thirty thousand men and the Confederates thirty-five thousand. Besides, Georgia was the Confederacy, so far as arms, grain, etc., were concerned. Sherman attributed much of his success to the fact that he could repair and operate the railroad so rapidly. Among his men were Yankee machinists and engineers, who were as necessary as courageous fighters."
"""We are held here during many priceless hours,"" said the general, ""because the enemy has spoiled this passenger engine. Who knows any thing about repairing an engine?"""
"""I do,"" said a dusty tramp in blue. ""I can repair this one in an hour."""
"""What makes you think so?"""
"""Well, I made it."""
This was one of the strong features of Sherman's army. Among the hundred thousand who composed it there were so many active brains and skilled hands that the toot of the engine caught the heels of the last echoing shout of the battle.
"Learning that Hood proposed to invade Tennessee, Sherman prepared to march across Georgia to the sea, and if necessary to tramp through the Atlantic States."
"Hood was sorry afterwards that he invaded Tennessee. He shut Thomas up in Nashville after a battle with Schofield, and kept the former in-doors for two weeks, when all of a sudden Thomas exclaimed, ""Air! air! give me air!"" and came out, throwing Hood into headlong flight, when the Union cavalry fell on his rear, followed by the infantry, and the forty thousand Confederates became a scattered and discouraged mob spread out over several counties."
"The burning of Atlanta preceded Sherman's march, and, though one of the saddest features of the war, was believed to be a military necessity."
Those who declare war hoping to have a summer's outing thereby may live to regret it for many bitter years.
"When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, “Thou wilt never see thy father and mother again, but I will keep thee with me, for thou hast set me free, and I have compassion on thee. If thou dost all I bid thee, thou shalt fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.” He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said, “Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, thou shalt sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order.” The boy placed himself by the margin of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron John came back, looked at the boy, and said, “What has happened to the well?” “Nothing, nothing,” he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said, “Thou hast dipped thy finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care thou dost not again let anything go in.” By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron John came, and already knew what had happened. “Thou hast let a hair fall into the well,” said he. “I will allow thee to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted, and thou canst no longer remain with me.”"
"On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You may imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said, “Take the handkerchief off.” Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. “Thou hast not stood the trial, and canst stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there thou wilt learn what poverty is. But as thou hast not a bad heart, and as I mean well by thee, there is one thing I will grant thee; if thou fallest into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, ‘Iron John,’ and then I will come and help thee. My power is great, greater than thou thinkest, and I have gold and silver in abundance.”"
"Then the King’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the King’s notice, and he said, “When thou comest to the royal table thou must take thy hat off.” He answered, “Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.” Then the King had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to turn him off at once."
"The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy."
"And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bed-room of the King’s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, “Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.” He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said, “How canst thou take the King’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.” “Oh, no,” replied the boy, “the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.” When he got into the room, the King’s daughter said, “Take thy cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.” He again said, “I may not, I have a sore head.” She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said, “I present them to thy children, they can play with them.” The following day the King’s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and when he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money."
"Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The King gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener’s boy, “I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.” The others laughed, and said, “Seek one for thyself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for thee.” When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and got the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jig, hobblety jig; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called “Iron John,”"
"three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said, “What dost thou desire?” “I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.” “That thou shalt have, and still more than thou askest for.” Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battle-field a great part of the King’s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to fly, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead, however, of returning to the King, he conducted his troop by bye-ways back to the forest, and called forth Iron John. “What dost thou desire?” asked the wild man. “Take back thy horse and thy troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.” All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the King returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. “I am not the one who carried away the victory,” said he, “but a stranger knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.” The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the King did not know, and said, “He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.” She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said, “He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying, “Here comes our hobblety jig back again!”"
"They asked, too, “Under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all the time?” He, however, said, “I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more ridiculed.”"
"The King said to his daughter, “I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and thou shalt throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown will come to it.” When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron John. “What dost thou desire?”"
"asked he. “That I may catch the King’s daughter’s golden apple.” “It is as safe as if thou hadst it already,” said Iron John. “Thou shalt likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.” When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one."
"The King’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away."
"On the second day Iron John equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The King grew angry, and said, “That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.” He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him."
"On the third day, he received from Iron John a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the King’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword."
"The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the King."
The following day the King’s daughter asked the gardener about his boy.
"“He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.”"
"The King had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the King’s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. “Art thou the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?” asked the King. “Yes,” answered he, “and here the apples are,” and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the King. “If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.” “If thou canst perform such deeds as that, thou art no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is thy father?” “My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.” “I well see,” said the King, “that I owe thanks to thee; can I do anything to please thee?” “Yes,” answered he, “that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.” The maiden laughed, and said, “He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,” and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, “I am Iron John, and was by enchantment a wild man, but thou hast set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be thy property.”"
137 The Three Black Princesses
"East India was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars. Then the townsfolk caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the money should be burgomaster. Now there was a poor fisherman who fished on the lake with his son, and the enemy came and took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred dollars for him. So the father went and gave them to the great men of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became burgomaster. Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say, “Mr. Burgomaster,” should be put to death on the gallows."
"The son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great forest on a high mountain. The mountain opened, and he went into a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and benches were all hung with black."
"Then came three young princesses who were entirely dressed in black, but had a little white on their faces; they told him he was not to be afraid, they would not hurt him, and that he could deliver them. He said he would gladly do that, if he did but know how. At this, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was just to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would do so. When he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father, and they told him he might go. He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this coat, and in a week he must be back there again."
"Then he was caught up, and was instantly in East India. He could no longer find his father in the fisherman’s hut, and asked the people where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he must not say that, or he would come to the gallows. Then he went to his father and said, “Fisherman, how hast thou got here?” Then the father said, “Thou must not say that, if the great men of the town knew of that, thou wouldst come to the gallows.” He, however, would not stop, and was brought to the gallows. When he was there, he said, “O, my masters, just give me leave to go to the old fisherman’s hut.” Then he put on his old smock-frock, and came back to the great men, and said, “Do ye not now see? Am I not the son of the poor fisherman? Did I not earn bread for my father and mother in this dress?” Hereupon his father knew him again, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then he related all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a forest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he had gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three young princesses had come to him who were black except a little white on their faces. And they had told him not to fear, and that he could deliver them. Then his mother said that might very likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take a holy-water vessel with him, and drop some boiling water on their faces."
"He went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped the water on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all turned half-white."
"Then all the three princesses sprang up, and said, “Thou accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on thee! Now there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born who can set us free! We have still three brothers who are bound by seven chains they shall tear thee to pieces.” Then there was a loud shrieking all over the castle, and he sprang out of the window, and broke his leg, and the castle sank into the earth again, the mountain shut to again, and no one knew where the castle had stood."
138 Knoist and his Three Sons
"Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and he had three sons. One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark-naked. Once on a time they went into a field, and there they saw a hare. The blind one shot it, the lame one caught it, the naked one put it in his pocket. Then they came to a mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed, one sank, the third had no bottom to it. They all three got into the one with no bottom to it. Then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree; in the tree was a mighty big chapel in the chapel was a sexton made of beech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy-water with cudgels."
“How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run!”
139 The Maid of Brakel
"A girl from Brakel once went to St. Anne’s Chapel at the foot of the Hinnenberg, and as she wanted to have a husband, and thought there was no one else in the chapel, she sang,"
"“Oh, holy Saint Anne!"
Help me soon to a man.
"Thou know’st him right well, By Suttmer gate does he dwell, His hair it is golden, Thou know’st him right well.”"
"At last the old man said, ""Come down, honey. I am afraid the limb will break if you don't."" Then, as the boy still remained, he told him that those were not eating-apples, that they were just common cooking-apples, and that there were worms in them. But the boy said he didn't mind a little thing like that. So then the old gentleman got irritated, and called the dog, and threw turf at the boy, and at last saluted him with pieces of turf and decayed cabbages; and after the lad had gone away the old man pried the bull-dog's jaws open and found a mouthful of pantaloons and a freckle."
"I do not tell this, of course, in Mr. Webster's language, but I give the main points as they recur now to my mind."
"Though I have been a close student of Mr. Webster for years and have carefully examined his style, I am free to say that his ideas about writing a book are not the same as mine. Of course it is a great temptation for a young author to write a book that will have a large sale; but that should not be all. We should have a higher object than that, and strive to interest those who read the book. It should not be jerky and scattering in its statements."
"I do not wish to do an injustice to a great man who is now no more, a man who did so much for the world and who could spell the longest word without hesitation, but I speak of these things just as I would expect others to criticise my work. If one aspire to be a member of the literati of his day, he must expect to be criticised. I have been criticised myself. When I was in public life, as a justice of the peace in the Rocky Mountains, a man came in one day and criticised me so that I did not get over it for two weeks."
"I might add, though I dislike to speak of it now, that Mr. Webster was at one time a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts. I believe that was the only time he ever stepped aside from the strait and narrow way."
"A good many people do not know this, but it is true."
"Mr. Webster was also a married man, yet he never murmured or repined."
CHAPTER XXIV.
BEFO' THE WAH CAUSES WHICH LED TO IT MASTERLY GRASP OF THE SUBJECT SHOWN BY THE AUTHOR.
"A Man named Lopez in 1851 attempted to annex Cuba, thus furnishing for our Republican wrapper a genuine Havana filler; but he failed, and was executed, while his plans were not."
"Franklin Pierce was elected President on the Democratic ticket, running against General Scott, the Whig candidate. Slavery began to be discussed again, when Stephen A. Douglas, in Congress, advocated squatter sovereignty, or the right for each Territory to decide whether it would be a free or a slave State. The measure became a law in 1854."
"That was what made trouble in Kansas. The two elements, free and slave, were arrayed against each other, and for several years friends from other States had to come over and help Kansas bury its dead. The condition of things for some time was exceedingly mortifying to the citizen who went out to milk after dark without his gun."
"Trouble with Mexico arose, owing to the fact that the government had used a poor and unreliable map in establishing the line: so General Gadsden made a settlement for the disputed ground, and we paid Mexico ten millions of dollars. It is needless to say that we have since seen the day when we wished that we had it back."
"Two ports of entry were now opened to us in Japan by Commodore Perry's Expedition, and cups and saucers began to be more plentiful in this country, many of the wealthier deciding at that time not to cool tea in the saucer or drink it vociferously from that vessel. This custom and the Whig party passed away at the same time."
The Republican or Anti-Slavery party nominated for President John C.
"Frémont, who received the vote of eleven States, but James Buchanan was elected, and proved to the satisfaction of the world that there is nothing to prevent any unemployed man's applying for the Presidency of the United States; also that if his life has been free from ideas and opinions he may be elected sometimes where one who has been caught in the very act of thinking, and had it proved on him, might be defeated."
Chief Justice Taney now stated that slaves could be taken into any State of the Union by their owners without forfeiting the rights of ownership.
"This was called the Dred Scott decision, and did much to irritate Abolitionists like John Brown, whose soul as this book goes to press is said to be marching on. Brown was a Kansas man with a mission and massive whiskers. He would be called now a crank; but his action in seizing a United States arsenal at Harper's Ferry and declaring the slaves free was regarded by the South as thoroughly representative of the Northern feeling."
"The country now began to be in a state of restlessness. Brown had been captured and hanged as a traitor. Northern men were obliged to leave their work every little while to catch a negro, crate him, and return him to his master or give him a lift towards Canada; and, as the negro was replenishing the earth at an astonishing rate, general alarm broke out."
"Douglas was the champion of squatter sovereignty, John C. Breckinridge of the doctrine that slaves could be checked through as personal baggage into any State of the Union, and Lincoln of the anti-slavery principle which afterwards constituted the spinal column of the Federal Government as opposed to the Confederacy of the seceded States."
"Lincoln was elected, which reminded him of an anecdote. Douglas and several other candidates were defeated, which did not remind them of anything."
"South Carolina seceded in December, 1860, and soon after Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit."
"The following February the Confederacy was organized at Montgomery, Alabama, and Jefferson Davis was elected President. Long and patient effort on the part of the historian to ascertain how he liked it has been entirely barren of results. Alexander H. Stephens was made Vice-President."
"Everything belonging to the United States and not thoroughly fastened down was carried away by the Confederacy, while President Buchanan looked the other way or wrote airy persiflage to tottering dynasties which slyly among themselves characterized him as a neat and cleanly old lady."
"Had Buchanan been a married man it is generally believed now that his wife would have prevented the war. Then she would have called James out from under the bed and allowed him to come to the table for his meals with the family. But he was not married, and the war came on."
"Major Anderson was afraid to remain at Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, so crossed over to Fort Sumter. The South regarded this as hostility, and the fort was watched to see if any one should attempt to divide his lunch with the garrison, which it was declared would be regarded as an act of defiance. The reader will see by this that a deaf and dumb asylum in Northern Michigan was about the only safe place for a peaceable man at that time."
"President Lincoln found himself placed at the head of a looted government on the sharp edge of a crisis that had not been properly upholstered. The Buchanan cabinet had left little except a burglar's tool or two here and there to mark its operations, and, with the aged and infirm General Scott at the head of a little army, and no encouragement except from the Abolitionists, many of whom had never seen a colored man outside of a minstrel performance, the President stole incog. into Washington, like a man who had agreed to lecture there."
"Southern officers resigned daily from the army and navy to go home and join the fortunes of their several States. Meantime, the Federal government moved about like a baby elephant loaded with shot, while the new Confederacy got men, money, arms, and munitions of war from every conceivable point."
"Finding that supplies were to be sent to Major Anderson, General Peter G. T. Beauregard summoned Major Anderson to surrender. General Beauregard, after the war, became one of the good, kind gentlemen who annually stated over their signatures that they had examined the Louisiana State Lottery and that there was no deception about it. The Lottery felt grateful for this, and said that the general should never want while it had a roof of its own."
"Major Anderson had seventy men, while General Beauregard had seven thousand. After a bombardment and a general fight of thirty-four hours, the starved and suffocated garrison yielded to overwhelming numbers."

It was a small round disc no more than an inch in diameter.

"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.
"""Wouldn't it be a good idea to call him again? It's rather important!"""
"""Oh, you think we shouldn't have gone out in a storm like this? I've"
"been dreadfully uneasy!"""
"""No danger at all,"" I declared, with affected indifference, adding: ""The"
"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"
where the door had swung back showing an empty bunk.
"""Why, he's up, after all,"" she glanced over her shoulder at me."
"""I believe he is,"" I idiotically affirmed."
"""But where?""--this more to herself."
"""Hiding, maybe,"" I ventured, taking a facetious squint about."
"""Hiding?"" she asked, in mild surprise."

"""Funny old dog?"" She drew slightly away from me. ""Do you mean my father,"
"Mr.--er?"""

And

"When I get my civvy clothes on,"
"No more soldiering for me."""
and all the other songs familiar to every soldier in the British army.
We marched all day along straight roads running in between flat fields
and past ugly little villages. As we grew tired and footsore our
rollicking spirit abated and the singing died down.
Towards nightfall we halted in a large meadow with a pond in one corner.
"Several lorries loaded with tents were waiting for us. We unloaded them,"
"pitched the tents, crept into them, and went to bed."
The rumble of the cannonade sounded faintly in the far distance.
"""I reckon it's a bloody shame to let the other Tommies and the"
"Frenchies...."""
The voice seemed to die away into a drawl as weariness overcame me. I
"continued to hear the sound of words for a little while, but they"
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
“I am trying to make use of my relationship to Cardinal Fort? Why
shouldn’t I?”
“You admit it?”
"“Yes, I admit it. People are such imbeciles that they think it is an"
honour to have a Cardinal in the family; I take advantage of this stupid
"idea, although I do not share it, because for me a Cardinal is merely an"
"object of curiosity, an object for an archeological museum....”"
"Cæsar paused, because the monk’s countenance was growing dark. In the"
"twilight of his pallid face, his nose looked like a comet portending"
some public calamity.
“Poor wretch!” murmured the monk. “You do not know what you are saying.
You are blaspheming. You are offending God.” “Do you really believe that
"God has any relation to my uncle?” asked Cæsar, paying more attention"
to his toast than to his visitor.
And then he added:
“The truth is that it would be extravagant behaviour on the part of
God.”
"The monk looked at Cæsar with terrible eyes. Those grey eyes of his,"
"under their long, black, thick brows, shot lightning."
“Poor wretch!” repeated the monk. “You ought to have more respect for
things above you.”
Cæsar arose.
"""I well remember it,"" he went on.  ""I quite recollect how, on one"
"occasion, you came over to London, and while dining together at Jimmy's"
"you told me of your infatuation, and showed me her photograph.  Do you"
"remember the night when you told me of your engagement to her?"""
"""Perfectly."""
"""And as time went on you suddenly dropped her--for what reason I know"
"not.  We are pals, but I have never attempted to pry into your affairs."
"If she really loved you, it must have been a hard blow for her when she"
"heard that you had forsaken her for Edith Austin."""
"""You reproach me,"" I said.  ""But you do not know the whole truth, my"
"dear fellow.  I discovered that Yolande possessed a second lover."""
"He nodded slowly, with pursed lips."
"""And that was the reason of your parting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""The sole reason?"""
"""The sole reason."""
"""And you have no suspicion that she may have committed suicide because"
"of her love for you?  Such things are not uncommon, remember, with girls"
"of a certain temperament."""
"""If she has committed suicide, it is not on my account,"" I responded in"
a hard voice.
"spasm; her eyes are closed, her mouth open, and her jaw a bit"
dislocated. In front of the swooning saint is a little angel who
smilingly threatens her with an arrow.
"“Well, what do you think of it?” said Kennedy."
"“It is wonderful,” exclaimed Cæsar. “But it is a bedroom scene, only"
the lover has slipped away.”
"“Yes, that is true.”"
"“It really is pretty; you seem to see the pallor of the saint’s face,"
"the circles under her eyes, the relaxation of all her muscles. Then the"
angel is a little joker who stands there smiling at the ecstasy of the
saint.”
"“Yes, that’s true,” said Kennedy; “it is all the more admirable for the"
"very reason that it is tender, sensual, and charming, all at once.”"
"“However, this sort of thing is not healthy,” murmured Cæsar, “this"
kind of vision depletes your life-force. One wants to find the same
"things represented in works of art that one ought to look for in life,"
even if they are not to be found in life.”
"“Good! Here enters the moralist. You talk like an Englishman,” exclaimed"
Kennedy. “Let us go along.”
“Where?”
“I have to stop in at the French Embassy a moment; then we can go where
you like.”
"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”
"informant; 'all, from the earliest memory to the latest breath. Like a"
whole landscape called by a flash of lightning out of the dark night. It
"is all there, every bit of it, good and evil, pleasure and pain, sin and"
righteousness.'
A man cannot escape from his life even in death. In our acts of to-day
"we are determining what our death will be; if we have lived well, we"
"shall die well; and if not, then not. As a man lives so shall he die, is"
the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"
"shall gain the great Deliverance. He shall have perfect Peace, perfect"
"rest, perfect happiness, he and his, in that heaven where his teacher"
went before him long ago.
"And if we should say that this Deliverance from life, this Great Peace,"
"is Death, what matter, if it be indeed Peace?"

CHAPTER IV
NIRVANA
"A pleasant sense of motion came over me that suggested cradling waves,"
and I was sleepily wondering why we had gone out on a day that portended
"storms, when a tapping at my stateroom door was followed by someone"
whispering:
"""Aren't you ever going to get up, you lazy old dear?"""
It was a girl's voice.
"Gradually and cautiously I drew the sheet about my chin, feeling no"
little confused to have a girl five feet away whispering pet names at me
through a thin partition.
"listening to every word--""very curious!"""
"""Did you feel any strange sensation on the left side of your neck"
"beneath the ear, or upon your lower lip?"" inquired Deane earnestly."
"She reflected for a moment, then said:"
"""Now that I remember, there was a curious numbness of my lip."""
"""Followed immediately by unconsciousness?"""
"""Yes, almost immediately."""
"The doctors exchanged glances, which showed that the mark upon the lip"
was the chief enigma of the situation.
"Trepard glanced at his watch, dissolved yet another pillule of hydrated"
"peroxide of iron, and handed her the draught to swallow.  The antidote"
had acted almost like magic.
"""You are absolutely certain that no person entered the room after Ingram"
"had left?"" repeated Deane, as though not yet satisfied."
"""Absolutely."""
"Dick Deane turned his eyes full upon me, and I divined his thoughts.  He"
was reflecting upon the conversation held between us before we entered
that room.  He was endeavouring to worm from her some clue to her
secret.
"""My mother knows that I am recovering?"" she went on.  ""If she does not,"
please tell her.  She has been so distressed of late that this must have

"“I know,” said John. “That 's why I 've come now.”"
"“What's the matter?” Herold asked, sitting in the chair before the"
"dressing-table, bright with mirrors and electric lights and sticks of"
grease paint and silver-topped pots and other paraphernalia.
"“Nothing particular. Only hell, just as usual. I saw that child to-day.”"
Herold lit a cigarette.
“Have you ever speculated on what becomes of the victims in cases of
this kind?” asked John.
"“Not particularly,” said Herold, seeing that John wanted to talk."
“What do you think can become of a human creature in the circumstances
of this poor little wretch? Her childhood is one vista of bleak
"ugliness. Never a toy, never a kiss, not even the freedom of the gutter."
"Unless you 've been there, you can't conceive the soul-crushing despair"
of that infernal orphanage. She leaves it and goes into the world.
She goes out of a kind of dreary Greek hades into a Christian hell. It
"lasted for months. She was too ignorant and spiritless to complain, and"
"to whom was she to complain? Now she's sent back again, just like a sick"

“Here we go!” shouted Frank.
The boys raced along the slope until they came to a point of timber
"which, following a more fertile spot, thrust itself up the ascent. Here"
"they disappeared, considering themselves reasonably safe in the"
seclusion of the forest. Frank examined his gun and found it empty.
“Good thing that dub didn’t know it was empty!” he laughed.
“Don’t stop now to throw bouquets at yourself!” grinned Harry.
“That’s right!” Jack declared. “We want to be getting back to the camp.
Gilroy’ll have a fit if he wakes up and finds us gone.”
"“Don’t you ever think those half-breeds will give up the chase here,”"
"Frank suggested. “Do you know what they’ll do?” he asked, “They’ll"
circle around and get between us and the camp! That’s what they’ll do.”
"“I sometimes think,” Harry snorted, turning to Jack, “that Frank is"
getting so intelligent that he may have the gift of speech conferred
upon him. He certainly has that proposition right.”
"“Well, if we can’t go back to camp,” Jack asked, “where can we go?”"
“We’ll have to glide into some gentle dell in the bosom of a friendly
"hill!” laughed Harry, “and send a scout out to watch those fellows spy"
upon the camp.”
“If they’ve got a detachment of half-breeds guarding every squad of Boy
"Scouts that have strayed away from the camp today,” Jack laughed, “they"
The man swelled with determination and pride. He had no thought of
"failure, and drew inspiration and joy from the heaviness of the bet"
which he had made with Fortune. He took the born gambler's delight in
a big risk.

"_Malplaquet_?"" said I."
"""I don't propose to tell you what I think,"" replied Dawson stiffly."
"""Still,"" I persisted, passing over the snub, ""you have a theory?"""
"""No, thanks,"" said Dawson contemptuously. ""I have no use for theories."
"When they are wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are"
no help. I believe in facts--facts brought out by constant vigilance.
"Unsleeping watchfulness and universal suspicion, those are the"
"principles I work on. The theory business makes pretty story books,"
"but the Force does not waste good time over them."""
"""What are you going to do?"""
"""This is Thursday afternoon. I am going to join the _Malplaquet_"
"presently, and I'm not going to sleep till she is safely down the"

"Dawson gave a shrug of impatience, for his nerves were on edge. For a"
"moment he hesitated, and then, recollecting the high post to which I"
"had tacitly been appointed in his household, he replied:"
"he had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were"
pushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he
"faced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its"
"tulle curtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the"
broad sills. On either side of the carriage porch their
"hydrangeas—famous in the town—were coming into flower; the pinkish,"
bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading leaves. And
"somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and"
"even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, “There is young life"
here. There are girls—”
"The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on"
"the oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and"
impatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.
"“And were there ices?” came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of"
her rocker.
"“Ices!” cried Ethel. “My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two"
"kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet"
frill.”
"“The food altogether was too appalling,” came from Marion."
"“Still, it’s rather early for ices,” said Charlotte easily."
"“But why, if one has them at all....” began Ethel."
"“Oh, quite so, darling,” crooned Charlotte."
"Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,"
"she nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave."
She ate alone that evening.
"""Isn't your husband coming in?"" asked the woman of the house."
"""Perhaps he doesn't want anything,"" she replied."
"There he stood, away by the tiny barn pretending to be interested in the"
"roof, in the style of building, and walked round looking at it, pursing"
his lips and whistling. But she could see perfectly well from the window
"that his face was blue and dejected. When she had eaten, she walked down"
"to the shore, calling as she passed him:"
"""Go in and eat!"""
"But he had not sunk quite so low; he would not go in to eat, and slept"
towards the papers in the seed-tray.
“You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man

"“Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession, and if what I"
tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away
from me and a heavy imprisonment.” He holds the licence across his
chest; the sweat pours down his face into his paper collar; his eyes
look glazed. When he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry
flesh on his forehead. Nobody buys a watch.
Look out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two
"She threw up her hand suddenly, as if she were about to vent on him"
"all the passions which consumed her--the terror, rage, and shame which"
"swelled in her breast. But something in his gibing tone, something in"
the set lines of his figure--she could not see his face--checked her.
"She let her hand fall in a gesture of despair, and shrank into"
"herself, shuddering. She looked at him as at a serpent--that"
fascinated her. At last she murmured--
'You will not dare. What have they done to you?'
"'Nothing,' he answered. 'It is not their affair; it is yours.'"
For a moment after that they stood confronting one another while the
"sound of the women sobbing in a corner, and the occasional jingle of a"
"bridle outside, alone broke the silence. Behind her the room was dark;"
"behind him, through the open windows, lay the road, glimmering pale"
"through the dusk. Suddenly the door at her back opened, and a bright"
light flashed on his face. It was Marie Wort bringing in a lamp. No
"one spoke, and she set the lamp on the table, and going by him began"
"to close the shutters. Still the Countess stood as if turned to stone,"
and he stood watching her.
"'Where are they?' she moaned at last, though he had already told her."
"'In the camp,' he said."
'Can I--can I see them?' she panted.
"'Afterwards,' he answered, with the smile of a fiend; 'when you are my"
wife.'
Besides--in a hundred years it will all be forgotten. Why do we struggle?
In a hundred years someone will read about it in memoirs and letters and
"think: ""How she wriggled, how she fussed--dear me!"" There are others about"
whom nothing at all will be written or read; life will close over them
like a grave. Either way....
"What sorrows she had--dear, dear, what sorrows! The day she had been"
"unable to pay the bill, she thought herself the center of the universe;"
"everybody stared at her, and she was at her wits' end. Then she heard a"
"man's voice outside saying: ""Haven't you watered Blakka yet?"" That was"
_his_ preoccupation. So she was not the center of the universe after
all.
"Then she and her companion had left the house, and set out on their tour."
"The center? Not at all. Day after day they walked across fields, and"
"through valleys, had meals in houses by the way, and water from the"
"brooks. If they met other travelers, they greeted them, or they did not"
"greet them; no one was less a center of attention than they, and no one"
"more. Her companion walked in vacant thoughtlessness, whistling as he"
went.
At one place they stopped for food.
"""Will you pay for mine for the time being?"" he said."
"She hesitated and then said briefly that she could not pay ""for the time"
"being"" all the way."
"""Of course not, by no means,"" said he. ""Just for the moment. Perhaps we"
"can get a loan further down the valley."""
irritate me; they seem to me like old ladies with a flatulency that
prevents their breathing freely.”
Kennedy laughed at the definition.
_CHIC AND THE REVOLUTION_
“I understand hating bad kings and conquerors; but artists! What harm do
they do?” said Laura.
“Artists are always doing harm to the whole of humanity. They have
"invented an esthetic system for the use of the rich, and they have"
killed the Revolution. The _chic_ put an end to the Revolution. And
"now everything is coming back; enthusiasm for the aristocracy, for the"
Church; the cult of kings. People look backward and the Revolutionary
movement is paralysed. The people that irritate me most are those
"esthetes of the Ruskin school, for whom everything is religious: having"
"money, buying jewels, blowing one’s nose... everything is religious."
"Vulgar creatures, lackeys that they are!”"
"“My brother is a demagogue,” said Laura ironically."
"“Yes,” added Kennedy; “he doesn’t like categories.”"
“But each thing has its value whether he likes it or not.”
"“I do not deny different values, or even categories. There are things of"
"great value in life; some natural, like youth, beauty, strength;"
"others more artificial, like money, social position; but this idea of"
"distinction, of aristocratic fineness, is a farce. It is a literary"
"to glitter with a queer metallic sheen. Then, from each of the three,"
as they passed over the boundary--nothing! All radio communication
"ceased as abruptly as though they'd been stricken dead."""
"He stared at Brand. ""That's all I can tell you, little enough, God"
knows. Something ominous and strange is contained in that red spot:
"but what its nature may be, we cannot even guess. I want you to go"
"there and find out."""
"Brand's determined jaw jutted out, and his lips thinned to a"
purposeful line. He stood to attention.
"""I'll be leaving to-night, sir. Or sooner if you like. I could go this"
"afternoon: in an hour--"""
"""To-night is soon enough,"" said Stone with a smile. ""Now, who do you"
"want to accompany you?"""
Brand thought a moment. On so long a journey as a trip to Jupiter
there was only room in a space ship--what with supplies and all--for
one other man. It behooved him to pick his companion carefully.
"""I'd like Dex Harlow,"" he said at last. ""He's been to Jupiter before,"
"working with me in plotting the northern hemisphere. He's a good man."""
"""He is,"" agreed Stone, nodding approval of Brand's choice. ""I'll have"
"him report to you at once."""
"He rose and held out his hand. ""I'm relying on you, Captain Bowen,"" he"
"said. ""I won't give any direct orders: use your own discretion. But I"
would advise you not to try to land in the red area. Simply fly low
"over it, and see what you can discern from the air. Good-by, and good"
"""Going to Havana?"""
"This, too, I admitted."
"""Well, there's a feller by the desk who missed the steamer, and he"
"hoped--er----"""
"""We'd take him over,"" Tommy supplied the halting words. ""Where is he?"""
"Turning, we easily distinguished the man by his timid glances in our"
direction.
"""Whiz-bang,"" Tommy whispered. ""What the deuce would you call it, Jack?"""
"Except for his age, that might have been sixty, he was most comical to"
"look upon--in stature short and round, suggesting kinship with a gnome."
"His head seemed too large for the body, yet this might have been because"
"it carried a plenteous shock of straw-colored hair, with mustache and"
"beard to match. He was attired in ""knickers"" and pleated jacket, that"
"looked as if he'd slept in them, and his fat legs were knock-kneed. On"
the floor about his feet lay almost every conceivable type and age of
"traveling bag, with the inevitable camera."
"""What's his name?"" Tommy asked, not that that would have made any"
difference if his passport were in order.
"""Registered as 'Monsieur Dragot, of Roumania,'"" the proprietor answered."
"""Roumania!"" Tommy looked at me. ""Let's go meet him, Jack."""
"Monsieur Dragot turned out to be the original singed cat, for assuredly"
he possessed more attractive qualities inside than were exteriorly
half a score of games were in progress at different points of the
quarry-like cauldron which formed the outlaws' rendezvous.
At once the humour of the child changed.
"""They obeyed you,"" she said; ""I like you for that. I mean to have many"
men obey me when I grow up. Then I will kill many--thousands and
"thousands. Now I can do nothing--only I have it in my head--here!"""
The elf tapped her forehead immediately underneath the red sash which
"was tied about it. The Sergeant, though eager to hear her story and"
"marvelling at such sentiments from the lips of a child, successfully"
"concealed his curiosity, and said gently, ""Tell me how you came to think"
"of to-night----"""
"""Of what to-night?"" asked the girl quickly and suspiciously."
"""The deed which is to be done to-night,"" replied the Sergeant simply, as"
though he were acquainted with the whole.
She leaped forward and caught him by the arm.
"""You will stay and go with us? You will lead us?"" she hissed, her blue"
"eyes aflame and with trembling accents, ""then indeed will I be sure of"
my revenge. Then the Italian woman and her devil's brat shall not
"escape. Then I shall be sure--sure!"""
"She repeated the last words with concentrated fury, apparently"
impossible to one of her age. The Sergeant smoked quietly and observed
her. She seemed absolutely transfigured.
"""Tell me that you will,"" she cried, low and fierce, so that her voice"
"machinery in it, and to it go connecting beams from all the square"
"metal plates everywhere. That is all I know."""
"Brand started to question her further, but her time was up. The two"
guards poked their loathsome pumpkin heads in the doorway and
"contemptuously beckoned her out. She answered resignedly, in the"
"piping Rogan tongue, and went with them. But she turned to wave shyly,"
commiseratingly at the two men; and the expression in her clear blue
eyes as they rested on Brand made his heart contract and then leap on
with a mighty bound.
"""We have in ally in her,"" murmured Brand. ""Though God only knows if"
"that will mean anything to us...."""
CHAPTER IV
_In the Tower_
"""What I can't figure out,"" said Dex, striding up and down the big bare"
"room, ""is why we're needed to tell them about the atomic motor."
"They've got our ship, and three others besides. I should think they"
"could learn about the motor just by taking it apart and studying it."""
"Brand grinned mirthlessly, recalling the three years of intensive"
study it had taken him to learn the refinements of atomic motive
"power. ""If you'd ever qualified as a space navigator, Dex, you'd know"
better. The Rogans are an advanced race; their control of polar
magnetism and the marvelously high-powered telescopes Greca mentions
say that the woman only suffers in such cases; the man never.  Whether
that rule proves always true will be shown in this strange story of my
own love.
"She drew her hand away slowly, but forcibly, saying:"
"""You cannot love two women.  Already you have shown a preference for a"
"wife of your own people."""
"""It is all over between us,"" I protested.  ""Mine was a mere passing"
"fancy, engendered, I think, by the loneliness I suffered when I lost"
"you."""
"""Ah,"" (she smiled sadly), ""that is all very well!  A woman, when once"
"played false by the man she loves and trusts, is never the"
"same--_never_!"""
"""Then am I to understand, Yolande, that you refuse to pardon me, or to"
"accept my affection?"""
"""I have already pardoned you,"" she faltered; ""but to accept the love you"
"once withdrew from me without just reason is, I regret to say,"
"impossible."""
"""You speak coldly, as though you were refusing a mere invitation to"
"dinner, or something of no greater importance,"" I protested.  ""I offer"
"you my whole heart, my love--nay, my life;"" and I held her hand again,"
"looking straight into those wonderful eyes, now so calm, so serious,"
that my gaze wavered before them.
"Slowly she shook her head, and her trembling breast rose and fell again."
"""You must not stop here,"" he said. ""You have frightened us all"
terribly. The regiment has come and is attacking. There will be some
"desperate fighting. We must all stick together."""
She caught Nicholson's eyes resting on her. She thought she read pity
"and sympathy in their steady depths, and wondered if he guessed what"
"she had tried to do. But he said nothing, and she followed the two men"
blindly and indifferently back to the bungalow.
CHAPTER X
TRAVERS
"They had no light. They talked in whispers, and now and again, when"
"the darkness grew too oppressive, they stretched out groping hands and"
touched each other. They did this without explanation. Though none
"complained or spoke of fear, each needed the consolation of the"
"other's company, and a touch was worth more than words. Mrs. Cary"
alone needed nothing. She lay on the rough truckle-bed and slept. Thus
she had been for a week--a whole week of nerve-wrecking struggle
against odds which marked hope as vain. Bullets had beaten like rain
"upon the walls about her, the moaning of wounded men on the other side"
of the hastily constructed partition mingled unceasingly with the
cries of the ever-nearing enemy. And she had lain there quiet and
"indifferent. Martins, the regiment's doctor, had looked in once at her"
"and had shaken his head. ""In all probability she will never wake,"" he"
"had said. ""Perhaps it is the kindest thing that could happen to her."""
"""You know what I mean. They probably don't realize it yet, but you're"
going to end up with the Soviet Far East in your wallet. For the price
"of a hot airplane, you get to plunder the region. They're even going to"
be thanking you while you reclaim Sakhalin for Japan. This _Daedalus_
spaceship is going to cost them the ranch. Have to admit it's
brilliant. Along with financing the whole scheme by swindling Benelux
"tax dodgers."""
"""You are too imaginative for your own good, Dr. Vance,"" he said, a thin"
"smile returning. ""Nobody is going to believe your interpretation of the"
"protocol."""
"""You've got a point. Nobody appreciates the true brilliance of a"
"criminal mind. Or maybe they just haven't known you as long as I have."""
"""Really, I'd hoped we would not descend to trading insults."" He reached"
"to refill Vance's sake saucer. ""It's demeaning. Instead I'd hoped we"
"could proceed constructively."""
"""Why not."""
"""Well then, perhaps you'll forgive me if I'm somewhat blunt. I'm afraid"
my time is going to be limited over the next few hours. I may as well
tell you now that we are about to have the first hypersonic test of the
_Daedalus_. Tomorrow morning we will take her to Mach 25. Seventeen
thousand miles per hour. A speed almost ten times greater than any air-
"breathing vehicle has ever before achieved."""
"""The sky's the limit,"" he whistled quietly. Alex hadn't known the half"
of it. This was the ultimate plane.
"""Impressive, I think you'll agree."" Mino smiled and poured more sake"
won your love by a trick. I had to show you the lowest and worst part
"of myself before the best in me could grow--the best in me, which is"
"yours."""
"""You are raving!"""
"""I am not raving. You must see I am not. Look at me. I am calmer than"
"you, though I face certain death. I knew when I came here that the"
"chances were I should be killed before I even saw you, but I had to"
"risk that. I had to win your trust back somehow, honestly and fairly."
"I can not live without your trust."""
"""Beatrice!"" The name escaped him almost without his knowledge. He saw"
tears spring to her eyes.
"""It is true. Your love and your trust have become my life. Then I was"
unworthy of both. I tried to make myself worthy. I did what I could. I
told you the truth--I threw away the only thing that mattered to me. I
"could not hold your love any longer by a lie--I loved you too much!"""
"For that moment the passionate energy of her words, the sincerity and"
"eloquence of her glance, swept back every thought of suspicion. He"
"stood stupefied, almost overwhelmed. Mechanically his lips formed"
themselves to a few broken sentences.
"""You can not know what you are saying. You are beside yourself. Once,"
"in my ignorance, I believed it possible, but now I know that it could"
"never be. Your race despises mine--"""
"""I do not care what you are nor to whom you belong!"" she broke in,"
"exulting. ""You are the man who taught me to believe that there is"
"something in this world that is good, that is worthy of veneration;"
the impression of a forceful man.
"Near them, at a table close by, was a little blond man, with a hooked"
"nose and a scanty imperial, in company with a fat lady. They bowed to"
Marchmont and his wife.
"“That gentleman looks like a Jew,” said Cæsar."
"“He is,” replied Marchmont, “that is Señor Pereyra, a rich Jew; of"
"Portuguese origin, I think.”"
“How quickly you saw it!” exclaimed Susanna.
"“He has that air of a sick goat, so frequent in Jews.”"
"“His wife has nothing sickly about her, or thin either,” remarked Laura."
"“No,” said Cæsar; “his wife represents another Biblical type; one of"
"the fat kine of somebody’s dream, which foretold abundance and a good"
harvest.”
"The Englishman, Kennedy, had also little liking for Jews."
"“I do not hate a Jew as anti-Christian,” said Cæsar; “but as"
"super-Christian. Nor do I hate the race, but the tendency they have"
"never to be producers, but always middlemen, and because they incarnate"
"so well for our era the love of money, and of joy and pleasure.”"
"The English author was a great partisan of Jews, and he asserted that"
they were more distinguished in science and the arts than any other
"race. The Jewish question was dropped in an instant, when they saw a"
smart lady come in accompanied by a pale man with a black shock of hair
"I reflected for a moment, then in a calm voice answered:"
"""Because I discovered that her heart was not wholly mine."""
She regarded me with undisguised amazement.
"""Do you mean that Yolande had another lover?"""
"""No!""  I cried with sudden resolve.  ""This conversation is not fair to"
"her.  It is all finished.  She has forgotten, and we are both happy."""
"""Happy!"" cried the Countess hoarsely.  ""You are, alas! mistaken.  Poor"
Yolande has been the most unhappy girl in all the world.  She has never
"ceased to think of you."""
"""Then I regret, madame,"" I responded."
"""If you really regret,"" she answered, ""then your love for her is not"
"altogether dead."""
"She spoke the truth.  At this point I may as well confide to you, my"
"reader, the fact that I still regarded my charming little friend of"
those careless days of buoyant youth with a feeling very nearly akin to
love.  I recollected the painful circumstances which led to our parting.
"My memory drifted back to that well-remembered, breathless summer's"
"evening when, while walking with her along the white highway near her"
"home, I charged her with friendliness towards a man whose reputation in"
"Brussels was none of the best; of her tearful protests, of my"
"all-consuming jealousy, of her subsequent dignity, and of our parting."
"After that I had applied to the Foreign Office to be transferred, and a"
month later found myself in Rome.
Slyne silenced him with a contemptuous gesture.
"""Whatever you do will make no difference to anyone in the wide world but"
"yourself,"" said Slyne. ""If you do what you're told you'll get a great"
deal more than you deserve out of it. If you don't--D'ye think I'd have
"taken you into the team if I didn't know how to drive you!"" he asked,"
"his eyes beginning to blaze. ""Why, my good fellow, if you refuse, if"
"you don't travel up to your collar, if you so much as shy at anything"
you see or hear--I won't even hurt you; I'll just hand you over to the
police.
"""So make up your mind now, quick!"""
"""You've nothing against me,"" quavered the lawyer."
"""No, I've nothing--not very much, at least, yet,"" Slyne agreed, knotting"
"his tie neatly before the glass. ""But--that may be because you haven't"
"embezzled any of my money--yet."" He had most opportunely recalled what"
the detective Dubois had told him about his new friend.
Mr. Jobling's face was almost green. He got up with an evident effort.
"""I was only joking,"" he declared with a most ghastly grin. ""I'll be"
"quite satisfied with ten per cent. of the accumulated income--in fact,"
"we'll call it a couple of hundred thousand pounds, if you like."""
"""All right,"" Slyne agreed imperturbably. ""Make it that amount if you'd"
rather. How long will it take you to get the papers drawn out? It's
"nearly one o'clock. And--you won't be safe till they're signed."""
"""An hour,"" said Mr. Jobling. ""I'm a quick writer."""
"Two of its nine satellites were in sight at the moment, with a third"
edging over the western rim.
"""Makes you think you're drunk and seeing triple, doesn't it?"""
"commented Dex, who was staring out the thick glass panel beside Brand."
"""Nine moons! Almost enough for one planet!"""
"Brand nodded abstractly, and concentrated on the control board."
Rapidly the ship rocketed down toward the surface. The disk became a
"whirling, gigantic plate; and then an endless plain, with cloud"
formations beginning to take on definite outline.
"""About to enter Jupiter's atmosphere."" Brand spoke into the radio"
transmitter. Over the invisible thread of radio connection between the
"space ship and Earth, four hundred million miles behind, flashed the"
message.
"""All right. For God's sake, be careful,"" came the answer, minutes"
"later. ""Say something at least every half hour, to let us know"
"communication is unbroken. We will sound at ten second intervals."""
"The sounding began: _peep_, a shrill little piping noise like the"
fiddle of a cricket. Ten seconds later it came again: _peep_.
"Thereafter, intermittently, it keened through the control room--a"
"homely, comforting sound to let them know that there was a distant"
thread between them and Earth.
*       *       *       *       *
Lower the shell rocketed. The endless plain slowly ceased its rushing
underneath them as they entered the planet's atmosphere and began to
be pulled around with it in its revolution. Far to the west a faint
at once.
"With this urgency in mind, I suggested to Frances and Betty that I"
"cross to Calais alone, regardless of the weather, leaving them at Dover"
"till my return. But they would not be left behind, so we all set sail on"
a blustery morning and paid for our temerity with a day of suffering. In
"Calais we posted our letters, having learned that a messenger would leave"
"that same day for Paris, and two days later we returned to Dover."
"Our journey home was made in the rain, Bettina sleeping with her head on"
my shoulder a great part of the way. And I enjoyed the rain even more
than I had enjoyed the sunshine.
"We reached London nearly a week before the king's return, so that nothing"
was known of our journey at court.
CHAPTER XI
"""ALL SUNSHINE MAKES THE DESERT"""
"Whatever faults Whitehall may have had as a place of residence, dulness"
"was not among them. There were balls, games with high stakes, theatres,"
"gossip, scandals, and once in a long while an affair of state to interest"
"us. In order to interest the court thoroughly, an affair of state must"
"have involved the getting of money for the privy purse; that is, for the"
"king's personal use, for out of it the courtesans were fed and gambling"
debts were paid.
"""Yes, there may be for a man, but I insist there is no real intellect."""
"""Well, Sarah,"" I answered, showing irritation despite an effort to appear"
"indifferent, ""it is my opinion that the possession of great intellectual"
"power by a woman is the one virtue with which men, as a rule, find"
themselves most willing to dispense. It gives her too great an
"advantage."""
"""Yes, a soft, plump figure like Betty's, long lashes and red lips,"
"surrounded by dimples, are apt to please a fool."""
"""But they're good in their way, Sarah, you'll admit--excellent!"""
"I retorted sharply, caring little if she saw that I was angry."
"""And men are fools, so there! Not another word about the barmaid!"" cried"
"Sarah, dismissing the subject with a wave of her hand."
"But men, too, sometimes like to have the last word, so I remarked: ""The"
"mother of the Duchess of York was a barmaid, at least, a barmistress."""
"""Yes, but is that any reason why Frances should be kissing this one?"
"Doubtless your friend Betty finds men enough to do the office."""
"""Sarah!"" I cried, springing to my feet, now thoroughly angry. ""If you"
"were a man, I'd give you the lie direct!"""
"Sarah began to laugh and clapped her hands, saying: ""I was leading you"
"on. I suspected you were fond of her. Now I know it."""
"But Sarah's remark, being so near the truth, did nothing to allay my"
"anger, so I told her she was a fool, and went into an adjoining room,"
"ruffian,"" said he to himself. ""If they have the same effect on Sallie, I"
"won't grudge the few francs I paid for them!"""
"He tiptoed down the short stairway, and, having tapped very quietly at"
"the door of the after-saloon, entered without more ado. He judged that"
he might have difficulty in gaining admission if he delayed to ask
leave.
The saloon was empty. But from an adjoining cabin came the sound of
"splashing, and from its neighbour the shuffle of heavy feet, a faint"
suggestion of deft hands busy among crisp muslin and sibilant silk.
Slyne hesitated; he wanted to be very tactful and yet was unwilling to
give up the advantage he had thus gained. He closed the door carefully
behind him. It creaked a little.
From the room whence had come the rustle of feminine garments an
"uncanny-looking figure appeared, and darted an angry, apprehensive"
glance about the saloon. The sound of splashing had ceased.
"""'Morning, Ambrizette,"" said Slyne briskly and standing his ground. ""Is"
your mistress up yet? Tell her I have Captain Dove's leave to pay her a
"call."""
"The dumb black dwarf's scowl grew darker, but her hand fell away from"
her breast and she halted as Sallie's voice sounded from within.
"""Is that you, Jasper!"" it ejaculated. ""What do you want? I thought--"""
"""I've come back--with good news for you, Sallie--wonderful news!"" said"
"Slyne. ""And I'm in no end of a hurry to be off again. Call Ambrizette in"
"and get dressed, as quick as you can. Captain Dove's waiting breakfast"
"""It is nothing to laugh at,"" grumbled Gatepath."
"""Not for you, perhaps. But to my mind the situation is gorgeous. Has"
"this man the legal right of succession?"""
"""Beyond a doubt,"" groaned Gatepath. ""His father saw to that."""
"""Then why not leave matters to take their legal course?"" asked the"
"Chief, still laughing. ""The House of Lords will be the better for a"
shock. They are a dull lot. And your lively friend will administer the
"shock all right."""
"Roger Gatepath spread out his hands in agony. ""But it is one of the"
"oldest peerages in the country, as old almost as the Barony of Arundel."
Can't you see how frightful it will be for the family if this--this
"person--is allowed to succeed?"""
"""There is no question of allowing him. If he is the legal heir he must"
succeed. The family must just put him in their pipe and smoke him. What
"else can they do?"""
"""I thought that you, with all your experience of the South, might"
suggest something. Would it not be possible to buy the man off--or might
"he not----"""
"""How can you buy him off when he is the heir? You people are nothing but"
"trustees, who must account to him for every penny. If he claims the"
"peerage and estates, you must accept him. You admit that legally he is"
"the heir. I can see what is in your mind, but it won't do, Gatepath, it"
"won't do. If you try any hanky-panky, that pretty neck of yours will"
find itself in a hempen collar. Now if it was only a case for judicious
"""My poor Yolande!  My poor daughter!""  Finding that my endeavours to"
"console her were futile, I went forth and made inquiries of the three"
frightened maidservants regarding what had occurred.
"One of them, a dark-eyed Frenchwoman in frilled cap, whom I had seen on"
"my previous visit, said, in answer to my questions:"
"""Jean discovered the poor mademoiselle in the petit salon about a"
quarter of an hour after m'sieur had left.  She was lying upon her face
"near the window, quite rigid.  He shouted; we all rushed in, and on"
"examining her found that she was already dead."""
"""But was there no sign of a struggle?""  I inquired, leading the way to"
the room indicated.
"""The room was just as m'sieur sees it now,"" she answered, with a wave of"
her hand.
"I glanced around, but as far as I could distinguish it was exactly as I"
had left it.
"""There was no mark of violence--nothing to show that mademoiselle had"
"been the victim of foul play?"""
"""Nothing, m'sieur."""
Could it have been a case of suicide?  I wondered.  Yolande's words
"before I had taken leave of her were desponding, and almost led me to"
believe that she had taken her life rather than face the man Wolf who
had so suddenly arrived in Paris--the man who exercised upon her some
"mysterious influence, the nature of which I could not guess."
"""To what do you refer?"""
"""You told me that you loved me, Gerald,"" she said in a deep voice,"
"suddenly grown calm.  ""You swore by all you held most sacred that I was"
"all the world to you, and that no one should come between us.  Yet past"
events have shown that you have forgotten those words of yours on the
"day when we idled in the Bois beneath the trees.  You, too, remember"
"that day, do you not--the day when our lips met for the first time, and"
"we both believed our path would in future be strewn with flowers?  Ah!"""
"she sighed, ""and what an awakening life has been to me since then!"""
"""We parted because of your refusal to satisfy me as to the real state of"
"your feelings towards the man who was my enemy,"" I said rather warmly."
"""But was it justifiable?"" she asked in a tone of deep reproach and"
mingled sweetness.  Her blue eyes looked full upon me--those eyes that
"had held me in such fascination in the golden days of youth.  ""Has any"
single fact which you have since discovered verified your suspicions?
"Tell me truthfully;"" and she leaned towards me in an attitude of deepest"
earnestness.
"""No,"" I answered honestly, ""I cannot say that my suspicions have ever"
"been verified."""
"""And because of that you have returned to me when it is too late."""
"""Too late!""  I cried.  ""What do you mean?"""
"""Exactly what I have said.  You have come back to me when it is too"
"late."""
"“Came in here an’ got some grub a full hour ago,” that servitor"
explained briefly. “When he’d eat it he went off agin.”
“Didn’t he say where he was going?” Bainbridge asked.
The cook shook his head. “Nary word.”
“And you didn’t happen to see what direction he took?”
"“Nary a sight,” was the reply. “I was busy inside.”"
"Bob frowned for a second, and then shrugged his shoulders. After all,"
"what did it matter where the fellow had gone, so long as he had taken"
himself away? It was very natural for him to avoid the man who had so
"humiliated him, though it was rather puzzling to have him slip away"
without apparently encountering any one.
"Bob proceeded to give his orders to the cook, explaining that he would"
have to pull up stakes at once and start down the river.
"“The boys will be a long way from here by nightfall,” he said, “so"
you’ll have to hustle. I’ve saved out a couple of men to help you and
"the cookee, who’ll be under your orders till you pitch camp to-night.”"
Outside the mess tent he hesitated an instant. Then he entered the other
"tent. This time he did not pause by the door, but crossed hastily to the"
"farther corner, where there was a small space crudely partitioned off"
"from the main portion. This would be Schaeffer’s sanctum, of course, and"
Bob entered it curiously--only to stop with an exclamation of mingled
"surprise, anger, and chagrin."
The place was in the utmost disorder. Blankets were rolled up in a ball
"After a short walk, Jack beckoned the boys to his side and suggested"
that they take a route to the camp different from that which they had
followed on leaving it.
"“You see, boys,” he explained, “that was a signal, all right, and we"
"haven’t found out the cause of it. So far as we know, it was put up to"
get us away from the camp.”
"“I’m beginning to think it was,” Frank announced. “Either to get us away"
"from the camp for the purpose of capturing us, or for the purpose of"
raiding our provisions.”
"“Well,” Jack went on, “if we duck away to the south and return to the"
"camp by a new course, anyone watching for us might watch in vain.”"
“That’s the idea!” Harry answered.
"“Then here we go the south,” Frank suggested, starting away at as swift"
a gait as was possible in the thicket.
They had proceeded but a short distance when every tree bole of good
size immediately in front of them seemed to their astonished eyes to
"yield a scowling, dirty half-breed. The boys drew their guns."
"“No use, lads!” a voice said, speaking in good English. “The men in the"
"bushes have you covered. Anyway, there’s no harm intended.”"
“Why the holdup?” demanded Jack.
The man who had spoken now advanced to Jack and looked him keenly in the
face. Although carrying the general appearance of the gang of
"half-breeds at his back, the boys could see by the fellow’s face and"
"something a little suspicious about one of his eyes, and a squat,"
queerly-shaped old fellow in semi-clerical garb and wearing smoked
"glasses, completed the party. Their waiters began to hover about them,"
and the fashionable world went on with its dinner.
"""Who was that _lovely_ girl?"" the Duchess of Dawn demanded of her"
"_vis-à-vis_, the veteran soldier, and he, reputed among women to have no"
"heart at all, recalled himself with an evident start from the reverie"
"into which he had fallen. He almost blushed, indeed, under the duchess's"
blandly discerning smile.
"""I don't know, I'm sure, duchess,"" he returned, smiling also, in spite"
"of himself, and beckoned to a servant behind him, whom he despatched on"
some errand.
"""She's registered as Miss Harris, your lordship,"" the man announced in"
an undertone when he returned.
"""Miss Harris!"" echoed the prince, who was also a soldier. He had"
"overheard. And, as he in turn caught the duchess's eyes, he lay back"
"laughing, a little ruefully. But the man opposite him, the master of"
"armies, was not amused."
"""I'd like to know who and what those three fellows with Miss Harris may"
"be,"" said he."

"At their table in the corner, they seemed to be thoroughly enjoying"
themselves. The three men were toasting Sallie and each other with equal
good-will. And even Sallie had dismissed from her mind the last of her
lingering doubts as to the reality and endurance of her part in that
Then the other said to me:
"""This is a thing I have never told anyone yet, but I will tell it to you"
now. There are times when I almost wish I could see German troops
marching victoriously through the streets of London. It is not my reason
"that is speaking now, but my bitterness, which has become stronger than"
"my reason."""
I understood him far too well to make any comment.
"And then after a long silence, I said: ""I wonder if anybody else thinks"
"like that."""
"And he answered: ""Yes, there are many--more than you would believe."""
"But the first added: ""We must remain neutral--that is our one and only"
"duty. The more malevolent our neutrality the better, but it must be"
neutrality. Remember that there are Germans whose bitterness prompts
them to wish that British troops were marching through the streets of
"Berlin. I think their wish is juster than yours, but both wishes cannot"
"be fulfilled, and it is therefore desirable that the next best thing"
"should happen, namely, that both the Allies and their enemies should be"
"entirely deprived of victory."""
"I agreed, but added:"
"""Yes, fundamentally one must remain neutral, but in relation to present"
circumstances one cannot remain neutral. It is our business to arraign
"England, our own country, and not Germany. It is for every nation to"
discover its own faults. There are many Germans of courage and honesty
who will condemn their country for the crimes she has committed. But

"The Sheriff shot one glance at the girl, keen, searching. Then, without"
"so much as the twitch of an eyelid, he accepted his defeat, took a cigar"
"from his pocket and lit it, the flame of the match revealing no"
"expression other than the nonchalance for which he was noted; then,"
picking up his hat and coat he walked slowly to the door. Here he halted
and wished her a polite good-night--so ceremoniously polite that at any
other time it would have compelled her admiration.
"Pale as death and almost on the point of collapse, the Girl staggered"
"back to the table where the wounded road agent was half-sitting,"
half-lying.
Thrusting her hand now into the stocking from which she had obtained the
"winning, if incriminating, cards, she drew forth those that remained and"
"scattered them in the air, crying out hysterically:"
"""Three aces an' a pair an' a stockin' full o' pictures--but his life"

"Conscious-stricken at the fraud that she had imposed upon the gambler,"
the Girl lived a lifetime in the moments that followed his departure.
With her face buried in her hands she stood lost in contemplation of her
"""That boy--there!"" she gasped, ""he frightens me--oh hateful! make him go"
"away!"" And she clutched the young man's arm with such a quick nervous"
"grasp, that a crimson flush rose quickly to Rollo's cheek."
"""No,"" muttered Etienne to himself as he watched the performance"
"critically, ""she was never in love with you, sir! She never did as much"
"for you as that. But on the whole, with a temper like Mistress Concha's,"
"I think you are well out of it, Monsieur Etienne!"" Which wise dictum"
might or might not be based on the fox's opinion as to sour grapes.
All unconsciously Rollo reached a protecting hand across to the little
white fingers which gripped his arm so tightly.
"""Go away, boy,"" he commanded; ""do you not see that you terrify the"
"Señorita?"""
"""I see--that is why I stay!"" cried the amiable youth gleefully,"
flourishing his crutch about his head as if on the point of launching it
at the party.
Rollo laid his hand on the hilt of Killiecrankie with a threatening
gesture.
"""If you come an inch nearer, I will give you plague!"" cried the boy,"
"showing his teeth wickedly, ""and your wench also. You will grow"
"black--yes, and swell! Then you will die, both of you. And there will be"
"no one to bury you, like those in the houses back there. Then all you"
"possess shall be mine, ha, ha!"""
And he laughed and danced till a fit of coughing came upon him so that
he actually crowed in a kind of fiendish exaltation. But Rollo Blair was
"not a man to be jested with, either by devil or devil's imp. He drew a"

"""Is it?  That is strange, it is more a subject for a feuilleton..."""
"""Such a subject must be treated with plenty of pepper...."""
"Then a short discussion begins.  The people listen attentively, as only"
one bottle of vodki has been drunk.
"After the leader, they read the local events, then the court"
"proceedings, and, if in the police court it reports that the defendant"
"or plaintiff is a merchant, then Aristid Kuvalda sincerely rejoices."
"If someone has robbed the merchant, ""That is good,"" says he.  ""Only it"
"is a pity they robbed him of so little.""  If his horses have broken"

"suit in court, ""It is a pity that the costs were not double the amount."""
"""That would have been illegal,"" remarks the teacher"
"""Illegal!  But is the merchant himself legal?"" inquires Kuvalda,"
"bitterly.  ""What is the merchant?  Let us investigate this rough and"
"uncouth phenomenon.  First of all, every merchant is a mujik. He comes"
"from a village, and in course of time becomes a merchant.  In order to"
"be a merchant, one must have money.  Where can the mujik get the money"
"from?  It is well known that he does not get it by honest hard work,"
"and that means that the mujik, somehow or other, has been swindling."
"That is to say, a merchant is simply a dishonest mujik."""
CHAPTER XXII
HIS MOTHER'S ROSARY
"It was, as the soldier had said most truly, a cold morning to be shot"
"in. But the Carlists, accustomed to Cabrera's summary methods, appeared"
"to think but little of the matter, and jested as the firing parties were"
selected and drawn out. Ragged and desolate they looked as they stood on
"a slight slope between the foreigners and the red dawn, biting their"
cartridges and fingering the pulls of their rifles with hands numbed
with cold. At elbow and knee their rags of uniforms flapped like bunches
of ribbons at a fair.
"""In the garden!"" whispered Luis Fernandez to Cabrera."
"""To the garden!"" commanded the general, lighting a new cigarette and"
"puffing vigorously, ""and at this point I may as well bid you good-bye. I"

"hands of your friend Nogueras--and she was a woman and old, gentlemen. I"
"doubt not you know as well how to die as she?"""
"And they did. Not one of them uttered a word. John Mortimer, seeing"
"there was now no chance of making his thousand pounds, set an example"
"of unbending dignity. He comported himself, indeed, exactly as he would"
"have done on his marriage day. That is, he knew that the eyes of many"
"were upon him, and he resolved not to shame the performance. So he went"

"Her pale lips trembled, her eyes were brimming with tears, her chilly"
"hand quivered in mine.  She did not speak for some moments, but at last"
"said in a low, tremulous voice half choked by emotion:"
"""Once you loved me, Gerald,--of that I feel confident; and I"
"reciprocated your affection, God knows!  Our love was, perhaps, curious,"
inasmuch as you were English and I was of a different creed and held
different ideas from those which you considered right.  It is always the
same with a man and woman of different nationality--there must be a
"give-and-take principle between them.  Between us, however, there was"
"perfect confidence until, by a strange combination of circumstances--by"
a stroke of the sword of Fate--that incident occurred which led to our
"estrangement."""
"She paused, her blanched lips shut tight.  ""Well?""  I asked, ""I am all"
attention.  Why is it too late now for me to make reparation for the
"past?"""
I loved her with all my soul.  I was heedless of those words of the old
"Baronne, of Anderson's suspicions, and Kaye's denunciation.  Even if she"
"were a spy, I adored her.  The fire of that old love had swept upon me,"
"and I could not hold back, even though her touch might be as that of a"
leper and her lips venomous.
"""Reparation is impossible,"" she answered hoarsely.  ""Is not that"
"sufficient?"""
"""No, it is not sufficient,"" I answered clearly.  ""I will not be put off"
"by such an answer."""
complete and solemn silence. Only in front of the door several
"she-goats, with bunching, over-full udders, waited to be milked with"
plaintive whimperings and tokens of unrest.
La Giralda looked at her companion. The Sergeant looked at La Giralda.
The same thought was in the heart of each.
"La Giralda went up quickly to the door, and knocked loudly. At"
"farmhouses in Old Castile it is necessary to knock loudly, for the"
"family lives on the second floor, while the first is given up to bundles"
"of fuel, trusses of hay, household provender of the more indestructible"
"sort, and one large dog which invariably answers the door first and"
expresses in an unmistakable manner his intention of making his
breakfast off the stranger's calves.
But not even the dog responded to the clang of La Giralda's oaken cudgel
"on the stout door panels. Accordingly she stepped within, and without"
"ceremony ascended the stairs. In the house-place, extended on a bed, lay"
"a woman of her own age, dead, her face wearing an expression of the"
utmost agony.
In a low trundle-bed by the side of the other was a little girl of four.
"Her hands clasped a doll of wood tightly to her bosom. But her eyes,"
"though open, were sightless. She also was dead."
"La Giralda turned and came down the stairs, shaking her head mournfully."
"""These at least are ours,"" she said, when she came out into the hot"
"summer air, pointing to the little flock of goats. ""There is none to"
"hinder us."""
"""Have the owners fled?"" asked the Sergeant, quickly."
It was the maid’s turn to look surprised.
"“I didn’t think he was to be here,” she said. “He’s had some—”"
"“Trouble at the office,” supplied Kennedy. “That’s what it was about."
Perhaps he hasn’t been able to get away yet. But I had the appointment.
"Ah, I see a telephone in the hall. May I?”"
"He had stepped politely in, and by dint of cleverly keeping his finger"
"on the hook in the half light, he carried on a one-sided conversation"
with himself long enough to get a good chance to look about.
There was an air of quiet and refinement about the apartment in the
Recherche. It was darkened to give the little glowing electric bulbs in
their silken shades a full chance to simulate right. The deep velvety
"carpets were noiseless to the foot, and the draperies, the pictures,"
"the bronzes, all bespoke taste."
But the chief objects of interest to Craig were the little square green
baize-covered tables on one of which lay neatly stacked a pile of
"gilt-edged cards and a mahogany box full of ivory chips of red, white"
and blue.
"It was none of the old-time gambling places, like Danfield’s, with its"
steel door which Craig had once cut through with an oxyacetylene
blowpipe in order to rescue a young spendthrift from himself.
Kennedy seemed perfectly well satisfied merely with a cursory view of
"the place, as he hung up the receiver and thanked the maid politely for"
allowing him to use it.
"""Then my name can't seem very odd to you, Miss Graham!"""
She was regarding me as though trying to discover what kind of a species
"I was that had got on her father's yacht, when the sailor came back"
followed by a husky brute in uniform. Intuitively I stiffened to meet
"the crisis, but even at this eleventh hour a respite came."

"burly one was only the captain, after all--saluted, saying:"
"""I've just now found out, ma'am, he ain't aboard!"""
"""Not aboard? What do you mean?"""
"""After bringing you on last night he went ashore again to get a little"

"Cast back upon his own thoughts, Rollo reviewed many things--his short"
"life, the reckless ups-and-downs in which he had spent it--but all"
without remorse or regret.
"""I might have been a lawyer, and lived to a hundred!"" he said to"
"himself. ""It is better as it is. If I have done little good, perhaps I"
"have not had time to do a great deal of harm."""
"Then very contentedly he curled himself up to sleep as best he might,"
only dreamily wondering if little Concha would be sorry when she heard.
Ramon Garcia sat with his eyes fixed on the sentry who had ceased his
"to-and-fro tramp up the centre, and now leaned gloomily against the"
"wall, his hands crossed about the cross-bar of his sword-bayonet."
"There was a train back to Cagliari that night, said the conductor, at"
which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting
seed-pod. He bounced on his seat. What good was that? What good was a
"train back to Cagliari, when their home was in Snelli! Making matters"
worse--
"So they bounced and jerked and argued at one another, to their hearts'"
"content. Then the conductor retired, smiling subtly, in a way they have."
"Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and"
"said it was a shame. Yes, we chimed, it _was_ a shame. Whereupon a"
self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari
advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert
"sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded"
"face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed."
"It had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed, even"
while the q-b shed a few tears.

"Well, the journey lasted hours. We came to a station, and the conductor"
said we must get out: these coaches went no further. Only two coaches
"would proceed to Mandas. So we climbed out with our traps, and our fat"
"friend with his saddle-bag, the picture of misery."
The one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded. The only other
coach was most of it first-class. And the rest of the train was freight.
We were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string
of freight-vans and trucks.
"There was an empty seat, so we sat on it: only to realize after about"
"five minutes, that a thin old woman with two children--her"
"""And I will take a stone and hit you on the head,"" the young man"
answered respectfully.
"Martyanoff would have broken his bones, had not Kuvalda interrupted"
with:
"""Leave him alone....  Is this a home to you or even to us? You have no"
sufficient reason to break his teeth for him.  You have no better
"reason than he for living with us."""
"""Well, then, Devil take him! ...  We all live in the world without"
"sufficient reason....  We live, and why?  Because!  He also because ..."
"let him alone...."""
"""But it is better for you, young man, to go away from us,"" the teacher"
"advised him, looking him up and down with his sad eyes. He made no"
"answer, but remained.  And they soon became accustomed to his presence,"
"and ceased to take any notice of him.  But he lived among them, and"
observed everything.
"The above were the chief members of the Captain's company, and he"
"called them with kind-hearted sarcasm ""Creatures that once were men."""
For though there were men who had experienced as much of the bitter
"irony of fate as these men, yet they were not fallen so low.  Not"
"infrequently, respectable men belonging to the cultured classes are"
"inferior to those belonging to the peasantry, and it is always a fact"
that the depraved man from the city is immeasurably worse than the
depraved man from the village.  This fact was strikingly illustrated by
the contrast between the formerly well-educated men and the mujiks who
were living in Kuvalda's shelter.
The representative of the latter class was an old mujik called Tyapa.
"shoulder to see what was tickling his fancy so, he frowned and folded"
that document up and returned it to Mr. Jobling.
"""Give it here, now!"" growled Captain Dove, menacing Mr. Jobling with a"
"clenched fist; and the lawyer, after an appealing, impotent glance at"
"Slyne, had no recourse but to comply with that peremptory order."
"""Are you quite sure of your figures?"" Slyne asked, with a scowl. He"
"seemed conscious that he, in his haste, had made a false step. And Mr."
Jobling nodded with nervous assurance.
"""I have inside sources of information as to the revenue of the estates,"""
"he replied, ""and a note of all the investments. I've allowed a wide"
"margin for all sorts of incidentals. I think you'll find, in fact, that"
Lady Josceline's inheritance will amount to even more than I've
"estimated."""
"Slyne smiled again, more contentedly. Nor was his complaisance overcome"
even when Mr. Jobling put to him a half-whispered petition for a
further small cash advance to account of expenses.
"""I wasn't even able to pay Mullins' wages with what you gave me in"
"Paris,"" said the stout solicitor vexedly. ""Fees and so on swallowed it"
"all up, and--I'm actually short of cab-fares!"""
"""Why don't you fire Mullins, then?"" demanded Slyne with a shade of"
"impatience. ""I've just got rid of my chauffeur because he was costing me"
"more than he was worth."""
"""But I can't afford to get rid of Mullins. Just at the moment he's very"
useful to me. It would create a bad impression if I had to run my own

her companions had already taken.
"As soon as she was out of sight, Nicholson recharged his smoking"
"revolver, and stood there quietly waiting. His trained ear heard the"
firing in front of the bungalow cease. He knew then that his men were
"retiring to join Colonel Carmichael, and that he stood alone, the last"
barrier between death and those he loved. The sound of triumphant
shouting drew nearer; he heard the wrenching and tearing of doors
"crashing down before an impetuous onslaught, the cling of steel, a"
howl of sudden satisfaction. His hand tightened upon his revolver; he
"stood ready to meet his enemy single-handed, to fight out the duel"
between man and man. But no one came. A bewildering silence had
followed upon the last bloodthirsty cry. It was as though the hand of
death had fallen and with one annihilating blow beaten down the
approaching horde in the high tide of their victory. But of the two
this strange stillness was the more terrible. It penetrated to the
little waiting group in the old bungalow and filled them with the
knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open
it with. Not even a button you could press.
That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps
back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock
"combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice"
"key--might as well see if that's it, I figured."

"For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million"
"possible combinations--The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and"
a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed
around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.
I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and
"sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found"
myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the
cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.
He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that
looked hard and soft at the same time.
"His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his"
back.
"And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the"
"deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards"
in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation--the kind of tan
that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His
"hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long"
combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down
"And from that day, a year and a half ago, there has been keen"
competition among the inhabitants of the dosshouse as to which can
"swear the hardest at the merchant.  And last night there was a ""slight"
"skirmish with hot words,"" as the Captain called it, between Petunikoff"
and himself.  Having dismissed the architect the merchant approached
the Captain.
"""What are you hatching?"" asked he, putting his hand to his cap, perhaps"
"to adjust it, perhaps as a salutation."
"""What are you plotting?"" answered the Captain in the same tone. He"
moved his chin so that his beard trembled a little; a non-exacting
person might have taken it for a bow; otherwise it only expressed the
desire of the Captain to move his pipe from one corner of his mouth to
"the other.  ""You see, having plenty of money, I can afford to sit"
"hatching it.  Money is a good thing, and I possess it,"" the Captain"
"chaffed the merchant, casting cunning glances at him.  ""It means that"
"you serve money, and not money you,"" went on Kuvalda, desiring at the"
same time to punch the merchant's belly.
"""Isn't it all the same?  Money makes life comfortable, but no money,"""
... and the merchant looked at the Captain with a feigned expression of
"suffering.  The other's upper lip curled, and exposed large, wolf-like"
teeth.
"""With brains and a conscience, it is possible to live without it. Men"
only acquire riches when they cease to listen to their conscience ...
"the less conscience the more money!"""
"""Just so; but then there are men who have neither money nor conscience."""
to 12 points of the new system; thus six picas are equal to 1 inch or
72 points. Printers still estimate the length and width of a page or a
column by the pica; thus a page 4 inches wide is 24 picas.
"The ""em"" is the square of a type body. Thus a ""12-point em"" is 12"
"points wide and 12 points long, or 1 pica long and 1 pica wide. A"
"""10-point em"" is a 10 point square, etc. The em used in measuring"
"newspaper column widths, magazine columns, etc., is known as the em"
"pica, which is 12 points square."
"In using larger faces for headings and display, or smaller faces for"
"footnotes or quoted matter, the printer will select from the same"
"family to which the type belongs, or from some family which combines"
with it harmoniously. Old-style faces should not be used with modern
"faces, but the Scotch face, which is a cross between old-style and"
"modern, combines well with either."

THE TYPESETTING
At this girl’s right hand sat a young man about twenty-four. He was
"well-built, active, strong-jawed and good-natured. But if his"
"description seems to follow that of James Williams, divest it of"
anything Cloverdalian. This man belonged to hard streets and sharp
"corners. He looked keenly about him, seeming to begrudge the asphalt"
under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch.
"While the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry, let me whisper you"
through the low-tuned cardiaphone to sit tight; for now things are
"about to happen, and the great city will close over them again as over"
a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a Broad street
bear.
The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the
last seat. The other passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her
was her Bluebeard’s chamber.
Her eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams. Between two ticks of a watch
"they exchanged their life’s experiences, histories, hopes and fancies."
"And all, mind you, with the eye, before two men could have decided"
whether to draw steel or borrow a match.
"The bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together,"
their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents—a comparison
that is not meant to go further. Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the
conference.
"And now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man"
in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another
hurried to join him.
The girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm
her a card with the telephone number of the laboratory.
"As we left the Blake mansion, Kennedy remarked, “We must trace that car"
somehow—at least we must get someone working on that.”
Half an hour later we were in a towering office building on Liberty
"Street, the home of various kinds of insurance. Kennedy stopped before"
"a door which bore the name, “Douglas Garwood: Insurance Adjuster.”"
"Briefly, Craig told the story of the stolen car, omitting the account"
of the dastardly method taken to blackmail Mrs. Blake. As he proceeded
"a light seemed to break on the face of Garwood, a heavyset man, whose"
very gaze was inquisitorial.
"“Yes, the theft has been reported to us already by Dr. Wilson herself,”"
he interrupted. “The car was insured in a company I represent.”
"“I had hoped so,” remarked Kennedy, “Do you know the woman?” he added,"
watching the insurance adjuster who had been listening intently as he
told about the fair motor car thief.
"“Know her?” repeated Garwood emphatically. “Why, man, we have been so"
close to that woman that I feel almost intimate with her. The
"descriptions are those of a lady, well-dressed, and with a voice and"
"manner that would carry her through any of the fashionable hotels,"
perhaps into society itself.”
"“One of a gang of blackmailers, then,” I hazarded."
"Garwood shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps,” he acquiesced. “It is"
"automobile thieving that interests me, though. Why,” he went on, rising"
"excitedly, “the gangs of these thieves are getting away with half a"
"going to be: all the wind tunnel tests, all the computer simulations,"
even the supersonic test flights--everything said go. _Daedalus I_ was
going to make history tomorrow morning.
"Except, he told himself, it's going to be a very different history from"
the one everybody expects.
"""Major Yuri Andreevich Androv, please report to Hangar Quadrant"
"immediately."""
The stridency of the facility's paging system always annoyed him. He
"glanced at the long line of computer screens one last time, then"
shrugged and checked his watch. Who wanted him?
"Well, a new planeload of Soviet VIPs reportedly had flown in yesterday,"
though he hadn't seen any of them yet. He figured now that everything
"looked ready, the _nomenklatura _were flooding in to bask in triumph."
Maybe after a day of vodka drinking and back slapping with the
"officials in Project Management, they'd sobered up and realized they"
were expected to file reports. So they were finally getting around to
talking to the people who were doing the actual work. They'd summon in
a few staffers who had hands-on knowledge of the project and commission
"a draft report, which they'd then file, unread, under their own names."
Typical.
"He reached for his leather flight jacket, deciding on a brisk walk to"
work off the tension. The long corridor leading from the East Quadrant
to the Hangar Quadrant took him directly past Checkpoint Central and
"the entry to West Quadrant, the Soviet sector, which also contained the"
"flight simulator and the main wind tunnel, or Number One, both now"
quiet.
"""José Maria, the Gitano, the prince of brigands!"" murmured La Giralda."
"""Ah,"" said the Sergeant, coolly, ""I have heard of him."""
CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
"Not a word more was uttered between the two. La Giralda, for no reason"
"that she would acknowledge even to herself, had conceived an infinite"
"respect for Sergeant Cardono, and was ready to obey him implicitly--a"
fact which shows that our sweet Concha was over-hasty in supposing that
one woman in any circumstances can ever answer for another when there is
a man in the case.
But on this occasion La Giralda's submission was productive of no more
"than a command to go down into the town of San Ildefonso, the white"
"houses of which could clearly be seen a mile or two below, while the"
sergeant betook himself to certain haunts of the gipsy and the brigand
known to him in the fastnesses of the Guadarrama.
Like a dog La Giralda complied. She sharpened a stick with a knife which
"she took from a little concealed sheath in her leathern leggings, and"
with it she proceeded to quicken the donkey's extremely deliberate pace.
"Then with the characteristic cry of the goatherd, she gathered her flock"
together and drove them before her down the deeply-rutted road which led
"from the farmhouse. She had not proceeded far, however, when she"
"“Lady from the Stenographer’s Agency to see about the position,” said"
Pitcher.
"Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker"
tape.
"“What position?” he asked, with a frown."
"“Position of stenographer,” said Pitcher. “You told me yesterday to"
call them up and have one sent over this morning.”
"“You are losing your mind, Pitcher,” said Maxwell. “Why should I have"
given you any such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect
satisfaction during the year she has been here. The place is hers as
"long as she chooses to retain it. There’s no place open here, madam."
"Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don’t bring any"
more of ’em in here.”
"The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself"
independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed.
Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the “old man”
seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every day of the world.
The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor
they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell’s customers
were heavy investors. Orders to buy and sell were coming and going as
swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were
"imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,"
"strong machine—strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate,"
"never hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act ready and"
"prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and mortgages, margins and"
"securities—here was a world of finance, and there was no room in it for"
that mattered.
"""I can not,"" she said."
"""Beatrice, do not deceive yourself. Though my life is nothing to"
me--though I would give it a dozen times to save you--I can not do
"otherwise than go on. I may be weak, but I shall be stronger than my"
"weakness. My word is given!"""
He spoke with the tempestuous energy of despair. The minutes were
"passing with terrible swiftness, and any moment the sea behind him"
might burst its dam and sweep her and him to destruction. Already in
the distance he heard the dull clamour of voices raised in angry
remonstrance at the delay. Only those immediately about him were held
in awed silence by the power of his personality. Again Beatrice shook
her head. She stood in the doorway which opened out into the garden
where the besieged had taken refuge. There was no other way. He
advanced toward her. Instantly she raised her revolver and pointed it
at the first man behind him.
"""If I fire,"" she said, ""not even you will be able to hold them back."""
It seemed to her that she stood like a frail wall between two
"overwhelming forces--on the one side, Nehal with his thousands; on the"
"other, Nicholson--alone, truly, but armed with a set and pitiless"
"resolve. A single sentence, which had fallen upon her ears months"
"before, rose now out of an ocean of half-forgotten memories:"
"""Nicholson is the best shot in India,"" some one had said: ""he never"
"misses."" And still Nehal advanced. His jaws were locked, his eyes had"
a red fire in them. She knew then that the hour of hesitation was
"over, and that in that desperate struggle she had indeed lost."
Uncontrollable words of warning rushed to her lips.
gone long barefoot. The marks of a child either stolen for ransom or run
away from home owing to some wild strain in the blood were too obvious
to be mistaken. Her liberty of movement among the gipsies made the
latter supposition the more probable.
"""I am _not_ pretty Chica, and I am not little,"" she cried angrily. ""I"
"would have you remember, Pépe, that _I_ made this plan, which the folk"
of Egypt are to execute to-night. But since this is the great brigand
"Don José of Ronda, who was executed at Salamanca, I will tell him all"
"about it."""
She looked round at the dark faces with which they were surrounded.
"""There are new folk among these,"" she said, ""men I do not know. Bid them"
"go away. Else I will not speak of myself, and I have much to say to Don"
"José!"""
"Pépe of the Eleven Wounds looked about him, and shook his head. Gipsydom"
"is a commonwealth when it comes to a venture like this, and save in the"
"presence of some undoubted leader, all Egypt has an equal right to hear"
and to speak. Pépe's authority was not sufficient for this thing. But
that of the Sergeant was.
"He lifted his Montera cap and said, ""I would converse a while with this"
maid on the affairs of Egypt. 'Tis doubtless no more than you know
"already, and then, having heard her story my advice is at your service."
"But she will not speak with so many ears about. It is a woman's whim,"
"and such the wisest of us must sometimes humour."""
The gipsies smiled at the gay wave of his hand with which Cardono
uttered this truism and quickly betook themselves out of earshot in
"groups of ten and a dozen. Cards were produced, and in a few minutes"
CHAPTER LXXXVI
"_Wherein our Hero, and Another, go Home_"
The sunlight that had painted the white face of Paris with a hundred
hues all day had given place to a gentle drizzle as the twilight fell;
and the steady downpour had driven Noll into a restaurant which he was
not in the habit of frequenting; it had kept him there in its bright
rooms until he knew every face and every trick of gesture of the people
who sat about him.
The night was well advanced when he sallied out into the light rain;
"turning up his collar, he strode homewards."
He paid small heed to the rain; and as he turned out of the well-washed
"street into the courtyard where he had his lodging, and climbed the"
"stairs to his room, he scarcely noticed that he was wet."
"The rustle of women’s petticoats was in his ears, and when he walked"
abroad in these days he was aglow with the sense of the warm regard
"of women’s eyes, that glanced upon him from the dark shadows of"
rakish hats; the walk and movement of women found a rhythmic echo in
his thinking. The warmth of the coming summer was in his blood. His
instincts were jigging to the dancing measure of the season.
As he flung off his wet clothes he was seized with a whim to go to the
tavern of _The Golden Sun_; and he decided to humour the whim.
He lit a candle and flipped through a book until it was close on
midnight. But he was restless--and he arose eagerly when it was time to
"a marine signal-station as well, passing ships have to be signalled"
and reported. The spell of labour varies from four to five hours or
"more. Obviously, the task is more exacting and arduous in the winter"
than in summer. During the former season the lamps have to be lighted
"as early as 3.15 p.m., and are not extinguished until eight o’clock"
"the next morning. In the summer, on the other hand, the lamps may be"
required for less than six hours or so. In northern latitudes where the
"daylight is continuous owing to the midnight sun, the light scarcely"
seems necessary. Yet it is kept burning during the scheduled hours of
darkness.
"Thus, night in and night out the whole year round, a comparatively"
small band of faithful toilers keeps alert vigil over the dangers of
"the deep, for the benefit of those who “go down to the sea in ships,"
and do their business in great waters.” The safety of thousands of
human lives and of millions sterling of merchandise is vested in
"their keeping. The resources of the shipbuilder, the staunchness of"
"the ship, the skill and knowledge of the captain--all would count for"
"nothing were it not for the persistent, steady glare of the fixed,"
"the twinkling of the occulting, or the rhythmic, monotonous turning"
"spokes of the revolving light, thrown over the waste of waters from the"
lighthouse and the lightship.

"""We can do nothing but await the critical moment,"" said the Captain,"
"walking about among them.  ""When they turn us out we shall seek a new"
"place for ourselves, but at present there is no use spoiling our life"
by thinking of it ...  In times of crisis one becomes energetic ... and
if life were fuller of them and every moment of it so arranged that we
were compelled to tremble for our lives all the time ...  By God! life
"would be livelier and even fuller of interest and energy than it is!"""
"""That means that people would all go about cutting one another's"
"throats,"" explained Abyedok, smilingly."
"""Well, what about it?"" asked the Captain, angrily.  He did not like to"
hear his thoughts illustrated.
"""Oh!  Nothing!  When a person wants to get anywhere quickly he whips up"
"the horses, but of course it needs fire to make engines go ..."""
"""Well, let everything go to the Devil as quickly as possible. I'm sure"
I should be pleased if the earth suddenly opened up or was burned or
destroyed somehow .. only I were left to the last in order to see the
"others consumed ..."""
"""Ferocious creature!"" smiled Abyedok."
"""Well, what of that?  I ... I was once a man .. now I am an outcast ..."
that means I have no obligations. It means that I am free to spit on
everyone.  The nature of my present life means the rejection of my past
... giving up all relations towards men who are well fed and well
"dressed, and who look upon me with contempt because I am inferior to"
them in the matter of feeding or dressing. I must develop something new
"within myself, do you understand?  Something that will make Judas"
But they were presently delivered from their difficulty by the newly
nominated commander-in-chief himself.
"""This scene is painful to me,"" said Señor Muñoz, placidly, ""it irritates"
my nerves. I have a headache. I think I shall retire and leave these
gentlemen to make such arrangements as may be necessary till the return
"of our guards, which will doubtless take place within an hour or so. If"
"you need me you can call for me!"""
Having made this general declaration he turned to Rollo and addressed
himself particularly to him.
"""My rooms, I would have you know, are in the north wing,"" he continued;"
"""I beg that there shall be no firing or other brutal noise on that"
"side. Anything of the kind would be most annoying. So pray see to it."""
"Then he advanced to where his wife stood, her eyes full of anger at this"
desertion.
"""My angel,"" he said, calmly, ""I advise you sincerely to do the same."
Retire to your chamber. Take a little _tisane_ for the cooling of the
"blood, and leave all other matters to these new friends of ours. I am"
sure they appear very honest gentlemen. But as you have many little
"valuables lying about, do not forget to lock your door, as I shall mine."
"Adieu, my angel!"""
And so from an inconceivable height of dandyism his Excellency the Duke
of Rianzares would have stooped to bestow a good night salutation on his
"wife's cheek, had not that lady, swiftly recovering from her stupor,"
"suddenly awarded him a resounding box on the ear, which so far"
discomposed the calm of his demeanour that he took from his pocket a
"'Can you do anything,' I asked, 'to cheer him? Do you speak to him of"
"what may happen after death, of hopes of another life?'"
"'No one can tell,' said my friend, 'what will happen after death. It"
"depends on a man's life, if he has done good or evil, what his next"
"existence will be, whether he will go a step nearer to the Peace. When"
"the man is dying no monks will come, truly; but an old man, an old"
"friend, father, perhaps, or an elder of the village, and he will talk to"
"the dying man. He will say, ""Think of your good deeds; think of all that"
"you have done well in this life. Think of your good deeds.""'"
'What is the use of that?' I asked. 'Suppose you think of your good
"deeds, what then? Will that bring peace?'"
The Burman seemed to think that it would.
"'Nothing,' he said, 'was so calming to a man's soul as to think of even"
one deed he had done well in his life.'
"Think of the man dying. The little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
"with an outer veranda, where the friends are sitting, and the inner"
"room, behind a wall of bamboo matting, where the man is lying. A pot of"
"flowers is standing on a shelf on one side, and a few cloths are hung"
here and there beneath the brown rafters. The sun comes in through
"little chinks in roof and wall, making curious lights in the"
"semi-darkness of the room, and it is very hot."
"From outside come the noises of the village, cries of children playing,"
"grunts of cattle, voices of men and women clearly heard through the"
still clear air of the afternoon. There is a woman pounding rice near
"by with a steady thud, thud of the lever, and there is a clink of a loom"
"I took down the address, but I was most ungracious to Eilert. Why couldn't"
he have kept the other knapsack--why this particular one?
Eilert replied that it was true the gentleman had offered him the other
"one, but he could see from the outside that it was not so good as this"
one. And I should remember that the money the missis had paid him hadn't
covered more than the bill for one of them. So it was only reasonable that
"he should take the fullest knapsack. As a matter of fact, he had behaved"
"very well, and that was the truth. Because when she gave him the larger"
"knapsack, and wrote the address, she had scolded, but he had kept quiet,"
"and said not another word. And anyway, nobody had better try it on"
"him--they'd better not, or he'd know the reason why!"
Eilert shook a long-armed fist at the sky.
"When he had eaten, drunk his coffee, and rested for a while, he was not so"
lively and talkative as on the previous day. He had been brooding and
"speculating ever since last summer, when the motor traffic started, and"
"did I think it would be a good idea for him to hire three grown men, too,"
and build a much bigger house than Olaus's?
"So he had caught it, too--the great, modern Norwegian disease!"
"The knapsack was back in her room again; yes, these were her clothes; I"
"recognized her blouses, her skirts and her shoes. I hardly looked at them,"
"of course; just unpacked them, folded them neatly, and put them back in"
the bag again; because no doubt Eilert had had them all out in a heap.
This was really my only reason for unpacking them.
finger-bowls.
The name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda?
"Please listen this time—Tildy—Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and"
too anxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself
"once or twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite."
"The Voice at Bogle’s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and did"
"not shine in the way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and"
contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the
waitresses concerning food.
Will it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she
donned a few hundred dollars’ worth of clothes and joined the Easter
"parade, and had you seen her, you would have hastened to say so"
yourself.
The customers at Bogle’s were her slaves. Six tables full she could
wait upon at once. They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience
"for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving, graceful figure."
They who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the
light of her smiles. Every man there—and they were mostly men—tried to
make his impression upon her.
Aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once.
"And every smile that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a"
"scatter-gun, in as many hearts. And all this while she would be"
"performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans, pot roasts,"
"ham-and, sausage-and-the-wheats, and any quantity of things on the iron"
and in the pan and straight up and on the side. With all this feasting
and flirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle’s came mighty near being a
"salon, with Aileen for its Madame Récamier."
"old, old babies inside. She holds up a lace parasol; he sucks the knob"
"of his cane, and the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks,"
and the steaming horse leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the
hill.
"Under a tree, Professor Leonard, in cap and gown, stands beside his"
"banner. He is here “for one day,” from the London, Paris and Brussels"
"Exhibition, to tell your fortune from your face. And he stands, smiling"
"encouragement, like a clumsy dentist. When the big men, romping and"
"swearing a moment before, hand across their sixpence, and stand before"
"him, they are suddenly serious, dumb, timid, almost blushing as the"
Professor’s quick hand notches the printed card. They are like little
"children caught playing in a forbidden garden by the owner, stepping"
from behind a tree.
The top of the hill is reached. How hot it is! How fine it is! The
"public-house is open, and the crowd presses in. The mother sits on the"
"pavement edge with her baby, and the father brings her out a glass of"
"dark, brownish stuff, and then savagely elbows his way in again. A reek"
"of beer floats from the public-house, and a loud clatter and rattle of"
voices.
"The wind has dropped, and the sun burns more fiercely than ever."
Outside the two swing-doors there is a thick mass of children like
flies at the mouth of a sweet-jar.
"And up, up the hill come the people, with ticklers and golliwogs, and"
"roses and feathers. Up, up they thrust into the light and heat,"
"shouting, laughing, squealing, as though they were being pushed by"
"something, far below, and by the sun, far ahead of them—drawn up into"
"the full, bright, dazzling radiance to... what?"
"""Sounds like raving, sonny. Who the dickens is Basil the Wolf? No, Jack,"
"that doesn't tell us anything."""
"""It tells us he couldn't have been inspired like that unless the place"
"and people were real to him!"""
"""Well, pirate or priest,"" Tommy laughed, ""he'll do if he waltzes us up"
"to the big adventure. You're about fit enough to tackle one now!"" During"
the past forty-eight hours he had openly rejoiced with Gates at my
"improvement and tried, with the indifferent success of an unbeliever, to"
play up at top speed that silly idea of an approaching adventure.
"We had strolled aft, and now stopped to watch a tall Jamaica negro--or"
so we thought him to be--asking Gates for a place in the crew. His
"clothing was too scant to hide the great muscles beneath, and Tommy"
"touched my arm, saying:"
"""There's a specimen for you!"""
"Had he been cast in bronze a critic might have said that the sculptor,"
"by over-idealizing masculine perfection, had made the waist too small,"
"the hips too slender, for the powerful chest and shoulders; the wrists"
and ankles might have been thought too delicate as terminals for the
"massive sinews leading into them. He smiled continually, and spoke in a"
"soft, almost timid voice."
"""I like that big fellow,"" I said. Perhaps I had been well called a"
"pantheist, having always extravagantly admired the perfect in form or"
face or the wide outdoors.
"Feeling my interests he turned from Gates, looking at me with dog-like"
pathetic trustfulness. Among the things he told us briefly--for the crew
watches when they turned up the slope. They would have felt less
comfortable during the latter part of their journey if they had known
that they were passing within a few hundred yards of the headquarters of
the outlaws at the old mission.
After a time they came to what looked like a wrinkle in the face of the
"grand old mountain. They proceeded up this with no little caution, not"
knowing but enemies might be watching there. It was just such a place as
outlaws lurking for prey or cowering from officers would be apt to seek.
"The wrinkle, or gully, led almost to the snow line and finally ended in"
"a little dip which lay between two summits rising side by side, like"
jagged rows of teeth.
"“I’m half starved and half frozen!” Harry declared, as he rested for a"
"time in the depth of what had once been a mountain lake, but which had"
been drained by the gully. “If I ever get back in little old New York
"again, I’m going to get Dad to make me a gasoline buggy with a snout"
"nine feet long, and I’m going to push traffic aside on Broadway for the"
next thousand years.”
“How often have you said that?” laughed Jack.
"“Let’s see,” Frank put in, “this is the twelfth trip we boys have taken,"
"either in the interests of the Secret Service or on vacations, so this"
makes twelve times that Harry has promised never to leave New York again
once he gets back there.”
“That’s all right!” Harry grinned. “You fellows ain’t half so hungry as
I am or you wouldn’t feel so gay over it.”
"“Now, how far are we from camp?” asked Jack."
was you. I'm so sorry I didn't have a chance to introduce you to mother
this morning. But mother wants me to take you back to the hotel. You
can have a room right next to mine and we'll have scads of fun--You'll
"come, won't you?"" For Sidney's face was unyielding."
"Like one cornered, Sidney stood straight against the table, her hands,"
"red from the hot dish water, clasped tightly behind her back. Though"
she knew that Pola was trying to make amends for her rudeness of the
"morning, something within her heart turned hard. The dusty idol was"
crumbling to bits of clay.
"""She's only inviting me because Mr. Dugald has told her to,"" she"
reasoned inwardly. And aloud she answered in a steady voice:
"""I'm sorry, but I simply can't leave Aunt Achsa. You must come here and"
"we'll find lots of jolly things to do--"""
"""Here?"" laughed Pola, glancing around the old kitchen."
"""Why not here?"" roared Mr. Dugald. ""As long as you've broken into our"
Secret Garden we'll introduce you to some things you've never done
before in your life. Only Sid will have to find some suitable clothes
"for you, and you'd better leave your complexion on the dressing table."""
"Pola accepted his banter good-naturedly. ""I shall be deeply grateful,"
"old dear, if you _will_ introduce me to any sensations I have not"
"experienced before. There, now, will that hold you for awhile?"" She"
"turned to Sidney. ""We quarrel like this all the time, but it's fun and"
I always have the last word. I make him so mad he can't think of
anything withering enough to say and I seize that strategic moment to
"cease firing. You see, I practice on Dug. I _will_ come tomorrow if I"
"may. Now, Duggie dear, lead me out of this funny lane or else I'll"
with just the right inflection of sarcasm to sting. It had suddenly
occurred to him that the fellow’s object was to make him lose his
"temper, and thus precipitate a clash, during which almost anything might"
"be accomplished. Not only did he refuse to let go his grip, but he did"
"his very best to goad Joyce himself into flaming out, and possibly"
betraying a few secrets.
"“That’s hardly the question, though,” he went on swiftly. “Strikes me"
you’ve been rather premature in running out the boom. Your mill isn’t
"operating, and I have yet to see a single log coming downstream except"
our own.”
"“Never you mind that,” retorted Joyce hotly. “Do you think a man’s going"
to wait till his timber comes in sight afore makin’ arrangements to take
care of it? You can’t come over me with no soft talk like that. The
"boom’s there, an’ there it stays. Half the river’s clear for you to use,"
an’ that’s all you gets.”
"“Hum! That’s your last word, is it?” inquired Bainbridge quietly. “You"
even refuse to let us swing the boom around so we can break our jam?”
“I do!” replied the red-haired individual emphatically. “The first man
"that tries to monkey with my property will wish he hadn’t, that’s all I"
got to say.”
"He raised his automatic significantly, but Bob was not even looking at"
"him. The young man’s gaze had swept out to the face of the jam, and in"
an incredibly short space an accurate picture of its appearance had been
photographed on his brain. Still without giving Joyce the satisfaction
"of a glance, he turned away, motioning Peters to accompany him."
"“A put-up job, of course,” he said tersely, when they were through the"
had marvellously recovered from his over-night's nervous break-down. A
"sound sleep, a visit from the barber, a bath and a liberal breakfast had"
all helped to alter him outwardly and inwardly for the better. He was
"once more the respectably prosperous, self-confident solicitor."
"""I believe you've been out all night,"" he observed in a jocular tone of"
"reproof, a waggish forefinger uplifted."
"""I've covered a couple of hundred miles in the car while you've been"
"asleep,"" answered Slyne, turning into his dressing-room. ""I've brought"
"the girl back with me--and the old man, her guardian. We're going to"
"have trouble with him unless we're very careful. So listen, and I'll"
"tell you how things stand."""
"Mr. Jobling composed his features into their most professional aspect,"
"but that gave place by degrees to a variety of other expressions, while"
"Slyne, busy changing his clothes, related all he himself knew as to"
Sallie's past history.
"""And now the old man thinks he is entitled to put a price on her,"" Slyne"
"concluded. ""She's promised to marry me, but he won't let her go till I"
"hand him a hundred thousand dollars."""
Mr. Jobling lay back limply in his chair. In all his career he had
"never, he asserted, heard a more scandalous suggestion."
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne cut him short. ""The money's no object to"
me. But you can understand what a difficult fellow he is to deal with.
"And what I'm going to do, merely as a precaution against his playing us"
"false in the end, is to give him my note of hand for the amount he"
"demands, endorsed by you, and payable the day I marry his adopted"
"daughter."""
"“Fine man,” commented the younger man aloud. “Hope I do run into him"
"again. Meanwhile, however, the rear isn’t coming along half quick"
"enough, and I haven’t seen a darn thing all afternoon of the wangan. I"
hope nothing’s happened to it and the grub. That would be one awful
blow!”
It was one that was spared him. Within half an hour the clumsy scow hove
"in sight. It tied up to the bank a little later, and before dark"
preparations for supper were going on merrily.
Bob did not get in till later. Assured that all was well with the cook
"and his staff, he went on downstream to see how Peters and his gang were"
progressing. On his return he discovered a stranger warming himself by
"the drying fire. He looked like an old-time woodsman, and the instant"
"Bainbridge appeared he was on his feet, extracting an envelope from the"
interior of his hat.
"“From Mr. Tweedy, sir.”"
The young lumberman ripped it open without a premonition of the blow in
store for him. It was natural for Tweedy to write. He would be reporting
"his success in the matter of credit, of course, and probably gloating"
over the amount of manufactured lumber he had sold in so short a time.
Bainbridge noted that it had been written in the Bangor office the night
"before. Then, settling himself by the fire, he proceeded to read:"
"Dear Bobby: It’s all up with us, boy. We’re done, and we may as well"
admit it first as last and make what terms we can with the gang. I
can’t get credit anywhere. Crane’s been ahead of me and spilled the
"beans each time. What’s more, Gastich absolutely refuses to renew that"
"note. Says he must have the cash for some stocks he’s carrying, and"
"all that; but you know what it means. It’s due in less than a week,"
"forces along the various jutting balconies of the second floor,"
"carefully darkening all the rooms in their rear, so that, till the"
"moment of the attack itself, the assailants would have no idea that they"
were expected. It was his idea that the small doors on the garden side
"of the house, which led right and left to the servants' quarters, would"
be attacked first. He was the more assured of this because the Sergeant
"had recognised, in the bivouac of the gipsies, a man who had formerly"
been one of the royal grooms both at La Granja and at Aranjuez. He would
"be sure to be familiar, therefore, with that part of the interior of the"
"palace. Besides, being situated upon the side most completely removed"
"from the town, the assailants would have the less fear of interruption."
"While Rollo was thus cogitating, Concha came softly to his side,"
appearing out of the gloom with a suddenness that startled the young
man.
"""I have pulled up the ladder by which we ascended and laid it across the"
"balcony,"" she said. ""Was that right?"""
"""You--alone?"" cried Rollo in astonishment."
She nodded brightly.
"""Certainly,"" she answered; ""women are not all so great weaklings as you"
"think them--nor yet such fools!"""
"""Indeed, you have more sense than I,"" Rollo responded, gloomily; ""I"
"ought to have remembered that before. But, as you know, I have had many"
"things to think of."""
"""I am glad,"" she said, more quietly and submissively than ever in her"
"life, ""that even in so small a matter I am permitted to think a little"
"of Death coming in heroic form, as when a man or woman dies for a great"
"cause, in which he has opportunity of admiring courage, devotion and"
"unselfishness; or of Death coming as a result of treachery, such as"
"we find in the death of Baldur, of Siegfried, and of others, so that"
children may learn to abhor such deeds; but also a fair proportion of
"stories dealing with death that comes naturally, when our work is done"
"and our strength gone, which has no more tragedy than the falling of"
a leaf from the tree. In this way we can give children the first idea
that the individual is so much less than the whole.
Quite small children often take Death very naturally. A boy of five
met two of his older companions at the school door. They said sadly
"and solemnly: “We have just seen a dead man!” “Well,” said the little"
"philosopher, “that's all right. We've _all_ got to die when our work's"
done.”
"In one of the Buddha stories which I reproduce at the end of this book,"
"the little Hare (who is, I think, a symbol of nervous Individualism)"
"constantly says: “Suppose the Earth were to fall in, what would become"
of me?”
"As an antidote to the ordinary attitude towards death, I commend an"
"episode from a German folk-lore story called “Unlucky John,” which is"
included in the list of stories recommended at the end of this book.
The following sums up in poetic form some of the material necessary for
the wants of a child:
THE CHILD.
"The little new soul has come to Earth,"
"ravine. It was decided, too, that there was not a moment to be lost in"
"putting their plan into execution. In consequence, Castro immediately"
took his departure.
The hour that passed before the time set for Johnson to leave the cabin
"was a most trying one for both of them. It was not so hard on the man,"
"of course, for he was excited over the prospect of escaping; but the"
"Girl, whose mind was filled with the dread of what might happen to him,"
"had nothing to sustain her. Despite his objection, she had stipulated"
"that, with Jackrabbit as a companion, she should accompany him to the"
"outskirts of the camp. And so, at the moment of departure, throwing"
"about her a cloak of some rough material, she went up to her lover and"
said with a quiver in her voice:
"""I'm ready, Dick, but I'm a-figurin' that I can't let you go alone--you"
"jest got to take me below with you, an' that's all there is to it."""
The man shook his head.
"""There's very little risk, believe me. I'll join Castro and ride all"
through the night. I'll be down below in no time at all. But we must be
"going, dear."""
The man passed through the door first. But when it came the Girl's turn
"she hesitated, for she had seen a dark shadow flit by the window. It was"
"as if someone had been stealthily watching there. In another moment,"
"however, it turned out to be Jackrabbit and, greatly relieved, the Girl"
whispered to Johnson that he was to descend the trail between the Indian
"and herself, and that on no account was he to utter a word until she"
gave him permission.
"For another moment or so they stood in silence; Johnson, appreciating"
convinced than ever before that there were at least distinct periods of
_good_ fortune in every man's life.
"Before reaching Gravesend, we halted at a grassy spot near the river"
"bank, where we ate our dinner. When the horses had rested, we set off for"
"Rochester, in which place we expected to spend the night at the Maid's"
"Garter, a famous old inn kept by a friend of Pickerings."
I had noticed a twinkle in Pickering's eyes when he directed us to go to
"this tavern, but did not understand the cause of his merriment until I"
"learned that by a curious old custom, a maid seeking entrance for the"
first time must contribute one of her garters before being admitted. The
worst feature of the usage was that the garter must be taken off at the
"door, and then and there presented to the porter, who received it on the"
point of his official staff.
"After entering Rochester, we went to the Maid's Garter and at once drove"
"into the courtyard, as the custom is with travellers intending to remain"
all night.
"When we left the coach and started to climb the steps to the great door,"
we found the landlord and his retinue waiting to receive us. Frances was
"in the lead, and when we reached the broad, flat stone in front of the"
"door, the head porter stepped before her, bowed, and asked humbly:--"
"""Is my lady maid or madam?"""
"Frances looked up in surprise, and he repeated his question."
"""What is that to you, fellow?"" asked Frances."
"""It is this, my lady,"" returned the porter. ""If my lady be a maid, she"
SPIRITUS FRUMENTI--WHISKY
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid obtained by the distillation of the
"mash of fermented grain (usually of mixtures of corn, wheat and rye) and"
at least four years old.
PROPERTIES.--An amber-colored liquid having a distinctive odor and
"taste, and a slightly acid reaction. Its specific gravity should not be"
"more than 0.945, nor less than 0.924, corresponding, approximately, to"
"an alcoholic strength of 37 to 47.5 per cent, by weight, or 44 to 55 per"
"cent, by volume. Contains no more than traces of fusel oil. The"
alcoholic liquors owe their flavor to bouquet to ethers which are only
"developed in course of time. The amylic alcohol, or fusel oil, in whisky"
"is therefore converted into ethers, which give the characteristic flavor"
to whisky.

"PROPERTIES.--A pale amber-colored liquid, having a distinctive odor and"
taste and a slightly acid reaction. Its specific gravity should not be
"more than 0.941, nor less than 0.925 at 15.6° C. (60° F.),"

"dead within him. If a man has lived a wicked life, he dies a wicked man,"
and no wicked man can obtain the perfect rest of the sinless dead.
Heaven is shut to him. But if heaven is shut it is not shut for ever; if
"hell may perhaps open to him it is only for a time, only till he is"
purified and washed from the stain of his sins; and then he can begin
"again, and have another chance to win heaven. If there is no immediate"
"heaven there is no eternal hell, and in due time all will reach heaven;"
"all will have learnt, through suffering, the wisdom the Buddha has shown"
"to us, that only by a just life can men reach the Great Peace even as he"
did.
So that if Buddhism has none of the consolation for the dying man that
"Christianity holds out, in the hope of heaven, so it has none of the"
threats and terrors of our faith. There is no fear of an angry Judge--of
a Judge who is angry.
"And yet when I came to think over the matter, it seemed to me that"
surely there must be something to calm him in the face of death. If
"Buddhism does not furnish this consolation, he must go elsewhere for it."
"And I was not satisfied, because I could find nothing in the sacred"
"books about a man's death, that therefore the creed of the people had"
"ignored it. A living creed must, I was sure, provide for this somehow."
"So I went to a friend of mine, a Burman magistrate, and I asked him:"
"'When a man is dying, what does he try to think of? What do you say to"
"comfort him that his last moments may be peace? The monks do not come, I"
know.'
"'The monks!' he said, shaking his head; 'what could they do?'"
I did not know.
"kept explaining all the way home how the accident had happened, what he"
"had said and what the lawyer had said, pointing to objects on the way as"
though this stone represented the lawyer and that the abyss into which he
had plunged.... Solem still carried the rope he had not had a chance to
"use. Miss Torsen asked no more than anyone else, and made purely"
"conventional comments: ""I advised him against it, I begged him not to"
"go...."""
"But however much we talked, we could not bring the lawyer back to life."
"Strange--his watch was still going, but he himself was dead. The doctor"
"could do nothing here, and returned to his village."
There followed a depressing evening. Solem went to the village to send a
"telegram to the lawyer's family, and the rest of us did what we thought"
decent under the circumstances: we all sat in the living room with books
"in our hands. Now and again, some reference would be made to the accident:"
"it was a reminder, we said, how small we mortals were! And the Associate"
"Master, who had not the soul of a tourist, greatly feared that this"
disaster would injure the resort and make things still more difficult for
Paul; people would shun a place where they were likely to fall off and be
killed.
"No, the Associate Master was no tourist, and did not understand the"
Anglo-Saxon mind.
Paul himself seemed to sense that the accident might benefit him rather
than do him harm. He brought out a bottle of brandy to console us on this
mournful evening.
"And since it was a death to which we owed this attention, one of the men"
from Bergen made a speech.
"covered with fairy-like toilet-articles, its blue delft bowls full of"
"flowers, its atmosphere so dearly English, yet English of the days when"
Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the mere. In no other spot on the
"globe could be found such a sea-chamber, with its high bed, on which lay"
"the sweet, elfin face, half child's, half woman's, framed in the soft,"
brown hair.
"Risca smoked on, and Stellamaris, seeing him disinclined to talk, gazed"
"happily out to her beloved Channel, and dreamed her dreams. They had"
"often sat like this for an hour together, both feeling that they were"
talking to each other all the time; and often Stella would break the
"silence by telling him to listen. At such times, so people said,"
"an angel was passing. And he would listen, but could not hear. He"
"remembered Walter Herold once agreeing with her, and saying:"
“There's a special little angel told off to come here every day and
beat his wings about the room so as to clear the air of all troubling
things.”
"In no other spot on the globe could be found such a sea-chamber,"
"wing-swept, spirit-haunted, where pain ceased magically and the burden"
of intolerable suffering grew light. No other haven along all the coasts
of the earth was a haven of rest such as this.
And the Furies were driving him from it! But here the Furies ceased from
driving. Here he had delicious ease. Here a pair of ridiculously frail
hands held him a lotus-fed prisoner. He smoked on. At last he resisted
"the spell. The whole thing was nonsensical. His pipe, only lightly"
"packed by the frail hands, went out. He stuffed it in his pocket, and"
cleared his throat. He would say then and there what he had come to say.
"Stellamaris turned her head and laughed; and when Stellamaris laughed,"
"camp just where we were and wait for daylight, when we might regain"
the camel track.
"I knew he was right, but said I would make one final effort on foot"
"to find the track, and directed him to give me the hurricane lamp we"
carried on the car.
"Stumbling and slipping over the broken ground in the pitch darkness,"
"the lamp barely lighting up my immediate path, I had wandered some"
distance from the car when I heard voices. Instantly I thought of the
"Raiders who were over-running the district. It would be too galling,"
"too humiliating to be captured by them before the campaign, on which"
"I was building such high hopes, had even begun."
Noiselessly I put out the lamp and listened in the dense darkness.
"There was absolute silence for some minutes, and I stood stock still."
"Then voices sounded again, and I conjectured that there were not more"
"than two, or at the most three, speakers."
"I thought rapidly, and finally decided that there would not be many"
men in front of me. Had there been anything approaching an encampment
"of the Raiders in the neighbourhood, there would have been lights,"
camp fires and considerable noise. The voices I had heard probably
"belonged to men who had seen the lights of the car, and had come to"
find out what it was.
"I turned swiftly and made my way back to the car, where I had"
foolishly left my revolver. Recovering my weapon I warned Allan in a
"whisper of the voices I had heard, and told him to be ready to stand"
"by. Then I made my way back in the darkness, and when I had regained"
"the spot, called out loudly, in Hindustani, ""Who's there?"""
"to mystify the ruffian as much as I do."""
"""I will watch for his ears when he next calls, which, I expect, will"
"be to-morrow. Thank you very much. I won't sneak."""
"""Remember that nothing else in the way of identification is of any"
"use, for I doubt if either of us has ever seen the real, undisguised"
Dawson as he is known to God. We know a man whom we think is the
genuine article--but is he? Cary's description of him is most unlike
the man whom we see here. I expect that he has a different identity
for every place which he visits. If he told me that at any moment he
"was wholly undisguised, I should be quite sure that he was lying. The"
man wallows in deception for the very sport of the thing. But he can't
"change his ears. Study them, and you will be safe."""
Our club was the only place in which we could be sure that Dawson did
"not penetrate, though I should not have been surprised to learn that"
one or two of the waitresses were in his pay. Dawson is an ardent
feminist; he says that as secret agents women beat men to a frazzle.
Shortly before Dawson left for his headquarters on the north-east
"coast he dropped in upon me. He had finished his researches, and"
revealed the results to me with immense satisfaction.
"""I have fixed up Menteith,"" he began, ""and know exactly how he came"
"into communication with the German Secret Service."" The contemptuous"
"emphasis which he laid on the word ""Secret"" would have annoyed the"
Central Office at Potsdam. I have given the detected British spy the
name of Menteith after that of the most famous traitor in Scottish
"history; if I called him, say, Campbell or Macdonald, nothing could"
save me from the righteous vengeance of the outraged Clans.
"as, until I could reach Robat, I had no knowledge at all as to the"
strength and composition of the force that would be at my disposal.
But upon one thing I made up my mind--even at that early stage--I
"would do my utmost to show these Raiders, who were doing us so much"
"harm, that they could not do this with impunity. The lesson once"
"driven home, an endeavour should be made to become friendly with"
"them, to win them back to our side, and, so to speak, appoint them as"
doorkeepers of the Baluchistan frontier; but doorkeepers with their
rifles pointed at our enemies instead of at ourselves.
In the midst of these meditations I found myself stumbling with
"fatigue, so, with a last look at the beauty of the night, I turned"
"indoors, and in a few minutes was sound asleep, and making up for the"
"""whiteness"" of the night before."
CHAPTER II
THE ROAD TO ROBAT
Mushki-chah--The native contractor--An evening rencontre--Idu
of the Chagai Levies--The native idea of an airship--Idu the
invaluable--Robat.
"On the third day we made good progress, fate being kind in helping us"
"to avoid the sandy pitfalls which had hitherto been our undoing, and,"
"by nightfall, we found ourselves approaching the post of Mushki-chah."
Here we found the road blocked with a number of camel caravans
"directed to the political aspect of the situation, he acknowledged the"
gravity of the disclosure. But honestly he could not pretend to think it
a thing which should alter or lessen the esteem or love in which
Medland's friends held him. And even if the original act were seriously
"worthy of blame, the lapse of years made present severity as"
"unreasonable as it would be unkind. In vain Medland reminded him that,"
"let the act be as old and long past as it would, the consequences"
remained.
"""What!"" Norburn cried, ""would any one think the worse of Daisy? The more"
"fools they!"" and he laughed cheerfully, adding, ""I only wish she'd let"
"me show her I think none the worse of her. Why, it's preposterous, sir!"""
"""Preposterous or not,"" answered Medland, ""half the people in the place"
will let her know the difference. I may agree with you--God knows how I
"should like to be able to!--but there's no blinking the fact. Well, I"
"must tell her."""
"He recollected telling the same story to the other woman he loved, and"
"he shrank in sudden dread, lest his daughter should say what Alicia had"
"said, ""To me it is--horrible!"" The words echoed in his brain. ""Ah, I"
"can't speak of it,"" she had cried, and the gesture of her hand as she"
repelled him lived before his eyes again. Surely Daisy would not do that
to him!
"""I should be like Lear--without a grievance,"" he said to himself, with"
"a wry smile. ""The very height of tragedy!"""
It was near midnight before he put away his work. Norburn had left him
"alone two hours before, and he rose now, laid down his pipe, and went to"
look for his daughter in her little sitting-room. His heart was very
heavy; he must make her understand now why a man who made love to her
the right to make his own terms at private houses upon the two remaining
nights of the working week. The costumes were to be provided by the
"managers, but were to be the property of the actors, who would undertake"
to replace them should any harm befall them at private representations.
"When these matters had been satisfactorily settled, and certain other"
"details arranged, the great men took their leave in high good humour;"
"and the Old Lion, shaking back his mane of shaggy hair, grasped Grey by"
"the hands, his eyes sparkling in his head."
"""Your fortune is made, young man! your fortune is made!  You will never"
need to fear poverty again. What life so grand as that of the man who
"can sway the multitude, make men laugh or weep at his bidding, hold them"
"suspended breathless upon his lips, move them to mirth, or rouse them to"
"the highest realm of passion?  Ah, that is life! that is life! Have I"
"not tasted it?  Do I not know?  And that life lies before you, my son."
"What the principles of Wycliffe have done for England, the principles"
"of Savonarola may yet do for Italy. At any rate, his work for Italy is"
not done yet.
"_December 19, 1902._"
[Sidenote: Pisa's Four Monuments.]
The four chief objects of interest at Pisa are all in a group at the
"northern end of the town, and a wonderfully effective group it is: the"
"cloistered cemetery, or Camp Santo, with its fifty-five shiploads of"
"earth from the Holy Land; the Baptistery, with its remarkable echo;"
"the Cathedral, with the pendent lamp in the nave which suggested to"
"Galileo the idea of the pendulum; and that wonder of the world, the"
"white marble Tower, which leans thirteen feet out of the perpendicular."
ANTITOXIN.--A counter poison or antidote generated within the body to
counteract the toxins of bacteria. Antitoxins are frequently injected
hypodermically in the treatment of certain infectious diseases and also
"to immunize against disease, as Tetanus Antitoxin for the treatment of"
"tetanus or lockjaw, etc."
ANTIVENENE.--A name applied to blood-serum of animals rendered immune
against snake-poison owing to its antidotal properties.
"ANTIZYMOTIC.--A medicine preventing fermentation, as Salicylic Acid,"
etc.
"APERIENT.--A medicine possessing a mild laxative or purgative effect, as"
"Rochelle Salts, etc."
"APHRODISIAC.--A medicine which stimulates sexual appetite, as"
"Cantharides, Nux Vomica, Phosphorus, Alcohol and general tonics, etc."
"AROMATIC.--A medicine characterized by a fragrant taste or odor, as"
"Aromatic Spiritus of Ammonia, Ginger and the essential oils, etc."
"ASTRINGENT.--A medicine which contracts vessels and arrests discharges,"
"as Tannic Acid, Ergot, etc."
"AUXILIARY.--A medicine that assists the action of another, as Chloral"
Hydrate would assist Bromide of Potassium in checking excitability.
"BITTER.--A medicine with a bitter taste, stimulating the"
gastro-intestinal secretions without materially affecting the general
"system, as Qussia Gentian, etc."
to the exclusion of all other duties. This telegram informs me that a
"parcel has been handed in at Carlisle and the bearer arrested."""
"""Excellent!"" I cried. ""My time is at your disposal, Dawson. We shall"
"now get full light."""
He sat down and scribbled a reply wire directing the parcel and its
"bearer to be brought to him with all speed. ""They should arrive in two"
"or three hours,"" said he, ""and in the meantime we will tackle the"
draughtsman who made that plan of the battleship. Good-bye Mrs.
"Copplestone, and thank you very much for your hospitality. Your"
"husband goes with me."" My wife shook hands with Dawson, and politely"
saw him off the premises. She has said little to me since about his
"visit, but I do not think that she wishes ever to meet with him again."
"Little Jane, who kissed him once more at parting, is still attached to"
the memory of her colonel.
*       *       *       *       *
"Dawson led me to the private office at the Central Police Station,"
"which was his temporary headquarters, and sent for the dossier of the"
"locked up draughtsman. ""I have here full particulars of him,"" said he,"
"""and a verbatim note of my examination."" I examined the photograph"
"attached, which represented a bearded citizen of harmless aspect; over"
"his features had spread a scared, puzzled look, with a suggestion in"
it of pathetic appeal. He looked like a human rabbit caught in an
unexpected and uncomprehended trap. It was a police photograph. Then I
"began to read the dossier, but got no farther than the first"
"paragraph. In it was set out the man's name, those of his wife and"
"children, his employment, record of service, and so on. What arrested"
"my researches was the maiden name of the wife, which, in accordance"
"with the northern custom, had been entered as a part of her legal"
"""The Señor, the tall stranger, had a mission to the Lady Superior of the"
"Convent,"" she began. ""From Don Baltasar Varela it was, Prior of the"
great Carlist Monastery of Montblanch. He trusted his papers into her
"hands as a guarantee of his loyalty and good faith, and here they are!"""
Concha flashed them from her bosom and laid them in the general's hands.
"Usually Cabrera was blind to female charms, but upon this occasion his"
eye rested with pleasure on the quick and subtle grace of the Andaluse.
"""Then you are a nun?"" he queried, looking sharply at her figure and"
dress.
"""Ah, no,"" replied Concha, thinking with some hopefulness that she was to"
"have at least a hearing, ""I am not even a lay sister. The good Lady"
Superior had need of a housekeeper--one who should be free of the
convent and yet able to transact business without the walls. It is a
serious thing (as your honour knows) to provision even a hundred men who
can live rough and eat sparely--how much harder to please a
convent-school filled from end to end with the best blood in Spain! And
"good blood needs good feeding----"""
"""As I well knew when I was a butcher in Tortosa!"" quoth Cabrera,"
"smiling. ""There were a couple of ducal families within the range of my"
"custom, and they consumed more beef and mutton than a whole _barrio_ of"
"poor pottage-eaters!"""
To make Cabrera smile was more than half the battle.
"""You are sure they had nothing to do with the slayers of my mother?"" He"
"was fierce again in a moment, and pulled the left flange of his"
moustache into his mouth with a quick nervous movement of the fingers.

Mother Superior of the Convent of the Holy Innocents. Do not attempt to
penetrate the secret. I assure you it will be quite useless. And pray do
"not suppose that only you can adventure forth on perilous quests!"""
"""I assure you,"" began Rollo, eagerly, ""that I suppose no such thing. At"
the moment when you came up I was wishing with all my heart that the
responsibility of the present undertaking had been laid on any other
"shoulders than mine!"""
"Yet in spite of his modesty, certain it is that from that moment Rollo"
rode no longer with his head hanging down like a willow blown by the
wind. The reins lay no more lax and abandoned on his horse's neck. On
"the contrary, he sat erect and looked abroad with the air of a"
"commander, and his hand rested oftener on the hilt of Killiecrankie,"
with the air of pride which Concha privately thought most becoming.
"""And in what case left you my wife and babe?"" suddenly demanded El"
"Sarria, riding up, and inquiring somewhat imperiously of the new"
recruit concerning the matter which touched him most nearly.
"""The Señora Dolóres is safe with the good sisters, and as in former"
"times I was known to have been her companion, it was judged safest that"
I should not longer be seen in the neighbourhood. Likewise I was charged
with the tidings that Luis Fernandez with a company of Cristino
"Migueletes has been seen riding southward to cut you off from Madrid,"
"whither it is supposed you are bound!"""
Rollo turned quickly upon her with some anger in his eye.
"""Why did you not tell me that at first?"" he said."
And on Mrs. James Williams’s face was recorded a little library of the
world’s best thoughts in three volumes. Volume No. 1 contained the
belief that James Williams was about the right sort of thing. Volume
"No. 2 was an essay on the world, declaring it to be a very excellent"
place. Volume No. 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest
seat in a Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all
understanding.
"James Williams, you would have guessed, was about twenty-four. It will"
gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate. He was exactly
"twenty-three years, eleven months and twenty-nine days old. He was well"
"built, active, strong-jawed, good-natured and rising. He was on his"
wedding trip.
"Dear kind fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P."
touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of
"the boat club. Instead of any of them turn backward—oh, turn backward"
and give us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip over again. Just
"an hour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees"
"looked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin—even"
if it was the hatpins that did the work. Can’t do it? Very well; hurry
"up with that touring car and the oil stock, then."
Just in front of Mrs. James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket
and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses. Only in dreams and
"milliners’ shops do we, alas! gather grapes and roses at one swipe."
"This girl gazed with large blue eyes, credulous, when the megaphone man"
roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should
be concerned. Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in
the form of pepsin chewing gum.
soon found it; but there I came to a check. Round the churchyard stood
"a number of quiet family houses, many-gabled and shaded by limes, and"
doubtless once occupied by reverend canons and prebendaries. But no
"one of these held such a position that it could shoulder Herr Krapp's,"
or be by any possibility the house I wanted. The churchyard lay too
far from the street for that.
I walked up the row twice before I would admit this; but at last I
"made it certain. Still Herr Krapp must know his own premises, and not"
"much cast down, I was going to knock at a chance door and put the"
"question, when my eyes fell on a man who sat at work in the"
"churchyard. He wore a mason's apron, and was busily deepening the"
inscription on a tablet let into the church wall. He seemed to be the
"very man to know, and I went to him."
"'I want a house which looks into the Neu Strasse,' I said. 'It is the"
next house to Herr Krapp's. Can you direct me to the door?'
"He looked at me for a moment, his hammer suspended. Then he pointed to"
"the farther end of the row. 'There is an alley,' he said in a hoarse,"
croaking voice. 'The door is at the end.'
"I thought his occupation an odd one, considering the state of the"
"city; but I had other things to dwell on, and hastened off to the"
"place he indicated. Here, sure enough, I found the mouth of a very"
"narrow passage which, starting between the last house and a blind"
"wall, ran in the required direction. It was a queer place, scarcely"
"wider than my shoulders, and with two turns so sharp that I remember"
wondering how they brought their dead out. In one part it wound under
"the timbers of a house; it was dark and somewhat foul, and altogether"
so ill-favoured a path that I was glad I had brought my arms.
"earnest when he preaches on Truth, and he is in just as dead earnest"
"when, stripped of every moral scruple, he pursues a spy or a criminal."
"In pursuit he is ruthless as a Prussian, but towards the captured"
victim he can be strangely tender. I should not be surprised to learn
that he hates capital punishment and is a strong advocate of gentle
"methods in prison discipline."""
"The chief assistant stared, opened a drawer, and pulled forth a slim"
"grey pamphlet. It was marked ""For Office Use Only,"" and was entitled,"
"""Some Notes on Prison Reform,"" by Chief Inspector William Dawson."
"I had begun to read the pamphlet, when a step sounded outside; the"
"assistant snatched it from my hand, flashed it back into its place,"
and jumped to attention as Dawson entered. He surveyed us with those
"searching, unwinking eyes of his--for we had the air of"
"conspirators--and said brusquely: ""Clear out, Wilson. You talk too"
"much. And don't admit any one except Petty Officer Trehayne."""
"""The _Antigone_!"" cried Cary, who thought only of ships. ""The"
"_Antigone_! Is she much damaged?"""
"""No. Whoever tried to cut her wires was disturbed, or in too great a"
"hurry to do his work well. The main gun-cable was nipped, but not cut"
"through. She will be delayed till to-morrow, not longer. I am not"
"worrying about the _Antigone_, but about the new battleship"
"_Malplaquet_, which was commissioned last month, is nearly filled up"
"with stores, and is expected to leave the river on Saturday. We can't"
"have her delayed by any hanky tricks, not even if we have to put the"
"whole detective force on board of her. Still, I'm not so anxious as I"
"was. This _Antigone_ business has cleared things up a lot, and one can"
"sift out the impossible from the possible. To begin with, the"
"_Antinous_ was in for repairs to her geared turbines, and the"
"and groan, while they are, for the most part, forgetful of anything"
"else life may have to offer."""
"""But what IS life without plenty of money?"" inquired the Duchess"
"carelessly--""Surely, not worth the trouble of living!"""
"Alwyn looked at her steadily, and a swift flush colored her smooth"
"cheek. She toyed with the magnificent diamond spray at her breast, and"
wondered what strange spell was in this man's brilliant gray-black
eyes!--did he guess that she--even she--had sold herself to the Duc de
la Santoisie for the sake of his money and title as easily and
unresistingly as though she were a mere purchasable animal?
"""That is an argument I would rather not enter into,"" he said"
"gently--""It would lead us too far. But I am convinced, that whether"
"dire poverty or great riches be our portion, life, considered apart"
"from its worldly appendages, is always worth living, if lived WELL."""
"""Pray, how can you separate life from its worldly"
"appendages?""--inquired a satirical-looking gentleman opposite--""Life IS"
"the world, and the things of the world; when we lose sight of the"
"world, we lose ourselves,--in short, we die,--and the world is at an"
"end, and we with it. That's plain practical philosophy."""
"""Possibly it may be called philosophy""--returned Alwyn--""It is not"
"Christianity."""
"""Oh, Christianity!""--and the gentleman gave a portentous sniff of"
"contempt--""That is a system of faith that is rapidly dying out; fast"
"falling into contempt!--In fact, with the scientific and cultured"
"classes, it is already an exploded doctrine."""
"There were a lot of untouched spaces--a horde, a myriad. On the side"
"wall was a chart, showing that nine squadrons of twenty-five spacecraft"
"each were patrolling back and forth through the uncharted wastes,"
seeking the space-wrecked lifeships.
The maddening part was the hourly report from both lifeships. It was
"like someone hiding in the dark and calling for aid, invisible and"
"alone. And not really calling for aid, but only making whimpering"
noises. For the signaling equipment on the lifeships was not equipped
"with the complicated infrawave phone, but only with the simple"
"signal-emitter, coded to transmit the identification call of the unit."
"On the hour they came in, calling three times, ""Lifeship Seventy-nine,"
"Seventy-nine, Number Three."" Number Two had not been heard from."
"Presumably it was not in use, or hadn't made the grade."
Wilson chewed his fingernails and fretted. Was Alice on Number One or
"Number Three, or was she on Number Two and it had foundered?"
"If she were still alive, what kind of fellow survivors were with her?"
He hoped she was with a group. If she had blown out in a lifeship with
"only one other--well, Ted Wilson did not like the idea. Of course, it"
was more customary than not for a young woman to love lightly before
she mated permanently. There was a lot less chance of wading into
matrimony wide-eyed and ignorant of what it was all about.
"But Wilson, if willing to face such transient loving at all, would"
"have preferred that Alice have her chance to pick and choose, rather"
than have the matter thrust upon her in the middle of a threatening
situation. The passion that comes with the shadow of death is only the
"instinct of racial preservation, and it mates men and women unsuited to"
than by the Secretary of State alone. Indians were under a great
"difficulty, in that they could not remain indefinitely in England after"
taking their degrees and being away from the place of recruitment their
claims were overlooked.
"83,643. There was no reason why a European should be paid a higher rate"
of salary than an Indian on account of the distance he came. An Indian
felt a sense of inferiority if a difference was made as regards pay. The
very slight saving which government made by differentiating between the
two did not compensate for the feeling of wrong done. This feeling would
"remain even if the pay was the same, but an additional grant in the"
shape of a foreign service allowance was made to Europeans. All workers
"in the field of education should feel a sense of solidarity, because"
"they were all serving one great cause, namely, education."
"83,644. The term ""professor"", as at present used in India, was"
"undoubtedly a comprehensive one, but it was equally comprehensive in the"
West.
"83,645. (Sir Murray Hammick). The witness did not wish to recruit"
definite proportions of the service in England and in India
respectively. He would for various reasons prefer a large number of
Indians engaged in education.
"83,646. Even in Calcutta he would not make any difference between the"
pay of the Indian and the pay of the European.
"83,647. (Sir Valentine Chirol). The witness attached great value to the"
influence of the teacher upon the student in the earlier stages of his
"education, and it was in these stages that that influence could best be"
exercised. At the same time he desired to limit the appointment of
non-Indians to men of very great distinction.
"been there, and had secured all the little snakes. There were seven of"
them.
"We asked the boys what they intended to do with the snakes, and they"
answered that they would show them to their friends in the village. 'And
then?' we asked. And then they would let them go in the water. My friend
"killed all the hamadryads on the spot, and gave the boys some coppers,"
and we went on. Can you imagine this happening anywhere else? Can you
"think of any other schoolboys sparing any animal they caught, much less"
poisonous snakes? The extraordinary hold that this tenet of their
religion has upon the Burmese must be seen to be understood. What I
"write will sound like some fairy story, I fear, to my people at home. It"
is far beneath the truth. The belief that it is wrong to take life is a
belief with them as strong as any belief could be. I do not know
"anywhere any command, earthly or heavenly, that is acted up to with such"
earnestness as this command is amongst the Burmese. It is an abiding
principle of their daily life.
Where the command came from I do not know. I cannot find any allusion to
it in the life of the great teacher. We know that he ate meat. It seems
to me that it is older even than he. It has been derived both by the
Burmese Buddhists and the Hindus from a faith whose origin is hidden in
the mists of long ago. It is part of that far older faith on which
"Buddhism was built, as was Christianity on Judaism."
But if not part of his teaching--and though it is included in the sacred
"books, we do not know how much of them are derived from the Buddha"
himself--it is in strict accordance with all his teaching. That is one
"of the most wonderful points of Buddhism, it is all in accordance; there"
are no exceptions.
I have heard amongst Europeans a very curious explanation of this
"men of learning, men of character who will take on themselves the burden"
"of the world."" Such is the prophetic vision given to the greatest of"
teachers. The modern teacher from England will set before him an ideal
"not less exalted--regarding his pupils as his comrades, he as an"
Englishman will instill into them greater virility and a greater public
spirit. This will be his special contribution to the forming of our
Indian youths.
Turning to the Indian students he could say that it was his good fortune
never to have had the harmonious relation between teacher and pupils in
any way ruffled during his long connection with them for more than three
decades. The real secret of success was in trying at times to see things
from the student's point of view and to cultivate a sense of humour
enabling him to enjoy the splendid self-assurance of youth with a
"feeling not unmixed with envy. In essential matters, however, one could"
not wish to meet a better type or one more quickly susceptible to finer
appeals to right conduct and duty as Indian students. Their faults are
"rather of omission than of commission, since in his experience he formed"
"that the moment they realised their teachers to be their friends, they"
"responded instantly and did not flinch from any test, however severe,"
that could be laid on them.

LIGHT VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
"On the 14th January 1916, Dr. J. C. Bose delivered a public lecture, on"
"Light Visible and Invisible, at the third Indian Science Congress held"
I did not like to say before my lady what I thought--that the
"Waldgrave was not quite himself, nor to be depended upon; and instead"
I proposed to go forward on foot and learn if anything was amiss. The
"road ran straight down the hill, and the party could scarcely pass me,"
"even in the gloom. If I found all well, I would whistle, and they"
could come on.
"My lady agreed, and, leaving them halted, I started cautiously down"
the hill. The darkness was not extreme; the cloud drift was broken
"here and there, and showed light patches of sky between; I could make"
"out the shapes of things, and more than once took a clump of bushes"
"for a lurking ambush. But halfway down, a line of poplars began to"
"shadow the road on our side, and from that point I might have walked"
"into a regiment and never seen a man. This, the being suddenly alone,"
"and the constant rustling of the leaves overhead, which moved with the"
"slightest air, shook my nerves, and I went very warily, with my heart"
in my mouth and a cry trembling on my lips.
Still I had reached the hillfoot before anything happened. Then I
"stopped abruptly, hearing quite distinctly in front of me the sound of"
footsteps. It was impossible that this could be the sound that the
"Waldgrave had heard, for only one man seemed to be stirring, and he"
"moved stealthily; but I crouched down and listened, and in a moment I"
was rewarded. A dark figure came out of the densest of the shadow and
"stood in the middle of the road. I sank lower, noiselessly. The man"
seemed to be listening.
It flashed into my head that he was a sentry; and I thought how
fortunate it was that I had come on alone.
"Presently he moved again. He stole along the track towards me,"
where a girl is weaving ceaselessly. All these sounds come into the
"house as if there were no walls at all, but they are unheeded from long"
custom.
The man lies on a low bed with a fine mat spread under him for bedding.
"His wife, his grown-up children, his sister, his brother are about him,"
"for the time is short, and death comes very quickly in the East. They"
"talk to him kindly and lovingly, but they read to him no sacred books;"
they give him no messages from the world to which he is bound; they
whisper to him no hopes of heaven. He is tortured with no fears of
"everlasting hell. Yet life is sweet and death is bitter, and it is hard"
to go; and as he tosses to and fro in his fever there comes in to him an
"old friend, the headman of the village perhaps, with a white muslin"
"fillet bound about his kind old head, and he sits beside the dying man"
and speaks to him.
"'Remember,' he says slowly and clearly, 'all those things that you have"
done well. Think of your good deeds.'
"And as the sick man turns wearily, trying to move his thoughts as he is"
"bidden, trying to direct the wheels of memory, the old man helps him to"
remember.
"'Think,' he says, 'of your good deeds, of how you have given charity to"
"the monks, of how you have fed the poor. Remember how you worked and"
saved to build the little rest-house in the forest where the traveller
"stays and finds water for his thirst. All these are pleasant things, and"
"men will always be grateful to you. Remember your brother, how you"
"helped him in his need, how you fed him and went security for him till"
"he was able again to secure his own living. You did well to him, surely"
that is a pleasant thing.'
"By a window at the end of the passage, one could see, far away, the"
"Alban Hills, looking like a blue mountain-range, half hidden in white"
"haze, and nearby one could see the trees in the Protestant cemetery and"
the pyramid of Caïus Cestius close to them.
"Cæsar felt a sort of deep repugnance for the people shut up here,"
remote from life and protected from it by a lot of things.
“The man who is playing the harmonium in this church with its opaque
"light, is a coward,” he said to himself. “One must live and struggle in"
"the open air, among men, in the midst of their passions and hatreds,"
even though one’s miserable nerves quiver and tremble.”
"After showing them the monastery, the abbot Hildebrand took them to his"
"study, where he worked at revising ancient translations of the Bible. He"
had photographic copies of all the Latin texts and he was collating them
with the original.
"They talked of the progress of the Church, and the abbot commented with"
"some contempt on the worldly success of the Jesuit churches, with their"
saints who serve as well to get husbands and rich wives as to bring
winning numbers in the lottery.
"Before going out, they went to a window, at the other end of the"
corridor from where they had looked out before. Below them they could
"see the Tiber as far as the Ripa harbour; opposite, the heights of the"
"Janiculum, and further, Saint Peter’s."
"When they went out, Kennedy said to Cæsar:"
"“What devilish effect has the abbey produced in you, that you are so"
much gayer than when we went in?”

"The climate of this region is equable, both as to temperature and"
humidity. Epidemic diseases are practically unknown among either men or
beasts. Should irrigation in future seem needful to agriculture the
multitude of streams furnish an ample water supply and innumerable sites
for reservoirs.
Westward from David the face of the country rises gently until you come
"to the Caldera Valley which lies at the foot of the Chiriqui Peak, an"
extinct volcano perhaps 8000 feet high. Nowhere in Panama do the
"mountains rise very high, though the range is clearly a connection of"
the Cordilleras of North and South America. The Chiriqui Peak has not in
"the memory of man been in eruption, but the traces of its volcanic"
character are unmistakable. Its crater is a circular plain about half a
mile in diameter surrounded by a densely wooded precipitous ridge. As
the ascent is continued the woods give way to grass and rocks. While
"there is a distinct timber line, no snow line is attained. At the foot"
"of the mountain is El Bouquette, much esteemed by the Panamanians as a"
"health resort. Thither go Canal workers who, not being permitted to"
"remain on the Zone during their vacations, wish to avoid the long voyage"
to North American ports.

It will be realised from the scanty number of examples offered in
"this section that it is only a side issue, a mere suggestion of an"
"occasional alternative for the Story-hour, as likely to develop the"
imagination.
I think it is well to have a good number of stories illustrating the
importance of common sense and resourcefulness. For this reason I
consider that stories treating of the ultimate success of the youngest
"son are very admirable for the purpose, because the youngest child,"
"who begins by being considered inferior to the elder ones, triumphs in"
"the end, either from resourcefulness, or from common sense, or from"
"some high quality, such as kindness to animals, courage in overcoming"
"difficulties, etc.[27]"
Thus we have the story of Cinderella. The cynic might imagine that it
was the diminutive size of her foot that ensured her success: the child
"does not realise any advantage in this, but, though the matter need not"
"be pressed, the story leaves us with the impression that Cinderella had"
"been patient and industrious, forbearing with her sisters. We know that"
"she was strictly obedient to her godmother, and in order to be this"
she makes her dramatic exit from the ball which is the beginning of
her triumph. There are many who might say that these qualities do not
ten of them.
"At last they met with a French vessel, a Martinico ship, of twelve guns,"
"and hunger drove them to attack even so big a ship as this, but the sight"
of the Black flag so terrified the French crew that they surrendered
"without firing a shot. After this, they took several vessels, and matters"
began to look much brighter. Phillips quickly developed into a most
"accomplished and bloody pirate, butchering his prisoners on very little or"
on no provocation whatever. But even this desperate pirate had an
"occasional ""qualm of conscience come athwart his stomach,"" for when he"
"captured a Newfoundland vessel and was about to scuttle her, he found out"
"that she was the property of a Mr. Minors of that island, from whom they"
"stole the original vessel in which they went a-pirating, so Phillips,"
"telling his companions ""We have done him enough injury already,"" ordered"
"the vessel to be repaired and returned to the owner. On another occasion,"
"they took a ship, the master of which was a ""Saint"" of New England, by"
"name Dependance Ellery, who gave them a pretty chase before being"
"overhauled, and so, as a punishment, the ""Saint"" was compelled to dance"
the deck until he fell down exhausted.
"This pirate's career ended with a mutiny of his unruly crew, Phillips"
being tripped up and then thrown overboard to drown off Newfoundland in
"April, 1724."
"During the nine months of Phillips's command as a pirate captain, he"
accounted for more than thirty ships.

"defined attributes--like the ""Putois"" of Anatole France. Dawson and"
"""Bailey""; they are both ""nice men"" and little Jane's friends; she is"
"sure of them, and I expect that she is right. Children always are"
right.
"Dawson, after his outburst, glowered at me for a moment and then"
"laughed. ""I am a man,"" said he, ""though you may not think it, and I"
have my weaknesses. But I never give way to them when they interfere
"with business. Menteith is in my grip, and he won't get out of it. But"
he is a poor creature. He handed over the description of the
"_Rampagious_, saw it hidden in the sardine tin, and was ordered to"
take the food parcel to the Post Office. The German agent who used him
had no notion of risking his own skin. Then followed the discovery and
the arrest of the draughtsman who had drawn the plan. Those who had
seduced Menteith forbade him to come near them. They slipped away into
hiding--which profited them little since all of them were on our
string--after threatening Menteith that he would be murdered if he
"gave himself up to the police, as in his terror he seemed to want to"
"do. When nothing happened for two weeks, the vermin came out of their"
"holes, made up the last parcel, and forced Menteith to go to Carlisle"
"in order to post it. All through he has been the most abject of tools,"
and received nothing except the four pounds and various small sums
"spent in drinks."""
"""You have the principal all right?"""
"""Yes, I have him tight. The others associated with him I shall leave"
free; they will be most useful in future. They don't know that we know

"then of no further use to us. It is a beautiful system, Mr. Copplestone,"
"and you have had the unusual privilege of seeing it at work."""
(153) The patient was wounded at Paardeberg at a range of from
"500 to 700 yards. _Entry_, just to the left of the episternal"
"notch; _exit_, in the fifth left interspace posteriorly, midway"
between the spine and vertebral margin of the scapula. A
"quantity of bright blood was brought up at once, and later"
blood was coughed up in clots.
There was no great pain at the moment of the injury; the man
"again got up to the firing line, and later walked two miles to"
"the Field hospital without aid. He remained here a week, when"
"he was sent down to the Base, and during the first three days'"
journey in the wagon he began to get worse. On the fourth day
cough began to be very troublesome.
"When he arrived at the Base, fifteen days after the original"
"injury, there was much dyspnoea; the temperature was 102°,"
and the pulse 110. The left side of the chest was dull
"throughout; an aspirating needle was introduced, and a pint of"
very dark liquid blood drawn off. The whole of the blood was
not removed on account of the very severe cough and pain which
the evacuation occasioned. The man appeared to steadily improve
"until three weeks later, when the temperature, which throughout"
"had been uneven, became consistently high, and signs of fluid"
"at the base increased. An aspirating needle was introduced, and"
16 ounces of pus were drawn off. Two days later a piece of rib
was resected (Mr. Pegg) and another pint of pus evacuated.
"After this, rapid improvement took place, and in ten days the"
"man was able to be up and dressed, although a small amount of"
discharge still persisted. He eventually made an excellent
recovery.
"Secondary empyemata not uncommonly followed incision of the chest, or"
"Superior sell her help. Keep the money, lads. If I am not a fool you"
will need it more than the sisterhood of the Holy Innocents before you

"And with that she blew them each a dainty kiss, distinguishing no one"
"above the other, dropped a curtsey to the general, whose eyes followed"
"her with more than usual interest, leaped on her white mare and rode"
"off, attended by La Giralda riding astride like a man, in the same"
fashion in which she had arrived.
"So little Concha was gone from his sight, and duty loomed up suddenly"
gaunt and void of interest before Rollo. To risk his life was nothing.
"When he got nearer to the goal, his blood would rise, that he knew. To"
"capture a queen and a regent at one coup, to upset a government, to"
bring a desolating war to an end--these were all in the day's work. But
"why, in the name of all that was sanest and most practical, did his"
heart feel like lead within him and his new dignity turn to Dead Sea
ashes in his mouth?
"It was not long before Cabrera dropped back, that he might talk over"
ways and means with the young colonel. It was clear that the _guerrilla_
chieftain did not believe greatly in the project.
"""I do not understand all this,"" he said; ""it is not my way. What have we"
"to do with taking women and children prisoners? Let us have no truck,"
"barter, or exchange with the government at Madrid except at the point of"
"the bayonet. That is my way of it, and if my advice had been taken"
"before, my master would at this moment have been in the royal palace of"
his ancestors. But these secret embassies in the hands of
"foreigners--what good can come of them?"""
Rollo explained such things as the Abbot of Montblanch had made clear to
"eternal _à propos_. What he writes is never vague, never dark--it is"
always plausible. Everything seemingly flows of itself like a fountain.
"It always rings true as to tone, turn of phrase and accent. It has"
"almost the light harmony of Ariosto. And it is, like Ariosto, never"
"tragic, never truly heroic. It carries us away, indeed, but it is never"
itself truly enraptured.
The more artistic aspects of Erasmus's talent come out most
clearly--though they are everywhere in evidence--in those two
"recreations after more serious labour, the _Moriae Encomium_ and the"
_Colloquia_. But just those two have been of enormous importance for his
influence upon his times. For while Jerome reached tens of readers and
"the New Testament hundreds, the _Moria_ and _Colloquies_ went out to"
thousands. And their importance is heightened in that Erasmus has
nowhere else expressed himself so spontaneously.
"In each of the Colloquies, even in the first purely formulary ones,"
"there is the sketch for a comedy, a novelette or a satire. There is"
"hardly a sentence without its 'point', an expression without a vivid"
fancy. There are unrivalled niceties. The abbot of the _Abbatis et
eruditae colloquium_ is a Molière character. It should be noticed how
"well Erasmus always sustains his characters and his scenes, because he"
_sees_ them. In 'The woman in childbed' he never forgets for a moment
"that Eutrapelus is an artist. At the end of 'The game of knucklebones',"
"when the interlocutors, after having elucidated the whole nomenclature"
"of the Latin game of knuckle-bones, are going to play themselves,"
"Carolus says: 'but shut the door first, lest the cook should see us"
playing like two boys'.
"As Holbein illustrated the _Moria_, we should wish to possess the"
"_Colloquia_ with illustrations by Brueghel, so closely allied is"
Erasmus's witty clear vision of incidents to that of this great master.

"gate, and accompany them to the palace."
"""I knew it,"" quavered the old woman, ""I knew it since ever my husband"
went away with the soldiers and left me here alone. I shall be murdered
"among you, but my blood will be on his hands. Indeed, sirs, he hath"
"never treated me well, but spent his wages at the wine tavern, giving me"
"but a beggarly pittance. Nay, how do I know but he had an intent in thus"
"deserting me? He hath, and I can prove it, cast eyes of desire on Maria"
"of the pork-shop, only because she is younger and more comely than I,"
who had grown old and wrinkled bearing him children and cooking him
"_ollas_! Aye, and small thanks have I got for either. As indeed I have"
told him hundreds of times. Such a man! A pretty fellow to be head
porter at a Queen's gate! I declare I will inform her Royal Majesty this
"very night, if I am to go to the palace, that will I!"""
"""Come down immediately and let us in, my good woman,"" said the Sergeant,"
soothingly. For it appeared as if this torrent of accusation against the
absent might continue to flow for an indefinite period.
"""But how am I to know that you are not the very rogues and thieves of"
"whom you tell?"" persisted the old lady with some show of reason."
"""Well,"" said the Sergeant forbearingly, ""as to that you must trust us,"
"mother. It is the best you can do. But fear nothing, we will treat you"
"gently as a cat her kitten, and you will come up to the palace with us"
"to show us in what part of it dwell the Queen and her daughter."""
"""Nay, not if it be to do harm to my lady and the sweet little maid who"
"this very day brought a pail of milk to poor old Rebeca the portress,"
whose husband hath forsaken her for a pork-shop trull. I would rather
"die!"""
"""I fancy,--I think,--we have met,--before! May I, . . dare I, . . ask"
"your name?"""
"Slowly she unclasped her gently folded hands; slowly, very slowly, she"
"lifted her bent head, and smiled at him! Oh, the lovely light upon her"
"face! Oh, the angel glory of those strange, sweet eyes!"
"""My name is EDRIS!""--she said, and as the pure bell-like tone of her"
"voice smote the air with its silvery sound, the mysterious music of the"
"organ and the invisible singers throbbed away,--away,--away,--into"
"softer and softer echoes, that died at last tremulously and with a"
"sigh, as of farewell, into the deepest silence."
"""EDRIS!""--In a trance of passionate awe and rapture he caught her"
"hand,--the warm, delicate hand that yielded to his strong clasp in"
"submissive tenderness,--pulsations of terror, pain, and wild joy, all"
"commingled, rushed through him,--with adoring, wistful gaze he scanned"
"every feature of that love-smiling countenance,--a countenance no"
"longer lustrous with Heaven's blinding glory, but only most maiden-like"
"and innocently fair,--dazzled, perplexed, and half afraid, he could not"
at once grasp the true comprehension of his ineffable delight! He had
no doubt of her identity--he knew her well! she was his own
"heartworshipped Angel,--but on what errand had she wandered out of"
"paradise? Had she come once more, as on the Field of Ardath, to comfort"
"him for a brief space with the beauty of her visible existence, or did"
she bring from Heaven the warrant for his death?
"""Edris!"" he said, as softly as one may murmur a prayer, ""Edris, my"
"life, my love! Speak to me again! make me sure that I am not dreaming!"
Tell me where I have failed in my sworn faith since we parted; teach me
how I must still further atone! Is this the hour appointed for my

the lieutenant had appeared in his room with a revolver and had
threatened to shoot him unless he produced a suit of civilian
clothes. Thus coerced he had given him his eldest son's Sunday
clothes left behind when the said son went off to join the Belgian
"army. The lieutenant, grateful for the assistance, had given him as"
a present his watch and chain.
On the other hand the German non-commissioned officers insisted
their lieutenant had been made away with in the night. The farmer's
allegation that he had deserted (as in fact he had) only enhanced
his crime. The finding of the court after a very summary trial was
"""guilty,"" and despite the frantic appeals of the wife, reinforced"
"later on by Mrs. Warren, the farmer had been taken out and shot."
The evening meal consequently was one of strained relations. Colonel
von Giesselin came to supper punctually and was very spruce in
appearance. But he was gravely polite and uncommunicative. And after
dessert the two ladies asked permission to retire. They lay long
"awake afterwards, debating in whispers what terror might be in store"
for them. Mrs. Warren cried a good deal and lamented futilely her
"indolent languor of a few days previously. _Why_ had she not, while"
"there was yet time, cleared out of Brussels, gone to Holland, and"
"thence regained England with Vivie, and from England the south of"
"France? Vivie, more stoical, pointed out it was no use crying over"
"lost opportunities. Here they were, and they must sharpen their wits"
to get away at the first opportunity. Perhaps the American Consul
might help them?
"The next morning, however, their guest, who had insensibly turned"
"host, told Vivie the tram service to Brussels, like the train"
"service, was suspended indefinitely, and that he feared they must"
resign themselves to staying where they were. Under his protection
"pocket. He knew that Captain Dove was merely trying to aggravate him,"
and it would not have been politic to stray from the matter in hand. He
lighted a cigarette at his leisure and waited for what should come next.
He had changed his mind as to taking the old man fully into his
confidence. He thought he could see his way to get all he wanted for a
very great deal less than that might have cost him.
"""Want a drink?"" Captain Dove demanded, no doubt with the idea that a"
"dose of spirit might serve to stir up his visitor's temper, and looked"
"surprised at Slyne's curt head-shake, still more surprised over his"
response.
"""I can't afford to drink at all hours of the day and night now,"" said"
"Slyne austerely. ""That sort of thing was all very well at sea, but--The"
business I have in hand isn't of the sort that can be carried out on raw
"brandy. And you'll have to taper off too, if you want to come in."""
"""Strike--me--sky-blue!"" exclaimed the old man, and Slyne held up a"
reproving hand.
"""I can do with a good deal less of your bad language into the bargain,"""
"he mentioned coldly, ""if you don't mind. In short, I want you to"
understand from the start that you've got to behave as if you were a
"reasonable human being and not a dangerous lunatic, or--I'll leave you"
"to rot, in the hole you've got yourself into."""
"Captain Dove, scarcely able to credit the evidence of his own ears but,"
"none the less, apparently, thinking hard, darted a very ugly glance at"
"him, and noticed the diamonds in his shirt-front. Under the strongest"
temptation to call in a couple of deck-hands and have him thrown off the
"ship, Captain Dove obviously paused to consider whether those could be"
"of any intrinsic value. He was, of course, satisfied that he knew"
"all thought, and think still, that I was a messenger from the"
"_Malplaquet_, which, by the way, is well down the river safe and"
"sound. Just wait a minute."" He walked into a corner of the room, moved"
"his hands quickly between his side pockets and his face, and then"
"returned. Except for the dark hair and moustache and the brown skin,"
"he had become the Dawson of the Thursday afternoon. ""It is as simple"
"for me to change,"" said the artist, with a nasty look in my direction,"
"""as it seems to be for Mr. Copplestone here to spot me. It will take a"
day or two to get the dye out of my hair and the tan off my skin. I am
"going to have a sharp touch of influenza, which is a useful disease"
"when one wants to lie in. Since Sunday I have only been twice to bed."""
We filled him up with coffee and flattery--as one fills a motor car
with petrol and oil--but asked him no questions until we were safely
in Cary's study and Mrs. Cary had gone about her household duties.
"""Your good lady,"" remarked Dawson to Cary, ""is as little curious as"
"any woman I have met, and we will leave her at that if you don't mind."
The best thing about our women is that they don't care tuppence about
"naval and military details. If they did, and once started prying with"
"that keen scent and indomitable persistence of theirs, we might as"
well chuck up. Even my own bright team of charmers never know and
never ask the meaning of the information that they ferret out for me.
"Their curiosity is all personal--about men and women, never about"
"things. Women--"""
I cut Dawson short. He tended to become tedious.
"""Quite so,"" I observed politely. ""And to revert to one big female"
"creature, let us hear something of the _Malplaquet_."""
"""You at any rate are curious enough for a dozen. It would serve you"
right to keep you hopping a bit longer. But I have a kindly eye for
"We said Good-night to our three railway friends, and went up to bed. We"
"had only been in the room a minute or two, when the brown woman tapped:"
"and if you please, the black-cap had sent us one of his little white"
loaves. We were really touched. Such delicate little generosities have
almost disappeared from the world.
"It was a queer little bread--three-cornered, and almost as hard as ships"
"biscuit, made of starch flour. Not strictly bread at all."

"The night was cold, the blankets flat and heavy, but one slept quite"
"well till dawn. At seven o'clock it was a clear, cold morning, the sun"
"not yet up. Standing at the bedroom window looking out, I could hardly"
"believe my eyes it was so like England, like Cornwall in the bleak"
"parts, or Derbyshire uplands. There was a little paddock-garden at the"
"back of the Station, rather tumble-down, with two sheep in it. There"
"were several forlorn-looking out-buildings, very like Cornwall. And then"
"the wide, forlorn country road stretched away between borders of grass"
"and low, drystone walls, towards a grey stone farm with a tuft of trees,"
"and a naked stone village in the distance. The sun came up yellow, the"
"bleak country glimmered bluish and reluctant. The low, green hill-slopes"
"were divided into fields, with low drystone walls and ditches. Here and"
"there a stone barn rose alone, or with a few bare, windy trees attached."
"Two rough-coated winter horses pastured on the rough grass, a boy came"
"along the naked, wide, grass-bordered high-road with a couple of milk"
"cans, drifting in from nowhere: and it was all so like Cornwall, or a"
"part of Ireland, that the old nostalgia for the Celtic regions began to"
"spring up in me. Ah, those old, drystone walls dividing the fields--pale"
"and granite-blenched! Ah, the dark, sombre grass, the naked sky! the"
"forlorn horses in the wintry morning! Strange is a Celtic landscape, far"
"more moving, disturbing than the lovely glamor of Italy and Greece."
saluted and stood at attention. There was a moment's silence in the
"room, but before Rollo had time to speak the Queen-Regent recovered her"
self-possession. The daughter of the Bourbons stood erect. Her long hair
streamed in dark glossy waves over her shoulders. Her bosom heaved
visibly under the thin pink wrapper. Anger struggled with fear in her
eyes. Verily Maria Cristina of Naples had plenty of courage.
"""Who are you,"" she cried, ""that dare thus to break in upon the privacy"
"of the Regent Queen of Spain? Duke, call the guard!"""
But her husband only shrugged his shoulders and continued to gaze upon
the pair of intruders with a calm exterior.
"""Your Majesty,"" said Rollo, courteously, naturally resuming the"
leadership when anything requiring contact with gentlefolk came in the
"way, ""I am here to inform you that you are in great danger--greater than"
"I can for the moment make clear to you. The palace is, as I understand,"
absolutely without defence--the town is in the same position. It is
within our knowledge that a band of two hundred gipsies are on the march
"to attack you this night in order to plunder the château, and put to"
"death every soul within its walls. We have come, therefore, together"
"with our companions outside, to offer our best services in your"
"Majesty's defence!"""
"""But,"" cried the Queen-Regent, ""all this may very well be, but you have"
"not yet told me who you are and what you are doing here!"""
"""For myself,"" answered Rollo, ""I am a Scottish gentleman, trained from"
my youth to the profession of arms. Those who wait without are for the
"present comrades and companions, whom, with your Majesty's permission, I"
"shall bid to enter. For to be plain, every moment is of the utmost"
"importance, that we may lose no time in putting the château into such a"
"was a reinforcement of foot from Fulda, rank upon rank of shambling"
"men trailing long pikes, and footsore, and parched as they were,"
getting over the ground in a wonderful fashion. After them would come
"a long string of waggons, bearing corn, and hay, and malt, and wines;"
"all lurching slowly forward, slowly southward; often delayed, for"
"every quarter of a mile a horse fell or an axle broke, yet getting"
forward.
"And then the most wonderful sight of all, a regiment of Swedish horse"
"passed us, marching from Erfurt. All their horses were grey, and all"
"their head-pieces, backs and breasts of black metal, matched one"
another. As they came on through the dust with a tramp which shook the
"ground, they sang, company by company, to the music of drums and"
"trumpets, a hymn, 'Versage nicht, du Häuflein klein!' Behind them a"
"line of light waggons carried their wives and children, also singing."
"And so they went by us, eight hundred swords, and I thought it a"
marvel I should never see beaten.
"When they were gone out of sight, there were still droves of horses"
"and mighty flocks of sheep to come, and cargoes of pork, and more foot"
and horse and guns. Some companies wore buff coats and small steel
"caps, and carried arquebuses; and some marched smothered in huge"
headpieces with backs and breasts to match. And besides all the
things I have mentioned and the crowds of sutlers and horse-boys that
"went with them, there were munition waggons closely guarded, and"
"pack-horses laden with powder, and always and always waggons of corn"
and hay.
"And all hurrying, jostling, crawling southwards. It seemed to me that"
the world was marching southwards; that if we went on we must fall in
at the end of this with every one we knew. And the thought comforted
me.
dedication of Suetonius two years before; but his real purpose is to say
"something about Luther. Luther's writings, he says, have given the"
Louvain obscurants plenty of reason to inveigh against the _bonae
"literae_, to decry all scholars. He himself does not know Luther and has"
"glanced through his writings only cursorily as yet, but everyone praises"
his life. How little in accordance with theological gentleness it is to
"condemn him offhand, and that before the indiscreet vulgar! For has he"
"not proposed a dispute, and submitted himself to everybody's judgement?"
"No one has, so far, admonished, taught, convinced him. Every error is"
not at once heresy.
"The best of Christianity is a life worthy of Christ. Where we find that,"
we should not rashly suspect people of heresy. Why do we so uncharitably
"persecute the lapses of others, though none of us is free from error?"
"Why do we rather want to conquer than cure, suppress than instruct?"
"But he concludes with a word that could not but please Luther's friends,"
who so hoped for his support. 'May the duke prevent an innocent man from
being surrendered under the cloak of piety to the impiety of a few. This
"is also the wish of Pope Leo, who has nothing more at heart than that"
innocence be safe.'
At this same time Erasmus does his best to keep Froben back from
"publishing Luther's writings, 'that they may not fan the hatred of the"
_bonae literae_ still more'. And he keeps repeating: I do not know
"Luther, I have not read his writings. He makes this declaration to"
"Luther himself, in his reply to the latter's epistle of 28 March. This"
"letter of Erasmus, dated 30 May 1519, should be regarded as a newspaper"
"leader[17], to acquaint the public with his attitude towards the Luther"
question. Luther does not know the tragedies which his writings have
caused at Louvain. People here think that Erasmus has helped him in
composing them and call him the standard bearer of the party! That
"I had no authority to compel him to go on, so gave up the struggle."
But I realised more than ever how imperative it was to endeavour
"to reach Robat without a moment's unnecessary delay, and start"
"conclusions with the Raiders, whose menace was growing more dangerous"
every day.
"We were, therefore, on the road very early next morning, for I hoped"
"to make Saindak that night. I had intended to go by Borgar, but now"
"that I knew--for I had verified the contractor's statements, and"
believed them to be correct--that that place was in the hands of
"the Raiders, I elected to go by an alternative route, known as the"
"_Webb-Ware_ route, which is practically out of use nowadays, hoping,"
"thereby, to avoid the enemy."
It was still dark when we set off on the most strenuous part of our
"journey; climbing, making détours, digging the car out again and"
again till we were all three worn out in body and temper. We hardly
"halted that day, for the necessity for speed was as fully realised by"
Allan as by myself.
"When night fell we had not yet sighted Saindak, but I knew we could"
"not be very far off, and cursed the coming of the night which made"
it impossible to see where we were. I knew we had got off the camel
"track somehow, for the ground was even more bumpy than it had been,"
"and was frequently intersected by nullahs or rocky ravines, which"
made the going positively dangerous. If the car were knocked right
out of action our difficulties would reach the last stage of disaster.
"At last, in despair, Allan stopped, saying it was useless going on"
any further. We might overturn the car at any moment and smash it as
well as ourselves. He submitted that the only sane thing would be to
accompanied by the duchess and a gentleman in waiting. The visit was made
incognito.
"As a result of this royal visit, which was made for the purpose of seeing"
"Frances, a part of Sir Richard's estates near St. Albans were restored to"
"him, and from poverty he rose at once to a comfortable income of, say, a"
thousand or twelve hundred pounds a year.
"Immediately all of Sir Richard's hatred of Charles II fell away, and once"
more the king shone in the resplendent light of his divine appointment.
"While Frances estimated the king's generosity at its true value, she was"
"glad her father had received even a small part of what was his just due,"
"and although she knew the restoration had been made to please, and, if"
"possible, to win her, she was glad to have spoiled the royal Philistine,"
"and despised him more than ever before, if that were possible."
"Sir Richard's good fortune brought a gleam of joy to Frances, but it also"
"brought a pang of regret, because it had come too late. Her only purpose"
in going to Whitehall had been to marry a rich nobleman and thereby raise
"the fallen fortunes of her house. Now that reason existed no longer, and"
"if George were here, she could throw herself away upon him with injury to"
"no one but herself. But George was not here, and liberty to throw herself"
away had come too late to be of any value.
"Every day during the fortnight that Frances remained at home, she asked"
"if I had any news from court, meaning the French court, but using the"
form of inquiry to avoid acquainting her father and Sarah with the real
cause of her solicitude.
"But my answers were always, ""Oh, nothing but Castlemain's new tantrum,"""
"or ""The duke's defeat at pall-mall."""
"human weakness, though you might not think it. I joined the ship on"
"Thursday afternoon, slipping in as one of a detachment of fifty"
R.M.L.I. who had been wired for from Chatham. They were an emergency
lot; we hadn't enough in the ship for the double sentry go that I
"wanted. All my plans were made with the Commander and Major Boyle, and"
they both did exactly what I told them. It isn't often that a private
of Marines has the ordering about of two officers. But Dawson is
"Dawson; no common man. They did as I told them, and were glad to do"
it. I had extra light bulbs put on all over the lower decks and every
dark corner lit up--except one. Just one. And this one was where the
four gun-cables ran out of the switch-room and lay alongside one
another before they branched off to the fore and after turrets and to
the port and starboard side batteries. That was the most likely spot
"which any one wanting to cut the gun-wires would mark down, and I"
meant to watch it pretty closely myself. We had double sentries at the
"magazines. The _Malplaquet_ is an oil-fired ship, so we hadn't any"
bothering coal bunkers to attract fancy bombs. I was pretty sure that
after the _Antinous_ and the _Antigone_ we had mostly wire-cutting to
"fear. When a man has done one job successfully, and repeated it almost"
"successfully, he is pretty certain to have a third shot. Besides, if"
"one is out to delay a ship, cutting wires is as good a way as any. I"
"had an idea that my man was not a bomber."""
"""I thought that you scorned theories,"" I put in dryly. ""When they are"
"wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are no help."""
"Dawson frowned. ""Shut up, Copplestone,"" snapped Cary."
"""We were in no danger from the lighting, heating, and telephone wires,"
for any defect would have been visible at once. It was the gun and
gunnery control cables that were the weak spots. So I had L.T.O.'s
"posted in the spotting top, the conning tower, the transmission room,"
"she had recharged her piece, and hearing that she wanted nothing and was"
"ready for all emergencies, he departed upon his rounds without the least"
leave-taking or approach to love-making. In her heart Concha respected
"him for this, but at the same time she could not help feeling that a"
Spaniard would have been somewhat warmer in his acknowledgments.
Nevertheless she comforted herself with the thought that he had trusted
"her with one of the most important posts in the whole defence, and she"
prayed fervently to the Virgin that she might be able to do her duty
there.
"She thought also that, when the morning came, perhaps he would have more"
"time. For her, she could wait--here she smiled a little. Yes, she"
"acknowledged it. She who had caught so many, was now taken in her own"
net. She would go to the world's end for this young Scot. Nor in her
heart of hearts was she ashamed of it. Above and beyond all courtesies
"and sugared phrases she loved his free-handed, careless, curt-spoken,"
"hectoring way. After his one kiss, he had treated her exactly like any"
"other of his company. He did not make love well, but--she liked him none"
the worse for that. In such matters (sayeth the Wise Man) excellence is
apt to come with experience.
"And he would learn. Yes, decidedly he might yet do credit to his"
"teacher. To-morrow morning would arrive, and for the present, well--she"
would keep her finger upon the trigger and a pair of remarkably
clear-sighted eyes upon the grey space of greensward crossed by black
trellises of railing immediately before her. That in the mean time was
"her duty to her love and (she acknowledged it), her master."
"Apart from these details of his feeling for Concha, however (which gave"
"him little concern), Rollo was far from satisfied with the condition of"
affairs. He would rather (so he confided to the Sergeant) have defended
"a sheepfold or a simple cottage than this many-chambered, many-passaged,"
seemed as if the knots would barely hold. But the work had been well
"done, and in less than half a minute Steve had secured the sack to the"
"chair-back. It was as good as a gag, and safer. Then we took up the"
"chair between us, and lifting it into the back room, put it down and"
locked the door upon our captive.
"As we turned from it Steve looked at me. 'If he catches us after this,"
"Master Martin,' he said, 'it won't be an easy death we shall die!'"
'Heaven forbid!' I muttered. 'Let us be off!'
He gave the word and we stole out into the darkness at the back of the
"house, Steve, who had surveyed the ground, going first. My lady"
followed him; then came the Waldgrave; after him the two women and
"Fraulein Max, with Jacob and Ernst; last of all, Marie and I. It was"
"no time for love-making, but as we all stood a minute in the night,"
"while Steve listened, I drew Marie's little figure to me and kissed"
"her pale face again and again; and she clung to me, trembling, her"
eyes shining into mine. Then she put me away bravely; but I took her
"bundle, and with full hearts we followed the others across the field"
at the back and through the ditch.
"That passed, we found ourselves on the edge of the village, with the"
lights of the camp forming five-sixths of a circle round us. In one
"direction only, where the swamp and creek fringed the place, a dark"
gap broke the ring of twinkling fires. Towards this gap Steve led the
"way, and we, a silent line of gliding figures, followed him. The moon"
had not yet risen. The gloom was such that I could barely make out the
third figure before me; and though all manner of noises--the chorus of
"a song, the voice of a scolding hag, even the rattle of dice on a"
"drumhead--came clearly to my ears, and we seemed to be enclosed on all"
"sides, the darkness proved an effectual shield. We met no one, and"
grandchildren--was chuntering her head off because it was _her_
seat--why she had left it she didn't say. And under my legs was her
"bundle of bread. She nearly went off her head. And over my head, on the"
"little rack, was her bercola, her saddle-bag. Fat soldiers laughed at"
"her good-naturedly, but she fluttered and flipped like a tart,"
featherless old hen. Since she had another seat and was quite
"comfortable, we smiled and let her chunter. So she clawed her bread"
"bundle from under my legs, and, clutching it and a fat child, sat tense."
*       *       *       *       *
It was getting quite dark. The conductor came and said that there was no
"more paraffin. If what there was in the lamps gave out, we should have"
to sit in the dark. There was no more paraffin all along the line.--So
"he climbed on the seats, and after a long struggle, with various boys"
"striking matches for him, he managed to obtain a light as big as a pea."
"We sat in this _clair-obscur_, and looked at the sombre-shadowed faces"
"round us: the fat soldier with a gun, the handsome soldier with huge"
"saddle-bags, the weird, dark little man who kept exchanging a baby with"
"a solid woman who had a white cloth tied round her head, a tall"
"peasant-woman in costume, who darted out at a dark station and returned"
"triumphant with a piece of chocolate: a young and interested young man,"
who told us every station. And the man who spat: there is always one.
"Gradually the crowd thinned. At a station we saw our fat friend go by,"
"bitterly, like a betrayed soul, his bulging saddle-bag hanging before"
"and after, but no comfort in it now--no comfort. The pea of light from"
"the paraffin lamp grew smaller. We sat in incredible dimness, and the"
"smell of sheeps-wool and peasant, with only our fat and stoic young man"
to tell us where we were. The other dusky faces began to sink into a
"dead, gloomy silence. Some took to sleep. And the little train ran on"
"and on, through unknown Sardinian darkness. In despair we drained the"
"had not seen the half. The city, all roofs and spires and bridges,"
"girt with a wall of seventy towers, roared beneath us; and that I had"
expected. But outside the wall I now saw a second city of huts and
"tents, with a great earthwork about it, and bastions and demilunes and"
picquets posted.
This was the Swedish Lager. It lay principally to the south of the
"city proper, though on all sides it encircled it more or less. They"
told me that there lay in it about forty thousand soldiers and twenty
"thousand horses, and twenty thousand camp followers; but the number"
"was constantly increasing, death and disease notwithstanding, so that"
it presently stood as high as sixty thousand fighting men and half as
"many followers, to say nothing of the garrison that lay in the city,"
"or the troops posted to guard the approaches. It seemed to me, gazing"
"over that mighty multitude from the top of the hill, that nothing"
could resist such a force; and I looked abroad with curiosity for the
enemy.
I expected to view his army cheek by jowl with us; and I was
"disappointed when I saw beyond our camp to southward, where I was told"
"he lay, only a clear plain with the little river Rednitz flowing"
"through it. This plain was a league and more in width, and it was"
"empty of men. Beyond it rose a black wooded ridge, very steep and"
hairy.
My lady explained that Wallenstein's army lay along this
"ridge--seventy thousand men, and forty thousand horses, and"
"Wallenstein himself. His camp we heard was eight miles round, the"
"front guarded by a line of cannon, and taking in whole villages and"
castles. And now I looked again I saw the smoke hang among the trees.
They whispered in Nuremberg that no man in that army took pay; that
all served for booty; and that the troopers that sacked Magdeburg and
"sold or ordered, are blessed and enriched with the indulgences of the"
Rosary Confraternity and the papal blessing. When blessed they may be
"distributed; _but if resold they lose all the indulgences_."" (Italics"
ours.)
Still another relic of great interest in this convent of St. Sabina
"is the crucifix of Michele Ghislieri (afterwards Pope Pius V.). ""One"
"day, as Ghislieri was about to kiss his crucifix, in the eagerness"
"of prayer, the image of Christ, says the legend, retired of its own"
"accord from his touch, for it had been poisoned by an enemy, and a kiss"
"would have been death."""
"[Sidenote: Sundry Miracles by Other Saints, and Images.]"
"In the Church of St. Gregory, on the C[oe]lian Hill, the thing that"
"interested us most was the picture by Badalocchi, ""commemorating a"
"miracle on this spot, when, at the moment of elevation, the Host"
"is said to have bled in the hands of St. Gregory, to convince an"
"unbeliever of the truth of transubstantiation."" This is the same"
Gregory who presented certain foreign ambassadors with a handful of
"earth from the arena of the Coliseum as a relic for their sovereigns,"
"so many martyrs having suffered death there, and ""upon their receiving"
"the gift with disrespect, he pressed it, when blood flowed from the"
"soil."""
Not far from the Church of St. Gregory we were shown the hermitage
"where St. Giovanni de Matha lived. ""Before he came to reside here he"
had been miraculously brought from Tunis (whither he had gone on a
"mission) to Ostia, in a boat without helm or sail, in which he knelt"
"without ceasing before the crucifix throughout the whole of his voyage!"""
Time would fail me to tell of the miraculous surgical operation
"I do not think it difficult to see how the sick man's face will lighten,"
how his eyes will brighten at the thoughts that come to him at the old
man's words. And he goes on:
'Remember when the squall came up the river and the boat upset when you
were crossing here; how it seemed as if no man could live alone in such
"waves, and yet how you clung to and saved the boy who was with you,"
swimming through the water that splashed over your head and very nearly
"drowned you. The boy's father and mother have never forgotten that, and"
they are even now mourning without in the veranda. It is all due to you
that their lives have not been full of misery and despair. Remember
their faces when you brought their little son to them saved from death
in the great river. Surely that is a pleasant thing. Remember your wife
"who is now with you; how you have loved her and cherished her, and kept"
faithful to her before all the world. You have been a good husband to
"her, and you have honoured her. She loves you, and you have loved her"
all your long life together. Surely that is a pleasant thing.'
"Yes, surely these are pleasant things to have with one at the last."
Surely a man will die easier with such memories as these before his
"eyes, with love in those about him, and the calm of good deeds in his"
dying heart. If it be a different way of soothing a man's end from those
"which other nations use, is it the worse for that?"
Think of your good deeds. It seems a new idea to me that in doing well
"in our life we are making for ourselves a pleasant death, because of the"
memory of those things. And if we have none? or if evil so outnumbered
"the good deeds as to hide and overwhelm them, what then? A man's death"
will be terrible indeed if he cannot in all his days remember one good
deed that he has done.
"'All a man's life comes before him at the hour of death,' said my"
"All disclaimed any precise information, and Lord Sandford spoke no word;"
"his brow was slightly furrowed, and there was a subdued gleam in his eye"
which warned those who saw it that something in the conversation was not
"to his mind.  They therefore hastened to change it, and many of them"
said adieu and sauntered away.  Only a small knot remained with their
"patron, discussing the plans for the day; and Grey stood still in the"
"embrasure of the window, his heart still beating with curious violence"
"and rapidity.  When those men were speaking of Geraldine, he had scarce"
been able to keep his fingers from their throats.  What business had
they taking her pure name upon their lips?  And why had they spoken of
her fortune?  Could it be true that she was so great an heiress?  He
hated to believe it; yet what was it to him?  He was wakened from his
"reverie by a quick question from Lord Sandford, which he heard as"
"through the mists of a dream, and answered,—"
"""’Tis true I am not quite myself.  I slept not at all last night, and"
have been on the river well-nigh since sunrise to rid me of the vapours.
Methinks I will seek some sleep in mine own rooms ere night. Reckon not
"on me for to-day’s pastime."""
"""Ay, you have the air of a man squeamish and in need of rest.  Go get"
"thee a good sleep, friend Grey, for we must keep you in fettle for the"
match on Saturday.  Man and beast must come to the field strong and
"robust, with nerve and wind and muscle true and taut.  But you must make"
one of our party to Vauxhall to-night.  There will be many bright eyes
"on the lookout for the gay cavalier, as the ladies call you for your"
"love-locks.  You must not fail us there."""
"For a moment Grey hesitated, prudence and passion fighting together for"
mastery.  But the overwhelming desire to see Geraldine again—perhaps to
"speak a word of farewell—overcame him, and he answered briefly as he"
"strolled through the room on his way out,—"
"ingenuity to keep them alive during the journey. Four plants, two"
"Mimosas and two Telegraph plants, were taken in a portable box with"
"glass cover, and never let out of sight. In the Mediterranean they"
encountered bitter cold for the first time and nearly succumbed. They
"were unhappier still in the Bay of Biscay, and when they reached London"
there was a sharp frost. They had to be kept in a drawing room lighted
"by gas, the deadly influence of which was discovered the next morning"
when all the plants were found to be apparently killed. Two had been
"killed, and the other two were brought round after much difficulty. The"
plants were at once transferred to the hot-house in Regents Park. For
"every demonstration in Dr. Bose's private Laboratory at Maida Vale, the"
plant had to be brought and returned in a taxicab with closed doors so
"that no sudden chill might kill them. When travelling, the large box in"
"which they were, could not be trusted out of sight in the luggage van."
They had practically to be carried in a reserved compartment. The
"unusual care taken of the box always roused the greatest curiosity, and"
in an incredibly short time large crowds would gather. When travelling
"long distances, for example from London to Vienna, the carriage"
accommodation had to be secured in advance. It was this that saved Dr.
"Bose from being interned in Germany, where he was to commence his"
lectures on the 4th August. He was to start for the University of Bonn
"on the 2nd, but on account of hasty mobilisation of troops in Germany he"
could not secure the reserved accommodation. Two days after came the
proclamation of War!
OUTCOME OF HIS WORK
The success of his scientific mission exceeded his most sanguine
expectations. The work in which he long persevered in isolation and
"under most depressing difficulties, bore fruit at last. Apart from the"
full recognition that the progress of the world's science would be
distinguished; it was all a question of genius. The Educational Service
"ought to be regarded not as a profession, but as a calling. Some men"
"were born to be teachers. It was not a question of race, of course; in"
"order to have an efficient educational system, there must be an"
"efficient organisation, but this should not be allowed to become"
"fossilised, and thus stand in the way of healthy growth."
"83,639. In the Presidency College a young man fresh from an English"
university was at once appointed a Professor regardless of his lack of
"experience, whereas an Indian who passed in highest examination with"
honours in India was appointed as an Assistant Professor. This grounding
often made him more efficient as a teacher than the Professor recruited
"from England. There were now several Professors in the college, in the"
"Provincial Service, who were highly qualified, and who lectured to the"
highest classes with very great success.
"83,640. In the Physics Department he had under his direction several"
Assistants who were so well qualified that they were allowed to give
"lectures to several classes. These Assistants, after their experience at"
"the Presidency College, would be best fitted to become Professors in the"
mofussil at Colleges. He would like to see them promoted to the higher
service after they had had experience. But before he gave them the
"highest positions, he would make it compulsory for them to go to Europe."
"83,641. A proportion of Europeans in the service was needed, but only as"
experts and not as ordinary teachers. Only the very best men should be
"obtained from Europe, and for exceptional cases. The general educational"
"work should be done entirely by Indians, who understood the difficulties"
of the country much better than any outsider.
"83,642. He advocated the direct recruitment of Indians in India by the"
"local government in consultation with the Secretary of State, rather"
"make nests and lay eggs and have little ones, and you went and shot"
them.' There are many sparrow-cotes to be seen in the villages.
"I might give example after example of this sort, for they happen every"
"day. We who are meat-eaters, who delight in shooting, who have a horror"
"of insects and reptiles, are continually coming into collision with the"
principles of our neighbours; for even harmful reptiles they do not care
"to kill. Truly I believe it is a myth, the story of the Burmese mother"
courteously escorting out of the house the scorpion which had just
bitten her baby. A Burmese mother worships her baby as much as the woman
"of any other nation does, and I believe there is no crime she would not"
commit in its behalf. But if she saw a scorpion walking about in the
"fields, she would not kill it as we should. She would step aside and"
"pass on. 'Poor beast!' she would say, 'why should I hurt it? It never"
hurt me.'
The Burman never kills insects out of sheer brutality. If a beetle drone
"annoyingly, he will catch it in a handkerchief and put it outside, and"
so with a bee. It is a great trouble often to get your Burmese servants
to keep your house free of ants and other annoying creatures. If you
"tell them to kill the insects they will, for in that case the sin falls"
on you. Without special orders they would rather leave the ants alone.
In the district in which I am now living snakes are very plentiful.
"There are cobras and keraits, but the most dreaded is the Russell's"
"viper. He is a snake that averages from three to four feet long, and is"
"very thick, with a big head and a stumpy tail. His body is marked very"
"prettily with spots and blurs of light on a dark, grayish green, and he"
"is so like the shadows of the grass and weeds in a dusty road, that you"
"can walk on him quite unsuspectingly. Then he will bite you, and you"
"die. He comes out usually in the evening before dark, and lies about on"
"footpaths to catch the home-coming ploughman or reaper, and, contrary to"
"no designs against Gatepath, yet she could not forbear to triumph over"
"him. ""One never knows,"" she said, ""when one may need a devoted friend,"
"and need him badly. I always look forward."""
Two or three weeks later Madame found a letter at her club signed
"""Gatepaths."" It was the club in Dover Street with those steep steps down"
which the members tumble helplessly in frosty weather. Madame calls it
"""The Club of Falling Women."""
"It appears that Gatepath, hunting for an adviser of ripe wisdom, had"
"sought out the Chief of Dawson and lately of Madame, and laid bare his"
pressing troubles. The Chief is one of those rare men to whom all his
"friends, and they are as the stars in number, go seeking counsel in"
"their crimes and follies. Nothing shocks him, nothing surprises him. And"
"from the depths of his wise, humorous, sympathetic mind, he will almost"
"always draw waters of comfort. Suppose, for example, one had slain a man"
and urgently sought to dispose of the corpse--a not uncommon problem in
crowded cities--to whom could one more profitably turn than to the
"Chief of His Majesty's Detective Service? Or if, in a passing fit of"
"absence of mind, one had wedded three wives, and the junior in rank"
began to suspect the existence of one or more seniors; do we not all
suffer from lapses of memory? One does not put these problems before the
"Chief as one's own--there is a decent convention in these matters--but,"
"of course, he knows. To know all is to pardon all, and there is very"
little that the Chief does not know about you or me.
The family solicitor of peers and princes poured into the Chief's ear
the fantastic cause of his present distresses. He delivered himself of
"the story in all seriousness, for it was dreadfully serious to him."
"Never in all his experience, and in that of his century-old firm, had"
anything so dreadfully serious occurred. The Chief controlled himself
"until the end was reached, and then exploded in a yell of laughter."
[Illustration: A PERFECT BUNCH OF BANANAS]
The towns of Bocas del Toro and Almirante are maintained almost entirely
by the banana trade. Other companies than the United Fruit raise and buy
"bananas here, but it was the initiative of the leading company which by"
systematic work put the prosperity of this section on a firm basis.
Lands that a few years ago were miasmatic swamps are now improved and
"planted with bananas. Over 4,000,000 bunches were exported from this"
"plantation in 1911, and 35,000 acres are under cultivation there. A"
narrow gauge railway carries bananas exclusively. The great white
steamships sail almost daily carrying away little except bananas. The
money spent over the counters of the stores in Bocas del Toro comes from
natives who have no way of getting money except by raising bananas and
"selling them, mostly to the United Fruit Company. It has its"
"competitors, but it invented the business and has brought it to its"
"highest development. At this Panama town, and for that matter in the"
"other territories it controls, the company has established and enforces"
the sanitary reforms which Col. Gorgas applied so effectively in Colon
and Panama. Its officials proudly claim that they were the pioneers in
inventing and applying the methods which have conquered tropical
diseases. At Bocas del Toro the company maintains a hospital which lacks
"nothing of the equipment of the Ancon Hospital, though of course not so"
large. It has successfully adopted the commissary system established on
the Canal Zone. Labor has always been the troublesome factor in
industrial enterprises in Central America. The Fruit Company has joined
with the Isthmian Commission in the systematic endeavor to keep labor
contented and therefore efficient.
[Illustration: THE ASTOR YACHT AT CRISTOBAL]
Probably it will be the policy which any corporation attempting to do
"pistol from his belt, looked carefully to the priming, and with the"
greatest coolness in the world pointed it at the misshapen brat.
"""Now listen,"" he said, ""you are old enough to know the meaning of words;"
I give you one minute to betake yourself to your own place and leave us
"alone! There is no contagion in a pistol bullet, my fine lad, but it is"
quite as deadly as any plague. So be off before a charge of powder
"catches you up!"""
"The sound of the angry voices had attracted La Giralda, who, looking up"
hastily from her task of building the fire beneath the gipsy tripod at
"which she and the Sergeant were cooking, advanced hastily with a long"
wand in her hand.
"The imp wheeled about as on a pivot, and positively appeared to shrink"
"into his clothing at the sight of her. He stood motionless, however,"
while La Giralda advanced threateningly towards him with the wand in her
hand as if for the purpose of castigation. As she approached he emitted
"a cry of purely animal terror, and hastily whipping his crutch under his"
"arm, betook himself, in a series of long hops, to a spot twenty yards"
higher up the bank. But La Giralda stopped him by a word or two spoken
"in an unknown tongue, harsh-sounding as Catalan, but curt and brief as a"
military order.
"The boy stood still and answered in the same speech, at first gruffly"
"and unwillingly, with downcast looks and his bare great toe scrabbling"
in the dust of the hillside.
"The dialogue lasted for some time, till at last with a scornful gesture"
"La Giralda released him, pointing to the upper edge of the _barranco_ as"
the place by which he was to disappear: the which he was now as eager to
"do, as he had formerly been insolently determined to remain."
"her back. ""What have you in your bag, granny?"" asked the merchant. ""O,"
"it is only a cat! I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her"
"into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman. ""The boy"
"told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said"
"the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her"
"cat for four shillings. The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain"
was closed.
"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke"
"loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and"
did not know where or whither. At last he came to a land where he had
"never yet been, and went up into the city."
"In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay"
"a switch, one for each guest. This seemed strange to the merchant, for"
he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches. Yet
"he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the"
"rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."" Yes, and when the food"
"came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place"
"was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table"
"had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and"
"nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than"
"the other. Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they"
"had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"""
"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant. ""How is it"
"the folk here have no cats?"" ""Cats?"" said the people: they did not know"
what they were. Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the
"scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to"
"hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been"
able to eat in such comfort. Then they begged and implored the merchant
to sell them his cat. At last he said he would let them have her; but he
"immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome—in"
"appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly"
"bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening."
Chandler’s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office
of an architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered
architecture to be truly an art; and he honestly believed—though he
would not have dared to admit it in New York—that the Flatiron Building
was inferior in design to the great cathedral in Milan.
Out of each week’s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each
"ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one"
gentleman’s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.
He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he
"took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and"
"there dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a"
"few hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a"
"well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label,"
"commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras."
This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to
Chandler a source of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one
début; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened;
"but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as"
new as the first had been. To sit among _bon vivants_ under palms in
"the swirl of concealed music, to look upon the _habitués_ of such a"
paradise and to be looked upon by them—what is a girl’s first dance and
short-sleeved tulle compared with this?
Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this
evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine
evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious _table
"It was vital to stop this lying but insidious propaganda, and the"
first step was to prevent German agents from entering India at all.
To do this the nomad tribes of the Sarhad must be brought back into
line with their old policy of friendship with Britain. Hence my
orders from General Kirkpatrick.
He instructed me to proceed without a moment's unnecessary delay to
"Quetta, where I was to receive more detailed instructions."
"On leaving him I hurried, with car and native chauffeur, to the"
"railway station, and asked for a truck on which to place the car"
for entrainment to Nushki. The station-master assured me I was
"asking for an impossibility. A great Maharajah, then travelling, had"
"commandeered every available truck for his suite, luggage and cars."
I told him that the Government business on which I had been sent was
"all important, and, by a little persuasion, soon had myself on the"
way to Pindi and the car on the way to Nushki.
Arrived at Pindi I found I had exactly one hour left in which to
"catch the train for Quetta. There was no time to pack, sort out kit,"
"or decide what should, or should not, be taken on a campaign which"
"might last only a few weeks or many months, and which might assume"
"a political aspect sooner than expected. My servant, Allah-dad, was"
therefore directed to take everything for sorting out when time could
"be spared, and I rushed off to try and ""do a deal"" with General Sir"
"Gerald Kitson, before starting."
I realised that a motor-car might play an important part in this
"prospective campaign, as it would be necessary to travel for long"
"distances in a land of no railways and no regular roads, the best"
road to be hoped for probably being a sandy track used by camel
caravans. I had already had some experience of difficult motoring
"But the finest growth of the new literature, it turns out, is due to"
"culture-contacts--an unexpected confirmation, in a most unlikely"
"quarter, of a general principle arrived at on other data. The vigilant"
"study of our own day has detected, standing out from the early"
"Icelandic literature, ""a group of poems which possess the very qualities"
"of high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature, passionate"
"dramatic power, and noble simplicity of language, which [other] Icelandic"
poetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong to Iceland at
"all. They are the poetry of the 'Western Islands'""[688]--that is, the"
"poetry of the meeting and mixing of the ""Celtic"" and Scandinavian stocks"
"in Ireland and the Hebrides--the former already much mixed, and"
proportionally rich in intellectual variations. It was in this area that
"""a magnificent school of poetry arose, to which we owe works that for"
power and beauty can be paralleled in no Teutonic language till centuries
"after their date.... This school, which is totally distinct from the"
"Icelandic, ran its own course apart and perished before the thirteenth"
"century.""[689]"
"Compare Messrs. Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_,"
"1883, vol. i, Introd. pp. lxii, lxiii; and, as regards the old"
"Irish civilisation, the author's _Saxon and Celt_, pp. 127, 128,"
131-33.
"The theory of Celtic influence, though established in its"
"essentials, is not perfectly consistent as set forth in the"
"_Britannica_ article. Thus, while the Celticised literature is"
"remarked for ""noble simplicity of language,"" the true Icelandic,"
"primarily like the Old English, is said to develop a ""complexity of"
"structure and ornament, an elaborate mythological and enigmatical"
"phraseology, and a regularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance,"
"quantity, and syllabification which it caught up from the Latin and"
"_Celtic_ poets."" Further, while the Celticised school is described"
"important) of the reigning beauties of the gay world, Grey felt that it"
would indeed be impossible to speak in this company of any of those
"things which were in his mind.  He contented himself by standing aloof,"
"looking out of the window and sipping his chocolate, whilst the gay"
"flood of talk surged around him, and he caught a word here and a phrase"
"there, but always heard when Lord Sandford’s resonant tones dominated"
those of all others.
"""Talk of rival beauties; we shall see sport to-night.  Lady Romaine and"
Lady Saltire—dearest friends and dearest foes—are to go to Vauxhall
"Gardens to-night, each in a new toilet specially designed and ordered"
"for the occasion.  It will be a ladies’ battle, in very truth; and"
public opinion must needs decide which of the rival queens is fairest to
"look upon.  I have promised both the dear creatures to be there, to give"
my admiration to both alike. Shall I risk the undying enmity of either
"by giving the palm to one?  No such fool, gentlemen—no such fool is"
Sandford.  I vow I will have ready such a pretty speech or couplet for
"each that she shall go away with a better opinion of me than ever!  Ha,"
"ha, ha!  I love to see the pretty dears, tricked out in their finery,"
"and ready to tear each other’s eyes out!  So, gentlemen, I cancel all"
"previous engagements for to-night.  I am for Vauxhall, and Heaven only"
"knows how late we shall be detained there by the battle of beauty."""
"""We will all be there!"" cried the young bloods, who were at all times"
ready to follow Lord Sandford to whatever place of entertainment he
"elected to go; and one voice followed with a laughing question,—"
"""Will the snow maiden be there in the train of her mother?"""
"Grey felt himself start, and was glad his face was turned away.  He"
would not for worlds that the sharp mocking eyes of Lord Sandford should
"see him at this moment, albeit he had no notion of any sort that he had"
Perhaps it may be as well to turn aside from the orderly and informative
discussion of the statistics of the Zone to expand a little further here
upon the remarkable matrimonial phenomena it presented in its halcyon
"days--for it must be remembered that even as I am writing, that society,"
"which I found so hospitable and so admirable, has begun to disintegrate."
"Marriage, it must be admitted, is a somewhat cosmopolitan passion. It"
attacks spiggotty and gringo alike. In an earlier chapter I have
described how the low cost of living enabled Miguel of the Chagres
country to set up a home of his own. Let us consider how the benevolent
arrangements made by the Isthmian Canal Commission impelled a typical
American boy to the same step.
Probably it was more a desire for experience and adventure than any idea
of increased financial returns that led young Jack Maxon to seek a job
in engineering on the Canal. Graduated from the engineering department
"of a State university, with two years or so of active experience in the"
"field, Jack was a fair type of young American--clean, wholesome,"
"healthy, technically trained, ambitious for his future but quite"
"solicitious about the pleasures of the present, as becomes a youth of"
twenty-three.

The job he obtained seemed at the outset quite ideal. In the States he
could earn about $225 a month. The day he took his number on the Canal
Zone he began to draw $250 a month. And that $250 was quite as good as
"$300 at home. To begin with he had no room-rent to pay, but was assigned"
"comfortable if not elegant quarters, which he shared with one other man;"
"carefully screened and protected from all insects by netting, lighted by"
"electricity, with a shower-bath handy and all janitor or chambermaid"
service free. Instead of a boarding-house table or a cheap city
"of the excited Don Carlos, and brought him up to his appointed place"
docile and motionless.
"The word was given, but the black stallion had bounded off a few seconds"
"too soon, and had to be recalled.  A second start was spoiled by two"
"other competitors, who suddenly reared at each other, and strove to"
"fight.  One iron hoof, indeed, inflicted such a wound upon the shoulder"
of his neighbour that that horse had to be taken away limping and
bleeding.
"It was trying to all, horses and riders alike; but at the third start"
"all got off, though Grey saw that again the black stallion had made his"
"bound a second too soon.  This gave him a few yards the advantage,"
"which, as his rider pressed him hard from the first, and his temper was"
"evidently up, he increased in the next minute to more than a length."
"The Arab and Don Carlos were neck and neck, and sailed over the first"
"easy jump side by side, the stallion having cleared it with a tremendous"
bound a couple of seconds earlier.
"The water jump was next, and it was obvious that one spot offered"
greater advantages to the horse than any other.  The stallion made for
"this spot with a rush, took off and bounded clear over, just as Don"
"Carlos and the Arab came rushing up neck and neck, each rider desirous"
of the advantage of the sound bank.  Grey set his teeth and glanced at
"his adversary.  A collision at the leap might be fatal to one or both,"
so far as the race went.  His rival would not budge an inch—that he saw.
"With a muttered oath between his teeth, he pulled his left rein, and"
"used his knees.  Don Carlos felt, and instantly understood: swerving"
"slightly, he gathered himself together, and rose magnificently where the"
"water was wider and the bank less safe; but he landed safely, and with a"
"hardly perceptible scramble found his feet again, and amid the plaudits"
"of the people raced on after the Arab, who, having got a momentary"
"her husband's execution, the woman said, she had had to become the"
mistress of the sergeant-major who resided with her as the only
"means, seemingly, of saving her one remaining young son from exile"
in Germany and her daughters from unbearably brutal treatment;
"though she added, ""As to their virtue, _that_ has long since"
vanished; all I ask is that they be not half-killed whenever the
soldiers get drunk. Oh Madame! If you could only say a word to that
"Colonel with whom you are living?"""
"Mrs. Warren dared not translate this last sentence to Vivie, for"
fear her daughter forced her at all costs to leave the Hotel
"Impérial. Where, if she did, were they to go?"
The winter of 1914 had witnessed an appalling degree of
"frightfulness in eastern Belgium, the Wallon or French-speaking part"
of the country more especially. The Germans seemed to bear a special
"grudge against this region, regarding it as doggedly opposed to"
absorption into a Greater Germany; whereas they hoped the Flemish
half of the country would receive them as fellow Teutons and even as
deliverers from their former French oppressors. Thousands of old men
"and youths, of women and children in the provinces south of the"
Meuse had been shot in cold blood; village after village had been
burnt. Scenes of nearly equal horror had taken place between
"Brussels and Antwerp, especially around Malines. Von Bissing's"
arrival as Governor General was soon signalized by those dreaded Red
"Placards on the walls of Brussels, announcing the verdicts of"
"courts-martial, the condemnation to death of men and women who had"
contravened some military regulation.
"Yet in spite of this, life went on in Brussels once more--by von"
Bissing's stern command--as though the country were not under the
heel of the invader. The theatres opened their doors; the cinemas
"Bill Dawson takes a bit of knowing."""
"""Have you any news, Mr. Dawson?"" asked Cary eagerly."
"""Not much. The wires of the _Antinous_ have all been renewed--the"
Admiralty won't allow cables to be patched except at sea--but I
haven't found out who played hanky-panky with them. It could not have
"been any one in the engine-room party, as none of them went near the"
"place where the wires were cut. Besides, they were engineers, not"
"electricians, and could have known nothing of the arrangements and"
disposition of the ship's wires. My man who worked with them is
"positive that they are a sound, good lot without a sea-lawyer or a"
"pacifist among them; a gang of plain, honest tykes. So we are thrown"
"back on the maintenance party, included in which were all sorts of"
ratings. Some of them are skilled in the electrical fittings--my own
"man with them is, for one--but we get the best accounts of all of"
"them. They are long service men, cast for sea owing to various medical"
"reasons, but perfectly efficient for harbour work. Among the officers"
of the ship is a R.N.R. lieutenant with a German name. I jumped to
"him, but the captain laughed. The man's father and grandfather were in"
"the English merchant service, and though his people originally came"
"from Saxony, he is no more German than we are ourselves. Besides, my"
experience is that an Englishman with an inherited German name is the
very last man to have any truck with the enemy. He is too much ashamed
of his forbears for one thing; and for another he is too dead set on
living down his beastly name. So we will rule out the Lieutenant
"R.N.R. My own man, who is a petty officer R.N.V.R., and has worked on"
"a lot of ships which have come in for repairs, says that the temper"
among the workmen in the yards is good now. It was ugly when dilution
"of labour first came in, but the wages are so high that all that"
trouble has settled down. I have had what you call sabotage in the
"shell and gun shops, but never yet in the King's ships. We have had"
"situation as a hall porter or waiter, but I can see that you ought to"
"be a soldier in the army, because you are no fool, are patient and"
"understand discipline. Life shuffles us like cards, you see, and it is"
"only accidentally, and only for a time, that we fall into our own"
"places!"""
Such farewell speeches often served as a preface to the continuation of
"their acquaintance, which again began with drinking and went so far"
that the client would spend his last farthing.  Then the Captain would
"stand him treat, and they would drink all they had."
A repetition of similar doings did not affect in the least the good
relations of the parties.
The teacher mentioned by the Captain was another of those customers who
were thus reformed only in order that they should sin again.  Thanks to
"his intellect, he was the nearest in rank to the Captain, and this was"
"probably the cause of his falling so low as dosshouse life, and of his"
inability to rise again.  It was only with him that Aristid Kuvalda
could philosophise with the certainty of being understood.  He valued
"this, and when the reformed teacher prepared to leave the dosshouse in"
"order to get a corner in town for himself, then Aristid Kuvalda"
"accompanied him so sorrowfully and sadly that it ended, as a rule, in"
their both getting drunk and spending all their money.  Probably
Kuvalda arranged the matter intentionally so that the teacher could not
"leave the dosshouse, though he desired to do so with all his heart."
"Was it possible for Aristid Kuvalda, a nobleman (as was evident from"
"his speeches), one who was accustomed to think, though the turn of fate"
"may have changed his position, was it possible for him not to desire to"
have close to him a man like himself?  We can pity our own faults in
others.
Englishmen before Marlowe flung his flaming torch amongst them. To
"understand the story a slight introduction is necessary. Igerna, the"
"wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, was loved by King Uther, who foully"
slew her husband and so won her for himself. As a result of this union
"were born Arthur and Anne, who, in their youth, perpetuated the"
"inherited taint of sin by becoming the parents of a boy, Mordred."
"Afterwards Arthur married Guenevera, and some years later went to France"
on a long campaign of conquest. In his absence Mordred gained the love
"of Guenevera. The play begins with the contemplated return of Arthur,"
"glorious from victory, the object being to concentrate attention upon"
"the swift fall from glory and power to ruin and death. Guenevera, having"
"learnt to hate her husband, debates in her mind his death or hers,"
"finally deciding, however, to become a nun. Her interview with Mordred"
ends in his resolving to resist Arthur's landing. Unsuccessful in this
"attempt, and defeated in battle, he spurns all thought of submission,"
"challenging his father to a second conflict, in Cornwall. Arthur,"
"feeling that his sins have found him out, would gladly make peace; but,"
"stung by Mordred's defiance, he follows him into Cornwall. There both"
"armies are destroyed and Mordred is slain, though in his death he"
mortally wounds his father. After the battle his body is brought before
"Arthur, in whom the sight awakens yet more fiercely the pangs of"
remorse. The play closes immediately before Arthur's own mysterious
departure.
Here is all the material for a great tragedy. The point for beginning
"the story is well chosen, though in obvious imitation of _Agamemnon_."
"Attention is concentrated on the catastrophe, no alien element being"
admitted to detract from the melancholy effect. It is sought to
"intensify the gloom by recourse to Seneca's stage Ghost; thus, the"
departed spirit of the wronged Gorlois opens the play with horrid
"imprecations of evil upon the house of Uther, and, at the close, exults"
"in the fullness of his revenge. From his mouth, as well as from the lips"
"""What will your prisoners get by way of punishment?"""
"""I am not sure, but I can guess pretty closely. The principal will go"
out suddenly early some morning. He is a Jew of uncertain Central
"European origin, Pole or Czech, a natural born British subject, a"
"shining light of a local anti-German society, an 'indispensable' in"
his job and exempted from military service. He will give no more
"trouble. Menteith will spend anything from seven to ten years in p.s.,"
"learn to do without his daily whisky bottle, and possibly come out a"
"decent citizen. The draughtsman, I expect, will be let off with"
"eighteen months of the Jug. We are just, but not harsh. My birds don't"
interest me much once they have been caught; it is the catching that I
"enjoy. Down in the south, where I have a home of my own--which I"
haven't seen during the past year except occasionally for an hour or
two--I used to grow big show chrysanthemums. All through the processes
"of rooting the cuttings, repotting, taking the buds, feeding up the"
"plants, I never could endure any one to touch them. But once the"
"flowers were fully developed, my wife could cut them as much as she"
pleased and fill the house with them. My job was done when I had got
the flowers perfect. It is just the same with my business. I cultivate
"the little dears I am after, and hate any one to interfere with me; I"
humour them and water them and feed them with opportunities till they
"are ripe, and then I stick out my hand and grab them. After that the"
"law can do what it likes with them; they ain't my concern any more."""
By this time it had become apparent even to my slow intelligence why
Dawson told me so much about himself and his methods. He had formed
"the central figure in a real story in print, and the glory of it"
"possessed him. He had tasted of the rich sweet wine of fame, and he"
thirsted for more of the same vintage. He never in so many words asked
"me to write this book, but his eagerness to play Dr. Johnson to my"
Boswell appeared in all our relations. He was communicative far beyond
"au moyen âge_, Bruxelles, 1874, p. 146 _sq._). There is some"
obscurity as to when the foreign Hansards were first permitted to
have warehouses and residences of their own in London. Cp.
"Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, vol. i, §"
"68; and Ashley, i, 105, following Schanz, who dates this privilege"
"in the reign of Henry III, though the merchants of Cologne (_id._"
p. 110) had a _hansa_ or gildhall in London in the reign of Richard
"I. Under whatever conditions, it is clear that London was one of"
the first foreign cities in which the German Hansard traders came
in friendly contact.
A reciprocal and normal egoism furthered as well as thwarted the Hansard
enterprise. Trade in the feudal period being a ground of privilege like
"any other, the monopolied merchants of every city strove to force"
"foreign traders to deal with them only. On the other hand, the English"
nobility sought to deal rather with the foreigner directly than with the
"English middlemen; and thus in each feudal country, but notably in"
"England,[717] the interest of the landed class tended to throw foreign"
"trade substantially in foreign hands, which did their best to hold it."
In the reigns of the Edwards privileges of free trade with natives were
gradually conferred on the foreign traders[718] in the interests of the
"landed class--the only ""general consumers"" who could then make their"
claims felt--in despite of the angry resistance of the native merchant
"class. For the rest, in a period when some maritime English cities, like"
"those of France and Germany, could still carry on private wars with each"
"other as well as with foreign cities,[719] a trader of one English town"
"was in any other English town on all fours with a foreigner.[720] When,"
"therefore, the foreigners combined, their advantage over the native"
trade was twofold.
Naturally the cities least liable to regal interference carried on a
"cosmopolitan co-operation to the best advantage. The Hansa of London,"
"Redditch seemed to dance up and down me, but I stuck it out--and I had"
"my reward, I had my reward. I did my duty, but it's a sick and sorry"
"man that I am this day."""
"""There was nothing else to be done,"" I said. ""What you feel now is a"
"nervous reaction."""
"""That's about it. I watched and watched, never feeling a bit like"
sleep though my eyes burned something cruel and my feet--they were
"lumps of prickly wood, not feet. Dull lumps with every now and then a"
stab as if a tin tack had been driven into them. Beyond me in the open
"alley-way the light was strong, and I could see men pass frequently,"
"but no one came into my corner till the end, and no one saw me. I"
"heard six bells go in the first watch ('Eleven p.m.,' whispered Cary)"
"on Friday evening, though there was a good bit of noise of getting"
"ready to go out in the early morning, and I was beginning to think"
"that all my trouble might go for naught, when a man in a Navy cap and"
overalls stopped just opposite my dark hole between two bulkheads. His
"face was turned from me, as he looked carefully up and down the"
"lighted way. He stood there quite still for some seconds, and then"
stepped backwards towards me. I could see him plain against the light
"beyond. He listened for another minute or so, and, satisfied that no"
"one was near, spun on his heels, whipped a tool from his dungaree"
"overalls, and reached up to the wires which ran under the deck beams"
overhead. In spite of my aching joints and sore feet I was out in a
flash and had my bayonet up against his chest. He didn't move till my
point was through his clothes and into his flesh. I just shoved till
"he gave ground, and so, step by step, I pushed him with the point of"
"my bayonet till he was under the lights. His arms had come down, he"
dropped the big shears with insulated handles which he had drawn from
"his pocket, but he didn't speak a word to me and I did not speak to"
"him. I just held him there under the lights, and we looked at one"
men. The light had not been abandoned; it had simply burned itself out.
It was a fortunate circumstance that very little shipping frequents
"these seas during the winter, or there would have been one or two"
"marine disasters, as the islands are often wrapped in fog."
It is surmised that one of the men ventured outside on to a rocky ledge
"in the early hours of the morning. According to the log, a vicious"
"storm was raging at the time, and probably in the darkness the man was"
"swept off his feet and carried into the sea. The second keeper on duty,"
"marvelling at the non-return of his assistant, evidently had roused his"
"other companion, and the two had instituted a search in the storm, only"
in turn to be caught by a wave and carried away.
"In Great Britain, since 1860, men only have been employed by the"
"Trinity House Brethren for the maintenance of the lights, but in"
the United States women still are engaged in this duty. Some of the
British lights have been controlled by one family through two or
three generations. It was only a few years ago that a Darling retired
"from the vigil on the Longstones of Farne Islands, the scene of Grace"
"Darling’s heroism, while for a century and a half one family kept the"
"South Foreland light faithfully. The Casquets light off Alderney, in"
"the Channel Islands, was maintained by one family, some of the children"
"spending the whole of their lives on the rock, son succeeding father at"
the post of duty.
"On the American coast, however, women are more extensively employed."
Seeing that many of the lights are burned in a low tower projecting
"from the dwelling-house, this circumstance may be readily understood,"
as the duties beyond the maintenance of the light are not exacting.
"One of the most notable instances, however, is the Point Pino light"
"at the entrance to Monterey Bay, on the Californian coast, the"
guardianship of which has been in feminine hands for the past thirty
"acres or even more. All fruit is delivered along the railway lines, and"
"the larger growers have tramways, the cars drawn by oxen or mules, to"
carry their fruit to the stipulated point. Notice is given the growers
"of the date on which the fruit will be called for, and within twelve to"
eighteen hours after it has been cut it is in the hold of the vessel. It
"is subjected to a rigid inspection at the docks, and the flaws for which"
whole bunches are rejected would often be quite undiscernible to the
ordinary observer.

"The banana is one of the few fruits which are free from insect pests,"
"being protected by its thick, bitter skin. If allowed to ripen in the"
"open, however, it speedily falls a prey to a multitude of egg-laying"
"insects. The tree itself is not so immune. Lately a small rodent,"
"something like the gopher of our American states, has discovered that"
banana roots are good to eat. From time immemorial he lived in the
"jungle, burrowing and nibbling the roots of the plants there, but in an"
unlucky moment for the fruit companies he discovered that tunneling in
soil that had been worked was easier and the roots of the cultivated
banana more succulent than his normal diet. Therefore a large
importation of scientists from Europe and the United States to find some
way of eradicating the industrious pest that has attacked the chief
"industry of the tropics at the root, so to speak."
[Illustration: COFFEE PLANT AT BOUQUETTE]
Baron Humboldt is said to have first called the attention of civilized
"people to the food value of the banana, but it was one of the founders"
"of the United Fruit Company, a New England sea captain trading to Colon,"
who first introduced it to the general market in the United States. For
a time he carried home a few bunches in the cabin of his schooner for
The best proof that Erasmus had practically given up his hope to play a
conciliatory part may be found in what follows. In the summer of 1520
"the famous meeting between the three monarchs, Henry VIII, Francis I and"
"Charles V, took place at Calais. Erasmus was to go there in the train of"
his prince. How would such a congress of princes--where in peaceful
"conclave the interests of France, England, Spain, the German Empire, and"
"a considerable part of Italy, were represented together--have affected"
"Erasmus's imagination, if his ideal had remained unshaken! But there are"
"no traces of this. Erasmus was at Calais in July 1520, had some"
"conversation with Henry VIII there, and greeted More, but it does not"
appear that he attached any other importance to the journey than that of
"an opportunity, for the last time, to greet his English friends."
"It was awkward for Erasmus that just at this time, when the cause of"
"faith took so much harsher forms, his duties as counsellor to the"
"youthful Charles, now back from Spain to be crowned as emperor,"
circumscribed his liberty more than before. In the summer of 1520
"appeared, based on the incriminating material furnished by the Louvain"
"faculty, the papal bull declaring Luther to be a heretic, and, unless he"
"should speedily recant, excommunicating him. 'I fear the worst for the"
"unfortunate Luther,' Erasmus writes, 9 September 1520, 'so does"
"conspiracy rage everywhere, so are princes incensed with him on all"
"sides, and, most of all, Pope Leo. Would Luther had followed my advice"
and abstained from those hostile and seditious actions!... They will not
rest until they have quite subverted the study of languages and the good
learning.... Out of the hatred against these and the stupidity of monks
"did this tragedy first arise.... I do not meddle with it. For the rest,"
a bishopric is waiting for me if I choose to write against Luther.'
"Indeed, Erasmus had become, by virtue of his enormous celebrity, as"
"circumstances would have it, more and more a valuable asset in the great"
"monopolized the market, for the trade statistics show 17,000,000 bunches"
of bananas imported by rival companies in 1912. As for its stimulation
"of the business of the ports of New Orleans, Galveston and Mobile, and"
"its revivifying of trade along the Caribbean, both are matters of common"
knowledge.
"[Illustration: ABOVE THE CLOUDS, CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]"
The banana thrives best in rich soil covered with alluvial deposits and
in a climate of great humidity where the temperature never falls below
75 degrees Fahrenheit. Once established the plantation needs little
"attention, the plant being self-propagating from suckers which shoot off"
"from the “mat,” the tangled roots of the mother plant. It begins to bear"
"fruit at the age of ten or eleven months, and with the maturing of one"
bunch of fruit the parent plant is at once cut down so that the strength
of the soil may go into the suckers that succeed it. Perhaps the most
technical work of the cultivator is to select the suckers so that the
"plantation will not bring all its fruit to maturity in one season, but"
"rather yield a regular succession of crops, month after month. It was"
interesting to learn from a representative of the United Fruit Company
"at Bocas del Toro, that the banana has its dull season--not in"
"production but in the demand for it which falls off heavily in winter,"
"though one would suppose that summer, when our own fruits are in the"
"market, would be the period of its eclipse."
[Illustration: THE CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]
[Illustration: NATIVE MARKET BOAT AT CHORRERA]
While most of the fruit gathered in the neighborhood of Bocas del Toro
"is grown on land owned and tilled by the Company, there are hundreds of"
small individual growers with plantations of from half an acre to fifty
"also to undergo the ascendancy of her religion. As a matter of fact, her"
"fervent believers maintained her sanctuaries, despite the law, on the very"
"Capitol. Under Cæsar, Alexandrian astronomers had reformed the calendar of"
"the pontiffs, and Alexandrian priests soon marked the dates of Isis"
holidays upon it.
The decisive step was taken soon after the death of Tiberius. Caligula
erected the great temple of Isis Campensis on the Campus Martius probably
"in the year 38.[29] In order to spare the sacerdotal susceptibilities, he"
founded it outside of the sacred enclosure of the city of Servius. Later
Domitian made one of Rome's most splendid monuments of that temple. From
"that time Isis and Serapis enjoyed the favor of every imperial dynasty, the"
Flavians as well as the Antonines and the Severi. About the year 215
"Caracalla built an Isis temple, even more magnificent than that of"
"Domitian, on the Quirinal, in the heart of the city, and perhaps another"
"one on the Coelian. As the apologist Minucius Felix states, the Egyptian"
gods had become entirely Roman.[30]
The climax of their power seems to have been reached at the beginning of
the third century; later on the popular vogue and official support went to
"other divinities, like the Syrian Baals and the Persian {85} Mithras. The"
"progress of Christianity also deprived them of their power, which was,"
"however, still considerable until the end of the ancient world. The Isis"
processions that marched the streets of Rome were described by an eye
"witness as late as the year 394,[31] but in 391 the patriarch Theophilus"
"had consigned the Serapeum of Alexandria to the flames, having himself"
struck the first blow with an ax against the colossal statue of the god
that had so long been the object of a superstitious veneration. Thus the
"prelate destroyed the ""very head of idolatry,"" as Rufinus put it.[32]"
"As a matter of fact, idolatry received its death blow. The worship of the"
gods of the Ptolemies died out completely between the reigns of Theodosius
for him to sleep in. But the curious thing was that the monk seemed to
"know it all. He knew the monastery and the path to it, and the ways"
"about the village, and the names of the hills and the streams. It"
"seemed, indeed, as if he must once have lived there in the village, and"
"yet no one knew him or recognised his face, though he was but a young"
"man still, and there were villagers who had lived there for seventy"
"years. Next morning, instead of going on his way, the monk came into the"
"village with his begging-bowl, as monks do, and went round and collected"
"his food for the day; and in the evening, when the villagers went to see"
"him at the monastery, he told them he was going to stay. He recalled to"
"them the monk who had planted the teak-trees, and how he had said that"
"when the trees were grown he would return. 'I,' said the young monk, 'am"
"he that planted these trees. Lo, they are grown up, and I am returned,"
and now we will build a monastery as I said.'
"When the villagers, doubting, questioned him, and old men came and"
"talked to him of traditions of long-past days, he answered as one who"
knew all. He told them he had been born and educated far away in the
"South, and had grown up not knowing who he had been; and that he had"
"entered a monastery, and in time became a Pongyi. The remembrance came"
"to him, he went on, in a dream of how he had planted the trees and had"
promised to return to that village far away in the forest.
"The very next day he had started, and travelled day after day and week"
"upon week, till at length he had arrived, as they saw. So the villagers"
"were convinced, and they set to work and cut down the great boles, and"
built the monastery such as my friend saw. And the monk lived there all
"his life, and taught the children, and preached the marvellous teaching"
"of the great Buddha, till at length his time came again and he returned;"
"for of monks it is not said that they die, but that they return."
This is the common belief of the people. Into this has the mystery of
"quittance of earth?--and have I so soon won the privilege to die?"""
"As he spoke, she rose and stood erect, with all the glistening light of"
"the stained window falling royally about her,--and he obeying her mute"
"gesture, rose also and faced her in wondering ecstasy, half expecting"
to see her vanish suddenly in the sun-rays that poured through the
"Cathedral, even as she had vanished before like a white cloud absorbed"
"in clear space. But no! She remained quiet as a tame bird,--her eyes"
"met his with beautiful trust and tenderness,--and when she answered"
"him, her low, sweet accents thrilled to his heart with a pathetic note"
"of HUMAN affection, as well as of angelic sympathy!"
"""Theos, my Beloved, I am ALL THINE!"" she said, a holy rapture vibrating"
"through her exquisite voice.--""Thine now, in mortal life as in"
"immortal!--one with thee in nature and condition,--pent up in"
"perishable clay, even as thou art,--subject to sorrow, and pain, and"
"weariness,--willing to share with thee thine earthly lot,--ready to"
take my part in thy grief or joy! By mine own choice have I come
"hither,--sinless, yet not exempt from sin, but safe in Christ! Every"
"time thou hast renounced the desire of thine own happiness, so much the"
nearer hast thou drawn me to thee; every time thou hast prayed God for
"my peace, rather than thine own, so much the closer has my existence"
"been linked with thine! And now, O my Poet, my lord, my king!--we are"
"together forever more,--together in the brief Present, as in the"
"eternal Future!--the solitary heaven-days of Edris are past, and her"
"mission is not Death, but Love!"""
"Oh, the transcendent beauty of that warm flush upon her face!--the"
"splendid hope, faith, and triumph of her attitude! What strange miracle"
"was here accomplished!--an Angel had become human for the sake of love,"
even as light substantiates itself in the colors of flowers!--the Eden
"lily had consented to be gathered,--the paradise dove had fluttered"
"could be at peace, and the monk answered for the governor that all his"
"land was at their disposal. 'Let the Nats choose,' he said; 'all the"
"country is before them.' So the Nats chose, and said that they would"
"have Popa Mountain, and the monk agreed."
"The Nats then left the tree and went away, far away inland, to the great"
"Popa Mountain, and took up their abode there, and all the people there"
"feared and reverenced them, and even made to their honour two statues"
with golden heads and set them up on the mountain.
"This is the story of the Popa Nats, the greatest Nats of all the"
"country of Burma, the guardian spirits of the mysterious mountain. The"
"golden heads of the statues are now in one of our treasuries, put there"
"for safe custody during the troubles, though it is doubtful if even then"
"anyone would have dared to steal them, so greatly are the Nats feared."
And the hunters and the travellers there must offer to the Nats little
"offerings, if they would be safe in these forests, and even the young"
man must obtain permission from the Nats before he marry.
"I think these stories that I have told, stories selected from very many"
"that I have heard, will show what sort of spirits these are that the"
Burmese have peopled their trees and rivers with; will show what sort of
"religion it is that underlies, without influencing, the creed of the"
"Buddha that they follow. It is of the very poetry of superstition, free"
"from brutality, from baseness, from anything repulsive, springing, as I"
"have said, from their innate sympathy with Nature and recognition of the"
life that works in all things. It always seems to me that beliefs such
"as these are a great key to the nature of a people, are, apart from all"
"interest in their beauty, and in their akinness to other beliefs, of"
great value in trying to understand the character of a nation.
For to beings such as Nats and fairies the people who believe in them
"Blackwoods' saloon, a recognisable but idealistic likeness,"
"that Ferrier remarked, 'I should call that the pursuit of"
beauty under difficulties.'
"During her infancy Edinburgh had become Mrs. Ferrier's home, though she"
"made frequent visits to Westmorland, of whose dialect she had a"
"complete command. The courtship, however, had been for the most part"
"carried on at the picturesque old house of Gorton, where 'Christopher"
"North' was temporarily residing, and which, situated as it is"
"overlooking the lovely glen made immortal by the name of Hawthornden,"
"in view of Roslin Chapel, and surrounded by old-fashioned walks and"
"gardens, must have been an ideal spot for a romantic couple like the"
Ferriers to roam in. Another friend writes of Wilson's later home at
"Elleray: 'In his hospitable house, where the wits of _Blackwood_"
gathered at intervals and visited individually in season and out of
"season, his daughter saw strange men of genius, such as few young"
"ladies had the fortune to see, and heard talk such as hardly another"
"has the fortune to hear. Lockhart, with his caricatures and his"
"incisive sarcasm, was an intimate of the house. The Ettrick Shepherd,"
"with his plaid and homely Doric, broke in occasionally, as did also De"
"Quincey, generally towards midnight, when he used to sit pouring forth"
"his finely-balanced, graceful sentences far on among the small hours of"
"the morning. There were students, too, year after year, many of them"
"not undistinguished, and some of whom had, we doubt not, ideas of their"
own regarding the flashing hazel eyes of their eloquent Professor's
"eldest daughter.' But her cousin was her choice, though wealth offered"
"no attraction, and neither side had reason to regret the marriage of"
affection.
"At the time of his marriage Ferrier had been practising at the Bar,"
"probably with no great measure of success, seeing that his heart was"
not really set upon his work. It was at this period that he first began
Osiris were either immediately identified or else were identical from the
beginning. The divinity whose worship was started at Alexandria by Ptolemy
was the god that ruled the dead and shared his immortality with them. He
"was fundamentally an Egyptian god, and the most popular of the deities of"
the Nile. Herodotus says that Isis and Osiris were revered by every
"inhabitant of the country, and their traditional holidays involved secret"
ceremonies whose sacred meaning the Greek writer dared not reveal.[2]
"Recognizing their Osiris in Serapis, the Egyptians readily accepted the new"
cult. There was a tradition that a new dynasty should introduce a new god
or give a sort of preeminence to the god of its own district. From time
immemorial politics had changed the {75} government of heaven when changing
that of earth. Under the Ptolemies the Serapis of Alexandria naturally
"became one of the principal divinities of the country, just as the Ammon of"
Thebes had been the chief of the celestial hierarchy under the Pharaohs of
"that city, or as, under the sovereigns from Sais, the local Neith had the"
primacy. At the time of the Antonines there were forty-two Serapeums in
Egypt.[3]
But the purpose of the Ptolemies was not to add one more Egyptian god to
the countless number already worshiped by their subjects. They wanted this
"god to unite in one common worship the two races inhabiting the kingdom,"
and thus to further a complete fusion. The Greeks were obliged to worship
him side by side with the natives. It was a clever political idea to
institute a Hellenized Egyptian religion at Alexandria. A tradition
"mentioned by Plutarch[4] has it that Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, a"
"man of advanced ideas, together with Timotheus, a Eumolpid from Eleusis,"
thought out the character that would best suit the newcomer. The result was
that the composite religion founded by the Lagides became a combination of
the old creed of the Pharaohs and the Greek mysteries.
"First of all, the liturgic language was no longer the native idiom but"
"badly, but there were plenty of leaves left on it. I stared at it,"
"trying hard to keep awake. But soon the trunk began to quiver, then it"
wobbled with a wavy motion like a snake. Then the leafy part seemed to
"shoot out in all directions until there was nothing but a green blur,"
and I fell back against the trench wall and my rifle clattered down. I
"pulled myself together, absolutely mad with fear, because I kept on"
thinking of the last time I went on guard and the court martial and the
death sentence. I ground my teeth and stared at the tree again. But the
trunk began to wobble with snaky undulations and the green blur grew
"bigger and bigger in sudden jerks, while I tried frantically and"
desperately to keep it small. But it got the better of me and all at
once it obscured everything with a rush and I dropped forward and
knocked my forehead against the steel plate. I pulled myself together
and prayed for a Blighty or something that would get me out of this
"misery. I looked at my watch--O God, only five minutes had gone,"
one-twelfth of my time! I had a kind of panic then and I dashed my head
wildly against the trench wall and I bit my lips--I almost enjoyed the
"pain. I looked through the hole. The tree was steady at first, but it"
"soon began to wobble again. Then I said to myself: 'I don't care, I'll"
"risk it, I won't look out, I'll just keep awake. I don't suppose any"
Fritzes will come along--I'll just peep through the holes from time to
time so as to make sure.' I stamped on the duckboard and kicked the
sides of the trench and jerked my rifle up and down just to keep myself
awake. It was all right at first and I was beginning to think I would
"get over it somehow, but my feet soon felt as heavy as lead and my head"
began to swim until I fell forward once again. Jesus Christ--I didn't
"know what to do. I thought of looking at my watch, but I hadn't the"
"courage at first. Besides, I felt the seconds would slip by while I was"
hesitating and so I'd gain at least a little time. I counted the
"seconds--one, two, three ... four ... five ... six ... my head dropped"
forward and I nearly fell over. I looked at my watch--fourteen minutes
"had gone, nearly a quarter of an hour! That wasn't so bad. I felt a"
expressed the needs of his fellow-playmates when he said: “I want to go
to the place where the shadows are real.” This is the true definition
"of “Faerie” lands, and is the first sign of real mental development"
in the child when he is no longer content with the stories of his own
"little deeds and experiences, when his ear begins to appreciate sounds"
"different from the words in his own everyday language, and when he"
begins to separate his own personality from the action of the story.
George Goschen says[26]:
“What I want for the young are books and stories which do not simply
deal with our daily life. I like the fancy (even) of little children
"to have some larger food than images of their own little lives, and"
I confess I am sorry for the children whose imaginations are not
sometimes stimulated by beautiful Fairy Tales which carry them to
worlds different from those in which their future will be passed....
I hold that what removes them more or less from their daily life is
better than what reminds them of it at every step.”
It is because of the great value of leading children to something
beyond the limited circle of their own lives that I deplore the
twaddling boarding-school stories written for girls and the
artificially-prepared Public School stories for boys. Why not give them
"the dramatic interest of a larger stage? No account of a cricket match,"
"or a football triumph, could present a finer appeal to boys and girls"
than the description of the Peacestead in the “Heroes of Asgaard”:
"“This was the playground of the Æsir, where they practised trials of"
skill one with another and held tournaments and sham fights. These last
were always conducted in the gentlest and most honourable manner; for
"the strongest law of the Peacestead was, that no angry blow should be"
"struck, or spiteful word spoken upon the sacred field.”"
filled his ear with slanderous reports. They had said that the queen's
"brother was the strongest man in all the kingdom. 'He was cunning, too,'"
"they said, 'and very popular among all the people; and he was so puffed"
"up with pride, now that his sister was a queen, that there was nothing"
he did not think he could do.' They represented to the king how
"dangerous such a man was in a kingdom, that it would be quite easy for"
"him to raise such rebellion as the king could hardly put down, and that"
"he was just the man to do such a thing. Nay, it was indeed proved that"
"he must be disloyally plotting something, or he would have come down"
with his sister to the city when she came. But now many months had
"passed, and he never came. Clearly he was not to be trusted. Any other"
"man whose sister was a queen would have come and lived in the palace,"
"and served the king and become a minister, instead of staying up there"
and pretending to be a blacksmith.
"The king's mind had been much disturbed by this, for it seemed to him"
"that it must be in part true; and he went to the queen, as I have said,"
"and his suspicions had not been lulled by what she told him, so he had"
ordered her to write to her brother to come down to the palace.
"The queen was terrified when she saw what a mistake she had made, and"
how she had fallen into the trap of her enemies; but she hoped that the
"king would forget, and she determined that she would send no order to"
"her brother to come. But the next day the king came back to the subject,"
"and asked her if she had yet sent the letter, and she said 'No!' The"
"king was very angry at this disobedience to his orders, and he asked her"
"how it came that she had not done as he had commanded, and sent a"
letter to her brother to call him to the palace.
Then the queen fell at the king's feet and told him all her fears that
"her brother was sent for only to be imprisoned or executed, and she"
begged and prayed the king to leave him in peace up there in his
"being cut open, there is not the slightest need to accentuate the"
physical side. Children accept the deed as they accept the cutting
"off of a giant's head, because they do not associate it with pain,"
especially if the deed is presented half-humorously. The moment in the
"story where their sympathy is aroused is the swallowing of the kids,"
because the children do realise the possibility of being disposed of
"in the mother's absence. (Needless to say, I never point out the moral"
of the kids' disobedience to the mother in opening the door.) I have
always noticed a moment of breathlessness even in a grown-up audience
"when the wolf swallows the kids, and that the recovery of them “all"
"safe and sound, all huddled together” is quite as much appreciated by"
"the adult audience as by the children, and is worth the tremor caused"
by the wolf's summary action.
I have not always been able to impress upon the teachers that this
story _must_ be taken lightly. A very earnest young student came to
"me once after I had told it, and said in an awestruck voice: “Do you"
"Correlate?” Having recovered from the effect of this word, which she"
"carefully explained, I said that as a rule I preferred to keep the"
"story apart from the other lessons, just an undivided whole, because"
it had effects of its own which were best brought about by not being
connected with other lessons.[31] She frowned her disapproval and said:
"“I am sorry, because I thought I would take The Goat for my Nature"
"Study lesson, and then tell your story at the end.” I thought of the"
terrible struggle in the child's mind between his conscientious wish to
be accurate and his dramatic enjoyment of the abnormal habits of a goat
"who went out with scissors, needle and thread; but I have been most"
careful since to repudiate any connection with Nature Study in this and
a few other stories in my répertoire.
One might occasionally introduce one of Edward Lear's “Book of
Nonsense.” For instance:

this last line being certainly one of the most suggestive and beautiful
in all poetical literature. Such expressions have the intrinsic quality
"of COMPLETENESS,--once said, we feel that they can never be said"
"again;--they belong to the centuries, rather than the seasons, and any"
imitation of them we immediately and instinctively resent as an outrage.
"And Theos Alwyn was essentially, and above all things, faithful to the"
"lofty purpose of his calling,--he dealt with his art reverently, and"
"not in rough haste and scrambling carelessness,--if he worked out any"
"idea in rhyme, the idea was distinct and the rhyme was perfect,--he was"
"not content, like Browning, to jumble together such hideous and"
"ludicrous combinations as ""high;--Humph!"" and ""triumph,""--moreover, he"
"knew that what he had to tell his public must be told comprehensively,"
"yet grandly, with all the authority and persuasiveness of incisive"
"rhetoric, yet also with all the sweetness and fascination of a"
"passioned love-song. Occupied with such work as this, London, with its"
"myriad mad noises and vulgar distractions, became impossible to"
"him,--and Villiers, his fidus Achates, who had read portions of his"
"great poem and was impatient to see it finished, knowing, as he did,"
"what an enormous sensation it would create when published, warmly"
seconded his own desire to gain a couple of months complete seclusion
and tranquillity.
"He left town, therefore, about the middle of May and started across the"
"Channel, resolving to make for Switzerland by the leisurely and"
"delightful way of the Rhine, in order to visit Bonn, the scene of his"
"old student days. What days they had been!--days of dreaming, more than"
"killed in an accident, and that was some consolation to me. And the next"
morning--I can't bear to think of it--nothing happened: that was just
the terrible thing about it--nothing happened. The day passed and then
"another day. At times I longed to be taken out and shot, and once or"
twice I felt I didn't care about anything. I didn't care whether I died
or not. A week passed and then another week. I don't know how I lived
"through it. Then, one day, I was told to pack up and rejoin my unit. I"
"don't know exactly what I did, but I think I must have gone hysterical."
I remember some N.C.O. saying I ought to stay a bit because I wasn't
well enough to go up the line. He said he'd speak to the officer and get
me a few days' rest. But the thought of staying in that place made me
shiver. I said I was absolutely all right and went back to my unit.
"""But I never found out what had happened--you see, I was only a common"
"soldier, so they didn't trouble to tell me--until I got a letter from"
the Captain who was in charge of me when I was on that forty-three hour
job. He said he'd heard I was in for a court martial for sleeping when
"on guard, so he wrote to our headquarters to tell them I'd worked"
forty-three hours on end and wasn't fit to do a guard after a spell like
that. Then they must have made a lot of inquiries--I expect there's a
"whole file of papers about me at headquarters. Anyhow, that's how I got"
"off--it's more than a month ago now. Well, yesterday morning I was put"
"on guard again. I tried to get out of it, but the officer said I was"
swinging the lead and he wouldn't listen to any excuses. I told him I'd
had insomnia overnight and could hardly keep my eyes open. I said I'd do
"anything rather than a guard--a fatigue job or a patrol, no matter how"
"dangerous, as long as it kept me on the move. The very thought of doing"
a guard made me tremble all over. He swore at me and said he'd heard
"these tales before and told me to shut up and get on with it. Well, I"
had to stand in the trench in front of a steel plate with holes in it
through which I had to peer. It was just about daybreak. There was a
tree growing about fifty yards off. It had been knocked about pretty
"historical research that, apart from the fruitful labours of the Navy"
"Records Society, of Messrs. Oscar Browning and Hereford George, and of"
"Mr. Bowman of Toronto, scarcely any English work has appeared that is"
based on the official records of this period. Yet they are of great
interest and value. Our diplomatic agents then had the knack of
"getting at State secrets in most foreign capitals, even when we were"
at war with their Governments; and our War Office and Admiralty
"Records have also yielded me some interesting ""finds."" M. Lévy, in the"
"preface to his ""Napoléon intime"" (1893), has well remarked that ""the"
documentary history of the wars of the Empire has not yet been
"written. To write it accurately, it will be more important thoroughly"
"to know foreign archives than those of France."" Those of Russia,"
"Austria, and Prussia have now for the most part been examined; and I"
think that I may claim to have searched all the important parts of our
"Foreign Office Archives for the years in question, as well as for part"
of the St. Helena period. I have striven to embody the results of this
search in the present volumes as far as was compatible with limits of
"space and with the narrative form at which, in my judgment, history"
ought always to aim.
"On the whole, British policy comes out the better the more fully it is"
"known. Though often feeble and vacillating, it finally attained to"
firmness and dignity; and Ministers closed the cycle of war with acts
of magnanimity towards the French people which are studiously ignored
by those who bid us shed tears over the martyrdom of St. Helena.
"Nevertheless, the splendour of the finale must not blind us to the"
flaccid eccentricities that made British statesmanship the laughing
"stock of Europe in 1801-3, 1806-7, and 1809. Indeed, it is"
questionable whether the renewal of war between England and Napoleon
in 1803 was due more to his innate forcefulness or to the contempt
which he felt for the Addington Cabinet. When one also remembers our
"extraordinary blunders in the war of the Third Coalition, it seems a"
the saints were exposed if they find them too often preserved at the
last moment from the punishment they were brave enough to undergo. For
"one or other of these reasons, I should avoid the detailed history of"
"St. Juliana, St. Vincent, St. Quintin, St. Eustace, St. Winifred, St."
"Theodore, St. James the More, St. Katharine, St. Cuthbert, St. Alphage,"
"St. Peter of Milan, St. Quirine and Juliet, St. Alban and others."
The danger of telling children stories connected with sudden
conversions is that they are apt to place too much emphasis on the
"process, rather than the goal to be reached. We should always insist on"
the splendid deeds performed after a real conversion--not the details
"of the conversion itself; as, for instance, the beautiful and poetical"
work done by St. Christopher when he realised what work he could do
most effectively.
"On the other hand, there are many stories of the saints dealing with"
actions and motives which would appeal to the imagination and are not
"only worthy of imitation, but are not wholly outside the life and"
experience even of the child.[30]
Having protested against the elephantine joke and the too-frequent
"use of exaggerated fun, I now endeavour to restore the balance by"
suggesting the introduction into the school curriculum of a few purely
grotesque stories which serve as an antidote to sentimentality or
"utilitarianism. But they must be presented as nonsense, so that the"
"children may use them for what they are intended, as pure relaxation."
Such a story is that of “The Wolf and the Kids.” I have had serious
"objections offered to this story by several educational people, because"
"of the revenge taken by the goat on the wolf, but I am inclined to"
"think that if the story is to be taken as anything but sheer nonsense,"
it is surely sentimental to extend our sympathy towards a caller who
has devoured six of his hostess' children. With regard to the wolf
"fully, and is well worth reading. He had many ups and downs in his early"
seafaring life in the West Indies; being no less than three times taken by
"the pressgang, each time escaping. He served in Dutch and Spanish"
"privateers, and eventually rose to being a pirate captain, making his"
"headquarters in Madagascar. From here he sailed out to the East Indies,"
and preyed on the ships of the East India Company. Several times he was
"wrecked, once he was the only survivor, and swam ashore at Madagascar"
stark naked. The unusual sight of a naked Englishman spread terror amongst
"the natives who were on the beach, and they all fled into the jungle"
"except one, a woman, who from previous personal experience knew that this"
"was but a human being and not a sea devil. She supplied him with clothes,"
"of a sort, and led him to the nearest pirate settlement, some six miles"
away. On another occasion when the pirates were having a jollification
"ashore, having left their Moorish prisoners on the ship at anchor, North"
"gave the prisoners a hint to clear off in the night with the ship,"
otherwise they would all be made slaves. This friendly hint was acted
"upon, and in the morning both ship and prisoners had vanished. The pirates"
"having lost their ship took to the peaceful and harmless life of planters,"
"with North as their ruler. He won the confidence of the natives, who"
abided by his decision in all quarrels and misunderstandings. Occasionally
North and his men would join forces with a neighbouring friendly tribe and
"go to war, North leading the combined army, and victory always resulted."
"The call of piracy was too strong in his bones to resist, and after three"
years planting he was back to sea and the Jolly Roger once more. On one
"occasion he seized the opportunity, when in the neighbourhood of the"
"Mascarenhas Islands, to go ashore and visit the Catholic priest and"
"confess, and at the same time made suitable arrangements for his children"
to be educated by the Church. North evidently truly repented his former
"sins, for he returned to resume his simple life on his plantation. On"
arriving home he found the settlement in an uproar. He soon settled all
"the disputes, appeased the natives, and before long had this garden-city"
of pirates back in its previous peaceful and happy state. Beyond an
"Volant_, from a French pirate, and made her his own flagship, christening"
her the _Satisfaction_.
In 1670 the greatest event of Morgan's life took place--the sacking of
Panama. First landing a party which took the Castle of San Lorenzo at the
"mouth of the Chagres River, Morgan left a strong garrison there to cover"
"his retreat and pushed on with 1,400 men in a fleet of canoes up the river"
"on January 9th, 1671. The journey across the isthmus, through the tropical"
"jungle, was very hard on the men, particularly as they had depended on"
"finding provisions to supply their wants on the way, and carried no food"
"with them. They practically starved until the sixth day, when they found a"
"barn full of maize, which the fleeing Spaniards had neglected to destroy."
On the evening of the ninth day a scout reported he had seen the steeple
"of a church in Panama. Morgan, with that touch of genius which so often"
"brought him success, attacked the city from a direction the Spaniards had"
"not thought possible, so that their guns were all placed where they were"
"useless, and they were compelled to do just what the buccaneer leader"
"wanted them to do--namely, to come out of their fortifications and fight"
him in the open. The battle raged fiercely for two hours between the brave
Spanish defenders and the equally brave but almost exhausted buccaneers.
"When at last the Spaniards turned and ran, the buccaneers were too tired"
"to immediately follow up their success, but after resting they advanced,"
and at the end of three hours' street fighting the city was theirs. The
first thing Morgan now did was to assemble all his men and strictly forbid
"them to drink any wine, telling them that he had secret information that"
the wine had been poisoned by the Spaniards before they left the city.
"This was, of course, a scheme of Morgan's to stop his men from becoming"
"drunk, when they would be at the mercy of the enemy, as had happened in"
many a previous buccaneer assault.
"Morgan now set about plundering the city, a large part of which was burnt"
"to the ground, though whether this was done by his orders or by the"
any time on its own account.'
"It was, as has been said, only about three years previously to this"
"visit that Hegel had passed away at Berlin, and one wonders whether"
"Ferrier first began to interest himself in his writings at this time,"
and whether he visited the graveyard near the city gate where Hegel
"lies, close to his great predecessor Fichte. One would almost think"
this last was so from the exact description given in his short
biography of Hegel; and it is significant that on his return he brought
with him a medallion and a photograph of the great philosopher. This
would seem to indicate that his thoughts were already tending in the
"direction of Hegelian metaphysics, but how far this was so we cannot"
tell. Certainly the knowledge of the German language acquired by
"Ferrier during this visit to the country proved most valuable to him,"
and enabled him to study its philosophy at a time when translations
"were practically non-existent, and few had learned to read it. That"
"knowledge must indeed have been tolerably complete, for in 1851, when"
Sir Edward Bulwer (afterwards Lord Lytton) was about to republish his
"translation of Schiller's Ballads, he corresponded with Ferrier"
"regarding the accuracy and exactness of his work. He afterwards, in the"
"preface to the volume, acknowledges the great services Ferrier had"
"rendered; and in dedicating the book to him, speaks of the debt of"
gratitude he owes to one whose 'critical judgment and skill in
detecting the finer shades of meaning in the original' had been so
"useful. Ferrier likewise has the credit, accorded him by De Quincey, of"
having corrected several errors in _all_ the English translations of
_Faust_ then extant--errors which were not merely literary
"inaccuracies, but which also detracted from the vital sense of the"
"original. As to Lord Lytton, Ferrier must at this time have been"
"interested in his writings; for in a letter to Miss Wilson, he advises"
her to read Bulwer's _Pilgrims of the Rhine_ if she wishes for a
"description of the scenery, and speaks of the high esteem with which he"
"There are distinct periods of good and bad luck in every man's life,"
"which may be felt in advance by one sensitive to occult influences,"
if one will but keep good watch on one's intuitions and leave them
"untrammelled by will or reason. At this time ""I felt it in my bones,"""
"as Betty would have said, that the day of our good luck was at hand."
"All conditions seemed to combine to our pleasure when, on a certain"
"bright spring morning, Betty, Frances, and I went down to the courtyard"
"of the Old Swan, where we found the coach, the horses, and even the"
drivers all glittering in the sunshine.
"There was ample room in the back seat of the coach for the three of us,"
"so Betty took one corner, Frances made herself comfortable in another,"
"and I took what was left, the pleasant place between them."
"After Betty had kissed her father at least a dozen times, and had shed a"
"few tears just to make her happiness complete, the driver cracked his"
"whip and away we went, out through the courtyard gate, down Gracious Hill"
and across London Bridge before a sleepy man could have winked his eyes.
"At first we thought we were in haste, but when we got out of Southwark"
"and into the country, the dark green grass, the flowering hedges, the"
"whispering leaves of the half-fledged trees, the violets by the roadside,"
"and the smiling sun in the blue above, all invited us to linger. So we"
"told the driver to slow his pace, and we lowered every window in the"
"coach, there being no one in the country whose wonder and envy we cared"
to arouse by a display of our glass.
There was not room in Betty's little heart for all the great flood of
"happiness that had poured into it, so presently, to give it vent, she"
"began to sing the little French lullaby we had so often heard, whereupon"
"Frances and I ceased listening to the birds, and I was more thoroughly"

"years after the crucifixion, and, as we have already seen, is now"
preserved in St. Peter's as one of its four chief relics. Guicciardini
"says of the death of Alexander VI.: ""All Rome ran with indescribable"
gladness to visit the corpse. Men could not satiate their eyes with
"feeding on the carcase of the serpent who, by his unbounded ambition"
"and pestiferous perfidy, by every demonstration of horrible cruelty,"
"monstrous lust and unheard-of avarice, selling without distinction"
"things sacred and profane, had filled the world with venom."""

"honors and promotions, to any cook, brewer, baker, vintner, physician,"
"grocer, surgeon, or others,' who would make away with Queen Elizabeth;"
and Pope Gregory XIII. offered a high place in heaven to any one who
"would murder the Prince of Orange; and the poor wretch, Balthazar"
built a sanctuary for the statue of Isis sent to him from Memphis by
Ptolemy Euergetes.[14] In token of his friendship Ptolemy Soter introduced
"his god Serapis into Athens, where the latter had a temple at the foot of"
"the Acropolis[15] ever after, and Arsinoë, his mother or wife, founded"
"another at Halicarnassus, about the year 307.[16] In this manner the"
political activity of the Egyptian dynasty was directed toward having the
"divinities, whose glory was in a certain measure connected with that of"
"their house, recognized everywhere. Through Apuleius we know that under the"
empire the priests of Isis mentioned the ruling sovereign first of all in
their prayers.[17] And this was simply an imitation of the grateful
devotion which their predecessors had felt toward the Ptolemies.
"Protected by the Egyptian squadrons, sailors and merchants propagated the"
"worship of Isis, the goddess of navigators, simultaneously on the coasts of"
"Syria, {80} Asia Minor and Greece, in the islands of the Archipelago,[18]"
"and as far as the Hellespont and Thrace.[19] At Delos, where the"
"inscriptions enable us to study this worship somewhat in detail, it was not"
"merely practised by strangers, but the very sacerdotal functions were"
performed by members of the Athenian aristocracy. A number of funereal
"bas-reliefs, in which the deified dead wears the _calathos_ of Serapis on"
"his head, prove the popularity of the belief in future life propagated by"
these mysteries. According to the Egyptian faith he was identified with the
god of the dead.[20]
Even after the splendor of the court of Alexandria had faded and vanished;
even after the wars against Mithridates and the growth of piracy had ruined
"the traffic of the Ægean Sea, the Alexandrian worship was too deeply rooted"
"in the soil of Greece to perish, although it became endangered in certain"
"seaports like Delos. Of all the gods of the Orient, Isis and Serapis were"
the only ones that retained a place among the great divinities of the
Hellenic world until the end of paganism.[21]
case excited the contempt alike of the man[1480] to whom the flattery
"was paid and of all posterity--a contempt which teaches, hardly less"
clearly than the indignation excited a century earlier by the supposed
"profanation of the mysteries, in what reverence and high esteem the"
idea of marriage between men and gods was generally held.
"Even Lucian, in whom reverence was a less pronounced characteristic"
"than humour, condemns seriously enough a parody of the mysteries"
of Eleusis which occurred in his own day; and his account of it at
the same time shows once more that the marriage of men and gods was
"the very essence of the mysteries. The impostor Alexander, he says,"
instituted rites with carrying of torches (δᾳδουχία) and exposition
of the sacred ceremonies (ἱεροφαντία) lasting for three days. “On
"the first there was a proclamation, as at Athens, as follows: ‘If"
"any atheist, Christian, or Epicurean hath come to spy upon the holy"
"rites, let him begone, and let the faithful be initiated with heaven’s"
blessing.’ Then first of all there was an expulsion of intruders.
"Alexander himself led the way, crying ‘Out with Christians,’ and the"
whole multitude shouted in answer ‘Out with Epicureans.’ Then was
"enacted the story of Leto in child-bed and the birth of Apollo, and his"
marriage with Coronis and the birth of Asclepius; and on the second day
the manifestation of Glycon and the god’s birth[1481]. And on the third
day was the wedding of Podalirius and Alexander’s mother; this was
"called the Torch-day, for torches were burnt. And finally there was the"
"love of Selene and Alexander, and the birth of his daughter now married"
to Rutilianus[1482]. Our Endymion-Alexander was now torch-bearer and
exponent of the rites. And he lay as it were sleeping in the view of
"all, and there came down to him from the roof--as it were Selene from"
"heaven--a certain Rutilia, a very beautiful woman, the wife of one of"
"Caesar’s household-officers, who was really in love with Alexander"
"and was loved by him, and she kissed the rascal’s eyes and embraced"
"him in the view of all, and, if there had not been so many torches,"
The Christian Faith in England is no longer hampered by certain
arbitrary axioms of the Puritan Divines. In the sixteenth century men
were almost compelled by the exigencies of the situation to discover
some Infallible authority which they could set up over against the
"Infallibility of the Church of Rome, and they endeavoured to treat"
Holy Scripture as though the great library of Jewish and Christian
writers contained a complete code of consistent legislation. A text
"was a convincing argument for the Divine right of Kings, or for"
"binding them in chains, for the burning of witches or the destruction"
"of a shrine, and although in the two following centuries the"
"Protestant ministers taught men to modify this conception, and to"
"realize the difference between the Old Testament and the New, the"
popular idea of Revelation allowed small scope for theological
inquiry. The biographies of our literary men of the Victorian period
have shown us how they were tempted to separate themselves from all
"public communion with the Church, by their misgiving that the Church"
was committed to an impossible position. Carlyle groaned for what he
"called an “exit from Houndsditch,” some deliverance from the Rabbinic"
"interpretation and use of the Bible. Things are very different to-day,"
as Henry Sidgwick says in a letter to Alfred Lord Tennyson published
"by his son in a recent memoir. “The years pass, the struggle with what"
"Carlyle used to call ‘Hebrew old clothes’ is over, Freedom is won.”"
And in the result a scientific criticism of the Old and New Testament
"is found to be compatible with, and often a compulsion to an"
"acceptance of the Christian creed, not the creed of Calvin, or the"
"Westminster Confession, but the reasoned statement of Nicæa. The"
student of physical science no longer believes that if he goes to
"church he must be taken to accept the cosmogony of Genesis, and on his"
side he no longer stumbles at the difficulty of miraculous events. He
knows too much about the influence of mind over matter to say that it
is impossible that Jesus Christ and His Apostles should have healed
the paralytic and made the blind to see and the deaf to hear. He is no
"Gulf of Florida. Tiring of this, Vane stole a vessel and ranged up and"
"down the coast from Florida to New York, taking ship after ship, until at"
last the Governor of South Carolina sent out a Colonel Rhet in an armed
"sloop to try and take him. On one occasion Vane met the famous Blackbeard,"
whom he saluted with his great guns loaded with shot. This compliment of
"one pirate chief to another was returned in like kind, and then ""mutual"
"civilities"" followed for several days between the two pirate captains and"
"their crews, these civilities taking the form of a glorious debauch in a"
quiet creek on the coast.
"Vane soon had a change of fortune, when, meeting with a French man-of-war,"
"he decided to decline an engagement and to seek safety in flight, greatly"
to the anger of his crew. For this he was obliged to stand the test of the
"vote of the whole crew, who passed a resolution against his honour and"
"dignity, and branded him a coward, deprived him of his command, and packed"
"him off with a few of his adherents in a small sloop. Vane, not"
"discouraged by this reverse of fortune, rose again from the bottom rung of"
"the ladder to success, and quickly increased in strength of ships and"
"crew, until one day, being overcome by a sudden tornado, he lost"
"everything but his life, being washed up on a small uninhabited island off"
the Honduras coast. Here he managed to support life by begging food from
the fishermen who occasionally came there in their canoes.
"At last a ship put in for water, commanded by one Captain Holford, who"
happened to be an old friend of Vane's. Vane naturally was pleased at this
"piece of good fortune, and asked his dear old friend to take him off the"
"island in his ship, to which Holford replied: ""Charles, I shan't trust you"
"aboard my ship, unless I carry you as a prisoner, for I shall have you"
"caballing with my men, knock me on the head, and run away with my ship"
"a-pirating."" No promises of good behaviour from Vane would prevail on his"
"friend to rescue him; in fact, Captain Holford's parting remark was that"
"he would be returning in a month, and that if he then found Vane still on"
"of the _Filosofia dello Spirito_, in which, under the title of _Teoria"
"e Storia della Storiografia_, he collected a number of essays written"
"between 1912 and 1913, containing an elaboration of the theory of"
history already expounded in the _Logica_. This volume does not form
"a new part of the system, but rather the natural conclusion of the"
"whole work, since the problem which it discusses is the one towards"
"which tended all his former inquiries into the forms of the spirit,"
"into their concrete life which is development and history, and the"
consciousness of which is historical thought. But before proceeding to
"analyze this final form of Croce's theory of history, we shall give a"
rapid account of the rest of his intellectual activity from 1910 onward.
"As during the preceding eight years, the _Critica_ continues to this"
"day to be the main organ of Croce's work and influence, and in the"
Critica the greatest part of his writings are still published for
the first time. The general features of the Critica have remained
"practically unchanged, except that his series of essays on the Italian"
literature of the last fifty years (which he collected in 1914-15 in
the four volumes of _La Letteratura della Nuova Italia_) has been
followed by studies on Italian historiography from the beginning of the
"nineteenth century to our day (since 1914), by essays on some of the"
"greatest European poets (since 1917), by notes on modern Italian and"
"foreign literature (since 1917), and by the Frammenti di Etica (since"
"1913), containing discussions of particular problems of contemporary"
morality. But practically all the reviews and essays published in
the Critica and elsewhere are now being collected in the edition of
"his complete works, of which a full list will be found at the end of"
"this volume. In 1912, for the inauguration of the Rice Institute in"
"Houston, Texas, he wrote his _Breviario di Estetica_, which we have"
"partly utilized in our exposition of his Ã¦sthetic doctrine, and which"
"he reprinted in 1920 in his _Nuovi Saggi di Estetica_, which also"
contains his most significant philosophical essays of the last four or
"No, I cannot leave the ruins."
But their revenge will be carried out.
The four pirates are condemned.
They will perish.
We will go to meet them!
You will be too late.
That doesn't matter.
We've finally got you.

"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
- Bite down.
- I think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
That was bizarre.
Emerson!
Yeah.
I thought you left me.
How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- We're fine.
We were ambushed.
- Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
I'll watch myself.
Just give me a chance to prove myself.
I'm different now.
Really.
I'm ready.
I can do this.
Okay.
That's the kind of confidence
We've been waiting to hear.
Yes.
Okay.
We will.
We'll give you a chance.
We're gonna start out with two weeks
And then we'll check in on you.
"And if that goes well, then we'll give you two months."
"And then if that goes well,"
- You'll be free.
"- Yeah, two weeks."
Yeah.
Okay.
So you can leave here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
"Listen, i really believe in you."
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
So go out there and make us all proud.
Make yourself proud.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
"Good luck, monica."
"Pull me up, please!"
- What a nice country road!
- Don't look down!
Hold on tight!
That's it!
That's it!
Now!
Like that!
Good!
A bit more!
Thank you.
"So, we've arrived."
"But I'm afraid, not where we were supposed to."
- According to the plan we should be...
- Let's check it out.
"- Come on, please!"
- My transmitter has disappeared!
What did you want to transmit anyway?
That we landed at the wrong place?
- That's all we know.
- Leave that to me.
What's this?
Against the cold.
- Maybe we pressed the wrong button.
- Why?
Did you press anything?
- No.
Emilia!
Katya!
I see flowers!
And bees!
I thought they only existed in fairy tales!
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
Where can I contact her?
Look.
If you continue to harass me.
I'll have to report it.
Where is she.
Damn it?
- You're going too far.
Tell me where she is!
- I don't know.
Because of you.
she's in the hands of a judge...
Yeah.
I know.
What do you know?
- The madam called you and complained.
Indeed.
Madame Zoe is threatening to sue us.
I don't give a damn.
Think of all the consequences.
You could be sued for...
Yeah.
Where's the girl?
The prostitute?
- Yes.
The prostitute.
Don't you know you're forbidden to even ask the question?
I don't care.
I love her.
You understand?
I'm your insurance company.
I speak in the name of the company.
OK.
- Where?
Where?
Whaddya have to do?
Don't you plug in the phone?
- Which part?
- I don't get it.
"What about that guy, Taka?"
We need to ask you something.
How d'ya get on the 'net with PlayStation2?
We can't?
!
But I heard you could.
Says we need an adapter...
But we don't have one!
Who does he think we are?
We ain't got one.
Have you?
Why the hell not?
That was no use.
We're back to square one.
Doesn't Taka have a computer?
"No, he just knows a lot."
Buys magazines then can't afford a computer.
What's up?
"That guy, Kanzaki!"
He'll have one.
That weirdo electrician?
He's not a weirdo!
"Who, who?"
My Dad told me.
So the weirdo's got a computer?
He's not weird.
How strange!
He still hasn't appeared.
Oh!
It fell apart!
"Oh, my god!"
This is Moriarty's doing.
There he is!
Hey!
Here we go!
You won't get away from me!
Wait!
Here they come!
What a fantastic engine I have stolen!
It works perfectly with my beloved 'Crow'!
Dirty rats!
Here we go!
"You, get out of my way."
How paltry!
Here we come!
"Stop that, stop that!"
You won't get away from me.
You coward.
"Oh, I'm coming apart!"
It seems that we're the last two planes left.
What?
!
Here I come!
"When it comes to technique, I can hold my own against anyone!"
Get down!
How swift he is!
"If that's how you're going to be, I'll just come to you."
"All right then, commence Mrs. Hudson's basket operations."

Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
Let's go.
"Marshal, please."
What kind of place is this?
This is a high class brothel.
A brothel?
What do you take me for?
The moral standard is down the drain...
What a lovely bottom!
What a surprise!
Take good care of him.
Marshal...
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's stay and check the place out.
There may be underage girls here.
Yes.
Let's have a toss.
Drink up.
Don't be shy.
What's wrong?
You're flushed.
What?
I just had a little drink.
But you just drank the soy sauce.
I want to investigate this girl.
Wait.
What's the matter?
Can I investigate your wife?
Do you know who I am?
- And do you know who I am?
- Who are you?
- Liang Foon of the Pochilam School.
- I've never heard your name.
"Yeah, sure."
"You cry, and it's all my fault."
I'm not crying.
You don't even want me to live here.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
Sure.
Why?
"- Why, why?"
"- Yes, why?"
- Why not?
- Why should you?
It'd be good.
We'd be together.
- But we're always arguing.
- That's not true.
Do you really like being with me?
"No, a big shiver!"
"Besides, it's starting to melt."
"- So, it's that urgent?"
- I already told you that.
What if Lella is delayed?
It would be a disaster.
Then let me handle this before it's too late.
Mother of God!
Actually...
I'm going to devour you!
- Just a moment...
let me get undressed.
- Hold still...
How long have you gone without?
Since I was born!
Where should I start?
All of them?
Are you still calm after hearing that?
You're so boring.
Hey!
Stop.
"Please, just stop..."
People die.
But it doesn't matter to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
- You're wrong!
Everything.
Yours to toy with.
Release it.
Open up.
Kill.
Everything.
Until everything disappears before your eyes.
"Hey, what's your problem?"
Don't defy me.
Your molecules shall scatter like sand.
What did you do?
God.
Devil.
Hero.
Monster.
What will you call me?
Finish him off!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash the power of the spirit which envelops the air!"
Analyze existence.
Release.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I got a good look."
"Yeah, yeah."
I got it.
"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."
The famine is on.
"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
"Come in, please."
I know you.
"No, I do not think so."
Yes.
"In the university, you helped me to put fiancee in a taxi, you were very amiable."
You decide to me very well.
Why have you come?
"I will see, I..."
-You want that I take a look at you?
truth?
-Yes.
I am very badly.
"Please,"
Get undressed.
-Also...?
-Yes.
Lie down.
tell me?
what happens to you?
"I have you feel nauseous, fatigue, lack of appetite."
We are going to auscultate the heart.
You seems to me a little excited.
This tightens much to me.?
It matters to him?
Please.
Thus I am more comfortable.
We see.
"Yes, very it is excited"
It excuses.
"Nowadays, the bra, they make them very small."
Thus it is well?
We are going to see where hurts to you.
You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"- That's what really scares you, isn't it?"
- Stop it.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going nowhere.
- Shut up!
Shut up.
Youshouldhavecalledmum.
She's all that's left.

"- No, no, no, no!"
Get out of my head!
You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.
You'll never see your mother again.
You're going nowhere.
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.
You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
You know that.
Do not want to get involved with them.
He lived for the club!
-And Died for him too!
-My Condolences.
Thank you.
My condolences.
He was a good man.
-I Can send flowers?
-Of Course.
Thank you.
My condolences again.
Let the memorial later if you want.
They will make a memorial at the club and want me to be there.
-You Can stay with Jimmy?
"No, you will not."
"You can be a cop, but you can not order me around."
We can have it.
Let's leave it.
Health then.
-It Was a beautiful funeral.
-Yup.
He was a very good people face.
"He was like a brother to me, you know?"
'You just said that.
"Yes, but he was there."
I do not sit and stare at someone kill my brother.
Raymond!
Free your mind.
Preserves you!
Sorry about that.
-Get It.
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.
Faster than schedule.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Finish it.
Finish what?
The joke.
"The will, adding me to the company."
He's been lying to both of us this entire time.
Who is that?
I don't want to sell this house.
Me neither.
"Wait, stop."
- What is it?
- Mm.
Oh.
I just thought we were good.
You're right.
It's too soon.
Sorry.
You should be.
For thinking I want some lame missionary position.
"There's just something about bedroom sex that's... so predictable, you know?"
"So... so ""old married couple."""
I'm just a girl who's more into... surprises.
You're right.
Beds are for sleeping.
We were married?
I had no idea.
Oh.
"Oh, don't stop."
Don't stop.
Don't move.
Shit.
Who is it?
Hope this isn't a bad time.
"The phone, Adriana."
"You need something, call."
But then I wouldn't get to see your beautiful face.
Come on.
"One, two, three!"
Wow.
That train is not moving very fast.
This window won't open.
That's why we need to get back in there.
Could pick up the pace.
You're not going fast enough.
I am too going fast enough.
No job is done until the paperwork is complete.
Stand by.
Where the hell is Rudy?
Okay.
"Oh, boy!"
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, wow..."
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal.
Wow.
You're making...
Come on.
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.
Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up.
Hand you the chocolates?
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.
How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate?
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
(Engine starts)
(Birds chirping)
"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
"Now, we are famed for our seafood."
You what?
See food?
What's 'see food'?
"Fruits de mer, sir - cockles, whelks, crabs, mussels..."
Them shiny pebbles?
"That's food, is it?"
"They are something of a delicacy, sir."
"Well, bung 'em in the bag."
And give me one of them pies with legs.
"No, no!"
Keep still!
"No, you're not even supposed to be in here."
Two points for straight in?
Wicked.
And one point if it goes in off the backboard.
Backboard?
Do you mean me?
What are we calling this game?
How about...
'Get the ball in the jug'?
Or 'Super juggy throw throw'?
Or...
Jugball?
"Yes, jugball!"
You're a genius!
We should play every day.
Make it company policy.
"Right, yeah!"
Brilliant.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
That would be brilliant.
What's it take to get a menu here?
"Okay, I'll handle it."
That's all right.
I'll handle it.
And ruin your popularity?
"You know what, why don't you guys just sneak out the back?"
What's going on with you two?
Hey!
How's it going?
Hey!
Front door.
Hi.
"Hey, guys."
How you guys doing?
"You like the food here, too?"
It's pretty awesome.
"Shut up, queer."
"Well, at least I don't shave my chest."
What'd you say?
"Luke, come on."
I just said you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.
"Do you want me to break you, Cohen?"
Hey!
No way.
Look who's back.
"You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile."
"Luke, don't!"
"What are you, like spokesperson for geeks of America or something?"
You know what I like about rich kids?
Nothing.
That was awesome!
You're late!
The last 15 minutes..
"I've been a fucking roller coaster of emotions, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I lit some of this.
"I fired on my nerves damn you, you know?"
And there you are.
It's okay.
You've just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, bring me some of this strong Russian shit, girls."
"Okay, now where is that ... pump?"
Where's that?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...?
Yeah?
"Fuck you, no!"
This is it.
"This is it, yeah."
Okay.
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, we gotta get this little fucker in there."
Whom I kidding with?
I'm not in condition to do this.
"I'm sorry, I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
What's wrong with his hand?
Who is he?
Is he a robot?
- There's no problem?
- No.
Where's my camera?
"Ali, where is it?"
I haven't seen it.
Look in the glove-box.
- Wait for me.
"- Farzad, put the bread there."
"Hello, engineer."
Hello.
"Farzad, wrap up the bread or it will dry out."
Would you like tea?
"Yes, thank you."
My colleagues are sleeping.
We'll have a walk and come back.
Off you go.
Which way's your school?
This way and that.
You have two schools then?
"No, there are two paths to school."
Where's the square?
This way.
You don't mind.
"Come this way, I'll get my camera."
What a handsome white village!
"Why is it called ""Black Valley""?"
The ancestors called it that.
"Can't you call it ""White Valley""?"
"No, we have to call it by its name."
It has to stay that way.
That's how it is.
"""When you're fahed ho be black..."
"Okay, guys, come on."
"Let's go, seriously."
We can do that later.
- You okay?
-Yeah.
(PANTING)
"Thank you, Peter."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Now we're even, stiff."
All right.
"Come on, let's go."
Before Jeanine realizes you're still alive.
"- No, no, no."
-What?
The box.
We have to get the box.
"What, are you kidding me?"
"Now's not the time for a souvenir, Tris."
"Four, you have to listen to me."
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is.
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.
We have to get it.
"Peter, is there another way into the lab?"
"I mean, I'd have to go into the control room to disable all the doors."
"Okay, good, then do that."
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
"You just chose our side, whether you meant to or not."
"If you wanna survive, make sure we do."
Let's go.
!
I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday.
She was thrilled.
Where'd you get the money?
It's all on me.
- But...
"- None of your business, Dorona."
I have the money and I want to do it.
But what'll I eat there?
You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about?
I want to try and find him.
Why?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Where to?
- Paris.
He wanted to come.
And you agreed?
What did he tell you?
"Nothing, I swear."
You have separate rooms.
- And he speaks fluent French.
- So do we.
"- Yeah, like morons."
- Is he going to be with us the whole time?
I'm going home.
Shai got you business class?
Why only you?
"Don't drink too much, your legs will swell."
- When will you tell me what you did?
- When will you tell me what you did?
- Are you starting again?
"So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved."
"And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty."
I did it.
- What?
- I did 'em all.
I did all the poops.
- Really?
"- Yeah, I did everyone of them."
"I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here."
- Dude!
- Jesus!
God!
"Why would you do that, dude?"
Because poop is funny.
I guess poop is very funny.
- Poop is funny.
- He pooped on the floor.
"You know what, well-played my man!"
Well-played!
I hate my life.
"Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again."
How is it on the rooftop?
Door is locked.
Hostage situation.
"Michael, do I wait for you?"
"Don't wait, I'll tell dad!"
"Just $20, 000 in such a high-class restaurant?"
"Well, it's high-class, so we use cards."
Where's the safe?
Open it!
Why would I have the key?
I wasn't okay until now but...
I'll feel better after I meet you.
Actually I'm going out to see my brother.
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.
He's invited influential people.
Fine send me the address.
I'll be there.
Okay I'll send it right now.

Make him flee?
Mr. Thakur wants to become the CP.
Tomorrow if people find out that... one of his inmates has escaped... then you can flush his chances of a promotion... down the drain.
Good.
What's on your mind?
Clear all the charges against Shiv... and set him free.
Once his connection's severed from you...
I'll cut his connection with life permanently.
Wow!
What an idea!
Great.
I'm the boss after all.
Free advice along with contract.
Fine.
I'll give Shiv clean chit and release him.
Good.
But don't mess up the contract.
He won't.
How can he?
When he kills Shiv I'll be with him.
Right Boss.
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Get out.
Go on.
Let's go.
Who are you?
Boss.
Dad our player's entered the field.
Yes.
Wow!
Male here.
I'm going up in the white building on the right.
"Gimlet, understood."
There you go!
Course Fixed...
Jin here.
The rockets on the intersection are deployed.
Ram here.
Sniper point secured.
Over.
You were fast Ram.
Finnish the preparations and stand by.
Yankee... can you give me position status?
The enemy is moving to the east.
You'll be able to see it when it goes out to the street.
You'll be able to shoot a hellfire?
As always...
Ok.
Wait for mi instructions.
"Male, how's going?"
Male here.
I'm moving.
Three drones on the air.
Understood.
"Jin, report status."
This is the last one.
"When this starts, they will fly to the objective."
Keep going.
Yankee.
Over.
Yankee here.
Drop the hellfire immediately.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
No.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
Yeah.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
He doesn't belong to any gang.
"- You'll be my slave, then."
- Are you a Traoré?
"If I had known,"
I'd have carried the two sacks on my head.
"Traoré, do you have a new slave?"
Rather he has a new master.
All right.
I'll pay you tomorrow in front of the factory.
Ok.
See you!
"Don't go yet, little slave!"
Come with me to the Bozola Co-op.
The sale is over.
Impossible!
We need rice!
There's no more left...
No more for sale.
That's the last sack.
We're out of stock.
We're out of rice.
"Balla, let's go back!"
Come!
Boss!
"Don't call me boss, call me Balla Traoré."
I wanted a leave permit.
Did you get someone to replace you?
Then tell your boss that I sent you.
"Traoré, the boss is looking for you."
I'm going to get my rice.
That's your problem.
Get to work.
You screwed up with that part.
I came all the way here to make a deal.
Jumong?
I might be in hiding but I still know what's going on.
Jumong can't leave Jolbon because of the blockade.
Why would he come here?
We have our reasons.
Daesan.
Yes?
Bring me a big jar of wine.
"Yes, sir."
Let's see if you are who you claim to be.
Drink this.
Drink up!
Tie him to that tree.
"Yes, sir."
I heard Jumong is a master archer.
Shoot that target next to him.
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up!
I don't like playing games.
"If you don't believe me, just kill me instead."
"If you're going to die anyway, shouldn't you die trying?"
I'll let you live if you hit the target.
Commander!
Shoot.
You must be Okjuh soldiers.
Kill them!
Why won't you believe us?
This is Commander Jumong!
- He is!
- Shut up!
It's the army!
How many?
- One.
- Three were pronounced on the scene.
"- Luka, let me take this."
"- It's okay, I got it."
"Officer, make sure these cars don't block that entrance."
"- Breathe for us, Trina."
- Tracheal shift.
Hold up.
Her lung is down.
"- Sats, only 88."
"- Miss, can you describe who did this?"
- Decreased on the right.
- Needle her.
- Want me to do it?
"- No, 18 gauge."
How many were there?
"You' re gonna get your ID as soon as she's stable, I promise."
She's not moving air.
No pulse.
Try the other side.
"- No, pull the dressing off."
- What?
"The dressing on the chest wound, pull it off."
"- Okay, pulse is stronger."
- Good chest excursions.
"All right, let's get her inside."
Luka?
Just need a minute.
"Dr. Lewis, patron saint of lost causes."
- GSW to head and chest.
- Tension pneumo.
Now I understand why that ACP let me go.
So that the Boss can kill you?
So what are you waiting for?
Come on kill me.
Not even your father...
Don't speak about my father!
Because I can endure anything.
But I can never endure anyone abusing my father.
'I can endure anything.'
'But if anyone abuses my father.'
'I cannot endure that.'
Brother!
I'm your brother.
I want to hug you bro.
But... the rascal on the left keeping an eye on us.
Look.
Dad.
The Boss has Shiv in his grip.
Yes.
He's too good.
Now play along with me.
But I can't act.
That's the problem with you new-comers.
That's why I've come prepared.
Look.
Take a good look.
Look.
- This is the lion's paw.
- Yes.
If that's a paw... then I have a strong hand.
And when I pound someone with this... he never gets up again.
Strong arm!
Fine.
It's very viscous.
It's a...
Cab-Merlot blend.
"Okay, okay, okay."
"Bob, do you know what the wine is?"
It is a blend.
But it's a blend of spit.
Because it's from the spit bucket!
What?
He's right.
Bobby wins.
What?
!
"You drank spit, Rick."
You drank a lot of it.
What?
You poured that from the spit bucket?
Why did you do that?
Because I knew Bob would know what it was.
Why would Bob know that?
"Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did."
That's disgusting.
And that's how you win a wine-off.
Ah!
Wine fight!
"No, no, no."
Not the jacket.
"Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere."
That's for lying on your profile.
I'm sorry.
"Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and..."
But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about.
What for?
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you live different.
That's true.
But I've also lived like you.
I also wrote in my diary.
Do you still have it?
I've lost it.
But do you remember the things you wrote?
Some of them.
Tell me.
See how one can't tell a thing about that?
It must've been too boring.
Why?
I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me.
For example:
"""I woke up at 8."
"It was cold."""
The bed was warm.
"""I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast."""
Things like that.
I've dreamt about dogs.
-With dogs?
Yes.
That happened very often.
I saw a square full of dogs.
"They moved, sniffed around..."
There wasn't any people.
Only dogs!
"And sometimes, me."
Every bit of it has been skewed and twisted.
It's Crystal.
She's the one who's done this.
It has to be her.
Hi-yah!
Come on!
Yah!
Hi-yah!
"- That's it, that's all of 'em."
- Close the gate.
"All right, you two, you're finished here."
"It doesn't have to be like this, Matt."
But you don't get to decide that.
I don't want you near those horses again.
Same goes for Will Vernon.
You tell him that.
Let's go.
"We can't let this happen, Ty."
All those beautiful horses.
He's gonna send them to auction.
He's gonna let them die.
"Okay. don't worry about it, all right?"
"We'll figure this out, just one step at a time."
"Amy, look."
At least he's still free.
This isn't over yet.
It's just beginning.

Hmm?

Or is he there?
That'd be smart.
I'd like to meet him.
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now.

He's been dead for a year.
I need the girl.
What girl?
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.
There's no girl here.
I know you went to the motel.
I was called there.
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.
Just the woman.
Such as she was.
you saw Gabriela.
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.

I think he means this five-sided witchy-shaped thing here.
"Oh yeah, it is a pentagram."

Maybe we should wait outside.

"- Jim, Butch, Mac, where you going?"
- Get out of here.
- Get out or we'll give it to you too.
- What are you trying to do?
Go to the pen?
You can't get away with this.
Go back there and put out that fire.
- We're gonna finish the job.
- You're playing into Thompson's hands.
- He'll hang you for this.
- Thompson's dead.
Thompson's dead?
"- Yeah, we took care of him."
"- Listen, kids, you gotta stop where you are."
Whatever you do will be another rap to beat.
I wouldn't give you a bum steer.
I'm in as bad a fix as you are.
- You think I ran out on you?
I didn't.
"- Sure, you ran out."
You ran.
Go on.
I didn't.
I meant to come back the day after I left.
I got into a fight and shot a rat.
I think I killed him.
I'm on the lam now.
"If they get me, it may mean the chair."
- What do you get for--?
- Shut up?
How long you been waiting to say that to me?
You two.
I need an explanation that doesn't involve my dad coming back from the dead.
_
_
_
What is that?
What language is that?
What are you saying?
!
Don't even bother.
It's some twin thing.
"It freaks me out, too."
[Stammering] That's what freaks you out?
!
"Hey, get your panties out of a twist, take a deep breath, and admit you know who I am, kiddo!"
- Don't call me that!
- Don't call me that!
"Now, you hate being called kiddo 'cause you're a grown man."
You took care of the family when I wasn't around.
"That's right, isn't it, kiddo?"
It's a mind-bender.
I know.
Imagine how I felt.
No.
No.
- Don't backslide.
Stay with it.
"- No, no, no, no!"
I know this is a lot to take in.
No.
My horse!
Why did you let the general escape?
"Go, look for him!"
"Don't move, your Highness."
It's me.
Henry from Bavorov.
"Oh, dear God."
Thank you.
"If we survive, I'll fulfil your every wish."
"Come, your Highness, down to the water."
"Bring back the general, dead or alive!"
"Too late, soldier."
"No, just a few more steps!"
Get to the water!
We must cross that mountain.
- It's a precipice!
"- Jump, don't be afraid."
Now he's trapped!
We'll drown!
"Please jump, your Highness!"
Now!
The devil took them.
"Look, aren't they beautiful?"
!
The finest in the world!
You can't eat toadstools.
Show me what you picked.
"All these, look, all beautiful..."
The red ones are poisonous!
Pick only the boletus!
So they're all ugly and poisonous and that's a red one too.
"No, that's an orange-cap, a good one."
I have to get him.
I have to get him.
- No!
Let me go!
I have to get him!
I'll drag him down to hell with me!
I'll drag him down to hell with drums and trumpets!
"The world can go to the dogs, every single man and woman!"
We're all going to hell with drums and trumpets!
You can't go out there!
We're all going to hell!
You're coming to the station.
You're Biberkopf!
We're all going to hell!
Don't ever come back here again!
REWARD!
MURDER IN FREIENWALDE
"Listen, wanna make some money?"
A pile of dough.
- How?
See what it says?
"""Blond hair."""
Still don't get it?
Sure.
But won't that get you in trouble?
Nah.
You just say you saw them together in the car.
Near my place around 9:00.
"No, make it 11:00."
COURT OF JUSTICE
Fifteen years' prison for Reinhold.
Pretty stiff.
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
"Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay."
"Oh, a survivor."
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
"Well, we have ways of making you talk."
Where are your rebel friends now?
"Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!"
All right!
Are you all right?
"I'm proud of you, Sheriff."
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door.
It's open!
We're free!
"Woody, we don't know what's out there!"
I'll tell you wha...
"They're gonna eat us, Buzz!"
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working.
I recharged it before I left.
It should be good for...
You idiot!
You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
-Get away!
Move it!
He's hypoxic.
"All right, let's move!"
- Clear the blades and we'll shock him.
- Where's the crash cart?
"- All right, the paddles."
- We just landed at County General.
- The doctors are taking out paddles.
- Charging!
- Clear!
- One hundred!
Several doctors are trying desperately to revive Ben Larkin.
- One-fifty.
- Clear!
- So far their efforts are failing.
-0.4 epi.
- Charging 200.
- Clear.
- Will he make it?
- Shock him again!
One more time.
- Charging 200.
- Back.
- Let's get him inside.
We'll try it again.
- Are we gonna lose him?
- Got warming blankets?
- We're all set.
Damn.
"We'll shock him again, then we'll try rapid rewarming."
- Get that gurney out of there!
- That little girl?
One breakfast like this could end all the day worries.
What an easy remedy.
As simple as making it everyday.
You'll have to come and make it.
I'll do it for a reasonable price.
Where will you say you stayed the night?
What is the matter?
Will you lie?
Nobody will ask me.
Where did you meet mom?
At college.
And had you met other girls before?
Yes.
Specially one.
What was her name?
Why do you care?
"Come on, tell me."
If you tell me about your writings.
That's blackmail.
Then I'm not telling you her name.
Her name was Amelia.
Was she pretty?
No.
"But she told me that she liked me, and that she was feeling good with me."
Are you and mom still arguing?
Much less now.
Poor Clara...
"Why do you say ""poor Clara""?"
-It's just a manner of speaking.
She says the same about you.
Is that right?
You're sad.
"Please, let me go!"
I can't stay here.
They told me to stick with him at all times!
Who?
The president of Yong Moon Plan...
I have to listen to him!
"Please, let me..."
You have to hide out somewhere that no one can find you!
"What bastard, in his right mind, stays home after stabbing a man?"
This is his house.
Stay here until things quiet down.
You...
- You can't call my mom.
- I don't even know her number.
I only stabbed him once...
Only once.
Do you think he died?
"What do I do now, Han Gyul?"
"Hey, how long will he be here?"
Suck it up...
You little...
Your phone.
You better never record me again.
Your voice recorder.
I gave that to the police at the station...
"Oh, is this it?"
The three million won you owe me?
Yes.
"Since you paid me back, aren't we done talking?"
Representative...
I'm a little scared.
Of what?
Better come with me.
Did everything go alright?
Not now.
"Hi, Kelly."
"My regular, Willy."
Right.
"Two more beers, Willy."
Yeah.
Can I buy you a drink?
I got one.
"Hi, buddy, what'll you have?"
"This is for hers, and I'll have a cognac."
Thanks.
You just get off the boat?
"Yes, how did you know?"
It shows all over.
Where are you from?
France.
Hm... where did you learn to speak English so good?
I studied at a great school in Oxford.
Oxford...
I oughta go there.
They'd be more likely to study you there.
Are you being insulting?
"No, I just meant that you'd make a fascinating course in anatomy."
Thanks.
How come you just get off the boat and head straight for a bar?
Looking for company.
"Hm, what sort of company?"
Your sort.
How do you know what my sort is?
"Well, you're not a school teacher."
So you didn't do anything to those women?
No.
Then where did you go every night?
- My part time job.
- Job?
Part-time?
So you bought meat with that money?
Yeah!
So why did you bring that dog here?
It's only skin and bones.
Not even worthy to eat.
Big trouble!
Big trouble!
Come out!
Your daughter and Mr. Hong...
Mr. Hong kidnapped your daughter!
Come out!
What?
I came here to take the plates back.
Hold on tight!
Stop the car!
Hey!
Stop the car!
Get closer!
"This motorcycle is so slow, what's wrong with it?"
Pull me up!
That damn bastard!
Is everyone still on?
"Dad, over there!"
I wasn't planning on killing you.
But you're just like the other bitches.
All hookers like you playing with all kinds of men have to die.
This is just fine.
Thank you very much.
No.
Thank you very much.
You've made me very happy.
"Very, very happy."
Where's Clark?
"He's talking to Grandma, sitting on the bench."
I saw them shake hands.
I feel as though I saw something very nice.
That's wonderful!
And the boy a rose did see
"The tone, it's all fixed!"
Didn't I tell you that I'd absolutely fix it?
How about that?
Let's sing!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field
Bravo!
You sound like angels.
This was amazing.
Is this Uncle's room?
This is your bed.
"Oh, my God."
Okay?
Okay.
Not bad!
"Ham and cheese, chicken, or egg and cress."
Egg and cress...
Isn't life wonderful?
You looking?
I don't... what?
"Few scars, few marks..."
What do you think of them?
I think they're horrible.
"At least I got 'em, mate."
Cos I fucking wear 'em.
Right...
How about you?
Do you... have any marks?
- No.
I'm fine.
"- Oh, yeah, course you are..."
You're fine and dandy.
Right?
Egg and cress...
It's a little fucking miracle.
18 years old.
The age of opportunity.
I bet you can't wait to come here!
"Imagine it... being able to live away from your parents and you can do anything you like, like stay up all night and eat ice cream!"
Derek.
"Thanks, Polly."
So.
"New home, new friends, new horizons."
"The good times, the bad times..."
The parties...
"oh, my God, the parties!"
"The loves that will never be, even though they seem so right."
Where's your friend?
-Ariving.
Your cop friends?
Around are.
Are they here?
Just me now.
You and that fucking gun who do not know how to use it.
What happened Luu?
Dead.
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
"This is a big problem for your friend, you know that?"
I do not think so.
Do not you know?
What the fuck do you want?
You and that stupid gun.
I saw how much you're handy with miracle.
-Sit down.
Have a seat.
Sit down or I'll kill you.
"Listen, man."
Why is a nice guy like you hanging out with a guy like Andes?
He kills people.
You kill people.
"Deserve it, your wife and child."
You mistake me understand.
It was an accident.
-Accident?
People have to come to me with a certain respect.
Some things can not tolerate.
"When someone accuses me of something,"
I take that as an insult.
I swear.
- All right.
I'm looking forward to it.
"All right, I got news."
You ready?
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
"- Oh, yeah, I knew."
- You knew?
How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?
- So is he okay?
"- Oh, yeah, he's fine."
"He was in bad shape for a while, though."
Really?
How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?
"No, he was on his regular bed."
So why didn't you tell me?
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?
It's not like you're my wife.
I still think you should've told me.
You were better off not knowing.
It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this.
I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I'm gonna talk to him about this.
That's right.
You let him have it.
Who is he not to tell you about his life- threatening illness?
"Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you."
You made me nervous.
"You look like shit, acting all crazy."
What's up with you?
Nothing is up with me.
"It was an accident and I am the one who gotta live with it, not you."
"You ain't hearing me, man."
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Hey!
"Howdy, partner."
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.
- What about?
"- I don't know, but it seemed important."
"Well, he's gonna have to wait."
It's Miller time.
We need to talk.
Follow me.
Come on!
Another Bourbon.
Make it double.
You shooting coke or something?
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.
How about abnormally?
I see Reynolds is back to work.
Gets to make bail.
"I mean, why am I lying to my husband about whether or not I put gas in the car?"
It was stupid.
And we each thought the truth would destroy the other person.
Funny how that happens.
But we all want to have sex with someone new.
"It's risky, it's exciting, and that's okay."
But divorce over that?
I would never leave my husband for a better orgasm.
"Thank you, honey."
Do we have to do it in here?
"There's a private office downstairs, I think."
Mmm.
"Oh, God."
Hold that thought.
Hang on.
_
Is everything okay?
"Let me get you another drink, okay?"
There's no need to rush.
We're here to take our time.
You want me to wait?
You know what happens to those that wait.
Good things.
They come.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, excuse me."
"Neil, there you are."
What's wrong?
Adriana's done a very bad thing.
I don't know if I can fix it.
What the hell?
"- Oh, no."
Sent it already.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Damn it.
You shook her hand once.
Now you're all messed up inside.
That's the bravest you've been in 7 years.
The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade.
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Lord
Hold on.
"I have another deadline on Wednesday, right?"
Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind.
I should have fixed the nail.
Shit!
I'm lying down but can't sleep.
Her nail is still broken.
Forget it.
No one will see it.
"But if you can see it, someone else might too!"
How could you send such crappy work like that?
Shit her nail is broken.
"If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep."
"If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard."
But her nail is broken.
- Yeah.
- Jacob.
I heard you were leaving.
- Can you give me one last blessing?
- Sure.
May the force be with you.
That... that's it?
"Yeah, I'm afraid so."
"For more details, see your local priest or rabbi."
Take care.
"- So, you all good?"
"- Yeah, I'm good."
"- Good, good..."
- More or less.
"Just, um..."
"I mean, you know, crazy as it sounds, I-I miss God."
"Well, if it's of any comfort,"
I'm sure God would be thrilled at your recovery.
Really?
How do you figure?
'Cause you serve God's neediest people by making tons of money and giving it away.
- God loves charity.
- All right.
"If you wandered the world with a begging bowl, who would that help?"
- Absolutely no one.
- Nobody.
"In fact, it'd be a sin."
"So go forth, continue to do God's work."
- All right.
Golf next week.
- Done.
"So, uh, is there anybody home?"
Because I told you to.
You get up so early.
I have to stop that.
I really shouldn't walk around here like this.
I can't find that red blouse that you bought me. I wanted to wear it.
- The one time I need tape.
- l put it in the wash.
There is tape.
It's in the drawer like always.
- l wanted to wear it.
"- We'll put it in the dryer, sweetie."
"- Oh, my God."
- [Lily] What?
They're pink.
Those were in the washer?
- Yeah. I put them in last night.
"- Oh, my God."
I don't think you're supposed to mix colors and khaki stuff.
Are you?
How do I make them not pink?
I don't think you can.
- Sorry.
"- l think they're cool, actually."
- You don't have to wear them.
- Why did you put them in?
I think Atlantor would appreciate seeing a different side of Rick.
The pinker side.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I'm out of here.
I hope not in those pants.
- Fade-away jump!
- Jess.
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
I'd rather make sure the kids are tucked in.
They might have a nightmare and throw the covers off they could get a sore throat.
Wait.
"Give them something, Bruno."
Here...
Is all I have.
"Your wallet, Bruno!"
You punk.
Dirty little bastard!
Whas with this chick?
Just spreads her legs and stares at the ceiling...
Son of a bitch!
What are you complaining about?
"You got off, didn't you?"
Like screwing a piece of meat.
Get up now.
He needs to rest.
Look at this dumb chick!
No panties!
Hurry up.
I'd like to go now...
Don't you like panties?
You going to answer me or not?
Look what your friend did to me.
You should take it easy.
What if I can't get it up again?
"Look, you bitch!"
You're going to be all right...
Is not my fault!
I didn't shoot you!
I don't give a shit about his car.
He your boyfriend?
Just say what you want.
You have to speak up.
How else can I understand you?
Why are you so distant suddenly?
I just want to freshen up my head a bit.
"Oh, that's it."
"Well, sir, you should do what you prefer."
"When things become clear to me, I'll call you."
It will become clear for sure.
I'll talk to you then.
"I'll express myself not with words, but with action and time."
What's the date today?
Ah!
You're here!
Have some coffee.
It's better than I'd expected.
Have some potatoes.
"Coffee, no thanks."
"Ah, yes."
I'll have some coke.
"- Okay, do you have change?"
"- Yeah, I've got some."
- Changwook!
- Be careful.
"- Shall we go, Director Kim?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
- Lovely.
What's gotten into you?
Two days later
"Help me, please."
The phone has been turned off.
It has been a while.
I'm coming in to take a look.
Are you used to this place?
You are not eating?
"Then I will stop bringing it to you, since it's a waste of food to feed you."
Cat...
Oh right...
"Oh my, you ate it all of a sudden."
You irritate me.
Eat more...
"Cat, cat..."
"Good, good."
Eat more if you like it.
"Good, good."
You are a good boy.
Good boy.
Don't make any noise.
Father has been obsessed with you lately.
How pitiful...
"Cat, cat, you are a good boy living by his whims."
Yoshikuni.
F-Father?
You... when did you...
You are just a commoner.
"Know your place, you filthy beast!"
"You are unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable!"
Unforgivable!
What is this you bastard!
You are just a lowly beast!
Run.
You must go to the world outside.
Cat... cat... run...
"No disturbance, that's an order."
Yan-ling!
Jun-kit!
What happened?
Fung-wu!
Stop!
What's this all about?
They won't let Yan-ling see you.
You must have provoked them!
No!
He said there can be no disturbing the chess game.
Is it true?
It's the Highness's order.
No disturbance from anybody.
Please go to Mr. Chao!
And you two better leave.
You better go back!
Fung-wu!
"Go back, don't cause any trouble!"
Let's go!
I feel something odd will happen tonight.
Now why is chess so mysterious?
It's a game.
You go on ahead.
I'll keep watch here.
Make sure you don't fight!
I won't!
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
I want to acquire the mystery of Shaolin kung-fu.
I'm a sincere Buddhist.
What's wrong with accepting me?
Please calm down!
- It was like a blow to me when he passed away.
"- Yeah, it was sudden."
It was
- It was terrible.
I never felt that way before.
He always used to say to me...
"""You know, Claire... if it won't be you, it'll never be anybody else."""
- What does that mean?
- He wanted me to marry him.
- Did he ask you?
- Sure.
- So why didn't you?
- So I said I wasn't ready to -
- I wasn't ready to get married.
- What are you waiting for?
I wasn't ready
- It is a lot of things you have to do when you get married.
Like what?
What did you have to do?
Inviting the people.
There's a lot of work involved.
Yeah.
Sure.
I would have helped you.
Max was a wonderful man.
"- He was never married, was he?"
- No.
- I know that.
- No.
- So you would have been his first wife -
- And again he said to me -
"He always said to me, ""Claire, if it won't be you... it'll never be anybody else."""
- Yachting.
"- Ah, good shite."
Would you look at that fucking eejit?
Can you not just say eejit?
That's what I did say.
Where are you going?
- Toilet.
"- Jesus, again?"
Me uterus is pressing into me bladder.
"Ah, now stop that, Sharon!"
I don't want to hear that sort of thing!
It's not right.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Where's the remote?
Da?
"No, you can't have a bike."
"It's not his birthday for ages yet, is it?"
"Oh, Jesus."
"There's nothing on the telly tonight, is there?"
There's never anything on.
"Oh, you're right, of course... but there's absolutely nothing on tonight, is there?"
I suppose a ride is out of the question?
Hang on till I get this line done.
You serious?
I suppose so.
Fucking great.
You're not messing now?
No.
Just let me finish the next line.
I'll go up and brush me teeth.
That'll be nice.
Together!
Yeah!
"-Yeah, that's the most, yeah."
-The Nike shop?
Louis...
-...shall we go in here?
"-Zayn, shall we go in here?"
"-Oh, my God!"
-Think a few fans have just spotted us.
probably tweeted.
"relax, everybody."
Come on.
will you all calm down now?
There you have it.
This is what happens.
Step back.
"Step back, please."
One Direction!
One Direction!
One Direction!
"We don't come out that often so we don't really see, Iike, this sort of side of it that often."
"So when we do, it's all a bit strange."
-I Iove you!
-Some girl was just trying to literally grab my ear.
"I think she wanted to keep it, but I was like:"
"""That's mine, love, you can't have that, unfortunately."
"It's connected."""
"Let's go, go, go."
Where'd the glasses come from today?
Somebody chucked them on stage.
I put them on.
These are sick.
I don't want to hear about it.
Just do it.
"It takes the brain of, like-- right."
I don't want to waste my 160 IQ on this particular problem.
You probably have a genius.
"Solve it, please."
Or I'll just go back there. [inaudible].
I'm not gonna have women and babies
"Walking through the-- you know, falling down on you guys."
I'll go back there.
I'll stay there.
You guys run it.
I'll handle it.
INTERVIEWER:
Do you think we should have some people
Just walk up the steps?
--[laughs] Just to piss Lloyd off?
INTERVIEWER:
Yes.
"Oh, yeah."
You missed the big explosion this morning.
"He-- no, I'm just kidding."
I'm making this all up.
"Like, I don't even want to start any rumors."
INTERVIEWER:
"Oh, no, no, no. [laughs]"
Oh.
[Laughs] You missed it.
[Chatter]
"Those are the brakes, right?"
But here we go-- the signs.
This is no entry.
One more time.
"Okay, on this part ?"
"It's like we're battling, right ?"
It's like a challenge.
"When I step forward like this, you have to challenge me back into my space, and I challenge you back in your space, like this."
"So, it's back, front, back, front, back, front, like that, that kinda feel."
"Step, back, forth, back."
"Wait, wait."
You're making me dizzy.
"Stop, stop."
"Sit on it, sit on it."
Stick your ass out.
- Do it.
- [ Both Laugh ]
"Okay, okay."
How am I doing ?
How's my butt ?
"[ Chuckles ] lt's nice. I mean, it's good."
Thank you.
[Sara] You made that ?
It's really nice.
It's Tanisha's.
That girl's gonna pay my way through design school.
What about your mom ?
Where is she ?
She was in jail...
for drugs.
For things women do for drugs.
She got out and took off.
"Well, maybe she'll come back."
"That is what Derek used to say when we were little, when Momma Dean used to piss us off."
But he grew up.
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan B.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do one very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
(distorted) Lydia!
a project by @olivethewenno enjoy watching
"Is that you, Ines?"
I said...
Don't play with fire!
You'll get burned!
It doesn't hurt?
It won't hurt me?
"Oh God, my dear!"
Who did it?
What happened?
50 hours in surgical room.
That's crazy.
Even for you.
Do you think he will forgive me?
He will.
But I won't.
Is it time to get him?
For me?
What do you mean?
"A week with you, in 10 years of our marriage!"
- Anais...
- That's all I get.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
The powder Mulan gave us...
we need to use it.
We gotta knock him out.
"Well, that's riskier."
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
Who's Milah on the tattoo?
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was once.
I got doughnuts.
I got jelly.
(Chuckles)
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix... this high-end jewelry place.
The manager was a drunk.
She's still extremely beautiful.
Cheers!
Cheers.
"Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?"
You knew.
I didn't know.
I didn't know you were that Jacob.
- I don't believe that.
- Well I can't change anything now.
What do you want?
- The honest or the official answer?
- I'd like the honest answer.
I'm just a good person.
There's not much in this.
We better complain.
- I don't need any more.
- We need another bottle.
It's the best way to get to know people.
Another bottle.
- I don't think that would be wise.
- You're not paid to think.
Either bring another bottle or bring your boss.
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?
- I need to go.
- Why?
We'd like another drink.
- What's the problem?
- We need a bottle of schnapps.
We can't serve you when you're so drunk.
So drunk?
I've only just gotten started.
- See?
- Oh...
That's... clap!
"One, two, three, four, five battle."
Alright tardy cake!
"- No, you're first!"
- You are... no.
You do this and...
Hey!
Look who's here?
We just saw your stupid little girl friend.
Had to tell about herself.
You should see her face.
Just this mornin' we got to whack a couple of clowns.
"Yea, we took our time doin' it too."
Your stupid little girlfriend looks scared than both those faggots put together.
Even when things are getting up before them.
Step aside jail-bait!
Or don't!
If you wanna be a tough guy and see what happens to you.
"Do it, do what they say, Daisy."
Can I ask you fellas something?
"- Nah, forget it."
- Come on.
Excuse me?
Please.
- Everybody!
- Please.
Very good!
But I won't get into it until you holster the hardware!
- Why would we do that?
- So you don't get tired.
"- Relax, man!"
"Gary, Gary, can we please just get out of here?"
Please?
What the hell?
Sorry I lost my temper back there.
"No, it's okay."
You were just defending my honor.
I don't feel so good.
Get you a glass of water.
"I know people say you're a jerk, but... they just don't know the real you."
I'm just gonna put this here.
You're gonna need that.
And a truckload of aspirin.
Get some sleep.
Hello?
So this barbecue on Saturday...
- Yes?
- I was just wondering if there was gonna be a smoked brisket involved.
Wait.
So you'll come based on the meat?
Yes.
"Yes, that's the deciding factor."
Done.
So what's up for tonight?
Not much.
Just a quiet evening at home.
You?
Not a lot... just getting my daily dose of jazz.
You hear it?
Love that one.
Crank it up.
You've got something right here on your...

Your offer is rejected.
"You can't do this, rennes."
"As a member of high council,"
I invoke the rule of seven.
That is your prerogative.
You are free to go.
What's going on?
You said you gambled and lost.
True.
His offer of trade was rejected.
"Under an ancient rule,"
Your father has substituted his life for yours.
Go.

Don't tell father I'm here.
Go.
Why?
You got me exempted from all the charges and set me free.
Maybe father will be pleased upon hearing this... and might forget the...
"I'm taking this, okay?"
Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?
The paw.
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
"Ma, it's a sin to leave it there."
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
"I get a nice one almost every night, Ma."
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.
I settle down almost every night.
But then in the morning I'm free.
I love you!
I want to be with you.
Why don't you settle down?
"How's your friend, Henry?"
What's the matter?
You don't talk too much.
Talk.
What are you quiet for?
"You don't eat much, you don't talk much."
-l'm just listening.
"-What's the matter, something wrong with you?"
"When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other."
There was this man.
He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
A nice profit they'll make.
"America will fight, you'll see."
They'll fight.
Fight to the last Englishman.
Last Welshman too.
"They're all right when it comes to talking war, when do they start fighting it?"
What about right now?
You sound like a bloody Yank yourself.
"Stop it, stop it, all of you!"
"And what's going on in here, may I ask?"
You horrible little man!
You're all in close arrest.
Sergeant.
"Left, right, left, right, left, right, march."
Halt!
Next lad.
Quick march!
"Left, right, left, right..."
Next man take your place.
Anybody got a razor blade?
What do you want it for?
Think he's going to cut his throat?
"I like, Private Dawes."
You're lucky to get busted.
"Look at that bloke, Hitler."
He was a corporal ain't doing him much good.
You've got something there.
"Is that correct, McKendrick?"
"No, Sir."
I started it.
Anything to add?
"No, Sir."
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes, mom."
We're all over it.
Watch your step out there.
"Yeah, you too, Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.
He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
Tell me that you're still at the park.
"Oh, yeah, I am, but Petty's not."
Stay there.
He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me, do not move."
Petty.
You know me?
A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.
It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well, transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
Shh.
Drop the knife.
"Get on the ground, face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
Okay.
"Al this hour, we'd have to add the daytime fee, too."
What do you mean?
If checking in before 11 PM we charge both the daytime and overnight fee.
What a rip off.
What're you doing?
It's my first bed in so long!
Feels nice and soft.
You stink.
I haven't bathed in over a week.
Huh?
Are you homeless or something?
"When I have money, I get a room."
When you don't?
Shall I pay first?
"It's okay, you already paid for food and hotel."
But that doesn't include sex.
Are you a saint?
Most guys usually expect sex.
"One time, a guy expected sex for buying me lunch."
Bunch of assholes.
"Right, bunch of assholes."
"Anyway, you should take a bath."
Okay.
"Wow, a jacuzzi!"
Hello?
How is it?
Nabbed a high schooler.
Underage fetches top money.
Make her fall for you.
"Leave it to me, I'll reel her in."
You better.
- Passports.
I left my jacket.
What did you say about passports?
- I had the jacket when I was at the table.
Did you leave passports there?
"I'm sorry, sire."
We left the passports.
- Thing?
"Christ, you will know now that we have lied."
You've been drinking all night.
- We have to get out of this way
And leave the Balkans.
Believe me when I say
"That it is best not to make him piss, that guy."
I can assure you that there will be heels.
"So, are we now pursued by a crazy Turkish and a crazy Serbian?"
The quickest way to go is to cross the sea to Italy.
But there is another border.
Montenegro.
Let's go.
I drive.
Sire?
Ludovic?
I am very ashamed.
I know.
I have to resign.
"No, Ludovic."
"He served me well, I count on her."
I failed completely.
"No, nothing at all."
Sire.
Here is the frontier.
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What have you done this time, Jimmy?"
Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
There we go.
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.
"Um, but... it's better if I show you at the lab..."
Hello?
"Oh, spasiba."
They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.
You know what I like about rich kids?
"Bam, nothing."
"Hey, Ryan, you wouldn't consider me rich, would you?"
I'd be more upper middle class?
"What's up, fool?"
"You know, you didn't have to hit him."
Sorry.
"You know, the cashier called the cops."
"Look, I don't know why Luke does that."
Did that.
He's just...
An ass?
Protective.
God.
It's my mom.
And... your dad.
It's been awhile.
Figure out what kind of shape this place is in.
Wow.
Oh.
That's what...those contractors have been doing.
This place is fantastic!
You think so?
You don't think it's too much?
Too much?
You're talking to the guy whose wife just imported ceramic shower-curtain rings from Morocco.
This is gorgeous.
The high ceilings and the molding.
It reminds me of...
Your parent's house.
On Elm Grove.
"Yeah, with the vaulted ceilings and those great beams."
Hey...
And you just left?
Yup.
So it's over?
I don't know.
She says that every time and then she goes back to him.
Well maybe I'm just being paranoid?
It was time for the bi-monthly...
breakup post modern.
Who said what...
did I handle it well etc.
Can I ask you something JP?
What baby?
Come back to bed.
How many girls are you sleeping with?
Baby why you so drama?
So what?
So drama.
"I mean why would he hang out with me for six months, and text and call... everyday?"
Last night I was trying to make this really good point.
We just had sex JP.
It's good.
I just had your penis inside of me.
But that sounded...
a lot better in my head.
Ouch...
- Sorry.
Last week bird crap this week balls in her face.
Ah it's typical.
Is it true he has a monster schlong?
I don't know where she gets her information.
But that's absolutely true.
Don't you have anything to say?
Why you ask him?
"I'm asking you, he's not your dad."
I'm asking you.
Why look away?
Why do you bother?
He came between us when we'd problems.
Lisa...
"Lisa, aren't I good to you?"
"Exactly, aren't I good to you?"
"It has been 3 years, don't you like me?"
What're you saying?
You knew him before me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Then why go after her now?
That makes me the third party.
The air is great here.
"I can smell the grass and flowers,"
Nice smell...
Trying to sound poetic.
I like him this way.
What?
I can change if you like that.
How?
I've been observing him.
He expects nothing back for his money.
A direct and righteous man.
Bad-tempered but has a good heart.
The world needs people like him.
Don't change.
I've never heard anyone praise him.
Bad-tempered but a good heart.
I was flattered to hear we looked alike.
But do we?
So I thought about it.
And I think I know why he said that.
"Can't really explain in words, but somehow we are a bit alike."
"The way we talk, for example."
Really?
You're nicer than I thought.
Thanks.
So why did you ask to meet?
Don't you have a real reason?
No.
"You're just so pretty, and very close with Director Kim."
So I just wanted to know more about you.
What do you fear most in your life?
Obsession.
Obsession?
I'm afraid of betrayal.
Did your husband betray you?
Is that why you're getting a divorce?
"Director Kim told you that, too?"
Yeah.
"Yes, my husband betrayed me."
That's nothing to cry about.
Just divorce him.
And live right when you can forget him.
And what about you?
Why do you cling on to him?
I did?
Two nights ago.
Don't lie to me.
"Oh, I get it."
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
"Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock."
Man.
That's brutal.
"You know, you should just ask her out, man."
It's not like she's a rocket scientist or anything.
"Oh, wait, she is."
"Well, why don't you ask her?"
Because I'm already dating someone.
"Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles."
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.
"Hey, you know what?"
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
"Yeah, that's funny."
"You know, you say you want a life experience, right?"
"Well, I'd say getting down with that would definitely qualify."
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Our honored guest.
"- How you doing, Ben?"
- I'm okay.
You see this button?
She controls her own dosage.
"Friends, family, career, future..."
None of these things matter to her now.
This is the face of 21st-century drug addiction.
Satisfied?
$25 million.
$30 million. $35 million.
"Ladies, you're off my grid."
I've lost visual of you.
You were right.
It is a cabal of evil florists.
We found Finch's flower patch.
If we connect this to the sprinkler system with the rest of the greenhouse...
We can wipe out every damn flower in here.
Go get Amanda.
I got this covered.
Got it.
"Guys, I got eyes on Bosley, but audio contact is dead."
I'll lead you in.
Something's wrong.
I'm losing power.
Who the hell are you?
No sign of Amanda.
Abby?
Eve?
Don't move.
Turn around.
Turn around!
The last offer I heard was $35 million.
Who wants to get real?
$50 million.
It's over.
Then why are you here?
This is not my wife.
This is Trudy.
I met her a couple weeks ago.
Can we go boogie boarding now?
"And once people knew what we were going through,"
I think my cortisol levels just shot up through the roof.
Because it's difficult to go through a very private struggle publicly.
"I heard what you think, but you know what I'm really interested in is hearing about how you feel."
Just tell her how you feel.
"Well, I think if you looked at everything that..."
"No, no, no, no."
Just...
Don't explain intellectually how you feel.
"You know, just tell her how you feel."
In one word.
Sure.
Angry.
Cynthia?
Judged.
Very good.
Yes?
Progress.
Excited.
Relieved.
That is it.
Yeah.
We're awesome at feelings!
Okay.
"Nice job today, guys."
That's all for today?
That's it.
Give me that.
You can have it.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, we should probably go to the bedroom and..."
start clearing stuff out of there.
Right.
Yes.
This is weird.
And this is really weird.
Who's this?
- I don't know.
- How could there be a photo of my dad with his arm around this woman... on his nightstand and I don't even know who she is.
Maybe she's an old friend.
"Nah, she's gotta be a new friend."
This was taken at the Wynn.
The Wynn didn't open until just before he died.
Then maybe she's a new friend.
Why wouldn't he tell me about her?
I know.
It's because I didn't call him often enough.
I wasn't gonna say that.
All right.
Let's hit the closet.
Yeah.
We did it.
What did we do?
It took a lot of people.
"It took a lot of man-hours, but we checked everyone that came into the casino between noon and 3:00."
You want to guess how many people that is?
No.
"Iwas so thrilled, Alicia, to see you coming in alone today, just with canes, on your own."
Did you see?
Howwas rehab today?
Very good.
Are you tired?
"Yes, very."
Doesn't matter.
We'll do some additional exercices.
We'll do some leg stretches.
I've done 100 today already.
We'll do just a few more.
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Sanz.
Come in.
Thank you.
The fetus was born dead.
It was a boy.
But Alicia woke up.
Benigno should be told.
"Given his mental state, I think not."
He could do something crazy.
But Icant lie to him.
"I'm his only friend, he trusts me."
I'll do it.
It's not a dilemma for me.
I'll tell him that Alicia is still in a coma and the baby is dead.
But you must promise me that you'll say nothing.
What about bail?
"It'll be very difficult, and expensive."
But we can try.
Number eight.
You got wet.
Gas trucks.
Nice touch.
( tyres screech )
( cell phone rings )
( rings )
Answer it.
Yes?
It's for you.
Sit down.
Yeah?
Okay.
I see you.
What do I want?
How about a world cruise and a winning lottery ticket?
( chuckles )
Why don't you come up here?
We can talk about it.
Just you.
Your little friends can wait down there.
"Hey, sit down."
What do you think you're doing?
I'm gonna get some ice for my neck because you hurt me.
"And tomorrow morning, after the FBI either lock you up or shoot you dead,"
"I'm gonna have to get up and go to work like any other day, and I'd just as soon do that looking as fresh and pretty as possible."
"Get some water for Charlie, will you please, Cynthia?"
CYNTHIA:
Yeah.
Anybody else?
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"We got to get him out of here, Ray."
I'll help you.
Be careful.
Man attempting suicide is safe.
"Situation under control, cancel back up."
"You don't agree with what I did, right?"
Different principles.
Did I say anything?
You didn't say but I can tell.
Good to live.
Look at this family.
Filial child and a caring father.
Perfect!
You're sick!
Come through this.
It's too late when your loved ones are gone.
"Leave dad a message, press 1."
"Ask for money, press 2."
"Make an appointment, press 0."
"You go ahead, toilet break."
Michael?
You haven't called for a long time.
Where's dad?
He's not home.
Nothing then.
Michael.
Come home for dinner when you're free.
Have fun in the toilet.
I can't bear it anymore.
So sleepy.
Don't you see this city is beautiful?
"If you sleep, what can you see?"
"Bro, we need to get some sleep."
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up your ass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone your own size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
What's your show tonight?
"Here, this is for making a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need your filthy stuff.
Ah OK then...
Don't you ever wear colourless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answer the phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brother is saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
Please don't make me do that.
"Come on, you're a guy."
You do this kind of thing all the time.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Just act sexy.
I can act sexy.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm acting sexy.
Looks like you're trying to get a cobra out of a basket.
"Hey, this move killed for me in the '80s."
That's great.
"If a Duran Duran concert suddenly breaks out, you'll be set."
"All right, I got it, I got it."
Here goes.
Hi.
My name is Christine Campbell.
"I'm divorced, but I get along great with my ex-husband."
We're just better as friends.
"Anyway, I'm not crazy."
I'm very stable.
"In fact, I own my own gym."
It's one of those 30-minute workout places for women.
"I make decent money, though."
But most of it goes to my son's private school.
But I'm not a snob.
I'm very down to earth.
I just want what's best for my son.
"His name is Ritchie, we live in Mar Vista."
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Way to play it cool.
An investment to be clear.
Not a fucking handout!
That said...
I did remind him... of the night we shared together.
"And how it would be a tad embarrassing if, uh... well, if anyone found out about it."
"Which is technically blackmail, I suppose, but whatever."
I filmed it.
You see?
Suck it.
I think we can all agree.
That the truth hurts.
Here.
This will help with the pain.
"Thanks for the party, guys."
She's dead.
"Get lost, you bloody queer!"
Oops.
We're done here.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year's out and in the end we're all still breathing.
Gin - fucking gin!
Gin - fucking gin!
Yeah.
"We'll be celebrating later, aren't you?"
"Uh, Jesus Christ!"
"Oh, we're going to be right at the end of that--"
Get off me.
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower you were to be in heaven!"
- It's the old lad.
"- Oh, bad to be on that!"
"- You have to go, Carlos."
"You can ruin your life with your muñequita, but you're not gonna ruin my bodega!"
"- You have to go, take the keys."
So I worked on a new color for this guy.
That's a great color.
I've got to show you something.
"I just finished these panels,"
I wanted to know what you thought.
"Jenny, go work on this."
"We'll talk about this, okay?"
You all right?
How you've been?
"Hey, Carlos?"
How have you been?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
"All right, what do you got here?"
"So, what do you think?"
It's good!
Good.
Good.
- I based that one on the old man.
- How is he?
He's fine.
Listen... can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
"Who, Raquel?"
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're ready?
"'Cause you only get one chance with her, you know that."
These are good.
Raquel:...which I assume is how you got the idea for this.
"- dang. jake ain't nothing but a paintballer -- no future and currently dead, by the way."
"kind of sad, though."
he didn't shoot blanks.
- [gasps] you're useless!
"- geez, i was just having fun."
i'm gonna get a refill.
[door creaks]
- you guys seen randy?
[toilet flushing] excuse me.
"oh, my god!"
ohh!
what is that?
- it's pizza with a hint of hard-boiled egg.
- that's disgusting.
- i don't know whether to be grossed out or hungry again.
"- okay, you have serious problems."
"look, have you seen randy?"
me and him are supposed to hook up.
- no.
- have you seen randy?
- excuse me.
y-you can see me?
"- well, yes."
"if you're standing right there, i can see you."
- what?
no. no.
how did that happen?
- have you seen him or not?
"- i, um -- no, i haven't."
"- have another drink, why don't you?"
- i think i will.
[knock on door]
"- Wait, do--"
"If anyone comes in, just act like you're working or something."
"Wait, mike."
"Mikey, where are you?"
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Get over here, will you?"
I got too many irons.
"Go right over there, give the ceiling a pull, will you?"
Basic business principles went right down the drain on this thing.
You're fired!

Keep doing the exercises and take three of the supplements a day.
It really should help your back.
"Yeah, I'm gonna be back in the office today."
"Okay, great."
Bye.
You're going back to work?
"Well, we talked about this."
It's been a month.
You said you were ready.
But if...
"oh, no, no."
"Right, right."
You're right.
You're right.
You should go back to work.
"Hey, I put down the new rug."
"Oh, good."
Do you like it?
'Cause I can get something else.
It's fine.
All right.
"Hey, I was right."
This is the living room.
This is where we live.
And this is the couch where much of the sitting takes place.
"Aren't you gonna show me the, uh, upstairs?"
"Yeah, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, boy."
The upstairs.
I love the upstairs.
"You know, we weren't even gonna have an upstairs, but I made 'em put it in because I knew you were coming."
"Nobody told me about this girl thing, Shawn."
"I mean, no one warned me."
I thought they were just there.
I didn't know they were interactive.
You'll get the hang of it.
Sure.
It's easy for you.
Your hair moves.
- There's other techniques.
- Like what?
I don't know.
I just do hair.
"Yeah, but where do I get my technique?"
Ask your brother.
He's got the boom.
You know what?
Let's just forget this whole subject.
There are a million other things to do in the world.
"I mean, we're too young to worry about finding mates."
- You're right.
See ya.
- Where are you going?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, Mallefille."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
Help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'll kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.
Be a dear.
Ask Ursula if she's got something for a bandage.
Of course.
Don't move.
No.
(LOCK CLICKS)
Bastard!
And what if it does?
That means you're in contact with God or the Angel of Death.
Who are you in contact with?
We can't stay here like this.
Who's to say that within a week... I have a feeling it'll happen in the next three days.
You keep repeating the same thing!
"Look, Keyvan, you know what?"
Give me three days.
Just three.
Perhaps it will happen.
- And what if it doesn't?
- let's say it will.
We're wasting time.
Can't you plan things?
Plan things?
"No, I can't do that."
We say the same thing.
"If you can't do it, who can?"
Only God can.
"If it happens, we shoot our report and return to Tehran."
All right.
We just need to know what to do.
Say it takes three months...
- Behzad.
- Yes.
I've brought you bread.
Put it over there.
"Listen, kid, can't you hold your tongue?"
I can.
Who told you to talk about her son leaving?
I can't lie.
It's not a matter of lying.
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
- What did your father say?
"- Nothing, what could he say?"
- Is he dead?
"- Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
- Doesn't he come to see you?
- No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Well...
What's your problem?
Me?
None.
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
- It wasn't that special.
- It was.
Very special.
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
This is it.
Someone must have knocked this over.
No!
It's not here!
No!
It's not here!
My engine!
I've just completed it!
It's gone!
"Please stay back, Mr. Mac Bain."
It's too dangerous.
The engine was just completed?
No...
It can't be.
The efforts of a lifetime have been...
We understand how you feel.
"Mac, please get a hold of yourself."
"Chief, one of our fire trucks has disappeared!"
That's impossible!
Keep looking!
I made some hot soup.
"Please have some, it'll make you feel better."
You're welcome to stay here if you'd like.
Thank you very much for your kindness.
"Oh, dear, I don't think you should give up just because the engine..."
No!
There's no hope whatsoever.
It's all over!
Your wife is correct.
"I think it's too early to give up, Mac."
Spare me your empty words of comfort.
"I am giving you no such thing, sir."
Executive decision.
Horses can eat a bunch of pudding.
My cousin from Chernobyl had a dog this size.
He had three legs.
"My cousin, not the dog."
Something good did come out of Chernobyl.
Excuse me?
How much do you charge for pictures with him?
"Oh, it depends."
How nude do you want him?
Ew.
We mean for our kids... with the horse.
"I don't think the ""ew"" was necessary."
You don't know what you're missing.
"I mean, we're just walking him for our friend."
We'll give you $10 each.
Sold to the woman who...
"""Doesn't"" wanna see me naked."
"Come on, 18!"
Which is also the title of my adult film debut.
"Mine would have been called,"
"""Might As Well, I'm 24."""
"Excuse me, Mr. Moustache?"
Could you stop feeling my ankle with your toes?
I guess that's a no.
"Oh, 18 winner."
We won!
I'm rich!
Now you have no shot with me.
"Stay close, sweet cakes."
You're good luck.
"Here, buddy."
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I'm scared.
There's no reason to be.
Everything's okay.
I could have been a better person.
I could have done more.
You did enough.
Stay with me.
It won't be much longer.
I'll stay right here.
- Let me see.
- I think I singed my eyebrow.
I need to see.
You thought it was a good idea to put kerosene in your barbecue?
- I thought it was lighter fluid.
- It doesn't look burnt.
I'll check for corneal burns with an ultraviolet light.
I need everything documented.
Worker's comp.
- You're a chef?
- It was my summer office party.
"Oh, I don't think that counts."
Any word on the air conditioning?
- Yeah.
They think it'll be fixed by winter.
- I can't work like this.
- You want a Big Stick?
- No.
- Why did I buy these shoes?
- Because they were cute.
- Some help here.
"- Yeah, what is it?"
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln Park.
"It's a chicken, they're female."
Silly me.
What's that?
It's your surprise.
- We're having a party.
- What's the occasion?
"It's my son's birthday, and I want to celebrate it."
"OK, Naj, do the honours."
"Three, two, one..."
You'd better come.
There's a problem with the vaccine test.
"For God's sake, be careful."
- How long has he been like this?
- A few hours.
- I should have been told!
- BP is going through the roof.
Oedema presence.
"At first we thought the vaccine was working, but then he started showing symptoms of the virus."
His immune system has collapsed.
This is my fault.
We're losing him.
"Hold him, for God's sake."
"The risk of contamination is too great, there's nothing you can do."
"Come on, get out, all of you."
"You too, Sami."
I'm so sorry.
You do what you like.
I'm not leaving him to die on his own.
Cut my throat!
Drive!
Samantha Willis live here?
Abby Grant sent us.
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
I'm sorry to drag you into this mess.
"Tell me, who's behind all this?"
That's not my game.
I play by the rules.
I knew you would never tell me.
Take care ofJenny.
Weng won't stop until he kills you.
You'd better let me arrest you.
We'll stay here tonight.
"Sidney will bring me my money, and we'll leave tomorrow."
I'm scared those gangsters will find us here.
Don't worry.
This place isn't easy to find.
Why is it so dark?
I can hardly see anything.
"Jeffrey, turn on the lights."
Why don't you turn on the lights?
Jeffrey.
Please turn them on.
There's been a power failure.
Will your friend come back with the money?
I'm sure he will.
I'm sure he will.
Boss.
"Here's the $1 00,000."
Please check it.
You think he can kill Jeffrey?
"Boss, Sidney Fung is here."
What if he betrays you again?
I'd still consider him my friend.
He was so good to me.
- Where isJeffrey's money?
Oh.
Me neither.
I like to keep off the grid.
(Door opens and closes)
(Crow cawing in distance)
Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it.
Does this really seem like a good idea?
"I mean, mom won't even let me make toast."
"Oh, come on now."
Put her in drive.
There you go.
Now give it a little gas.
I'm so nervous.
"Well, there's nothing to be nervous about."
"Worst-case scenario, we both die, and that's gonna happen at some point anyway."
(Engine rumbling)
(Tires screech)
Okay.
(Chuckles) I'm driving!
(Tires screech) (Whispers) Driving.
"Okay, now keep your eye on the road!"
"Jeez, I learned that lesson the hard way."
"Hey, this is kind of embarrassing, but, uh, could you give me your name one more time?"
Is it... (Vehicle approaches)
(Brakes squeal)
"Hey, dad."
We had the best day.
"Uncle Rusty took me out of school, and we ate ribs, and I bowled a 39."
"I learned that I do not like beer, though."
Oh. (Laughs) He did pretty well.
Right?
You look great!
Really great!
You think so?
Sure!
Anything else?
The family is falling apart  right in front of my eyes.
He's only going on vacation.
Yes I know.
"But for me, vacations always took years."
Oh god!
"I'm getting cold, kids."
Here he comes.
"Well, there will always be a place for you here."
"At least, as long as I'm here."
"Hey, I've heard someone wants a ride."
"What's all this here, god damn it!"
?
Your theory was right.
Those were kids from the tattoo shop.
What?
You want to know what I think?
No!
A suspect is fleeing over there.
And you're having a relationship with the other suspect.
Is it clear what you're doing here?
"No, cancel the whole operation!"
"Conflict of interest, aiding and abetting, disciplinary action."
Are you stupid!
?
"Franz, man!"
- They sure can sing.
I got addicted to one of those things.
Almost broke up my marriage.
What?
"Oh, no, no."
Not that.
"No, no, no, I met someone, and, you know, we had a nice time-- that's all there is to it."
"Wait, you're not going to see him again?"
"Maybe I will, and maybe I won't."
You can do that?
"Apparently, I can."
"Oh, crap."
Here comes Sad Dad.
Who's Sad Dad?
"Yeah, that's the other side of divorce."
"His wife left him three years ago for her personal trainer and he's been moping around the school ever since, trying to get any woman to show him the slightest bit of attention."
"Oh, that is so pathetic."
Which one is he?
Hey!
"Oh, my God, what are you doing here?"
You looking for me?
"Uh... uh, no, my kid goes to this school."
No way.
"My daughter, Alice, goes to school here."
Wow.
You would think that that would have come up last night.
"Oh, my God."
"No, no, no, no!"
Don't answer that.
Why?
Who is it?
Hi.
We're very busy.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Is your mother back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Does your mother approve?
- Sure.
She always gives a lot herself.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize ...
Normally we don't take money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we can do it."
"Well, take a good look at how beautiful this house is."
They can afford it.
"As thanks for the donation, I have here a plaster."
Help!
Help!
Help!
Stop!
Please prove that you're our mother.
Ask her what my favorite song is.
What is Lukas' favorite song?
"""Good evening, good night""?"
Don't!
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them.
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
"I'm doing this for all of us, mom."
Hi!
"No, thanks."
Are you also the pride of yourparents?
"Just like me, you're not sure."
"My fatherwas a soldier, I always wanted to be like him."
He used to say:
"""I am so proud of you, son""."
Attention!
"Combat boots on, guns ready, attack!"
One afterthe other...
They all die...
Dad would be so proud of me.
At ease!
"At ease, huh?"
Dad is dead.
My condolences.
We owe our lives to dad.
I owe everything to him.
"Soldiers are immortal, nations are indivisible."
"You'll fucking serve the army too, you pussy boy Can!"
Pussy boy!
We should leave now.
These hands were so tiny.
Size of a cat's paw.
They said you wouldn't live.
So tiny.
Now look at these...
Why don't you join a support group forfallen officers' families?
You're always at home.
It's not that.
It's the seaside I miss.
I want to know when!
Years ago?
Months ago?
Weeks ago?
It was the night of the fire.
But it was friend sex.
I swear.
He was just so desperate.
He needed someone.
He needed comforting.
So you slept with him?
"Just so we're perfectly clear, you and Ben had sex?"
And he's been trying to make me feel bad about sleeping with Adrian!
And you didn't tell me?
You just let me feel bad about it?
You let me agonize over that one stupid mistake when the two of you did something just as bad!
Or even worse!
What did I ever do to you that you did this to me?
Were you ever going to tell me?
"I mean, if you did this just to get back at me for breaking up with me I think you'd want me to know."
"Geez, Alice."
That's really low.
Henry!
"Pick me up at seven, okay?"
Seven.
I got it.
I'll be there.
What?
You're gonna go through with this?
"Oh, yeah."
Game on.
Hi.
I do not hit on your mom.
You always kiss her on the cheek and try to make her like you.
"You're like, ""Oh, that dress is just perfect for the season!"""
Why does your voice always get higher when you do an impression of me?
That's her.
My heart is racing.
I need that stress ball.
You can do this.
Stay calm.
Don't let her get to you.
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Do it for me.
"Okay, I can see I lost you."
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Okay.
Relax.
There's no way she can make an entire family Thanksgiving about herself.
"Oh, God."
She upped her game.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"I'll just take this heavy bag upstairs, then."
- All by myself.
"- Okay, great."
Be careful of that clicky elbow.
What happened to your mom?
Absolutely nothing.
She is looking for attention.
You didn't ask?
She could be really hurt.
"Oh, please."
That thing isn't even bolted into her head.
- I should go help her.
Yeah.
It's good woodwork.
- That's this place.
- Full marks for observation.
Mm-hmm!
Yep!
"Alright, there we go."
Ah!
"- Oh, shit."
- What's up?
I just forgot I don't have my phone.
"I keep going for it, I forget it's not in my pocket."
"And there's, uh... no TV here, so..."
Welcome to the 19th century.
"No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi."
Yeah.
No wonder people were seeing shit.
Probably were just bored out of their gourds.
"Well, that's the leading theory about ghost sightings."
The mind plays tricks when less stimulated.
"Fewer distractions, people saw more ghosts."
Isn't that a nice piece of info?
"Well, they got literature, though."
"That's pretty sweet, right?"
"Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual last time that I read a book."
To think people used to do this on purpose.
I know.
Crazy.
Why?
"- You know, I don't think I've..."
"- Shh, alright?"
I need to get into some old-school shit here.
Ritzy.
- I really don't want to wear a corsage.
- They're all paid for.
- Really.
It's too much.
- Your mother wants you to pick one.
"- Really, it's okay."
She'll just come back here herself.
"- This one, thanks."
- Good choice.
The cameraman said that would look best on film.
- So you're the rich girl.
- Maybe.
I'm not rich... but my parents have money.
But I'm totally self-sufficient.
I take nothing from them except this corsage and my daughter's tuition.
"So, are you gonna stone me?"
I should've guessed.
Look at her friends.
They're wearing suits that drip money.
"Hey, pal, this was 30% off."
That's why you didn't want to get pizza 'cause it's below you?
"No, Liza."
Pizza is not below me.
I love pizza.
I eat tons of pizza.
It's one of my four major food groups.
"Candy, popcorn, and pizza."
See.
It's two of my food groups.
That's how much I love pizza.
I want to believe you.
What the hell?
Stay where you are!
"Wait, we're trapped in the house."
Stay where you are.
The pair of dead bodies inside.
"Our friends, okay."
Blair.
"I'm sorry, she does that when she's scared."
Everybody down on the ground now!
Do it.
"Officer, you're not listening to me."
"This man is a murderer, okay."
He killed both of our friends.
That's a lie.
"Just do what I say, and we'll sort this out."
Sheriff.
"I couldn't say anything before, but, they've been holding me hostage, and they're robbing' my house."
That's a fuckin' lie.
Don't believe him.
Everybody shut up!
You will talk only when I say so.
Is that clear?
"Officer, you gotta listen to me."
Shut up.
"Take these, cuff yourselves to that post right over there."
What about him?
He said shut up.
You shut up.
"No, you shut up."
Everybody shut up!
"Let me take care of him, all right?"
Just do what I say.
- Cathet...
- Pressure's up to 95 palp.
No gross blood.
Where do you need me?
- We're all set.
- She's good.
"Thanks, Sam."
We'll take it from here.
I'll go check on his kids.
She's really not sure what happened.
She gave herself a good whack in the head.
We can't do anything if she doesn't identify her assailants.
That's okay.
"Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers."
She's not even certain it was intentional now.
Fine.
Let me know if she changes her mind.
You did the right thing.
The next step is to get your wife some help.
No.
The next step is for me to take her home.
"My wife is not crazy, okay?"
She had an accident.
It happens.
"I'd rather she chose to stay, than have psychiatry put her on forced hold."
She's gonna be with me.
She's gonna be fine.
Just leave us alone.
I mean it.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
Crit's 28.
Send another 4 units to angio.
We're passing ships.
We've met a few times.
You were on tour somewhere and we...
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one time I don't remember.
"No, I don't."
Yeah.
It was a crazy night.
LAUGHTER
"Ten past one, Rob!"
I've had similar experiences with Ronnie Corbett where the two of us are smashed off our tits.
Literally no memory of what time we left the golf club.
So it seems silly to ask you if you're a party girl.
Don't you try to deny it!
Slightly retired.
I'm a country bumpkin now.
You moved to the country.
Is that a real thing?
It's not like a stage!
It's real.
I've got a veggie patch and everything.
A veggie patch?
"It's not a euphemism, Noel."
So you're out in the country and you're acting more now.
I am.
Is that as big a thing as the music?
I think music's my first love.
I couldn't ever not do music.
"But acting, yeah, totally."
Love it.
I nearly wanted you.
These children are dangerous to us.
also to their own selves.
We can't cure it.
"Therefore,"
"I have to tell you... that we've decided for their sake, to lock them up indefinitely."
Benigno!
David!
Stand up.
Where's Anais?
Let's go!
Anais didn't make it.
But we save a child.
Your child.
Don't move!
Make them wear it.
Tell them to wear the safety clothes.
I can't eat slowly when I eat hot things.
"If you eat it, will you die?"
Eat it quietly!
"Son-in-law, it looks like your food is too hot for you."
Would you like to drink some cool beer?
Beer?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
Would I die if I drink it?
!
"Dad, he has to drive later."
"Da Ran, I don't have a car since the accident."
"Yoon Jae, your body is still not well since the accident."
I think I will sleep well with just one drink.
"Please pour it for me, Father-in-law."
"Dad, Dad, me too."
I wanted...
I wanted to do something that used the part of my brain that was healthy.
"So, what's different now?"
I know how the world sees me.
And people with schizophrenia aren't lawyers.
They're bag ladies.
So prove them wrong.
Finish law school.
You have insight into something very few people understand.
Think about this.
"If you finish law school, who could you help?"
"Their distinct color comes from their main food source, shrimp."
Not far away from our flamingo friends...
Cat.
Bat.
Rat-a-tat-tat.
- Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
- Heh.
Right?
Right.
You're so lucky.
Your voices... stop sometimes.
Times.
Crimes.
Limes.
Times.
I have a secret.
It's about my mother.
There was the one I told my friends about... the mom I wished I had.
She mostly lives in my snow globe.
Then there was Up Mom.
You see what I'm talking about?
"- No, you wasn't!"
- I was!
- At all...
- Was my fault.
God... so inefficient...
Well...
Let's go!
Please enter on the collapsed tunnel.
In about 500 meters there's the place we are searching for.
"Ram, don't run."
"Male, pay attention to your steps."
Yes.
"Lieutenant, what happened?"
Don't worry.
Male stepped over a landmine.
Really?
In a place like that?
You are not scared.
Aren't you?
Leave me alone...
"Lieutenant, be careful please."
Right now a heat source has become visible.
Ok!
Let's change location.
"Everyone, listen!"
There is something lurking in the ruins at the west.
It's not like they are unarmed people.
We will take a walk before exploring underground.
Let's start the procedure as usual.
Launch the UAV.
The enemy is already moving.
Hurry!
That's all right.
Please stop this.
Please just come home.
"I have to do this, honey."
"No, you don't."
They have to pay for what they did to Kevin.
And when it's over..
I promise..
I promise you'll understand.
You're doing this for Kevin?
I swear to God.
Then you do whatever it takes.
You make them pay for what they did to our boy.
What the hell are you doing?
"Walker, you stop this.."
or I'll make sure she spends the rest of her life in a federal prison.
You have 19 minutes.
You're done.
General.
Your boss took the White House..
and your man inside got the president killed.
"Carol, calm down."
You're free to go.
Thank God for Gerald Ford.
Why?
He built this because he didn't want the press to see him in his swim trunks.
Any chance this leads out of here?
No.
"Listen, I gotta stop for a second."
What?
You all right?
"That's not good, is it?"
Did you book this room in advance?
What do you think?
Did you push me into the lift on purpose?
"I just wanted to get to know you better, because you're the most popular girl in our company, ... but no one's ever dated you."
Please excuse me.
"Are you angry with me, princess?"
No!
Don't!
No!
I've got to have you.
I'll take them off myself.
I don't want you to laugh at what you see.
I'm not sexy.
Don't worry.
We're in a hotel room on the 32nd floor.
"If an earthquake hits, we'll die together."
I'm scared.
Moan more.
Is it nice?
Move your hips more.
Hold me tighter.
Shall we go to that hotel that has a revolving bed next?
"Yeah, I've always wanted to go there,"
You know how sexy your voice sounded?
"I liked it,"
Are you comparing me with someone?
Who?
Look at the TV.
- Come on.
Just look.
- l don't want to.
Nami's pussy's sucking my penis in.
And also I'd like us a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.
"It'd be nice to have like a white, beautiful place and a decent stove."
It's not a lot to ask.
"Wow, don't look so surprised."
Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
You know what's funny?
I don't think I ever cooked for a guy before.
I mean not even my husband.
Jesus Christ.
Where is he?
Who?
You know who.
- Trevor.
- Don't.
"Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?"
"This, Ivan."
"He's your ex, isn't he?"
What?
Why is he doing this?
"It's because I'm fucking you, isn't it?"
Now it all makes sense.
"I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me."
Where is he?
"Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?"
"I don't know what you are talking about, baby."
"Ah, don't baby me."
"Yeah, baby."
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
"I'll do anything you want, baby."
"You know what, I don't deserve this."
What did you do?
-What are you looking for?
-Where is that box you used to keep all my stuff in?
- The memory box?
- Sounds about right.
I don't remember.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Look.
First place.
The trophy was bigger than you were.
"Can we speed this up, Ma?"
I need my medical records and my birth certificate.
All right.
Here.
"How about your report card, huh?"
You could have been valedictorian... if you hadn't been suspended so many times for getting into fights.
- I never could figure-
"- Mom, I don't need my report card."
- Your father used to get so angry.
- I don't want to talk about Dad.
- I just need my stuff.
- Fine.
Here.
All right?
-I don't want you to think you're keeping those.
"-No, I'm just gonna make copies."
I'm gonna take a trip.
Work.
"The last time you said that, you left for 10 years, Michael."
It's not that kind.
"Did you ever think about leaving, Mom?"
- I didn't chop them up.
- I donated them to science.
- Donating my ass!
How much did you get?
Two grand a body.
- But the benefit of medical research...
- Who'd you hawk them to?
Who'd you hawk them to?
A guy named Russ Bianco.
"I call a number, and he meets me."
You Bianco?
"Yeah, where's Mogan?"
"Ah, he couldn't make it."
He knew I needed the cash.
Name's Elliot.
I work in the morgue with him.
You got a city ID?
Fresh off the slab.
"- Uh, he's not an addict."
- No.
That guy's in better shape than the stiffs Mark usually sends me.
Brain hemorrhage.
Tox screen clean.
So...
Nice gig Mark's got going here.
How's your supply?
Always looking for more.
Why?
One of my cousins works in the Manhattan morgue.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call./ All right."
You wanna give me a hand with this guy?
This is good.
This is really good.
My mother made food like this.
"Oh, thank you, Fern."
How's Walter?
He had his gallbladder taken out yesterday.
Good for him.
I'll give you boys 100% cooperation.
Me and my two deputies...
We'll take turns watching the place around the clock.
"So you boys can just take it easy, relax, drink beer, chase chicks, whatever you want."
We'll help.
Hmm?
We'll help you.
Suit yourself.
"Oh, another thing."
Old man Malcolm?
I guarantee he don't know jack shit about this stuff with his nephew.
You talk to him?
Not yet.
I just know it.
There aren't any telephone lines out to that old place.
He's like a hermit.
Hardly steps foot off his property.
We ought to talk to him.
That may be the case...
DALE:
"Charlie, get on in here."
Charlie's my deputy.
Retired police officer.
"Morning, guys."
This is Dud Cole.
"He's on 6 grams a day, and he has a crazy idea of becoming a tattooist."
"He started tattooing some bananas, and then he got a roast pork   and now he's dragged half a goddamn pig into our living-room."
It's so gross!
"Go away, for fuck's sake!"
Get off!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Strange dogs.
The police was there!
You told me there'd be no police.
No police at all.
"- How should I know, honey?"
"- You don't know shit, man."
Asger?
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
- Do you love me?
- Why the fuck do you ask me that?
It can't be that difficult.
"Do you love me, or..."
Shut up!
Right...
"No, she made it."
"No, she brought the CDs home."
And the washing machine.
They got Lars' stuff.
That's good for our business.
- We'll need some more soon.
- I don't feel well...
- Probably just your nerves.
"- No, I'm really..."
I really feel bad.
There...
He is free!
You came when I called to you.
I am free and you will sacrifice your bodies to me.
Come.
"You say nothing, but you speak to me with your minds."
"I will give you all my power, so that you may carry out your revenge."
You may go.
Now I am within you.
You have all of my power until sunrise.
"Once the daylight comes, you will be just as weak as you were before."
Go now.
You only have a few hours to carry out your revenge.
They're alive.
I saw them.
Poor things
"So, Louise, who did you see?"
Tell us what you know.
I didn't see anyone.
But I do know everything that happened.
That's the way I am.
I know things I have never seen!
I've heard about your gift of second sight.
Are they alive
- They're alive.
- Where are they?
Right here.
"- No, Bosco!"
- Calm down!
"Captain, stop him!"
"So there you are, my children."
You are very much as I imagined.
"Yes, I've seen you before."
Get in.
Where did you go?
"Hey, where did he go?"
Go inside.
Where did Kutty go?
Come here.
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
To pluck guavas.
There are only stones for 12 kms.
Where did you get the guavas?
Tell me the truth.
Where did you go?
I won't tell you.
Tell me.
I won't tell you.
Small boy!
Don't you fear me now?
Konda Reddy says that Singamuthu is in this quarry.
And is insulting me with a camera.
This bastard says that he went to pluck guavas.
Don't you have any fear?
"Until he tells me where he went, he must lie there bleeding."
"If anyone tries to save his life without my knowledge, your children's fate will be very much similar to his."
This is Cuddapah Raja's line of death.
"If anyone treads on it, I will kill him."
"Kutty, where did he go?"
He didn't come for lunch either.
He can't stay hungry.
"Kutty, come fast."
We might miss the bus.
Someone tell me where he is.
"It's my dad, ok?"
He won't let me.
Why?
I...
"It's ok, just... tell me."
"I know it's not true, but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house because he thinks you're gay."
I know you're not.
I just...
I have to do what he says.
I'm sorry.
What if I was gay?
What do you mean?
Would you not want to sleep over at my house if I really was gay?
Hey.
So... don't worry about last night.
"It was almost curfew, and there was a lot of pressure."
Yeah.
But you still want to... right?
Of course.
"Um, Saturday night, we'll do it the right way, ok?"
"Yeah, I'd like that."
I got it all planned out.
We can go to a really nice dinner.
Totally on me.
"And then afterwards, maybe we can go to the beach."
- The beach?
- Yeah.
What's wrong with the beach?
Have you ever had sex on the beach?
"I know it's supposed to be all romantic and stuff, but there's sand everywhere, in all your business, and bugs."
It's...
It's pretty terrible.
What are you doing?
Hurry and get up!
I was going to cook some bean sprouts.
"I've already made the rice, serve yourself."
"All right, all right, I'll take care of it."
What the hell?
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Please hurry and cross!
Hurry!
You can't stop traffic!
Hello.
- I'm sorry for being late.
- Hello.
I'm sorry.
Are you having some problems in your life?
Excuse me?
"Oh, I don't have any problems in my life, editor."
"I haven't been getting any sleep, and I overslept."
You must've had a good sleep.
"Yes, that's correct."
"All right, let's start the meeting."
Yes.
"It fits perfectly, it doesn't need any adjustments."
I'll make that decision.
All right.
Did you gain some weight?
"No, I didn't."
You must've been slacking off on your exercise.
Did I gain weight?
Why isn't your groom here?
"He's coming, he'll be here."
Did I gain a lot of weight?
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
This isn't going much like the picture by...
"Yea, I know."
"204, 00:18:15,886 -- 00:18:18,094 I wish it would be more like a normal job."
Now it's weird!
"206, 00:18:20,016 -- 00:18:21,882 I never really talked to a job before."
Listen...this might be some kind of a test.
Everything is a test when you're a career woman.
Damn right .
And thoses dresses aren't going to buy themselves.
I got it!
What?
I know what we can do!
What?
"Why don't we just go in there, blast him without thinking about it ?"
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"214, 00:18:40,911 -- 00:18:43,654 We don't even have to look either because we never going to miss at that distance."
"That's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
You think so?
Totally!
Cool.
But don't aim too high.
Why not?
We don't want to hit that little bird.
"Oh, yea, good thinking."
"Okay, ready?"
Ready!
Let's do it!
Who wants a snack?
"Be careful, they're hot."
Stop it!
- Your boyfriend is not a killing machine
- ...you hoped for.
- Henry!
But you built a great punching bag.
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- You stop it!
- Estelle...
Aren't you curious what this fucker will do to this fucker?
No!
Henry!
"You're a fucking rabbit and headless, aren't you?"
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's alright, you can put your hands down now."
"Three years, I've been waiting for this moment... and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin."
"For fuck's sake, come on!"
"Well, let's have a look, chick."
"Open the glove-box, please."
And get that whole contraction.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you...?
Are you married?
How's that working out for you?
"Yes, poor shocker."
Bright.
"Next, I need you to, uh... take your shirt off."
Come on.
We got to catch those three.
They might make trouble.
"You're not going, commodore."
For $10 million?
Don't be a jackass.
Headed toward the ferry.
"Boys, you grab a horsecar, cab, anything."
Get over to the ferry!
I'll take bessie.
Giddap!
Heaven preserve us!
There you are.
"Stay there, now."
Yah!
"Hey, move!"
Clear the road!
The colonel's in there!
"Come on, boys!"
Take it away!
You scoundrels!
I'll run you down if i have to crawl in every rat hole in jersey!
"Good-bye, commodore!"
The colonel is sorry he couldn't wait to receive you.
"And you take good care of bessie, cornele."
I'll pay you for the oats when i get back.
I thought you were going to jersey city with jim.
So did i.
Is he all right?
I hope so.
Would you think me rude if i wondered why you've come here?
Jim got a fool idea somebody was going to try to annoy you- look at you sideways or something.
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
Proof?
"Hell yes, proof!"
I'm not the kind to talk shit without backing it up.
"Don't be afraid, let him have a rest only."
Let some get fat only kilo.
Did you see that he ate the in crumbs chicken two times?
"Well...what right, it right."
"Ow, my mother, my mother,my sweet good mother, why you left me?"
!
Ow!
What is it?
Was somebody wounded?
"Nothing happened, major lord."
As if I would have heard a groan.
Well...
I was it.
As if somebody would have kept recalling his mother.
Well...is an a kind of bad habit only.
I like stretching out and then very...
I gtoan.
Yes?
I am really glad about this.
He fidget.
Why are you surprised at this?
100 mortal dangers is every day.9 months are in constant noise and smelliness.
"Well...what right, it right."
Let's go.
Let us lie.
Enough were the today's day already.
What was that?
Who's here?
Stop!
Who are you?
Major lord.
This evening is beautiful.
Give it a thought.
Think about it.
It's my mistake to have had a tea without getting you one.
Have a tea in my credit.
Perumal...
Sir.
"If this program becomes a hit, your photo will become viral on social media."
People will praise you as the ideal cop.
"After which... promotion, salary hike..."
- Get lost.
Panju Sir!
Panju Sir!
How long will you be an underdog?
When will you rise to occasion?
I'm going to pee.
Step aside.
Sir.
"Okay, Sir."
Greetings.
Inspector asked to come here.
Didn't you bring your gun?
I wonder how you will manage without it!
Go upstairs.
"Hey, crow!"
"Perumal, one strong tea."
Make it two.
"- Okay, Sir."
"What's up, Sir?"
Would you like to have any fried snacks?
No tension!
I gave an idea to change your image altogether.
Now it's upto you.
- I'll untie him myself.
"- Yes, that's right."
"Only one hand, that's all I need at you."
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
"- I'll take all day, if you order me around."
"I owe you one, anyway."
"Mate, look at your back."
- Never mind that.
Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
"I'm sorry, mate."
The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him.
It's our only chance.
"He's sacred, so they won't shoot us."
"Why, you hairless dog."
"Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy..."
"A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant."
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
"- Why don't you enlist, mate?"
Lash.
"For a beginning, this is not bad."
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
The sooner the better.
Oh.
I'll have him sent down here.
SKEETS:
"Yes, Mrs. Brendan?"
"Skeets, would you have Wilbur Hoolick sent to my office, please?"
Wilbur will be delighted to see you.
He'll be surprised to see me.
Gee!
"""Majuba diamond murderer."
"Police baffled."""
(MAN WHISTLING)
Wilbur's the killer!
"Boy, these straight razors sure do the job, boy."
"You know somethin', Mike?"
I want to thank you.
"You've been very, very helpful to me, and believe me when I tell you, I ain't gonna forget you."
You won't?
No.
"(STUTTERING) Well, I mean, I'd just as soon you would."
"What do you mean, pal?"
"We've been buddies, we're friends."
What do you mean forget you?
"And the gang back home, they'll love you."
But I'm too young to be with a gang.
"Yeah, maybe you're right, kid."
"Yeah, well, maybe we'll give you a few years."
"Wait, Willy."
Wait just a minute!
I won't tell on you.
Please!
"Please, don't kill me!"
A month back...?
Meeting...?
Is your meeting more important than your daughter's marriage?
Cancel that silly meeting.
Keep quiet.
You remember half  forget half.
Ministers meeting...?
"As said, fix the engagement in 2 days time."
Thank you.
Find out when was the Ministers meeting in Malaysia finalised.
Oh God!
My bladder is full.
Hey Halwa...
I can't take this tension.
I don't know how you will behave.
Tell me your next plan.
I'm planning to surrender.
Don't be tensed.
I am not selfish.
I give charity to everyone.
"Once I surrender, I will tell them your name too."
Even you will find some kick.
I'll be back soon.
- What should I do now?
- Run.
You...
You heard me right.
I said that.
Buy the ticket  run away before they lynch you.
You must know why we got separated.
I won't listen to you.
This is very important.
"Yes, I am."
- No.
"Dr Brandon is his physician, but he's on vacation."
I've treated him in the interim.
- Look.
His name's on the prescription.
- I didn't know.
- Did you prescribe those for Saul?
"- Yes, I did."
- Does he need them?
- They're nitroglycerine tablets - only to be taken in case of a heart attack.
Has Mr Greenberg suffered a seizure?
- Ruben?
"- Yeah, I'm back."
- How is he?
- He's still out.
His heart seems steadier though.
You have any problems?
"No, I left the ambulance in a dirt road off the jungle in Koko Head."
"But coming back, a coastguard cutter was dropping black flags in the water."
- It must be some kind of a warning.
"- Yeah, maybe to keep us in."
Don't worry.
"We'll get out of here tomorrow, no matter what."
- And the woman?
- We'll get her too.
- Give him an injection!
- What about his heart?
The hell with his heart!
inject him!
Hello.
He tried to escape.
You'll have to kill him.
Get my diamond before killing him.
I want that diamond at any cost.
Don't worry Bhai.
Have some opium and go to sleep.
I'm hearing a name that scary for the 1st time.
"Time is not good, let's go to the village."
We are in the village.
"Let's go to the city, Car is here."
I will kill him slowly.
Make a bomb.
Which blows.
"Laxminarayan will come, but he won't go back."
Listen to me carefully.
I've seen an old car on the internet.
"How is it, Sir?"
I want to buy this car.
Leave for Pondi now.
Check the car and give 1 lac as advance.
I will mail you the details.
"Which mail, Sir?"
"Sir, Today's Zapack mail comes very quick."
Fool.
I'll fax you from the computer turn on the fax machine.
"There are two fax machines here, which one, Sir."
Left or right?
Left.
Your left or my left?
My left.
"Which position are you in, Sir?"
Can't see on the phone.
This is your last chance.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"- May I see your ID, please?"
"- Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Good-bye, and thank you."
- 627...
- Wait.
What?
Am I wrong?
honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on Iine to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'II wait in the car.
"well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
really?
That is so sweet.
"also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
After all.
I always have to tell you twice.
Now you're so nicely raised by your balls.
- What's that?
Why did you flinch?
- Please forgive me.
You lie before me like a pig hoisted by its balls.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I know."
I'll just wash our glasses and then come.
Bye.
Miss Russo.
Mi...
"Miss Russo, it's Danny Ferman."
You ca...
So that's it?
You don't need anything else from me besides my statement?
There isn't much to do until we get toxicology.
But I can tell you now it's gonna say smack.
Okay.
She was a witness on the Malcolm Miller case.
Usually kill 'em before they testify.
She lied on the stand.
- I've seen it a thousand times.
"They finally think they're clean, then something stresses them out."
Like the trial.
And they just have a little too much.
I'll call you when I get the tox.
"But I promise you, she OD'd."
What about the juror assault?
Any leads on that?
"""To each according to his needs""."
My poor little thing.
Is it love?
My cub...
Love.
I'll show you.
Mommy!
The smell is the proof.
You don't leave a friend wounded in the trenches of old age.
Especially when they're incontinent.
"Here I am, my friend."
"Come on, get down here, you prick."
Do you want me to snatch you by the balls?
Jump off!
And don't fidget!
"Do you remember when, you told me that"
I am doing all this for Mary.
You were right.
"Do you know what a ""lost girl"" means in French?"
Nobody knows any more.
It's a woman that keeps on walking until she falls apart.
You can never help her.
Ever.
You can try to kill yourself.
That's all.
"Yeah, I know."
"You could tell me that I could have nabbed the Munch Bunch at the parking lot, or the villa..."
I'm not God.
I'm just holding his crayon.
That's all.
"one more point, I'm not like the ones you've dealt with at home."
Come on.
I don't have anymore.
"Otherwise, I would give you another one."
Don't worry about it.
Don't let them get you down!
"They can all go to hell, right?"
"Great, three days of ravioli."
How was your audition?
They expired last year.
Throw them away.
"Nonsense, what else should we cook?"
Are you going to sing for Toni?
"Well, if I survive the ravioli."
Then that'll be your new job?
Right.
Then you won't work here anymore?
You can always visit me.
Would you like that?
I don't care.
"- No Tom, and no ravioli  but for actual money."
... without Tom.
Bon appetit!
"For tonight's special event, it's best to pray  because it's probably dangerous."
- What?
The food has expired!
If that was the only thing?
Same old story.
Amen.
Amen.
- No ravioli?
No thank you.
- No thanks.
"I bet he goes to a restaurant afterwards, and takes Babette with him."
My agent's.
"You and me, given opportunities only because young men are gone."
Or dying.
"But to turn our back on those opportunities, even when one has suffered such great loss, wouldn't that be giving death dominion over life?"
Have you seen it yet?
Our film?
You should.
It's very good.
I'm awfully good.
And so are you.
Calling all small boats.
All seaworthy vessels to report to your local harbor master immediately.
"Dunkirk. on, Lily!"
I think they're gonna get 'em out.
"Then they're going to need all the boats they can get, aren't they?"
The Nancy.
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper up there.
I don't care if he's got a bleedin' cannon.
I'm not gonna sit by and watch him shoot a dog.
Aww!
What in the-
- What is that?
"It's France, Uncle Frank."
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never get us all out.
Hitler?
Hitler?
It just came to me.
"Gee, I'm awful glad you could stay, Wilbur."
"Oh, I am, too."
Except I can only stay over the weekend.
Oh.
Would you like to sit down for a while?
Okay.
"No, sit over here."
No.
Close your eyes.
Real tight.
(GASPS) Why do you want...
"Oh, you scared me."
I was going to ask you why you wanted me to close my eyes.
"Well, Wilbur seems to know his way around a campus, doesn't he?"
I can't understand that.
"I could have sworn he was the shy, studious type."
I'll say.
"Man, dig that crazy homework."
I better have a little talk with him.
I don't think he understands girls.
Neither do I. I wish you'd have a little talk with me.
I got to get out of here.
Hey.
Kiss me!
Kiss me!
"Oh, no!"
"Get away, you!"
"Remember, girls, tomorrow we're having a test on the alloyed group."
I want a list of all our enzyme experiments.
Are there any questions?
Class dismissed.
I want you to be strong.
I know I will.
Because you never let me down.
"Penguin, still there?"
"Yes, right here."
You can leave them at home safe with her mother?
"-Daddy, what are you talking about?"
-What are you talking about?
"Sorry, kids."
The career of his father came to an end.
"No, Dad."
"No, Dad."
Let's take a look around.
Can you see any way out?
"Yes, only creating a pair of wings."
-Can you move?
"-I'm stuck, pal."
"Okay, everybody, move away from the edge we depart the edge."
"Okay, do not move until I return."
Where you going?
I'll see what I can do by their father.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
This is another small step for a krill.
A great leap invertebrate without a cord.
Holy mother of krill!
"How is your appetite, Bill?"
He is great?
-What do you think you're doing?
Armando-strike.
Can not ...
You do not give boat you're a krill.
"All right, I'll show you how to set it."
You got five numbers.
"Left, right, left-right, left."
Full turns in between.
You'll hear a loud click when you're done.
"So, what's it gonna be?"
What about six-two-six-two-nine?
What is that?
"It's ""Nancy"" if you spell it out on the telephone."
You think that shit is slick?
Like nobody's gonna figure that out?
"And no kids' birthdays, either."
People can just look that up.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"- You like me, don't you?"
- Yeah.
- You want me to be your girlfriend?
- Yes?
I'm not gonna kiss you until I get my braces off.
"And that won't be for a while, like maybe even a year."
That's okay.
"Okay, then."
They're just roomier.
- Did you see it?
- At least they got her hair right.
"So, if this thing goes national, how much money are we talking?"
New dishwasher?
New house?
It's Isabelle's money.
- The law in California clearly states...
-Cooperate.
I like your reason.
Do you like my uniform?
I purposely prepared a white dress.
"If I let down my hair and wear heels, I'm really pretty."
More than the bride.
How is it?
So the concept for today is...
"You know if from first sight, right?"
Is it a virgin ghost?
It's an angel.
Let's go.
So what you're saying is that the person that Myeong Joo's father approved of is you?
Yes.
Please wait here for a moment.
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.
"So you are saying Sergeant Major Seo, Myeong Joo and you were a love triangle?"
Yes.
Hold my hand.
And it's still valid?
- Yes.
- Then how about your opinion?
Why are you curious about my opinion?
When was it that you dumped me...
I am just asking.
I am just asking.
I am not curious about your opinion.
Your earlier facial expression seems very curious.
Sit.
Hold on tight.
And don't fly away.
- Is it?
"You guys, nobody better fall sleep watching this commentary."
- Let's talk about this damn church.
- This is one of my favorite churches.
"- That's like Broadway, right?"
- Andy Samberg is genius.
- Famous street in New York.
"- Yeah, but it's..."
"Mike, why don't you talk about what it was like to film this?"
- How did you...?
"Yeah, you guys..."
- This was very late.
I remember it was the last thing in the night.
"- Andy was around for hours, though."
- Yeah.
"In fact, this was the same night as the convenience store thing."
- Right.
"- So this was, like, 6 in the morning."
"We started shooting the next scene at about 5, 5:30."
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
- This...
That.
- That.
Let's talk about that.
That is so good.
- It's so frigging good.
- Let's talk about it.
Let's discuss that.
"When you push those doors and you say, ""Yeah."""
Get out of my house!
This is my house!
Get out!
"Austin, what are you doing?"
I can't sleep.
Can I sleep with you?
When hell freezes over.
But I'm miserable.
I also threw up.
- Where?
- In the john.
But I still feel awful.
Okay.
I'll get you some ginger ale.
It'll settle your stomach.
I don't know how I got here.
"I mean, how did I become,"
"God, such a giant fuck-up."
Hey.
You were a...
pretty good doctor and a really good diet-pill salesman.
That was all bullshit-- the opposite of when I'm with my kids.
"That's when I was really myself-- watching ""Lost In Space,"""
"playing concentration, grilled cheese."
"Well, you are..."
on their level.
That is for sure.
"I always figured having kids would force me to grow up, but... it was the total opposite."
I knew who I was with my kids.
It's the only thing I was good at.
That is not true.
"You know it's true, Betty."
And you know what?
I'm gonna help you find your time capsule!
"Not tonight, though, 'cause sean and darrin are coming over,"
"And we're punching each other in the stomach,"
"You know, firming up the core,"
But tomorrow we're gonna find that time capsule!
"Oh, hey, Brick."
"Hey, when are you supposed to get your math test back?"
"Oh, I already got it."
Whoa.
Hold on.
How'd you do?
"Some might call it a very low ""d."""
Some might call it a d-minus.
What?
You did worse?
"Well, I was confident going in."
"Eh, well."
What are you gonna do?
This is nuts.
What do you think happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Ms. Rinsky is what happened.
She's just a bad teacher!
Mm.
Could be.
"She intimidates people, mike."
I experienced it firsthand.
You can't do math
"With those cold, dead eyes staring at you."
Brick probably melted down just like I did.
Probably.
For what?
"You moved on, started a family."
It wasn't that easy for the rest of us.
"Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being around, okay?"
But I'm here now.
It's too late for that.
"I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us."
(crickets chirping)
It's very late.
I didn't hear you come in.
"Well, I wanted to let you sleep."
It didn't go well with the men?
These guys saw hell.
"You know, most of them are still paying the price."
"You feel the effects of war, too, Booth."
Yeah.
"Yeah, but I got lucky."
I got a great family and great life.
Got all this.
"You're an addict, just like Aldo."
Yeah.
"Unlike him, you got help."
Yeah.
But you're in my corner.
That's the difference.
Aldo had no one.
(beeping)
Hey.
"I just, uh, dropped off Jessica."
"And, let me guess, you thought you might check in to see what I'm getting from Tompkins' video doorbell."
Looks like it's rough going.
I thought those things actually worked.
Then you bring me here?
How can i left you there?
Laxmi Narayan.
Now pain is gone?
Pain has just started.
What is she doing!
Why are you taking off your cloths?
How can i show you then?
No... no!
This is wrong... now i got your nature.
And you know my nature.
Laxmi Jee Relax... that's what happen in this age.
I am sorry... why?
Because of the way talked to you.
When?
When i told you to shoot me.
What was you fault...
I am not like that.
"If i didn't had problem, i would never say like that."
After my father left.
I am all alone.
Have to leave this house too.
"You know, that Mundaya was saying... if i don't pay him the money, i have to marry him."
"Better is that, i should kill myself i will kill you... if you talk like this."
"I am here, here it is, how much you need?"
I bought 25000/- only 25000/-?
"Don't worry... take this chain, worth 24000/- only?"
"Only means, its fake."
Take this ring.
It was for my just wife.
Just wife?
Yeah i just told Mina gay my wife.
Why should I tell them about her?
Don't know why they had come without even knowing her name?
"Hey, please listen to me..."
I will not.
I don't want to hear flashbacks of split ups.
I like as I'm now.
I feel something fishy.
Why isn't he listening to me?
I suspect him...
Why are you silent?
Do something.
What is your plan?
Why are you staring?
Do something.
What can I do?
I suspect him...
Say something please...
"Check, where is Kalyan?"
Can't you do it yourself?
"What happened, Halwa?"
Was I here only?
"You're here only, right?"
"Though I'm here, I'm not and though I'm not here, I feel I'm here."
Do something.
Something is happening without my knowledge.
Hey!
If you've guts remove the veil and beat me.
"Whether you're in veil or me, I'm getting the stick, right?"
"If you've guts, remove the veil."
"How can I be afraid of you, Halwa?"
I'll tell her everything.
Go ahead.
"- Well, thank you."
And I love your scarf.
Really brings out your vagina.
How come I have never thought of that before?
[ Grunts ]
[ Chuckling ] That's funny.
[ Whispering ] How can she be above me?
Do you realize she's a woman?
- Yes.
Why are we whispering?
- Because they can hear everything!
"- She's a topflight chef, Steven."
She ran her own restaurant.
- Ohhh!
"I don't care if she's a world-class balloonist... who can whistle ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"" out of her ass!"
- This should've been mine!
"- You're preaching to the choir, buddy."
- What?
Pino doesn't trust me?
- Why would he?
You stole his Vicodin.
- We don't need another chef.
"- Yes, we do."
"We're getting slammed, okay?"
And I'm just giving her the scut work.
"You're still my go-to guy, huh?"
You're my right-hand man.
You're the Sundance to my Butch.
"- Oh, good."
So I'm actually in charge.
- No.
What's she ever done that's so great?
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
"Combo, you seen Badger?"
Don't you cover for him!
"I ask you a straight-up question,"
I expect a straight-up answer!
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
You've got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I can only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
All right!
"Let's all go back to work, for Christ's sake!"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos have been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
What's this from APD?
I been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me.
- Rape isn't a joke.
- No.
- It is in this line.
"It gets a big laugh, though."
"Hey, we're about to do..."
"Oh, no, we're not."
"This, you're being pulled by a, whatever that's called, a dolly rig."
- These guys are towing the...
- Not actually driving.
Is this the night...?
"Oh, no, that's gonna be in another scene."
- Is this a real or fake background?
- This is all real.
- We're really being...
- That's 1 st Avenue.
"I don't think we had a fake background in the Yugo, did we?"
No.
"Oh, except when I'm, like, driving into the city."
- In the van we had a fake thing.
- Seth Meyers.
"- And Lorene Scafaria, the writer."
- Our writer.
Screenplay writer.
- She's so hot.
- These guys were great.
"Some people don't realize that that's Seth Meyers, right, Mike?"
"Some, yeah."
"A lot of people, actually."
I've mentioned:
"""Yeah, Seth Meyers was the guy in the back."""
"They're like, ""No way, that was him?"""
"- Wait, what were they like?"
So j... give me your skates.
What?
Why?
"You've dragged me so far, we're closer to my office than we are to the car."
Take 'em off!
He just wasn't ready.
But me?
I had a message for the small stuff that used to rule my life.
"Hey, Phil."
"Honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
"So, I'm at the beach..."
Long story.
"Anyway, I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor."
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
I'm kind of busy.
"Okay, great."
"Suck it, small stuff."
Why are we stopping?
"For many, a near-miss with death is a wake-up call."
"But when a man misses his own near-miss, he truly sees what he's been missing."
No more putting my dreams on hold.
"Five years ago, I made a bucket list."
It was time to start crossing things off.
Scariest moment of my life.
Ohh.
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you!
"But amazingly, something great came out of it."
I found out how my sister truly feels about me.
"Girls, are you sure?"
I wanna hear what she has to say.
"Bloody Mary, shadows have power, I get it."
But what if that's not just a shadow?
That look on her face is somebody who's trapped.
"Believe me, I know that look and so do you."
"If things get hinky, you can pull the plug."
What do you got to lose?
I do need to do this.
"Wait, wait!"
Let me think!
Where are you?
So Mr. Whitman doesn't look good.
- No sign of any artifact.
- Not even a glimmer.
- What's up with his hand?
- I don't know.
"If you want to get rest, I'll stay with them."
- Not if they split up.
- I'll call you.
"No, no."
Let's...
Let's stay together.
"If they've got something, it's on 'em."
I want to know what it is.
I've been burned by this before.
They look real and they'll say anything.
Say something.
"Artie, when I get out of here, I'm hugging her and"
I'm kicking your ass.
"Yeah, well, that won't be happening."
Why?
"- Artie, it's me."
We only went to dinner and then a movie.
"Harriet is not your daughter, Miss Golly."
"She is mine, and you have no idea, none, what it is like to come home and find"
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea that you'd be home this soon.
I don't care.
I don't care what you did or where you went or why.
All I know is this can never happen again.
Miss Golly... you are fired.
What?
!
No!
Just a moment.
This is my fault.
Please.
"Well, it seems awfully sudden."
Actually... maybe it's not.
"I think you're right, Mrs. Welsch."
It is time for me to go.
What?
What?
What?
"Now, look, I admit, I lost it... because, I just..."
I was frightened.
"But the thing is, the fact is we need you, Golly."
We can't do it alone.
"We all spoke out of turn, I think."
None of this is causing...
Absolutely not.
"Absolutely, no."
"I mean, I think we were talking about... our feelings out there."
"You were afraid and-and-and now what we should be focusing on, right?"
And why things happen this way and not the other.
I think there's no much use in talking about what happened already.
Probably...
You're always trying to explain people what happens to them.
Instead of looking to yourself.
"Once, I was thinking of you.."
And then I got sad.
Then I'm not funny always.
You never put any effort in a better living.
"For example, you say you like living in the field."
Then why don't you move here?
Would you come with me?
Why do you say that?
I'm saying if you'd live here with me.
I don't know.
I told you I may not like the idea.
What does that mean to what we were talking?
Do you love me Sara?
And what did that come from?
I'm asking you.
How I couldn't love you.
You're my father!
And if I weren't?
Imagine for a moment that I weren't.
What a nonsense!
What do I know?
Could you give me a cigarette?
I'm going to bed.
We had a long ride.
Good night.
Bye.
Good night.
- Knew it.
- Okay.
"All right, well, uh, what does his relationship status on his Facebook say?"
"""Facebook""?"
"I don't know, Grandpa."
We don't have a typewriter.
- Snap.
"- Oh, come on, Facebook is on a compute..."
"No, no, no, stop talking, because the more you say, the older we get."
"Okay, fine, I won't say anything."
"No, no, no!"
We can actually help this child.
"Unlike Lark, she's telling us what's wrong in words we can understand."
"Yeah, we're gonna tell you"
"- what you do here, okay?"
- Yes.
Just go over there.
"No, if we get too close, he might recognize us."
"Okay, well, uh, here."
He won't recognize us.
(stammers) He didn't know what we looked like before.
"Yeah, of course."
"Hey, will you put this on my birthday list?"
"Yeah, okay, one stupid hat."
Got it.
"What's up, Broseph Stalin?"
You looking for something special?
Maybe for a special someone?
You work here?
"- Yeah, we do."
We for sure do.
- Yeah.
"Unless I miss my guess, the extra gravity oughta do it."
The Temple.
Where's the treasure?
Where is it?
Professor.
I'm coming.
"What's the line in the riddle about, uh, the ancients and the Book."
"""The Book shall summon up the power of the ancient ones."""
The Book shall summon the power.
The Book.
Give me the Book.
"You want the treasure, give me the Book."
These aren't book pages.
But what else could they be?
They're punch cards.
It must be an ancient...
"It's a computer, and these cards program it."
"Kelly, slide these in where the symbols match."
"Professor, let me see the Torch."
Here.
But how does it run?
A computer needs electricity.
Maybe not.
The people of Atlantis tapped into the volcano for power.
They used geothermal technology.
You mean this thing runs on heat?
No.
Steam.
Look!
Treasure chests.
Stay back.
It's nothing but paper.
Would you mind autographing this for me?
Where did you get my picture?
From a little frame out by the door.
"Oh, hold on, that's mine."
"Oh, well, I'd prefer whenever you're smiling."
"- Do you, ever?"
"- Yes, when I'm amused."
"You know, I think I could use you in my fall production."
I don't play animal-act.
"No, really."
I'm putting on a Broadway show next season.
"You're putting on your show right now, and it's a flop."
Wait a minute.
I'll meet you out front.
Hey.
[laughing]
I hope you make it in time for your fall production.
How did I get in?
"Oh, man!"
"Goodbye, partner."
[screaming] Help!
[intense music]
[tapping foot]
[swing music]
- You're a college graduate?
"- Yes, sir."
- Travelled here and abroad?
"- Yes, sir."
- How many languages you speak?
"- Five, sir."
"Well, I think we can use you."
"Salary, 22.50 a week."
I don't know where it is.
"Well, maybe you could find it."
"3,000 bucks."
"Well, that will get me back, but not in style."
I can get you another two when we get to the States.
"It's important, Marion."
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
"See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones."
"Good evening, Fraulein."
The bar's closed.
We...
We are... not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
Must've slipped his mind.
The man is... nefarious.
"I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it."
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
"Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?"
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
Here.
Any time.
Thanks.
Uh...
where do I start?
The first step is admitting to someone that you love and trust that you're powerless before your addiction.
That's not going to be easy.
"No, it's going to hurt like hell, but the program works, it really does."
Hi there.
STONETREE:
So how do we know it's the same killer?
Similar MO.
Kills with the victim's... choice of drug.
"Uh, Lewis..."
mind if I bum one?
Thanks.
If the killer knows their addictions...
He knows them pretty well.
"Maybe very well, if you know what I mean."
When?
Fairly close to the time of death.
After the meeting?
Yep.
How about the last victim?
"Uh-huh, that's why I checked."
Okay.
Well...
"Let's make some connections, uh..."
"Do we have the, uh... members' last names?"
"Yeah, and the telephone numbers."
Sign-in sheet from the meeting.
"Though, I got to tell you, I feel a bit like Judas."
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The fuckin'shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean to say that.
I just mean that he's scaring me.
I just need help.
"Help me, please."
You know anything about this fuckin' restaurant business?
He knows everything about it.
He's in the joint 24 hours a day.
"Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool."
That's how often he's in there.
You want me to be your partner?
is that what you're tryin' to tell me?
You want me to be partners?
What do you think I'm talking about?
"Paulie, please."
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
"God bless you, Paulie."
You've always been fair with me.
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
We would have met him coming in.
Fantomas could not have escape.
Let's be coherent.
Where do you believe he's hiding?
Guess.
Guess?
Instead say you know nothing.
You made us lose enough time.
You would be better looking through the floors.
Useless.
Fantômas has not left these four walls.
This is absolute madness!
"Mr Nanteuil, would you please do me a service and draw plans of this floor?"
I can not draw.
Do your best.
Fine.
If you insist...
"I will prepare the ink and paper, Mr Nanteuil."
But what are you doing?
Oh!
I brought a little snapshot:
These prints are identical.
And these are the fingerprints of Jacques Dollon.
What is this story?
This is madness!
Mr Juve.
This is a journalist's trick!
It would be easy to make another print from my finger.
You'll see I'm not Jacques Dollon.
No need.
I saw through your act a second ago.
The hand of Jacques Dollon.
New Bern is on its way.
There are 70... maybe 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
"All right, let's get ready!"
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location through the satellite.
"Well, can they?"
"If they have time, yes."
Do you know who it is?
"My guess is, it's, uh, Valente."
"What, him?"
"From, uh..."
from Homeland Security?
"I don't know who he's working for now, but he told Sarah to get the bomb any way she could and to eliminate all witnesses."
All the witnesses.
Shut it down.
"No, I can't."
We just have to make sure we disconnect the feed before he finishes the trace.
Hey.
I don't get it.
Why are they just standing there?
I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
Can't make a perfect world.
"No matter what, shit happens."
It felt really nice to be desired today.
It meant a lot.
Thank you.
"Honey, i always desire you."
"Usually, it just annoys you."
No.
You want to have sex all the time.
"Today, you desired me."
okay.
Okay.
We still don't know the truth about jane.
I'm just saying.
Madeline had anger issues.
Itty bitty ball of rage.
Wanna see her rage issues?
"Call her ""itty bitty."""
"Renata had the whole kind of ""sexy praying mantis,"
"Bite your head off after sex"" thing going."
"Oh, yeah, that bonnie's just the sweetest thing."
"Yeah, right."
"Celeste-- she is an accomplished attorney,"
And some people in this town resent that.
"Rich, beautiful, madly in love."
Something had to be wrong.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you thinking?
I'm trying to decide whether i'm happy or sad.
People usually know.
I'm sad because--
Like being so co-dependent you flunk your test.
You are like a detective.
I'm close to identifying the bad guy.
You already know half my life story.
Some of your questions even my mom has never asked.
Are you saying I'm nosy?
No.
"Why would I say that, doc?"
"You should get more sleep, doc."
How do you know I didn't?
I am an expert on this.
"Just looking at your eyes, I can tell."
"Lately, I have exams."
I recommend Redbull mixed with coffee.
You can stay awake until dawn.
And that's good?
It's okay.
It's not like we're 20 anymore.
"Back then, staying up 2 nights was nothing."
"But in our 30's, our body starts breaking down."
How long can you stay awake?
5 days.
Like the X-men.
It's my special power.
But I'm okay.
I feel totally fine.
"I can do it, doc."
It's... necessary.
I think you should stop.
"This is my profession, how can I stop?"
"If you can't stop, can you do less?"
I can't.
"- Write, I guess."
Write?
What about?
You've had no life!
"Anyway, it doesn't matter."
I don't want it anymore.
I didn't know you before.
You were just some bloke.
But now...
We're friends.
I think.
I don't want to do it.
The money's not important.
"It might not be to you, but it is to me."
I want some of that to go to Frances.
Ten grand.
"Look, Paul, son."
"If this weekend showed me anything, it's that I want some good to come of my passing."
"Now, if I jump from that bridge, the only thing I would've left behind was a traffic jam all the way up to the Angel."
This way...
I get to give something to me little girl.
That's something I wasn't able to do when I was alive.
And you'll get your money.
Everyone's a winner.
- Now that's how I want it.
"- For fuck's sake, I don't want the money!"
I'm an idiot.
I didn't think things through.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not."
It's crazy.
I can't do it.
I won't.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- It's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
"Well, uh, just a minute."
"Dr. Alison, what's your off-the-cuff estimate"
- of Sally's condition?
"- Stay with her, Sergeant."
"Yes, sir."
"Here, Sally, let me help you."
This is Dr. Alison from the consulate.
"Without a complete diagnostic check-up, which we can only do properly at a medical office,"
I would say she is really a super chimp.
"Her heart has a steady beat, and she appears to be in astonishingly good health considering her fantastic voyage through space."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I want to get back"
- to my famous patient.
- Message received.
"I'll be needing you, Doctor."
Thanks.
"That's right, Nagoro."
We'll keep in touch.
Out.
That's it.
We're gonna lift her.
Put your hands under her.
- You get that end.
- Right.
Up we go.
"1, 2, 3, lift."
Here we go.
Now we'll turn.
(SERGEANT):
"You'll be all right, pal."
(CAPTAIN):
Here we go.
I'll get her from the front.
These might be the worst sounds ever made in this room.
It's not what it looks like.
"Yes, it is!"
This is exactly what it looks like.
Mason and I love each other.
"Nope, not buying it."
Mason's totally out of your league.
What are you guys talking about?
But you're going to tease me.
"No, we're adults."
I'm not going to tease you.
Okay.
[sighs]
I like Emma.
[mocking]:
Ooh!
So you like Emma.
"That's big, weird news."
"I would use it to my advantage, but you already do everything I ask without question."
"Well, it wasn't news to me."
I know everyone's secrets.
I was head bitch on my high school cheerleading squad.
"Huh, you know nothing about me."
Calf implants.
"I just, uh..."
looked at the brochure.
"Yes, Jack, I like Emma, but don't worry."
I have a foolproof plan to win her over.
"Unless it involves some kind of enchanted amulet,"
I find that hard to believe.
Boom!
Behold.
I'm not him.
"Uh, I know that, Aubrey."
(chuckles anxiously)
"He left his wife, he left me."
"You know, I would-- I would never ever do that."
What are you saying?
"I'm saying that... when I commit to something, it's real."
That I'm serious about us.
Did I say the wrong thing?
No.
"Of course not, Aubrey... (sighs) ...but there's a lot going on."
I know.
"And when it's all taken care of,"
I'm gonna feel the same way.
BRENNAN:
"I know this is difficult, Booth, but... (groans) ...you're gonna get through it."
"Yeah, sounds like something Aldo would have said."
He was right.
(Booth groans)
"Yeah, but this is different."
"Bones, he, um... he died... 'cause he was trying to protect me."
What do you mean?
You know that X-ray that we saw in the sound studio?
I know who that was.
There was no name on it.
I looked for that.
He died of a gunshot wound in the head.
Center core.
"3,000 feet away."
I'm the one who made that shot.
That is a ridiculous assumption.
There are other snipers capable...
"- Hold it, don't move!"
- Stay down!
Breaking Bad
2x08
- Better call Saul
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
You are under arrest.
I'd better call Saul!
Hi.
I'm Saul Goodman.
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!"
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, I know."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
Ye...yes.
"If this is good to get this to cinemas, we'll have a few of them standing."
Well done.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Do I have the job?
Well why not?
"Twins after all, double the slob."
Temporary secondment to bake the productions.
No screen credit.
Ministry wages.
I need more.
I could throw in less.
I need more than Ministry wages.
I'll talk to Baker.
Leslie Backs birthday mine.
Still staggering around the studios giving his unhinged love to young ones back...
Oh!
"No, no, no Ceres."
Too much glass.
"You know if you'd paid your clients half as much attention as do that hyena, you might actually be an agent worth having."
Spitfires.
Won't you help a bird?
"Ambrose Hilliard, a man with the glimpse."
Oh!
I know him a celebrity.
Would you do him for me?
Would you?
Inspector Chamforth?
Someone has made a mistake.
It's a simple mistake.
And it's easy to him.
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number!
All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number!
All's well!
Chaar Number!
All's well!
Paanch Number!
All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
"Come on, get it up there at the double."
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
"Come on, hurry up, I told you."
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
"What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?"
"Annie, get your back into it!"
Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
"You can't work 24 hours a day, you know."
"In another 24 hours, my time will be up."
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
"Get it up, hurry up."
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
- Brandon Mayhew.
- Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
- I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home, like the rest of us with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man!"
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Ok.
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
And a felony quantity.
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
"The cops around here are like butchers, always got their thumbs on the scales."
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm going to get you a second phone call.
"You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader, and they're going to deliver me a check for $4,650."
I'll write that down on the back of my business card.
4-6-5-0.
A few.
Through my dad.
"Look, I spend half my life trying to get people like Cleaver Greene to pay their tax."
How do you think that makes me feel?
This is a chance for me to do some good.
So do it.
Knock 'em dead.
I have to go study.
TV:
"Then let it go, and crouch, and hold."
CLEAVER:
"Morning, folks."
Stretch out the whole body and...
Pica hardly sleeps here.
Just comes to paint and read.
I've no idea what he does with the rest of his time.
"I shouldn't let him stay, really, but he's quiet and he's a gentleman."
"There you go, my lad."
"Come on, boys, out of there."
Finnegan.
She is your teacher!
She's meant to be telling you about Jane Austen.
It is age inappropriate sex!
It's bloody great sex.
"At your age, you should be having exploratory sex with a girl your own age."
And maybe some oral.
"Oh, yuck."
"The damage you are doing to your psyche could be irreparable, darling."
I know.
I'm trained.
"Well, I'm not ending it."
It is immoral!
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen,"
I guess that just about wraps it up.
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
"Well, I know what I've got here."
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know... a drink?
Subtitles resynced by Maza
The poison is still fresh...three days.
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would have killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
Come on!
Teach me.
Are you afraid?
You're right.
Because they're all dead.
All my teachers.
-What time is it?
-What?
We go to the club.
"We go to the club, we'll dance."
"There's nothing else to do, we might as well dance."
"Come on let's go, let's go."
-Are you looking for Adrian?
"-Adrian is dead, it's every man for himself."
"I'm delighted to see you, you don't know how it thrills me."
-You're glad?
-Sure I'm baby you're the man.
I love your sexy body.
-You're freaky.
"-Sure I'm baby, freaky for you."
Let's go to my place.
Come on.
Well now that we've had dinner and coffee and everything...
Why don't you take off your jacket and make yourself at home.
I really should update my notes.
"You're absolutely right, now is ""the"" perfect time."
This is gonna be the fuck of your lifetime.
-I got some coke.
-I don't care about that.
I just want you...now.
"Orgasms, wasn't that the subject we were discussing?"
I think that right now I should study the alien.
The first days are different from now.
Serving tea to your husband is work now?
is it the same?
"Yes, but it's not work."
"Whether you make tea or serve it, it's work."
"I serve you tea, it does you good."
But no one takes care of me to help me relax.
I know you're exhausted.
Serving tea is work these days.
Don't take any photos.
I have three jobs.
"I have three jobs, not you."
And the third is the hardest and most important.
Don't take any photos!
- l should have kept it.
- l'll put it away.
- l said no photos.
- All right.
I won't do it again.
Don't men have a third job?
Only women?
We don't?
"If men don't do their third job, they'll be dishonoured."
Their third job weighs as heavily as a mountain.
It's a very hard job to do.
It's not as simple as you think.
is that wrong?
- Mashti Hatam!
- What?
"Come on, come on."
The engineer's forgotten his camera again.
He's as distracted as me.
"Right, OK."
Anyone else won't stand for it?
Raise your hand if you won't stand for it.
"That is good to know because we do need to make some redundancies, so you're all fired."
What?
I was stretching!
I will stand for it.
We need to reduce spending pretty urgently.
"I'm afraid it's a case of 'no pain, no grain'."
"Yeah, Prof, the company bought this gold jug for the tournament later."
Mm-hm.
"So we'll need a bit more pain, then."
Sorry.
Let's lose...
the guy with the monobrow and Lena the cleaner.
What?
You can't fire Lena!
Why are you still here?
"End of meeting, everyone back to work."
Apart from those who've been sacked.
You have to go.
Now.
Not even fixed the squeaky door!
"Mmm, fish eggs."
Cor.
Workers united will never be defeated!
The workers united will never be defeated!
"Oh, no, please!"
I'm a worker too!
I'm working very hard here!
Lena's worked here for 45 years.
"So she probably needs a rest, then!"
"Yes, it is."
Hey I'm sorry man I forgot.
You people don't have deserts and this dry heat do take some getting used to.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Mr. Jenkins.
Yeah?
We are busy men.
Me too.
So you do know what we need.
Oh yeah.
Nick you said you have some big stuff you need greased through the boarder.
Yes.
"Well I handle the number three artery into California, the night shift."
I could smuggle through a heard of elephants if I had enough capital.
That's true.
Billy here is the very best.
He's your man.
So what do we move?
So what do we move?
"When the time comes, we'll let you know."
"Sure thing, konnichiwa."
I've been studying.
I might be playing baseball in Tokyo next year.
I'll call you.
"Ok, partner."
All right.
So what do you think?
He was nervous.
"It's a big opportunity, anyone would be."
Are you sure about him?
Absolutely.
Your answer?
Echidna?
"Echidna, show me your first letter."
Let's see if you're right.
"Yes, indeed, in the nick of time."
What is an echidna?
It sort of scuttles a bit.
It scuttles a bit?
!
It's a spiny anteater.
That's what I was going to say...
Of course you were!
Of course you were.
It's on the five cent coin.
It's a monotreme isn't it?
"It's a monotreme, an egg-laying mammal."
"Geniuses, I'm surrounded by geniuses."
"OK, where are we so far?"
"Araucarians, you're on one, welcome to the game."
"Lutrophiles, you're racing ahead at the moment with seven."
"You know what's going to happen now, it's going to get a bit harder."
"Because now I'm looking for two answers, and you must spot both to score the point."
"Lutrophiles, are you ready?"
Reveal the hive.
Picasso...
"Picasso's there, is Spain there?"
It might not be.
No.
I don't think it is.
It's not.
Brack?
No.
And the pig's tongue is for you only.
I wanted to fool you!
"I want to take your advantage, so what?"
I won't give it a damn to tell you the truth.
"It's hot, and life is boring,"
"I just want to have fun, isn't it alright?"
That's alright!
"Well, it's OK then."
Why do you stare at me?
"Because of our friendship,"
I'll let you kiss something anyways.
You'd better ask her.
Excuse me.
"Chan Mon-gut, you are a married man, why do you still date me for dinner?"
You'll make me misunderstand something.
Haven't you thought of my feeling?
A smart guy isn't a big shot.
Miss Shiu.
Very simple!
She secretly admires him.
He fooled him.
He wants to kiss her.
You are mad at him.
"I wanna beat you, you know?"
Siu-tso!
Lend it to me.
Miss Shui...
Please wait!
"Miss Shui, it's dark outside, let me show you the way home."
"No, you'd better lend me the lantern."
I'll return it next time.
Next time?
Now get ours.
That ship's not taking off without us.
You got that?
- Halt!
"- Oh, please don't shoot!"
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell are you doing
"- out here, lady?"
- I was being held captive.
By Nazis?
"No, worse."
- Your helmet.
- What about it?
I've seen it before.
"Paper, do you have paper?"
Something to write with.
"Lady, I think you're in shock."
Please!
Yeah.
"So if it wasn't Nazis, who were you running from?"
I need your helmet.
Now!
"I'm sorry, my love, but this game is not over yet."
"Despite my wishes to pursue Savage alone, it seems that you're all intent on seeing this thing through till the bitter..."
Oh!
Speaking of bitter.
You knew.
You dropped us off five months later
- because you knew.
- Knew what?
"You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister."
- I'm afraid that that...
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know, I don't know how to say this."
I...
"You know, the things I deal with you and me don't have much of a..."
"What you might call ""an experiential overlap."""
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen might happen, might not happen."
Fifty years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine.
Okay.
And I came to realise it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So...
Get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"Ten thousand even, same as last time."
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30 44, five each."
Three pounds should be 48 each.
Who's short?
All right.
Look at that.
Another p--pregnant female.
There.
Which cake?
One of those or one of those?
-
"- No, thank you."
I don't think so.
-
- A bit of cream's all over it.
"Really, I only came in looking for French cigarettes."
I don't suppose you have any French cigarettes.
"No, but we have English ones you can s--smoke with a foreign accent!"
-
- I only smoke the French.
-
- Best thing that could happen to them!
I remember a shop like this when I was a child.
"Yes, so do I. This is it!"
-
- It's long since been condemned.
-
"- As a matter of fact, we are on the verge of the same thing ourselves."
-
- Really?
-
- On account of the frats.
-
- The frats?
-
- Yes.
They're everywhere.
You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach!
Get on the ground!
Hold it right there.
Don't move.
Stay down.
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!
"Hi, I'm Saul Goodman."
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque."
Better call Saul.
"Saul Goodman, attorney at law, 505-1 64-CALL."
That's 505-1 64-CALL.
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, no."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
- Me!
You're about to see a trick by Foguinho the Magnificent.
Wait right there.
This is a very special box.
It came from a very serious land.
- Do you see anything inside?
- No.
"It is a magic box, you see?"
When I go like this-
A rose for the pretty girl!
"Can we get some applause, kindly?"
You'll share this room with Quico for now.
"This is all yours, my darling."
Do you like the room?
It's really high.
"Put your things away, darling."
What is the matter?
There's a whole closet just for you!
We're used to it Mrs. Maria Cecília.
"At the circus, we don't get a lot of room."
"It doesn't matter, my love."
We'll get you settled in later.
There's no rush.
Enjoy the party.
"There are so many kids here, and so many sweet treats."
Go on over to the living room.
"Go play with Foguinho and the kids, sweetie."
Barbuda will be right there.
She's so quiet.
She's been lately always thinking...
- Thinking about what?
- Like I'd know!
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
"Whatever the case, she... fell in love with someone else."
Who?
A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.
I only saw him once.
From a distance.
They died in a car accident.
How does your daughter figured that it's your fault?
"Well, my daughter didn't know about the affair."
She blamed me for the breakup.
And consequently the... car accident.
Well... did you ever tell her the whole story?
- No.
- Why not?
Because I want her to remember her mother the way she does now.
That's stupid!
You're stupid!
- Thank you.
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
- What?
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
Very much.
"Well, at least she did somethin' right."
"Now, I'm gonna get some bullets and we've done with all these."
Tell Violet.
"You like my partner, don't you?"
What's not to like?
She's....a sweet girl.
Do you like her better than me?
I don't know you as well.
That's okay.
I like her better than me too.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
Ew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, it's-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
- You said this was gonna scare 'em.
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume.
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that would scare the pants off of you.
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes.
Stories to make your blood run cold.
- Yeah.
- Stories to terrify you.
Yeah.
"And whoever shall last through the night, shall be named the King of Halloween."
I accept.
We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wunderbar!"
Huzzah!
OK.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick-or-treaters.
Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
- Trick or treat.
I shall begin.
"No, Sonny."
Let her go.
"Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet."
"Don't do this, Sonny."
I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.
"Please proceed to the elevator, detective."
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.
Go!
Go!
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.
"Kill her, the way you were going to kill me."
"Sonny, get the nanites."
"Yes, doctor."
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.
That's V.I.K.I.
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
They'll infect her entire system.
Spooner!
What is it with you people and heights?
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.
"Oh, this is poor building planning."
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?
Yes.
But it just seems too heartless.
"Okay, we're good."
You're both disgusting.
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.
So what are you gonna do?
Go backpacking... if you'll have me.
"Well, it's too late. i'm..."
I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
who?
- It's me.
Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time."
Melissa and i.
Oh. really?
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.
I want to do something for me.
And we'll just go as friends.
Don't worry. it won't be anything romantic Unless you know we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie
So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.
What's wrong with my tie?
Mm. i need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
So i'm the one who does the good deed
And that guy goes off with the girl?
It's good to be that guy.
Do you...you go here to n.y.u.?
I wouldn't.
Now put the gun down.
- Oh!
- You shot him!
- Are you okay?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I thought that's what the nod meant.
- It was.
It was awesome.
"It was actually just like the end of ""Speed,"""
which is a pretty good movie.
"It's not as good as ""Die Hard."" ""Die Hard""'s perfect."
"- Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis."
"- Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis."
"Same page, still."
- Get out of the car!
- Young Jeezy take the wheel!
"- Freeze, punk!"
"- Yeah, freeze, punk!"
"- Gina, where did you get that gun?"
- Lost and found at the storage facility.
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.
"- Hey, Figgis."
"My fiancé, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you,"
I should read you this letter.
"""I want to lick the skin off your body, baby."""
"Oh, that side's for me."
"""I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy."""
"- We're sorry we doubted you, sir."
You really saved our butts.
- I can't take credit for that.
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know."""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
- What's your point?
- You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"- That's my job, isn't it?"
- That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just...
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
Most of all friends.
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
"A man's life is not the bricks, it's the mortar."
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff...
!
"Health and Safety, rummaging through me stock!"
"All right, they found a little few things."
Couple of mice.
"So what's, what's the...?"
Few rat droppings in the lemon bonbons.
Couple of fruit salads was way past their sell-by date.
Three years.
"That's not a crime, though, is it?"
"Well, enough to get you shut down."
Is it enough for you to kidnap him?
That's what I want to know.
I'll tell you what I know - he don't know nothing about sweets.
And I've got sweets running through my veins!
I know that.
Look at me!
I know that.
"I'm on my own, I've got nothing!"
Open up.
"There you go, it's all right."
It's all right.
"Plenty of other, there's plenty of other sweet shops out there."
Could I have a bit of the strawberry laces?
There you go.
"I had everything, now I've got nothing!"
"There you go, eh?"
Time was of the essence.
We headed to the station.
For clues?
No.
For something a little more important than that.
"Come on, O'Leary, follow me."
Lieutenant caine.
The beatles played on this stage.
I know that.
I was here.
You come alone?
Just like I said I would.
Why here?
I like my privacy.
"What's this all about, caine?"
Where'd you get this photo?
You let jesse cardoza take the fall for something you did.
"What exactly do you want, caine?"
I want you to come clean.
All right.
We knew enright had murdered his wife.
"And we had him, too."
Dead to rights.
"When I saw that cuff link,"
"I knew that his slick lawyers would get him off,"
So I pocketed it.
"No harm, no foul."
The right guy goes down.
And that's the way it should be.
But I had no idea
Cardoza had already taken a photograph of it.
So you allowed it to look like he tampered with evidence.
I figured he was young.
Get a couple weeks
"Desk duty, slap on the wrist."
"Yes, but it didn't turn out that way, did it?"
No.
His wife was murdered- probably by enright.
-You got change of 20?
"-Oh, yes, sir."
What's your number again?
-82.
-82.
I put your number ahead of the other guys.
"-Thank you, sir."
-I like the way you work.
"All right, let me look at that robe a minute, will you?"
"Get this polished while you're down there, too."
"This may be a little gaudy for the Waldorf, but in certain sections of Manila, may I tell you...?"
"Hey, look, kid, uh, where's the latri-- uh, the shower?"
"Right over there, sir."
"Be a little indecent, showering alone."
You're all right.
-Did I get your number?
-82.
"Yeah, all right."
"Oh, I want this suit pressed."
I want those creases you can cut butter with.
I'll do it right away.
"Wait, hold it, this is the important..."
See these stripes?
"When you steam it, don't get 'em up."
You know what I mean?
-Keep 'em nice and shiny.
-I certainly w...
Six stripes?
"Well, you're a master sergeant."
How do you know?
Were you in the service?
"Oh, yes, sir, I was a lieutenant."
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
Kaya gave me a voice message to translate to you.
It's in this thumb drive.
"I'm going to begin, ok?"
Are you mixed?
Hi Gym.
I'm sorry about keeping my interview at the factory a secret.
I love you
But we hardly have anything in common.
"For example, our interests culture attitude religion and how to live life."
I think we won't make it together.
We can't really communicate and understand each other.
Communicate my ass!
We slept together every night!
Umm I don't know.
I'm here just to translate.
"I'm going to continue, ok?"
I hope you will meet the right person one day.
You are right for me.
I don't want to listen anymore!
Ok.
That's fine.
If you don't want to listen anymore.
Wait.
You're the one who taught her English?
Yes
This is your fault!
Damn it!
What the hell are you looking at?
Is that a bomb?
"Excuse me, what is that?"
Chicken soup I think.
Chicken soup?
"Not very much, Father."
It's just been bothering me for 15 years.
What did you do with those fountain pens you stole?
- Rocky!
You old...
"- Jerry, glad to see you."
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I'm glad to see you.
Good to see you.
Fifteen years.
Hasn't changed a bit.
- You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.
- Remember it?
He used to stand right where you are and boil the tar out of me.
"Gosh, 15 years."
It doesn't seem possible I haven't seen you in that length of time.
- I've seen you.
- You have?
Where?
I was there when you made the 90-yard run against NYU.
- Why didn't you come back and see me?
- Some people were waiting for me.
- Oh.
"Well, I got a kick coming, though."
- You have?
What?
- Why haven't you written to me?
"- You know how it is, Jerry."
"I changed my address and number so often, you had no way to answer me."
You know what happens to letters written in the stir.
Everybody reads them.
"Um, I don't think she would."
Why not?
"Well, you see, it's like plants."
There's a time and a season for things to grow and bloom and then they fade and die away.
"Your mother and I have, uh, been through a lot of seasons together."
You mean you just don't like each other.
"No, no, no, no, I don't mean that."
"Well, you don't."
"No, we don't."
Why not?
I'm not the man that she wanted me to be.
And she's not the woman I fell in love with.
We both fell in love with a picture-- in our heads.
Not with each other.
Am I just a picture in your head?
"No, no, no, no."
You're the only thing I love in this world.
I don't want to go.
I know.
[sobs]
Do I have to?
"Well, it'll be a great vacation for you."
"Yeah, who wants to go out west?"
"Oh, what do you mean?"
"Arizona, Death Valley-- all those horses and cowboys and Indians."
"Yeah, bang, bang-- great."
Your mother's got a friend out there.
She told me.
You might like him.
"Well, you might."
"Billy, she's lonely."
She's doing the best she can.
Last number to call and last number dialled.
- How was she?
- What does that mean?
- Did she seem suspicious or anything?
- All right.
A bit trusting.
I wouldn't let anybody into my house like that.
- That's cos you're a hard-faced bitch.
- Sorry!
"Well, you steal credit cards from vulnerable women."
- Just a moment of madness?
- No.
I fell for a cheap whore in a bar.
"Well, it had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
I'd advise you two to get a room but you already have.
"Shut up, Calum."
"Now, sit nice and try not to lick the windows."
"Hello, is that the Longbay Hotel?"
"Could you put me through to lain Risdale, please."
- Yeah.
That's him.
"- John, check the words to this."
Yo!
And I ain't chatting no black talk.
"- ""Yo"" means ""I"" in Spanish."
- Very impressive.
"There's more. ""Yo no soy marinero. "" ""I ain't no sailor. """
"""Soy Capitan. "" ""I'm Captain. """
- I've found Risdale.
"- To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
I'll find a ride home.
No fair.
How come he can leave?
Nobody's leaving!
We just got here.
Our fun is only starting.
Let's hit that hill!
Yay!
Last one to the bottom is a rotten...
Fuck!
Ice-ball!
Goddamn it!
"If you cross my path today, Murphy,"
"I will scalp you, shit in the scalp, and slap it back on your head so everybody calls you ""shit wig"" and..."
- Hey!
"- Oh, man, don't hurt me!"
Yeah!
You better run from me!
"I'm afraid of your wife, you out-of-work pussyfart!"
"You see that, Sue?"
Everybody knows.
I can't even intimidate children anymore.
"Don't let him bother you, Frank."
He'll be in jail soon.
We can still have fun.
Smile a little!
"I'm trying, but I'm sick of all these busybodies looking at me like I have a fatal disease."
"""Oh, you poor man, how's the job hunt going?"""
"""I don't know, lady, how's your saggy tits going?"""
It's all in your head.
People love you.
"Come on, cheer up."
I want Pete back.
"I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room."
Fine.
I thought you were going to quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Yeah.
"Thank you, good night."
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
[Horn honking]
Hello?
Excuse me?
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, do you think there's two lines and we're all in this line and you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
You believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"Now I want all the hot dogs, please."
"Yeah, I'm buying all the hot dogs."
You don't have to do that.
"No, no, no, You don't have to do that."
That is ridiculous.
And I'm giving them to the good people.
You'll be OK.
[Barks]
[Woman] Washed up from a shipwreck.
"Oh, the poor thing."
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
- [Woman hums] - [Gasps]
I'll just...
I'll just get this washed for you.
"[Gasps, splutters]"
"Well, you must have at least heard about this girl."
- No!
- Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
[Burps]
- Really.
"- Madam, please..."
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
"If Eric's looking for a girl,"
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.
[Gasps]
[Knife glistens]
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion...
"I'm tellin' ya, Grim."
She was real.
"I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her."
"[Woman laughs] Come on, honey."
Don't be shy.
"Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?"
"Uh, you look wonderful."
- I hope he does.
I hope my guy does.
Is that... is that the guy you're supposed to meet?
"- No, maybe that's yours."
"- No, I don't think so."
Are you Richard?
- How you doing?
"- Hey, Richard."
I'm Nathaniel.
"- Yeah, I figured it'd be you."
- Nice to meet you.
Right.
Right.
"There was a policeman here and a policeman here,"
- and the dead man was here.
- And where were you?
I'm pretty sure that I was over here.
"So when you came in, were the policemen already there?"
"No, no."
"I see this face of this guy, and he didn't look very well."
Did you know he was dying?
Was it clear to you that...
I've never seen anybody die.
So I don't think I would know that.
"I've seen one or two dead men, and they don't look like that."
They look very peaceful.
- He didn't look peaceful?
- No.
"You remember that, that he didn't look peaceful?"
What was... what was the...
I mean...
He just didn't.
- You missed a great party!
Everybody was there.
I could have stayed all night...
But Paul forgot his stupid disk and we had to come...
- all the way back uptown.
- Bummer.
We won't keep you from your work...
I'm sure it's very important.
"Come on, Paul, I wanna go home."
"Jocelyn, don't work too late, will you?"
You are pathetic!
What a disgrace!
- You're fired.
- You are over!
What are you doing?
"You are stupid, you're a bad person!"
You fool.
You ashamed Skirt and you're never ever gonna work here again.
You!
A new fuse!
Look at you!
You're fabulous!
You're incredible!
"The eyes, the hair, the smile!"
That's it:
The new muse!
I know her wicked ways
The parts you never see
Our supergirl You are our supemodel.
Although you have a reputation
Can I afford
To abandon my station
Are you going to clean it?
The Blue Diamond Hotel is right beside it.
I want to go there.
Do you see that bufalow?
"Yes, On the right."
Follow it.
It takes bath everyday in it.
What Madam?
You're just wasting time.
There's nothing in my bag.
I can see that you're a riot without a weapon.
"Show me the bag, okay go ahead."
See this is a pant.
And this is my Gun!
Where did that come from?
Put the gun down and surrender.
Yes I'll put it down but first let me think where it came from?
Give me the gun or...
I'll beat you so bad.
No Madam don't come forward.
A stupid fool like you will shoot me!
You're scaring a Jatni with spray.
"Ma'am this is my gun, actually the holi is coming that's why."
But when I saw your physique I got scared and...
I hid the gun in his bag.
Let him go.
Please Ma'am.
Let him go!
Gentleman is telling me to let him go.
Let him go.
You'll have to file an application for it.
"I obliged you, Aren't you going to oblige me?"
seductor!
Damn it!
"Finally, you have arrived."
From where you come?
Of the university.
-Again Alvaro?
-Yes.
You are really an idiot.
You help me?
How many times you take trying to tie to him?
Two times.
Two times?
And above you have scored at Medicine to be near him.
"Without a doubt, a medical desire much, but until Alvaro finishes the doctorate..."
"Good, to his parents they do not need money."
Money.
"To the aim to the end, they only have a bar."
But you know what bar is?
It is a Sport Bar.
-He of the place?
"-Yes, that same one."
"Ah, then he rich."
I am not idiot.
"I have to him in the loose cord,"
I will not give anything to him until we marry.
"He is not handsome, but..."
"It hears, I say it to you like expert, you you have future?"
you know?
-Where it is?
-There.
"Because in spite of being a fan, you are better than many professionals."
Modestly...
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, doctor."
"Your medication, miss Porter."
"Thank you, Gunther."
"What book are you reading, miss?"
"Uh, it's Edgar Allan poe."
Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"The tales may be dark, i know what you're saying, but through them he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he holds up a mirror to our own lives."
You're a very thoughtful woman.
"Thank you, Gunther."
"If you ever need anything ever, you just let me know."
Isabel.
"Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
Calm yourself.
"Oh, thank god."
There's a man in there.
There's blood everywhere.
I...
I just...
Dr. lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
No.
"We had California plates, but our car broke down in New Mexico, so we had to get a new car."
"I told you it wouldn't make it, Ray."
But he wouldn't listen to me.
This one will make it.
Make it where?
Philadelphia.
My mother lives there.
She's sick.
"Ray is my boyfriend, so he got stuck with the job of taking me there."
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.
Uh...
"We weren't speeding or anything, were we?"
"No, ma'am."
What the fuck did you stop us for then?
I want you to get out of the car one at a time.
"You first, ma'am."
Get your hands up.
"Hey, calm down."
"You said ""Get out, you first, man,"" right?"
"Step around to the rear of the car, and keep your hands where I can see them."
"You said ""Get out of the car."" That's all I'm doing."
What's wrong with you?
You told us to get out.
"Ray, do what the man says."
"Stay where you are, ma'am."
Now you put your hands on the car.
Spread them out.
Now spread your legs.
"Okay, same thing."
Hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
- It comes with a free cigarette.
"- Oh, no."
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.
"Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it."
"No, no, no."
Don't do that... smoking is bad.
You should quit smoking right now.
Hey...
Ahh.
We seem to be in the clear.
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah.
I got caught on top of the fence.
Check out my calf...
it's like Scratch City.
How about you?
"I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe."
"Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my God!"
It's gonna be fine.
"Oh, my God!"
"I got rifles, vests, flash grenades..."
"Chips, dips, ice cream sammies..."
"I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully."
Pretty sure?
Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty?
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
Really?
Then what is this?
"Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
"Jove's sake, he's like a tree!"
Hence why he moved me up here.
What?
You can't change the rules just cos you found a tree man.
You have to check with me first.
"No, it's my sport."
I invented it.
I've been playing it for ages!
It's my sport.
Is this still the meeting?
"No, ignore that."
"Basically, my point was..."
"Hello, I'm Marcus."
I'm gonna do some really good stuff around here for you.
So...
Like what?
"Like, well... give you comfier chairs and unblock the toilets... and oil that squeaky door."
"Oh, thank you."
"Yes, exactly."
"For too long, this company has put profits above people."
Yeah.
"If there's anything you need at any point, just ask and I will deliver."
Thank you very much.
"Could I go and find a big man for my jugball side, please?"
Yeah.
"Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK, fine."
"Wicked, thanks."
It's terrible!
I can't eat anything.
"You don't know any dentists, do you?"
"Davus here could extract the bad tooth, if you want."
"What, really?"
I know my way around.
"We're not committing to an offer yet, but if you have a number, we'll listen."
"Mr. Canning, are you with us?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was just texting my lawyer."
"It's funny, isn't it, lawyers having lawyers?"
"And my lawyer probably has a lawyer, too."
"We should all be getting progressively smaller, like matryoshka dolls."
Yes.
"So are we negotiating,"
- or what are we doing?
"- No, we're negotiating."
I-I think I have an offer for you.
A one-time offer.
- Zero?
Really?
"- Yeah, unfortunately you have five minutes to decide whether to take it."
I see.
"And if we don't, you have a bomb or something?"
Sort of.
Hi.
We're all here.
Where are you?
Just changing.
I'll be right in.
"The rash is back, Michael."
I know.
I'm trying the ointment three times a day.
You have to stop eating so much spicy food.
Yes.
No more Thai food for you.
"Oh, please, it's just poop."
"You shovel the stuff all day, buddy."
"Sinaté, I'm preparing a little trip."
"Hey, you, what about your papers?"
I don't have any.
"Hey, get up!"
Come on!
"You, there!"
Get up!
Your ID?
"The guy asked him for a ""hit""."
"As the baker didn't understand, the Sarakollé showed him a loaf of bread..."
Then the baker and his wife started to laugh.
That's funny!
"Our Sarakollé fathers... in Europe, make fun of white people..."
Really funny!
Leave that!
What have I done now?
You're provoking me!
"Come on, M'Batoma, let's go to the room."
Founé!
See the children off to bed!
Is this your little girl?
Time to go to bed.
"Excuse me, Balla... it's better to be alone."
Women are indiscreet.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
"After returning from Europe, my husband won't let me work."
What about your degrees?
Young men are jealous.
In a week you'll have your car.
I'll go and see Bathily for your coverage.
You'll have all the privileges of your rank.
- Our guests arrive today.
- precisely.
You blockhead!
"These are the great geniuses of our time, gathered together in our home!"
They are a gang of parasites.
"After a few days in their company, I expect you'II come to your senses."
You'II humiliate me if you don't receive them.
charles!
You don't want me to be a success!
Gustav?
Gustav!
Attach little bags of seed to the branches.
I want thousands of birds singing when they come up the avenue.
darling?
You're not dressed properly.
Go and put on your pink waistcoat.
- (gunshot)
- Oh!
That murderer!
There won't be a bird left in the sky!
welcome!
Yes.
"Come on, HeIene."
welcome!
"In my house, you are the nobility."
The nobility of genius.
Madame Sand!
- hello.
How was your trip?
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
You must be very happy.
Instead...
Why are you upset like this about this random girl?
"I know, my fault."
Sorry.
"Now, please smile for me."
I'm telling you again...
Sadhana is deeply in love with you.
When you were hospitalised...
I know.
I will talk to her.
What I meant is...
More than the one we love...
The one whom we love...
The one who loves us...
"No, no..."
It's okay.
"Leave it, mom."
I get the point.
"Have a seat, Sadhana."
Will you like to have anything?
Don't suddenly flip into a totally different person.
Be normal.
Only that suits you.
Okay.
I have to tell you the truth.
"Since you were coming, I didn't even use room freshener."
Okay.
Let me get to the point.
"If you still love her, I totally understand."
Don't take any decision just because your parents are forcing you.
You don't have to tell me 'you like me' just because someone is asking you to.
Me too.
If you can go slightly backward shake it to pass.
"That I can not befriend, retreat."
Running the beach not up to anyone.
Maybe move to the other side.
Do not have this side.
-And what have we got here.
Then they will have to return everything.
I am with children it's kind of dangerous.
I know.
-And we need to get home.
"I understand, very fair."
"But understand my side, champion."
One day I will have to protect my thing.
Because someone will want to take it from me.
"When I see, the whole world will see."
And in the background of consciousness I have a cruel reminder.
Once I stepped for a penguin.
"He looked at me, is gone."
"Goodbye, girls, hello empty beach."
-Got it.
"Yes, more ..."
So get out my face!
My mother says that every obstacle is an opportunity.
What?
"Dude, can apologize, or I'll break your nose!"
-He did not want to do this.
-All right.
And I still know.
"- ""SvenPense."""
"-Erik, no."
"His chubby flabby, out of my way."
-Look at the neutral strip in this direction.
-Why isn't he making any shots?
- He does not shoot because he is an ace.
"- OK, he will not hide from us."
We'll get him afterthe sun moves to the right position.
-There are about 20 minutes left.
-And what?
-The sun will get a little bit lower.
-And what?
-Have patience and you'll see.
"- Listen, let me get out with the cap on."
Wearing this cap?
Stay quiet.
He will not hit me.
"And if he makes a shot, you'll fire."
Remain seated.
He knows your cap.
-Why am I sweating in it?
- l dunno.
What are you doing?
Were you fond of playing with sun reflections in your childhood?
Surely.
So I recall my childhood.
At about one the reflection will get directly into his eyes.
And we'll see what he does.
"If he shoots,"
He'll think I'm dead.
Why did you become so silent?
Hey!
Go on talking.
I feel merrierthat way.
It is this buffoon again!
333...
A number that ends with 333.
Details of this number?
You said the the victim of the accident got calls from a number?
Is it the same number?
Let me check.
Yes.
It's the same number.
"The number we got from the lodge, Manoj's number, and this number."
There's some connection definitely.
Sir.
"Moorthy, how are you?"
- I'm fine.
Did our car met with an accident?
Why do you ask?
"The cops are torturing me, Sir."
"They are accusing me of that accident, that I drove the car."
What did you say?
That I am no longer working for you.
I told them that the lady with you drives your car.
How did you...
Why did you blabber all that?
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir!
Fool!
"Manoj, tell us the truth at least now."
Who was with you?
What actually happened?
Who is it?
The same cops who came yesterday.
Tell me what happened.
I did tell you that nothing happened.
Good.
- Sit up for me.
Tonight you will face your final test.
- Mr. Porter.
- Mr. Avery.
- I took a look at it.
- And?
- It's chockfull of laudanum and what I think is Indian root.
And it appears to have trace amounts... of aconite.
- Aconite?
- Monkshood.
Wolf's bane.
"A poison, Mr. Porter."
"Not enough to kill you, but certainly enough to have rather unpleasant effects... on your mind."
- Congratulations.
You found us.
One final test... for your commitment.
Who do you see?
- Margaret.
- And why do you think she's here?
"- She whispered lies into my mind, sowed doubts within me."
She tried to turn me against you.
"- No, Isabel."
- She must be punished.
- Please.
- You will be my star.
Cleanse her with the lash.
Her screams will be her sacrament of reconciliation.
"- Isabel, please!"
Please!
Help me!
Please help!
I want you to take the gown out of your bag and put it on.
-This isn't appropriate for public.
-You don't understand naked.
Naked is inner.
I am here with you.
There is no shame.
There is no separation.
And I'm not ill.
"Yes, you are ill, Gloria."
And I have no need for a green synthetic nightie used to conceal the essence of my supple skin and my aching soul in the barren desert that is this land.
I'm moving in with my son in Costa Mesa.
He thinks I'm lonely.
"Truth is, he's lonely."
Sweet kid.
Just can't seem to connect.
Me and my wife lived here 40 years.
"It's lovely, really."
It's really lovely.
You seem like a very nice person.
I hope you take the place.
-Come on.
-Come on!
You're nothing!
Come on!
Pussy!
Fucking pussy!
I don't know about trust.
Maybe she just needed a nap or something.
Believe me.
She's been belligerent with everybody else.
I dealt with her last year.
"I just listened to her, really."
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
- Reagan --
- I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett.
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was -- he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
I'm in the middle of it.
We'll take care of it.
We'll manage.
We'll get it done.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
Fine.
Bye.
I do like my drink.
It goes hand in hand with playing.
It's a given.
A morning break drink.
"Before that, three spritzers just so I can talk."
"Then, with the morning break drink, 10 spritzers."
"And afterwards a few shots, because everything's gone so well."
But I'm predisposed because my whole family drinks.
Is dinner ready?
This is our basement den.
We don't use it as often as before.
- We used to celebrate birthdays here.
- We don't celebrate here anymore.
"My son was a musician, he'd play for us."
"On birthdays, Christmas, New Year's."
We always had such a good time.
We had Mardi Gras parties.
"We had Mardi Gras parties, but... that's all over."
"Yup, pretty much."
"The carpets here, actually..."
I'm no fan...
"I'm no fan of carpets, but my wife..."
"It doesn't fit upstairs, but it cost a lot, so I put it down here."
- Nowadays...
- That guy is such an asshole.
- Don't blame it on him.
You're not makin' any progress.
I'm goin' to get the jump rope.
- Men are such pricks.
"- Oh, tell me about it."
I bet you're real tired of them pushing you around.
"Oh, God, you have no idea."
If only there was a way that you could be... physically tough enough to intimidate men.
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
Let's just say I provide a much-needed service around this place.
"Step into the shadows and, uh, we'll talk."
Yeah?
"Mac and Dennis, dude."
Open the door.
- What?
- It's Mac and Dennis.
Open the door.
"Open the door, bro."
"All right, guys."
Hang on a second.
"It's like, uh..."
It's like 11:00 in the morning here.
- We don't care.
Open the door.
"- Surprise, bitch."
You're hittin' me with that?
"Charlie, let's be honest."
Punching boards isn't your thing.
- But that's okay.
"- Yes, that's okay, because for you... it's not gonna be about inflicting punishment... it's gonna be about having punishment inflicted upon you."
Oh!
[groans]
"Boy, if Dad could see you now."
I am doing what he asked me to do.
I'm trying to help you.
I know you want the bonds.
- I can give them to you.
- And why would you do that?
Were you not listening?
That blood could satisfy your need to kill.
And what if I like to kill?
Do you?
"Look, what's the catch?"
You let Freddie go.
And I get to come with you and help you through this.
Are you out of your mind?
You seriously trust that Carlos won't just eat you the first chance he gets?
I don't trust him.
I trust you.
"I know you'll protect me, Scott."
[rock music plays]
"[Eddie] How did you get Seth to give you the plans, anyway?"
[Richie] Let's just say I convinced him.
[exhales]
"It's a little fancy, don't you think?"
I'm workin'.
[Richie sighs]
"Hey, listen."
I'm sorry I had to twist your arm about all this.
"What, are you kiddin'?"
I'm back!
"But if you ever try anything like that again, I'll kill ya."
"I'm sure you are, Jake."
"You ask me to take point, and then you kind of undercut my authority in there."
"Yeah, I'm sorry about that."
We could've closed it clean for 1.75.
I know.
So now we just sit it out?
"Liz has cancer, Jake."
What?
Found out last night.
Is it serious?
Mm-hmm.
"Burton, I'm so sorry."
"You know, you should have told me about this before the meeting."
"I--I am trying to get vortex as our client, and I--I really don't want to do a deal with them that can turn out badly."
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
The U.S. attorney wants names from kalaya.
What does kalaya get?
Protection from the thai penal system.
Come on.
She'll be dead in the streets.
Yeah.
That's why I didn't take the deal.
I lined up a couple of prospective foster parents.
Do you think we have any kind of a shot in here today?
"Probably not, Ms. Agnes."
Hmm.
Liz:
How did it go today?
"Well, they want you to get life insurance."
Heh!
I can't do it.
- There was a shipwreck.
And the captain thought he saw the ghosts.
Le Bosco was also acting strangely
- And at dawn
- What happened at dawn?
They were in the marshes near the haunted ruins at dawn.
And now -
There they are.
How do you know all of this?
I just know.
What if they're still alive?
"For God's sake, shut up"
The captain has shut himself in his house.
He's afraid.
You're all crazy!
You know what's hidden away in the ruins.
If they made it there
Two girls.
Wounded and exhausted!
I think they must have drowned!
I hope so
If they are hiding in the ruins and they free
Don't mention his name!
We don't really know what's hiding in the ruins.
Yeah.
But if they manage to get that far... what will happen?
All I know is that no one has been there for at least a century.
Shut up!
You don't know what you're talking about.
- Do you understand?
- Help!
Stop it!
"You know, i..."
I wasjust feeling good that day.
Yeah.
"I, uh..."
I don't know what to say.
"I'm at a loss, boy."
I'm at a total loss.
"I mean, here you are, supposedly injured, all right?"
You're collecting your lieutenant's salary and full disability.
I didn't even want to do this.
Matt had to talk me into it.
You know how stupid I felt?
"The lower back, it's an enigma."
"Pat, I'm gonna be straight with you."
"Obviously I have alternatives to pursue, but I'm not gonna... because - cause I don't want this getting out."
All right?
It makes everybody look bad.
"But from now on, you are back on full patrol."
Here.
Get started with this.
- A missing person's case?
"- Yeah, a bookie."
Jerry Green.
No one's seen him for about a week.
Huh.
Jeez.
- What happened to him?
"- I don't know, Pat."
That's what you're supposed to find out.
Right.
All right.
We talked earlier about the fact there's a shortage of wading pools.
This is the best you could come up with?
This shit?
This is shit.
Read the deposition of the LaVamere lady.
She was putting on a sex show.
- How long did this go on for?
- It was hours.
- How many hours?
- Three or four.
Which one?
Three or four?
"Three, I guess."
"In her defense, she was drunk."
"To be honest, once she finished fucking and sucking those two assholes... she was carried into another room, and boys were going in and out of there... but I don't know if she was fucking them."
"When she came out, she was covered in cum."
It was awful.
"Excuse me, Counselor."
"I, um..."
- May I?
- Of course.
"Just to clarify, why exactly was Mrs. Laine Hanson..."
Strike that.
"Laine Billings involved in this, uh... appalling and disgusting behavior?"
- That's...
That's what's important.
- Exactly.
Thank you.
It's great to see you guys.
There you go.
Thank you so much for your support.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Who's staying with mcgee?
- I can.
If you want tony to check out the other real estate women.
Fine with me.
"Tony,stay with mcgee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smell like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dt,sweat... and sandalwood."
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant,so I used yours."
"No,you didn'T."
"Ye,we're partners."
What's the big al?
A hair!
"Come on,you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ound radar techs didn't show till dawn.
Mcgee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very brokeback mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."
""" How romantic."
I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well,I can show it to you on my new phone-- it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
I'm here.
My scouts just informed me.
I am sorry about your father.
"Jake, you're outmanned and you're outgunned."
There's too many of us and we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
"Walk away, put your guns down and return to town, and no one else will be harmed."
"Jake, I need an answer."
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
"Sorry, I didn't get that."
You can go straight to hell.
About my father... you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
"Sir, wheels up in five minutes."
Roger that.
Jericho's been moved up to priority #1 on the list.
Thank you.
"Oh, God, thank you."
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry.
We're gonna get things back to normal again.
"All right, saddle up."
My father expected us to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Go to the shop and bring back some beer.
Beer!
Why is he the one happy about it?
Bring back some soju too.
"You take care of it on your own, I don't want to get involved."
Then shall I tell them everything?
That there's someone else inside the body?
"If you do, I bet you'll get dragged to the hospital right away."
"If you don't want to get caught, then cooperate."
I'm sure we'll get caught.
I'm sure it'll show as more time passes.
"If it starts to get obvious, then you have to try to hide it!"
Hide what?
Uh oh...
See?
It's already starting.
What are the 2 of you hiding?
Kids don't have to know.
Don't get involved in an adult's conversation.
"Let's go, Yoon Jae."
"You, kid don't have to know!"
She said a kid doesn't have to know.
Come have a seat over here.
-Da Ra!
Da Ran!
"-Yes, mom."
Be good.
What?
If it's uncomfortable...
Do you want me to get you a pair of socks?
That's okay.
This is comfortable.
There are two more crates outside.
Did you tell them?
"He knows, too?"
"You know, too?"
I'm done for.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Big deal.
Have you considered how he feels?
A guy raises three kids and 30 years later he finds out he's not their father.
"Stop being his lackey, Ricky."
It's his fault that my mom's dead.
"He paid the surgeon $3,000 under the table"
- to make sure she'd be okay.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- The Arab took a bribe.
- How do you know?
He told me-
- You believe all his 1001 Nights stories?
He's waiting outside.
Really?
Why doesn't he come in?
Natanel!
Wait!
Natanel!
See?
I told you not to come.
"""...beyond any blessing, song, praise or consolation"
"""uttered in this world, and let us say Amen."""
- Amen.
"""May there be great peace from Heaven,"
"""life, bounty, salvation, comfort, health,"
"""forgiveness, abundance and deliverance, for us and all Israel"
I think you should...
"Less talk, more action."
"Oh, this machine almost drives itself."
"Stay here, son."
"Come on, we have to find course for the dinosaur or we're useless."
"Cody, what did you do to our robots?"
"If you need them to do you want, you have to ask nicely."
"Cody, get off this channel."
It's for emergency responders only.
"Hide down, Kade."
Cody spotted the dinosaur first.
"For now, he's on the team."
Fine by me.
"Got any ideas, Cody?"
Not exactly.
But I know someone who will.
Hello.
Cody?
The Dinosaur Exhibit.
"Fine, now you're interested."
"How is that going, Graham?"
I'm almost there.
Just a little more to the right.
Preparing to lift the payload.
"Good to go, Dani."
You really think this will hold the tyrannosaur?
We'll find out.
"Keep him busy, Dad."
Dani is on her way.
"Now, how are we supposed to get that thing over here?"
Thought you'd never ask.

"Come on, then."
You know I didn't mean it.
You can go.
"All sorted, Sir H."
Ready to record when you are.
"Thank you, Lionel."
Now.
This... hears everything and forgives nothing.
It is a cruel mistress.
We can have no mistakes.
Perfection only will do.
"Complete clarity, total concentration!"
"And of course, a lovely, happy sound."
"Pauline, go and phone the coffee order through."
Right.
What was I supposed to say?
"Yeah, you're right, fatso, we have it away every Tuesday?"
Bloody idiot.
Is he a drinker?
Huh.
You don't want to bother with him.
I do want to bother with him.
Pauline!
Do you want this hand cream?
Atrixo?
"Lovely, thanks."
"No, don't be like that, Enid."
"Honestly, in bed, between you and Moira, well, no contest."
"You might want to switch off the intercom, Malcolm."
Oh...
"Oh, good."
A critique on my sex life has gone through to everyone in planning.
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- How about your legs?
- No.
I can't feel them.
"Gallant, need a hand here."
We' re talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?
I'm on Psych rotation.
I really shouldn't be helping you.
"- Haleh, this is a dead body."
- You ought to go to med school.
Can't take her to the morgue yet.
We' re waiting on family.
Why am I not exploding?
No movement below the umbilicus.
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?
You might have bruising to your spinal cord.
"I need 30 mgs per kilo of methylprednisolone, IV bolus."
- Where the hell's X-ray?
- Behind you.
Start with the chest.
- Please.
I need Ricky.
"- Stay with us, Alma."
"Entry wound, left mid-sternocleidomastoid with a large hematoma."
There's blood behind the ear as well.
Be nice to hear about that ultrasound.
Morrison's is dry.
The pericolic gutters look good.
- Bladder is-
But i ain't got the money to pay it.
Josie... nick... she's a gilt-edged corporation.
"Mr. Boyd, we can get through to the hospital now."
I got a carriage for the colonel.
"No, i don't want any carriage."
Got a golden chariot comin' for me.
I wonder if those gates are really made of gold.
"Right, then."
Go straight to the office...
Don't dawdle on the way
Don't worry
I'll call in 30 minutes to check
"Oh, hello Fujio"
"Is your mother here, too?"
Why are you outside?
It's no fun listening to women's talk
"Well, why don't we go in together?"
I'm fine out here
"Right, you wait out here"
Aunty!
Tell mom...
"If she's not out soon, I'm leaving!"
I'll tell her
Mrs. Ishino has arrived
Good
Welcome
Please come in
I hope you're well
Been here long?
A little while
"You're very pretty, today"
You should've called me yesterday.
Who the hell is this person you're meeting?
"Okay, can I ask you a favor then?"
Can I bring my girlfriend along?
- Girlfriend?
- Yes.
You want to take your girlfriend?
We were supposed to go on a date today.
"Sure, fine then."
Then I'll be right back.
"I'll go tidy things up a bit, and I need to call her."
"Alright, what time then?"
- How about two?
- Two?
"Okay, two then."
Hold on.
- Hello?
"- Director Kim, it's me."
- How are you?
"- Fine, of course."
Did you happen to read the paper this morning?
It said that a film director named Kim died in a car accident.
And so I called just in case.
I felt awful because of that.
So you're alright?
That was in the morning paper?
Interesting.
"- Anyhow, I wonder who it was."
"- Someone, I guess."
"- So, is the script almost done?"
"- Uh, well..."
"Actually, I was just taking off to somewhere quiet to work on it."
To say that...
I love you   and that I don't want you to die and lots of other things...
Come over here.
I love you.
Shouldn't you hurry up?
They'll be here soon.
You look great.
Thank you.
"There, come on."
- Are you still up?
- It's skateboarding.
Is it skateboarding?
Is it exciting?
- Move!
- It's really exciting.
Move!
Then you have to go to bed in half an hour.
Sleep tight.
"Jorgen was a diplomat, so he was sent down there."
He sat down in the chair and he didn't say a word.
"Finally Baunsgaard asks, will they do it by 3   or will we have to pay overtime?"
"Jorgen said, you won't have to pay overtime at least."
I just fired all 42 of them.
This story gets better and better.
Last time it was 32.
"I don't know the cost in dollars and cents, but we almost went bankrupt."
But we had integrity.
"Integrity, Jorgen."
"- And cheers to that, Jorgen."
- Thanks.
Cheers.
- You're not drinking much tonight.
You have to eat it.
What's this stink?
"The MiIanese brought it, it's all moldy."
- That's how you eat it.
- With mold?
"It's MiIanese cooking, refined, it's totally different."
"Not like us, we eat stuffed peppers."
Taste it.
Try it.
What's it like?
But stuffed peppers too...
How about a kiss?
- I don't think so.
- Gimme a kiss.
- You're hurting me.
- No kiss 'cause he's here?
problems?
"If anyone's got problems here, it's you, if you speak."
"tell yourma to buy somethin' black, she's gonna be in mourning'."
"Shut up, you moron, yourma stills brings you snacks."
Maybe you still don't get my type.
"Good boy, go inside."
That clown...
settle down!
"- You came on a new motorbike, huh?"
"- No, on foot."
What are you doing to my motorbike?
I'II take the personal responsibility to explain.
"You take the responsibility, huh?"
Let's take him inside.
careful.
It can't go on like this.
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
It is already there!
"Were you there, Mrs Thielbacke?"
They called neither for me nor a doctor.
Well!
Hold it then!
My hands are so dirty.
"Come on, move!"
"Hold yourself straight, girl!"
What do I say if someone sees me?
That you've fetched your wages...
No hospital... is that at all doable?
"Well, there you see."
Isn't he a fine boy?
Didn't you also come into this world in your mother's bed?
But the due date was a long way off!
"Oh well, that's why I too didn't believe it when the pain sat in."
Then I would've called the doctor.
So you did it all alone...
A mother's soul
- All alone...
Bruno was there;
he helped me.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
I left the money and the papers in the car.
Bruno...
"Could I not return to Mrs Kunze, Bruno?"
Why do you ask questions?
"Nope, you'll stay with me for a couple of days!"
I'll find somewhere to sleep.
I've never been worried about that!
Oh my goodness... the bed!
"If she hadn't crashed, she'd been gone anyway, so what's the diff?"
She might have come back?
"Well, we'll never know, will we?"
"So, spare me the pity party."
I am over it.
Morning.
Correct.
"So, that's it then?"
That's the story?
"Yeah, for now."
Because Big Mac doesn't want his family dirty laundry aired in public.
"Ah, no, because most of what people are saying is hearsay and we don't print hearsay, George."
But it just seems so...
Underwhelming?
Yes!
There is a life attached to that body.
"Well, not anymore, to be accurate."
"Which we are, George."
The facts.
"So, an unidentified woman..."
Which everyone knows is Trina!
She hasn't been formally identified yet.
"So, until then it is not a fact, it is gossip."
"We print news here, George."
News.
Siouxsie?
"Ah, Siouxsie, is Monty..."
"Right here, George."
"She's, er, processing her grief."
"Were her and Trina close, then?"
Not really.
Trina didn't really like kids.
"Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
"No,"
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist.
The one wearing the male birth control.
I was gonna go with
"""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
"All right, he's a hero."
Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff,"
I have a date.
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
Great.
Bring her in.
You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
Mm.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
- To our meeting.
"Oh, what a poison!"
Some friend you've got!
"No, actually he's a good man."
"Actually, he's not Georgian, he's Greek, though he lives in Tbilisi, he is a tennis coach."
"Excuse me, what's your name?"
- What?
- Your name.
Oh.
Maria.
And I'm Yuri.
Incidentally!
"I didn't drink that much, but it went to my head."
Let's have something to eat.
I was hanging about the station all day!
Very well.
"You take charge here, I'll go and procure some plates and forks."
Tanya!
Can you find some plates and forks for us?
There you go.
Thanks a lot.
Good girl!
"My dear, why do you keep coming and going?"
"You know, I couldn't understand how it could... how it could be that the door's locked but the man's gone!"
"You know, I thought I was going to die."
Let's have another shot.
Though I can't drink much.
"You know, when I drink, I get..."
I get kind of bad in the head.
Start singing right away.
The matchmakers came to me
On a skewbald mare!
I can't wait to dive in and find out all about you.
Mer looks weird.
Does she look weird to you?
She looks like she's gonna pee her pants.
"Oh, crap."
I made her hydrate.
Meeting the family always blows.
I'd never make you do that.
"Me, either."
One of the many perks of dating a dead guy.
Who's that lady touching Meredith?
Derek's mom.
"Oh, that's why she looks so weird."
"She does not look weird, okay?"
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.
Looks like she's gonna pee.
"Dr. Yang, you mind checking on some of my post-ops?"
ER is swamped with traumas.
"Also, would you like to go on a date with me?"
I'm sorry?
A date.
"You said not to play hot and cold with you, so, um, I'll pick you up around 8:00?"
"Oh, and make sure mr."
Kenner in room 2-2-1-2 gets that enema.
He's been holding on to it for days.
Okay.
'Cause that wasn't weird.
"See, another perk of dating a dead guy."
No awkward dates.
"2-to-1, but who's counting?"
Why can't I have that nice man's organs?
He was starving...
Yoyo!
He has a fever and his stomach ached.
Yoyo!
Where was I just now?
You were getting nowhere.
Because I don't know what you're talking about.
You still remember the good old days?
"""l remembered the love song she used to sing."""
"""Even in my dreams I will always remember."""
"""Her tender love warms my heart."""
"""The good old days I will always remember."""
"""Like a flower that bears fruit is our love."""
"""l cannot live without you."""
"""The calm water rippled as you left me!"""
"""Our love will never be forgotten."""
You know how I suffered these 3 years?
But I have my own difficulties.
Difficulties?
Why did you get engaged to Fat Pig?
It's all because of you.
Me?
You shouldn't marry Fat Pig.
You should marry me.
"Sooner or later, you'll know how much I love you."
Love?
Action speaks louder than words.
Can you wait?
Did you make it?
"If you didn't come, I would have made it."
What?
I meant the 'Beast'.
"All right, guys."
"Winner takes all, a week without chores."
"Prepare to meet your doom, boys."
"Not tonight, French Fries."
This game is mine.
You know why the Flyers suck?
Lt all comes down to Lindros.
What a waste.
Sucked us dry and left us for dead.
"So, you gonna kiss me tonight or what?"
- Pair of nines.
- Pair of trois.
"Triple aces, boys."
I win again.
- Tweaker!
- Tweaker!
"You know I really like you, right?"
So you'd have to like gnaw on my lip for this to totally suck.
I guess it's not like in the movies where kisses magically happen at exactly the right moment.
Just like the formation of rainbows.
Wow.
Can you imagine if I told other people that you actually said that?
- It could be your dad.
- I'm in the shower.
- There's a thought.
"- Easy, pilgrim."
- It could be the guys.
- You gave them my number?
What?
I made pizza and we were gonna have purple cows after we kissed.

How rude!
Even I am not used to people not turning around to look at me.
Using my pickup line on me?
- Yes.
- Liquor baron Zakir Merchant.
Awesome.
We didn't scare him.
What's your name?
"Well, in Germany they call me Johann"
And here Honza.
That's what we call our pig!
"Well, Johann, you can sleep above the pigsty."
- The nights are warm.
- It's him.
Above the pigsty?
Is there no bedroom - er some tiny room?
There isn't.
"All right, I'm used to hardship on my travels."
"Go and turn the hay, up by the wood."
I'll feed Terry and then I'll help you.
"There's a rake, the meadow above the chapel."
He never killed himself working!
"Good, he's here, so we can keep an eye on him."
And we'll pay him back for his trouble.
We'll scare him out of his wits.
"If he doesn't behave, just call us!"
"What are you up to, Honza?"
You're slow!
Would you call me Johann?
You already have a...er - the pig Honza.
"As you like, Johann."
I'm glad I came at the right time.
"You can't do it all alone, poor girl."
I'm not alone - I have my Henry.
What's that?
You wait!
So those palace rascals are still bothering you.
With God's help I'll be home soon to protect you.
- Your keys.
"- ls it just the keys or along with the keys, the car too?"
"Along with the car, the driver too is there."
I have never seen a flower selling flowers.
"Will you just see, or buy something too?"
I will buy all your flowers.
How much do they cost?
Around 4000.
Give me the address.
Where do I send it?
- Your name?
- Nisha.
I don't want flowers.
I am at fault.
And the flowers are being punished?
The flowers are being punished.
And you are sweating?
Here...wipe off your sweat!
- Sweat?

- Please take it.
"If I were in Baba's place, I would have picked up the girl..."
- ..and parceled her right away!

Let Baba just mention it once.
I will pick up her entire family!
How would you know what love is?
One should go straight to the girl and ask her...
'Will you give me a kiss?
Or shall I slit your throat?
'

"Yeah, I have an idea."
For this house.
For me.
"And hopefully, if you like it and things continue to, you know..."
"Anna I have a plan, okay?"
-Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know.
It haunts me.
"Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy."
"After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver."
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.

It's here.
We should warn you before you watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it?
Is it scary?
It's ironic how footage of someone being born..
can make you want to kill yourself.
"Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it."

He tells her that she's dead.
Right?
She's gonna be dead by morning.
"- So he drops this box off at her place, right?"
- They call you guys.
- They call Bomb Squad.
- Right.
We go in there.
We x-ray it on scene.
"- And, uh, we can't see anything in there."
- [ Man ] Right.
I cut a little hole in it.
I can see there's something in there.
[ Man ] Uh-huh.
"I, uh, I see that there's, uh, some white fuzz."
There's something pink.
I can't figure out what it is.

This was Amanda Kane's cabin.
Nice work.
It's been over a week.
You think we're gonna find anything?
Cleaning crew might have missed something.
So what happened?
You know as much as I do.
Amanda got on the boat and disappeared.
No.
"I mean, what happened with you after the story broke?"
You can Google all the ugly details.
"Kate, if you don't want to tell me, I'll drop it."
It was like...
A bomb went off.
"I destroyed my life, and I hurt everyone else in the process."
"I lost my fiance, my career."
But you know what the worst part was?
What?
Facing my mother.
"That day, she was crushed."
"She says she forgives me, but she hasn't looked at me the same way since."
You sure you want to do this?
What?
Search the room?
"No, not search the room."

- What is your name?
"- Biberkopf, Franz."
- I'm Sonja.
- Are you from Poland?
"No, Bernau."
But then your name wouldn't be Sonja.
It is based on my appearance.
- Are you allright?
"- Yes, sort of."
"- You're not getting any pension, huh?"
"- Sometimes I get some, but not regularly."
Will you take me along?
"No, I'd better not."
What's the matter?
I'll take you along.

Hope we don't find anything.
I just hope you find the truth.
"Hey, Joe."
It's Vic.
Can you believe I walked out on them?
"When they left, I thought it'd be easier."
I thought they'd miss me more than I'd miss them.
"Guess I'm the shithead, huh?"
–Stacy still on the swim team?
"–Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
"Yeah, she, uh..."
Damn it!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"–Broke, with nothing."
–What about your pension?
Damn lawyers for the civil suit ate it up.
–What about the stuff you took on the side?
–I guess I didn't take enough.
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.
"–Joe, you can't live like this."
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
"He thought I was one of the guys that was trying to sell him out to, uh..."
"Well, to you."
He did all this to you?
Yeah -- with jumper cables.
"Tell me something, Mr..."
Sodor.
I have my sources at Mr. Schmidt's operation.
How come I never heard of you until now?
"He hired me on the qt, because he was always afraid of traitors."
And then you hacked the alarm system
"I set up in the Tampa warehouse, and then all of a sudden, I'm the traitor."
Sugar?
O-one sugar.
Just one?
Two.
"Listen, Schmidt was a paycheck."
I got no love for him.
I just want to go home.
And I can help you.
How can you do that?
"You want to catch this guy, right?"
I know where he lives.
You know where he lives.
Nobody knows where he lives.
Except me.
"I'm telling you, I was his secret weapon."
"In fact, the only place I ever met him was at his house."
"If you want to hit him, you got to hurry."
I just wish --
I just wish I could see that son of a bitch bleed.
Okay.
Give us his address.
Stop it!
"Just stop it, for God's sake."
What's wrong with you?
"- What, what?"
- I get it.
Everybody's found their special someone
- except for this old coot.
"- No, Mags..."
"You guys can't get your hands off each other, and that's nasty."
And you guys can't get your hands on each other.
"Well, just get it over with and do it."
At least you're not all by yourself in your home alone.
"Well, that's it, Mags."
You got the movie.
- I got... got what?
- You just guessed the movie.
"""Home Alone,"" that was the movie."
- What?
"- Yeah, you won."
"Why didn't you guys just go ""ahh""?"
It's the poster.
♪ ♪
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, those apps still have some life in them."
- They're cream cheese.
- It doesn't keep.
"Mags, what is going on?"
Do you still have feelings for Bruce?
"No, of course not."
"Well, then are you in love with Cookie?"
'Cause I would understand that.
"I don't know, I'm just..."
"I'm standing there looking at you guys, and it just feels like everyone..."
Sergeant Wu got a hit on Kimura at the palms motel.
"But when they went to check on the room, they were attacked."
- Are they okay?
- For the most part.
But it wasn't Kimura.
It was a woman.
And we're thinking he's working with a woman who's not to be messed with.
So watch yourself.
"You too, Hank."
We keep the cats on this side.
"If we kept them with the dogs and the birds, they'd be screeching and hollering all night."
"Okay, how do we know which is the cat we're looking for?"
"Well, the name of the owner is on every cage."
Do you know the name of the owner?
"Yeah, Schade."
Adalind Schade.
Okay.
"Oh, hello, Majique."
You don't look very sick to me.
"[Cat yowls, cage rattles]"
"Yep, that's probably the one."
How's it going?
Everything all right?
"Yeah, there's nothing happening out here."
All right.
See you in the morning.
"All right, stand back."
Stand back.
Don't get too close.
We got to knock this thing out.
"If you don't have any drugs that'll do it, a 2x4 would be fine by me."
- How's Juliette?
- He is stunt man..
How long you knew him?
- I knew since my childhood.
By the way who are you?
What do you want..?
Police..
Yes Sudhakar.
Sir his name is Karthik..
He is Stuntman..
Okay..
Thank you.
What his dad said was correct.
There is another person looking like him.
But we cannot take chance.
Hello sir..
I am sending a photo.
Hack the IB main server and check whether he is there in the employee data base.
His name is Vikram Kumar.
IPS 2012 batch.
Thanks Stephen.
"Confirmed, both are different."
- Strange!
Hello sir..
"As said by you, they hacked and searched the IB server for you."
We created your ID as an IB officer.
They confirmed that I'm a police officer via audio.
Now I'll show them the video.
Why are you still here?
Have you not still caught him?
My target is to catch you.
- Will you call Chairman Sir informally?
Inquiries should be done on criminals like you and not on Police like me.
"And, Bruce, we really wanna wish you well."
I thought they gave you grounds privileges.
They did.
It's not much of a privilege unless you use it.
So you're really leaving?
"Well, my insurance ran out, so I guess so."
Are you ready?
Do I have a choice?
You cold?
Oh.
"Uh, a little."
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
"- God, this feels so normal."
- Hm.
Is that crazy?
"You thinking the law library was haunted, that's crazy."
"This is, um..."
This is fine.
What's it like?
- What?
- Just hearing the voices.
"Oh, um..."
It sucks.
"Well, what does it feel like?"
Because I just picture it like there's a radio on in your head or something.
"Um, no, it's not in my head."
It's...
I actually hear them with my ears.
"Like people standing behind me, or beside me or creeping up."
Sometimes it's just one.
And then sometimes it's so many that I can't sort out the voices from my actual thoughts.
And it'll just be really great to be back in my old room again.
"Don't worry, Jenny."
We'll- we'll find a place for you.
"Well, that's great,"
"Because I'm moving in, too."
Downstairs.
I was waiting to tell you
Until the board approved my sublet tomorrow.
But I'm very excited.
All my family together under one roof again.
"Better watch out, Humphreys."
"They say love makes a family, but on the Upper East Side,"
Everyone knows it's real estate.
"Hey, dad, I'm sorry I'm running so late."
Can you save me a waffle?
Always.
I'll put one in the oven for you.
"Uh, how's Lily?"
She's great.
And you?
How you holding up?
"I mean, it must be weird."
Lily's ex-husband is now her doctor.
It was at first.
"But the fact is,"
He's just her doctor now.
I'm her husband.
"Uh, by the way, Vanessa can't make it."
Said she had to be somewhere.
"Oh, right."
"The, um, internship at CNN."
They called me as one of the references she listed.
- What?
- Get up.
How do you know Emma?
- The name's August.
- (DOG BARKING)
"And it's a long story, but trust me, you wanna hear it."
"All right, August."
You're not a cop.
Who are you?
You got two minutes.
Think of me as Emma's guardian angel.
Guardian angel?
I see you've been doing a pretty crap job.
I've been looking for her for the past two years.
"Now I finally find her, and she's robbing convenience stores with some deadbeat."
Tell me again who's doing the crap job?
Let me tell you something.
I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her.
Two years?
Where were you the rest of her life?
I'm not perfect.
This world?
Full of temptations.
"Turns out, I'm not that great at saying no."
Not built that way.
But I'm here now.
So who are you?
We were in the same home as kids.
"And I thought she'd be safe inside the system, but now that she's out..."
"Back then, I promised I would take care of her."
"Well, we promised to take care of each other."
You love her.
That was the only thing that I could do.
I hoped days like that would arrive and continue on forever.
"So, I wasted away that young life."
It was a regrettable ending.
And so...
"You are saying that the grudge that the woman had possessed the cat, and turned it into a Bake Neko?"
What the...
Old master...
I guess she couldn't allow anyone from this house to get married.
Which means that woman's grudge is beyond redemption.
It is your turn to talk!
Your turn!
Who are you referring to?
I only did what I was told.
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!
I was just used by you!
I was just following orders!
"I couldn't rebel against it, even though it was something bad!"
It's cruel!
"Cruel, cruel, cruel!"
It's too cruel!
Odajima-sama!
What is still missing?
Old master!
Sato-san!
Answer me!
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault."
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault."
Sato-san!
Sato-san!
Sato-san!
"No need for such pessimism, Hugues."
Thing's aren't rosy.
"But it's the right decision, Jeanne, and I'm sorry."
"Jean-Pierre, we know this should have happened a year ago, and I myself..."
You what?
I've a plan to make the redundancies go smoothly.
May I know who's leaving?
I can't tell you yet.
It's not yet official.
Is that all?
Oh!
Wait!
There.
"You have a good team, it seems."
"- So, that's it?"
- Yes.
- Do you know who's going?
- They wouldn't say.
"It's not official, right?"
"Don't worry, we'll fight."
I'm not worried.
I must tell you...
"I couldn't say with Maillet there, but you're on the list."
- Me?
- Yes.
"I'm really sorry, believe me."
But you're probably the luckiest.
Or rather...
The least unlucky.
"Given your age and the relocation rules, you'll be able to take early retirement, and get your leaving bonus, of course."
You're relocating...
"It's a chance for you, Jeanne."
"The soldiers met Snow White, is that right?"
"Yes, they met Snow White..."
"No, you are fooling me!"
Smart you!
"So, where did you stop?"
Why should I answer your question?
"Right, I don't know why you want to answer me!"
What a shame!
"Chan Mon-gut, you've gone too far!"
Wipe your sweat first!
I think you haven't had good sleep lately.
Does Ho Chun visit you every night?
Your Honour!
"Let's go back to our topic, what did you do that night?"
"I told you, I read at home."
"No, I don't mean the night Chun was killed."
I mean the night before he was killed.
"Before killing him, I went..."
Yes!
You're finished!
"Your Honour, I request to reach the final address."
Damn you!
Tell us what you did on the night before Chun's death.
Police.
No!
I mean Chan Mon-gut.
What's the matter?
The defence counsel's personal point of view is really amazing!
But according to the legal procedure...
Come on!
Why are you so stubborn?
You're charged with contempt of court.
in her job description?
Their job is to follow instructions.
So is yours.
You knew that I couldn't let this go.
"as it turns out, I was right."
I apologize for doubting you.
Oh.
"Well, thank--thank-- we're--we're all human."
As far as I know.
You know that this was only Macpherson's first move.
And he's planning something... bigger.
Any guesses what his plan might be?
No.
I don't know.
I don't want to wait to find out.
You know what the Talmud says?
"""If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first."""
"It also says ""don't rush into any unnecessary danger."
"A miracle may not save you."""
Previously on Warehouse 13...
So you know it's MacPherson.
- I'm right.
"- Yes, I'm afraid you are."
And he now has a sword which renders him invisible.
Now it's up to you to stop him.
You always hurt the one you love.
"Okay, just stop."
"Okay, stop and think this through."
Guess what.
I'm still taking the artifact.
"I can't let you do that, Pete."
"Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig."
You think I'm ugly?
"Look, I'm sorry about yesterday."
"I didn't mean it, okay?"
I'm not ugly.
You're ugly.
I'm not talking about it anymore.
I already told the cops and the doctors.
No one believes me.
They think I'm crazy.
"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I --
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head, but I couldn't control my body."
"I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop."
I just wanted to stop.
I'm sorry.
You don't need to apologize.
"April, some of the kids at school told the police that you and Taylor didn't get along."
"Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her."
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
Just a couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you... happen to smell anything?"
Anything... like what?
Like rotten eggs or...
sulphur?
"Um, no."
Okay.
Yeah?
Let's just hope this lady coming up the stairs now feels the same way about that as you do.
I felt good about this guy as soon as I saw him.
LISA:
"Me, too."
( knock on door )
Answer it.
Come on.
"Out of the way, Dr Penzler."
Let me see her.
Are you the one who asked for the FBI?
( scoffs ) Yeah.
I'm here.
You can talk to me.
Did anyone tell you what this was all about?
Man in therapist's office holding ten hostages demands FBI agent.
I asked for someone from the FBI extraterrestrial project.
Someone who knows about aliens.
"You mean, like on X-Fiies?"
I'm the one you want.
RAY:
Okay.
Let me bring you up to speed on our situation here.
I shot him.
And he's gonna die if he doesn't get medical attention.
That's one.
"After that, if I don't get what I ask for, these people, they're just fish in a barrel to me, you understand that?"
"That was the lady in the park, the one who tried to grab me."
RAY:
You understand?
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to go public.
No!
"I need to stretch their wings, then, bye."
Interesting.
Do something because they will not stop.
"Relax, I know exactly how to get attention of our benefactors aliens."
"Relax, breathe deeply, take a deep breath."
-Loving.
-I am the mayor of the village!
"In this place, I say!"
-This is great.
Can you believe that.
"If you have a Will, has one output."
"Bill, are you?"
"I know not, Uncle Mano ... are noisy and are destroying our ice."
"Atticus, are building a way out of here."
All they thought never would leave here.
"Look, our road to freedom."
"It will not long, boys."
I will miss you here.
Where we live when everyone leaves?
"We'll find a new place dear, the world is big."
And just being together which is already a home.
It is.
Let children to hide.
"Carmen, you see ... even in the mystical should be a couple."
"No, no, no!"
-Are you still here.
-And you're still here.
-They were.
What?
A little while bad they disappear.
Who's missing?
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
-
"- Oh, aye."
Nothing to choose between them!
"Then I thought, ""Colour the hair, Granville."
"-- ""Get into colour."
"Loads of colour."" -"
- They're not really great legs.
"Then I thought, ""Maybe"" -- and I'd appreciate a second opinion --"
"""Maybe something plain."
"Severe, even."
"""Something discreet, in the shape of a single earring?"""
"Oh, yeah!"
Yeah.
Isn't that lovely?
"Oh, d--dear!"
Look at her!
That's the k--kind of advertising we need!
-
- Have you got any copper?
-
"- Oh, yes."
"One pound, thank you."
There we are!
"I'm making a study of the adverts in these glossy magazines, Granville."
There are two things that stand out.
Her two things c--certainly stand out!
But where are we going to get someone like that round here with these qualifications?
"No, who would d--dress in a c--costume like that and p--p--pose like that?"
-- (TILL BANGS) -
- Aghh!
"Oh, dear."
He'll never get the hang of that!
We got to get going.
Right.
Okay.
"Then later, at a club in Chinatown somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair, some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out, when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
"Wait, how old does she think you are?"
"So, were you in Vietnam?"
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot!
She likes old guys!
Don't judge me!
"Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, th..."
"I swear, this is what all the 20-year-olds looked like..."
"I want to thank you for your service to this nation, Private."
Colonel.
Aw.
I got to end this.
"Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid?
That's...
embarrassing.
Your Highness!
Let's go.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
Cool?
It's all good.
I'm happy.
I'm very happy.
"well, get off the phone then before I start crying."
All right then.
Okay.
Love you.
See you.
-talk to you later.
"AII right, bye-bye."
-Bye.
t's amazing man.
That's literally why I auditioned for the show in the start.
"Like, I just wanted to be able to give back to my mum and stuff."
So it's wicked to be able to do that.
It's really cool.
Tonight is the biggest show we've ever done.
I'm just throwing it out there.
"e are playing to 65,000 people tonight."
It's just insane.
Good luck.
Look at the amount of policemen...
-...we've got.
-I can't get over how many police bikes there are.
They've got 40 policemen on us and then they've got like 1 000 policemen on the streets.
"It's quite scary, but it's quite fun at the same time."
We literally have like a small army.
We do have the army.
Let's take over this place.
What is that girl doing out the top of the car?
With an english hat on.
She is a literal rebel.
How much do we have to take from this crud?
There'll be no vigilante stuff.
Not while I'm barracks chief.
"Hey, look at them!"
- Those crazy jerks!
- They won't get away with it!
The Krauts'll shoot them!
It's Harry and the Animal!
They're trying to sneak into the Russian compound!
They're past the 50-yard line.
- It's a quarterback sneak.
-Look at them go!
Those idiots will paint themselves right into their graves.
Get a load of them
"Hello, bublichki."
How are you all?
Hey!
"Hey, the brick Kremlin!"
"Hey, Olga Volga, wait for me."
"Hey, Animal."
The window.
Hmm.
So life sort of drifted back to normal in Stalag 17.
It was a couple of days before Christmas and everything seemed quiet enough.
"But underneath it all, we knew we were sitting on a barrel of dynamite and that the stoolie, whoever he was, was ready to strike again at any second."
At ease.
At ease.
At ease.
"All right, at ease."
At ease.
Mail call!
"- All right, at ease."
[gun shots]
Watch your back.
Right.
Cover me!
[gun shots]
The other two got away.
They got andreas.
Edward mace is unrelenting and ruthless.
When he discovers he doesn't
"Have what he came for,"
He will be back with a vengeance.
Where will they take andreas?
To the darkest place on earth.
I have to go after them.
(nigel:)let's see what we've got here.
The scabbard has holes along its length
That coincide with words written
On the inside of the blade.
Makes up a latin phrase.
"""from sarsen stone, 240 peds,"
"Beneath the druid's noch."""
"(syd:) ""peds."""
Is a roman measurement common to the time.
"Yeah, the stride of an average man."
It would have been about
Five-foot-two in those days.
Sarsen.
"Sarsen is a type of limestone,"
Indigenous to south- central England.
"Also known as greywether,"
Or druidstone.
It's what stonehenge is made of.
Carlos:
This place is starting to look like a dump.
- Why don't you take some boxes away?
"- Okay, boss."
Don't call me that.
Wow!
Where do you guys get this from?
It's beautiful.
"You know that can of paint up front, the white one?"
Yes.
Why don't you go get it and paint over that shit?
Everybody gonna like this.
It gives some cultural stuff to the store and the kids love that.
I drew that.
Eight years ago.
My mom used to watch me every afternoon.
"Altogether, it took about... a month."
Why you want to take it down?
- 'Cause it's bullshit.
- It's beautiful.
"You said your mom liked it, I'm sure your dad--"
Why don't you cover that shit?
You put a part of yourself into the store--
What are you...?
"I did that shit for my father, he covered that shit and now you want to uncover it?"
"When I come back, this shit better be gone."
Stop!
- Yo!
"Ten cuidado, coño."
- Watch where you're going.
"Right, right."
Okay.
Thank you.
"So, what, you're just never gonna have sex again?"
Probably not.
It's funny.
"You know, I never had a problem screwing in a bed where another guy's been."
You've never had a problem screwing in a woman where another guy's been.
You told him you were dangerous?
You're so non-dangerous.
I know!
"But I swear, with him, I feel like I could be."
Mm-hmm.
There's something about him that's so dynamic.
This confidence...
I have not felt this excited about work in I don't know how long.
Dear God... exhale.
Oh.
Oh!
And let me tell you... is that boy easy on the eyes.
Don't.
I know... don't do voices.
Thank you.
"Seriously, he is hot."
"Obviously, I would never go there."
Please.
You keep an apartment there.
Nope.
Not gonna happen.
"I'm happy just to be around him, to work with him, to learn from him."
He is amazing.
"I hear myself talking to these people, and..."
They're listening to me.
"I mean, really listening and nodding."
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
I couldn't take the shot.
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"- No, he couldn't."
"- What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
- I'm stuck here with you.
- Yeah.
"Through this bucket list, we want you to see that life is precious and beautiful--"
- I'll hook up with girls at the club...
- Excuse me..
And I'll have one night stands everyday.
"Stop, stop, stop."
We'll stop here!
Don't stop and let me continue.
"Do you think this broadcast is a joke, Sin Joon Young?"
It's not.
I'm being honest here.
What wouldn't I be able to do if I were to die soon?
What about drugs?
"Will you drink and drive, gamble, use public restrooms?"
"Do you want to date me, PD No Eul?"
Let's say I'll die in three months.
For only three months.
Really deeply.
Only... 3 months.
"Really passionately, with all of my strength."
"Well, since it was just a test..."
Those jokes don't really matter.
I'm not joking though.
I said I wasn't joking.
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
What do you mean?
I'm so thankful!
Top star Sin Joon Young is proposing that we date.
"If I said I didn't like it, I would be crazy!"
PD No!
Good.
That means you have to do right by her.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Then leave her.
Never.
She has a destiny and you?
This life?
You're gonna keep her from it.
"Okay, you believe in magic?"
I take it you do.
So will you.
Trust me.
I'm gonna show you something.
Something that's gonna make you look at everything differently.
"And when you see what I have in here, you're gonna listen."
You're gonna believe every word I say.
(LID CREAKS)
"Yeah, right."
(SNIFFS)
"Okay, I'm listening."
There is a curse and it needs to be broken.
Emma is the key.
I was tasked with keeping her on track.
"And you, my friend, just got caught in the crossfire."
Now I'm gonna tell you a story.
"And at the end of it, you're gonna have to make a decision, will you do the right thing or not."
"So, are you ready?"
(BEEPS)
(ERROR SOUND)
WOMAN: (RECORDING) The number you're trying to reach is out of service.
If you think you've reached this message in error...
- (BEEPS)
Maybe that's what you're tryin' to do with me.
"What are you gonna do, Freddy?"
You gonna arrest the whole town?
"You goin' to New York to take ""paint by number"" cop lessons?"
"You know, Ray likes you."
That don't mean I'm gonna let you fuck him over.
"Ray Donlan gave you this job, Freddy."
You forgot that?
We made your sorry ass!
So now you can do us a favor.
You could tell us... where Superboy is.
"If I knew where he was, he'd be in the city already."
"You're gonna be hurtin', Freddy."
"You're not gonna know when, you're not gonna know where."
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words.
I'm watchin' you!
Hey.
- You got your check.
- Yep.
"Thanks to you, Freddy."
Filing out those forms in such a timely fashion.
You with Liz?
Where you goin'?
I don't know.
"My leave came, so I thought I'd look around for a new reality."
You know?
"Anyway, I'm sure you could use your privacy, Freddy."
"No, no."
"Look all you want, Freddy."
You're not gonna find anything.
I took care of it.
Me too.
I'm glad you came.
How can anyone live two years in a place like this?
"The bathroom's clogged, no water, it's disgusting!"
"I'm used to it, but you don't have to be."
"I can't allow you to live in a place like this, you go home tomorrow, there's a train at 9."
"No, I'm yourwife."
- I'm staying here with you.
- But Chicco?
- He has to become independent.
- As of when?
As of now.
"When we're organized, we'II bring him here to live."
"We're a family, we have to stay together."
"It would be wonderful, but I can't allow it."
What's that?
"It's the neighbors, they fight all the time."
Not anymore.
hold me.
But you leave tomorrow.
- Think they're asleep?
- Warrior's rest.
- Let's go home.
"- No, I have an idea."
"We end with a blast, Iet's burn down the town hall."
Aren't you coming?
"No, I have to bodyguard his wife."
Goodnight.
Why don't you stay here?
Be serious.
"It's the first time we've been alone, even Mom's not here."
"It's all pretend here anyway, right?"
"- Oh, Mike."
- You'll see my head...
- There we go.
"You can hardly tell, but I thought..."
"When it happened, I was like, ""Great, that'll look like I did that on purpose."""
And then you can't tell.
It looks like I have a spastic neck movement.
- Tom Richmond.
- Tom Richmond.
"It hurt though, really."
I think I was bleeding.
I was actually bleeding from that.
They had to put makeup on it.
- Yeah.
- Mike.
"For the rest of the movie, whenever you see me, I had makeup on."
"No, that's not true."
- It's horrible.
"- Oh, God, that was real vodka."
- It's a controversial shot.
"- Whose voice is that, Pete, yelling?"
"That's Myron Kerstein, our editor's voice heckling Ari."
Those are good names there:
"Adam Brightman, Nathan Kahane, Joe Drake."
- We love Nathan.
- All those names are good too.
- Good names.
"- New York, we love."
- That's a good couple of names.
- Look how cute...
Mike.
I did not really drink alcohol in that previous scene.
When you..
"- When you look at the coating, will you beat that guy up on the price?"
Kevin!
That is not a real toilet.
"Dad, what's going on?"
Is everything okay?
Please tell me he's not peeing in the store.
It's nice to take a moment and just relax.
Dad?
I gotta go.
I don't know him and there's no way I'm going near him.
"Grandpa, there's no toilet paper."
Help me get my shirt off.
"You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp."
They want you to be in debt.
That's how it works.
"They give you these credit cards you can't pay for,"
"HD, motorcycles."
It's all a pimp game.
I BELIEVE IN ANGELS
"God, grant me the serenity To accept the things"
I cannot change.
Grant me courage To change the things I can.
And wisdom To know the difference.
Marcus Aurelius (121-180)
No blessing.
I'm not giving my blessing.
Where would she go without a blessing?
"Shut up, woman."
"A fine job you did, raising her."
What I've been telling you?
"Baby,I'm sorry."
"Oh,my God!"
Happy birthday.
"This is like some kind of,like,nightmare or something."
Happy birthday.
"No,happy birthday."
No.
You know what?
"Forget it,man."
Hit the road.
"No,no,no,we suld,like,celebrate or something."
No.
I'm in the middle of a gig here.
Okay?
That's right.
Gigging right now.
Bella!
Bella!
Really?
You are gonna hitch your hope wagon to Johnny Tearducts?
There are higher forces at work here.
I'm just trying to avoid dying alone.
He wasn't a bad guy.
So he's a little passionate.
Whatever.
Didn't he try to suck your blood?
Drink my blood.
Like in a nice way.
I was just going to check out his show and see what happens.
I'm going to tell you exactly what's going to happen.
"You're going to go; he's going to sing a couple songs about rainbows,get a little misty and then you're going to be right back here telling me how you're afraid that your lady parts have closed up."
Oh!
- What shall we make of that?
"- Made your point, Fi."
- Did I?
- Yep.
You did.
What about D.C.?
- You still goin'?
- I have to.
"If I don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else here to kill me."
I need him to know I can get to him too.
I need him to know right now.
And you need help.
And you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
- Both.
Everybody I know is in danger right now- everyone I'm close to.
Well...
I'm willing to risk it... if you are.
- How's my mom?
- Locked up cozy and tight with a cigarette and a shotgun... ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
"- Here you go, Doug."
My lucky vest.
- It'll look great over my shirt.
- Thanks.
"- It's a little worn, but it'll do the trick."
- Are these bullet holes?
- Yeah.
I broke it in for you.
It's a short ride to the U.S. Attorney's office.
Just think of it as a precaution.
It's like a seat belt.
I was thinking of an annual donation of one million dollars for four years.
But I need more time to think through   which projects I want to get involved with.
So don't get your hopes up too high.
Okay...
I was given a different impression.
"Then let's look at the papers again, because..."
"No, no."
Let's forget the boring paperwork until Monday.
We'll have lunch and I'll let you know what I've decided.
- I've got a busy weekend coming up.
- So I've heard.
I spoke to the guy that drove me here.
He's marrying your daughter?
"- Yes, Christian."
You're not married?
- No.
- Got any family here?
"- No, I don't."
Then come to the wedding tomorrow.
It's a huge wedding.
I don't know half of the guests myself.
- It would be nice.
- I need to...
You don't have any other plans.
We're through.
See you tomorrow?
We're looking forward to it.
- Then I can get to know you.
- Thanks for your time.
"- Hey, dad!"
- How are you?
Were you jumping on the trampoline?
Danny's been moping around all day.
"Oh, please."
"Come on, they're grown men."
Not like they're moping around the streets like some Backstreet Boys video from the '90s.
"Let's do this, you oily donkey."
You're not wearing your diamond stud.
No.
I just wear this for fun.
"I'm off duty, babe."
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Work the alley by yourself.
This is the alley where anything goes.
OK.
"Charlotte said, uh, Trent has the diamond at his apartment."
She wants to know if she should go sleep with him.
Excuse me.
What?
No.
- Tell her no.
- Finally I got to make out with Adam.
"That lunatic's back only if you go before... by the way, my legs..."
Nobody else hear that?
I'm all packed up.
"Going to head to the bar,"
Close early so we can all celebrate the engagement together.
You are still welcome if you want to come.
Nah.
I'm good.
All right.
"Well, if you, uh, if you change your mind, just, you know, come."
- What's wrong with you?
–I'm not lying!
"–Yes, you are!"
"Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act."
"–Without him, you're worthless."
Nothing.
–It's not like that!
And you won't leave him because you're afraid no one else will ever love you... that you'll learn Bob was right about you all along.
–No!
"–Oh, damn it, Marcy!"
–Don't lie to me!
–Why are you doing this?
Because there's a girl out there who may still be alive... and I won't let you kill her!
"Now, goddamn it!"
Tell me right now!
Where is she?
I don't know!
Really!
I don't!
I played the daddy.
I broke her.
"If she knew Bob was involved, she would've confessed... or at least given me a nondenial."
–You think?
–I don't know.
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.
Maybe he's just an asshole.
"Problem is, he's the only asshole we've got."
"–Well, what do you got for me?"
–What you got for me?
Come on.
Embrace the relationship.
Fleetwood is fencing' again.
He's so goddamn predictable.
(chuckles)
"So, what brings you to Los Angeles today, Toast?"
Waffles.
What?
(chuckles)
"Well, not just waffles, fried chicken too."
Have you ever been to Roscoe's in Hollywood?
"Uh, yeah, sure."
It's great.
"I don't know if I'd travel 3,000 miles for it."
"Yeah, well, clearly you're not as dedicated to excellent waffles as I am."
"But if you're free later, I'd love to take you to breakfast."
"You do know we land at 5:00, right?"
I don't do time zones.
"I do, however, very much enjoy a good breakfast, hence the name."
You're funny.
And you're mind-blowingly attractive.
"(coughs, clears throat)"
(clears throat)
You're gonna just pretend like you didn't see us or what?
Hey.
Jersey.
McGruff.
What a coincidence.
You guys going to LA?
No.
"No, and neither are you."
"Impeccable timing as always, fellas."
"Thanks to you, I am not having chicken and waffles with a bona fide ten."
DANNY:
"Hold on, hold on."
Stop.
I...
I've lost my line.
Cut!
Twenty three takes!
I mean he stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War house wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
None of them thought to give him a bloody screen test?
Will Johnnie replace him?
This one has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
He is the tempered.
"If that empath young stays, the film fails, the national case with it."
He's a brave boy.
"With you, or I think so brave."
Is Mr.Baker alright?
He lost one of his grandsons
Oh!
Hit by a tram on shore leave.
Oh!
Must make it so much worse.
"If wasn't ""for"" anything."
Promise to Baker.
"This wasn't ""for"" anything."
Just think people like films.
Because story is a structure.
And...a shape.
Purpose and meaning.
One thing's turned bad.
"It's still part of a plan, you know, it's...it's...there's a point to it."
I like life.
"You don't believe in a match, do you?"
I believed this was gonna be a good picture.
No.
It's the truth.
And I'm sorry that I didn't mention it before.
"Honestly, it's still sort of confusing, trying to figure out how to explain it to people."
I think it's intriguing.
"Honey, we should probably get going soon."
"Hi, Sally..."
I should apologize for the way I ran off before.
I'm Samantha.
I'm having sex with your husband.
My wife doesn't usually meet the people
I'm sleeping with.
"Oh, dear."
Sorry about that.
It's fine.
We're both still a little shaky on the rules.
Got it.
"Look, I should probably go talk to her."
But I meant what I said before.
I'd like to see you again.
So...
Let me know.
Sure.
Definitely.
"Sure, they're throwing me a party now, but the ballet world is brutal."
"The girl I'm replacing was out by 24, with busted knees and a torn groin muscle..."
"Oh, and anorexia."
So at least she was skinny.
That's awful.
You don't get many shots at this.
"So when it comes, you have to claw for it..."
Even if it destroys you.
"Warm, nurturing, homebody."
- It's my mom's.
- You live at home at your age?
"Well, yeah, it's temporary."
"See, I used to live in New York."
I moved to L.A.
- Because I had this fiancée...
- Should have seen her apartment.
Steel.
What is it with people that want to live in a warehouse?
"Hi, I'm Nora."
- How do you do?
I'm Elise.
- You have something you need to do?
I do.
I'm organizing the linen chest.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
"Elise, when do you think I'll have my first date?"
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We do have work.
"Your dating techniques, your appearance, your hair."
What...
What's wrong with my hair?
- A little product wouldn't hurt.
- I don't need product.
"No, just for a little volume."
"Now, I need to prep you on what you're going to say."
"Oh, well, you know, I'm..."
"I know that I look young, but I've actually been dating for about 20 years, so I..."
And yet you've never sealed the deal.
"Well, maybe I've never wanted to ""seal the deal."""
- Don't be defensive.
- Shut up!
"- Right, shut up."
"I said if you don't pay me back, I'll cut off your thingy, right?"
I remember.
Mommy!
Morons.
"Put on your panty, honey!"
"Stop, you bastard!"
You're dead if I catch you!
This way!
Dumb bastards.
Hurry up and follow me!
"Bastards, I wish I had the money to pay you back."
I couldn't record anything this month.
This absolutely sucks.
What is it?
Why is here so dark?
# Sometimes I have this dream
# About someone holding me tightly
# A dream about a kiss
# But when I wake up I'm always alone
# Then I can't fall sleep again # because of loneliness
# After tumbling the whole night # I see the morning
"# Ah, how wonderful it would be"
# If it wasn't a dream
"# Instead, I wish"
# I could never wake up from my dream
# I miss a man's arms
# I miss a male's scent
Doctor?
Treating a sick heart is my specialty.
"Whenever I see a sick person, I can't just let it pass."
only the crickets answered.
And to make us more nervous...
Was he armed?
"Hey, that's when..."
I said:
We're going in.
I was determined.
Ducky was panicking.
"I thought he went to get the tire iron, but no."
He came back with a flashlight.
"I told C,duIie: don't move!"
"As we were about to go into the field, the corn started moving."
"Touchy was coming out, holding the kid by the arm."
He runs fast but not in the corn.
The kid let himself fall to the ground.
"I put the 12 gauge in his face, to keep him quiet."
When Touchy caught his breath...
What's he done to make me run like this?
Ducky showed him what the problem was.
The smashed statue.
The black kid looked at Touchy who couldn't get over it.
"Oh well, well, well..."
The kid looked less arrogant than before.
"And that's when C,duIie said:"
"Let him go, boys."
Boys...
She still called us that.
So if I understand...
"Mrs Lajeunesse wanted to let him go, but you didn't want to."
I agreed with her.
I said:
She's right.
"What are you doing here, Ryner?"
What could I say?
- This su...
"- If you say this sucks, I'm beating you up."
Don't hit me!
Relax.
The bleeding will start again.
Why are you so badly injured?
Forget the injuries.
There's something I have to tell you.
Your younger sister is gone.
Apparently she was killed some time ago.
"How do you know that, Ryner?"
I see.
I see it now.
"You're another pawn of Roland, aren't you?"
I didn't want to hear it.
I didn't want to hear that my sister is dead!
"Not from you, certainly!"
You knew it all?
"You knew that, and laughed?"
When I said I cared about you were you laughing at me for being such a foolish girl?
I had a vague idea that my sister might be dead.
But what could I do?
I...
I...
Why do we have wars?
I've got no interest in who owns what land.
That's why I said I liked afternoon naps the most.
"Tahile, Tony, and Fahle all died senseless deaths."
What are you saying?
It must be the motivated guys who start wars.
"- Before you picked me, you didn't tell?"
- No.
- I always assumed...
- No.
Well... .
Let's go see our boss.
- Hey.
- How was the NGA?
"Oh, you know the governors, too many mandates, too little money."
- I can hear that one at home.
- Good one.
- The governors liked it.
- Yeah.
Have you announced for the governor of New Jersey bill?
- Excuse me?
- Did I miss an announcement?
That's three years away.
I'm trying to serve...
I never heard of these loans.
So I'm assuming it's a campaign proposal.
Camden and Newark will go nuts.
I know it's not national.
- Give me a break.
- Know how I know?
National programs are announced by the president unless this White House passes on them first.
"Toby, this is a nickel-and-dime program."
Calm down.
Right.
We're announcing a new replacement for Social Security...
- I thought we were...
- They're not your nickels.
- They're not your dimes!
Madam!
Why is this house locked?
Who are you?
Whom do you want to meet?
"Gardener, why is this house locked?"
Where is sir?
Who?
Mr. Kumar.
"Oh, you mean him?"
He was really nice fellow.
Its been long since he has left this place!
Where did he leave for?
"I dont know, sir."
But afterthis mansion was auctioned..
..nobody saw him around here!
Auction?
"Yeah, now Mr. Dhanraj owns this mansion."
Dhanraj?
!
And what about his family?
His brothers?
They were not brothers but rather brutes.
And now they have become quite rich.
They have started factory with help of those auction money!
Both of the brothers have taken away all the money.
Mr. Kumar and his younger sisterwere..
..thrown out of this house!
They have left this house as if they were leaving this world!
But why did he agree to all this?
Why did he put up with their dishonesty?
Why did he leave silently?
What could he do?
[clicker clicks]
Kept me distracted.
Kept me from scratching my scars open.
♫♫ [woman singing opera]
Ahem.
That was my father's.
"Second War, paratrooper."
Dropped men behind the lines at night.
Can't talk.
Snipers.
So... [clicking]
Crickets.
Wow.
[chuckle]
I just want you to know that working on this case has been a gift.
Yes.
"I know that I stumbled at first, but I've grown."
I saw the video.
You surpassed all my expectations.
Thank you.
That' all I've ever wanted.
"To stand in front of a jury, wow them with my eloquence, and... it's all thanks to you."
No.
"And I want you to know that, no matter what happens in this case, it's not going to affect our feelings, is it?"
No.
W-Why do you keep shoving these fucking pictures at me?
"I mean, they do get a closer look."
You got to be really strong to do that.
I don't even know what that means.
When do I get my car back?
That's it?
That's all you got to say to me?
- A roaring fire.
"- Bread, cheese."
- Dripping.
"- Add a little love, makes a meal fit for a king."
I think they're happier being poor.
"Yes, or perhaps not."
"Oh, well, who gives a toss anyway?"
Let's check what's in the larder.
Any food?
"Erm, only a couple of dirty mags."
Huh?
"Oh, yeah."
I'm sure there's a reason why we shouldn't be doing this but I can't put my finger on it.
Don't overtax your tiny mind.
It's concentrating on breathing.
"Shut up, the cheque's in the post."
"Yeah, whose show is this anyway?"
"I'm the famous one, love."
"Come, let us go to the supermarket."
Right.
What a rotten shop.
There's never anything you want to buy.
For example...
"""Cruizos."
Bite-sized cruise-missile shaped lumps of potato flavoured snack.
"""Warning-will give you cancer. """
Everything gives you cancer these days.
You can't blow off without being told it's carcinogenic.
"- In my case, it probably is."
- Probably.
"- Careful, you'll get grabbed by the dick."
- Oo-er.
- Maybe he's bi.
- No one's bi.
Ever met a 70-year-old bisexual?
At some point you make a choice.
"Thus the expression, ""Bi now, gay later."""
- Maybe he hasn't decided.
- He better decide.
I can't keep missing work.
My hamstrings are killing me.
I don't know how I'm gonna make it up and down stairs at the Coliseum.
"It's Staples Center, dumb-ass."
Who knew too much sex could make you cranky?
- I wish I was cranky from too much sex.
- What are you and Joe up to tonight?
We are going to a club.
Yeah.
"This, um, band that Joe used to love."
- How very 20-something of you.
- We're in serious need of fun.
Last time I heard my husband laugh was with another mom.
Another mom?
Uh-oh.
Is someone feeling a little possessive?
"Oh, please."
She's hardly the issue.
"So, this club, do they let parents in or is it seniors' night?"
No.
"- Oh, definitely no."
- Come on now.
Hey.
- That is my favorite date dress.
- No wonder you're still single.
- Same stakes?
"-Sure, go ahead."
"Hey, that's not bad."
- Where'd you learn your pitching?
-From the farmer's daughter.
Something I've been meaning to ask.
It has to do with security.
Shoot.
We're having a tough time keeping stuff from the Krauts.
"Like our escape equipment, for instance."
So we're always looking for new devices.
Uh-huh.
Looks like you found one.
- Me?
"-Well, I mean the lieutenant."
"He hid a time bomb on him, right?"
"He even carried it through prisoners' search, didn't he?"
Where did he hide it?
Right in his pocket.
- The old cigarette-match gag.
-What's that?
"You take a book of matches, light a cigarette, slip it in."
It takes about three minutes for the cigarette to burn.
Then it sets off the matches.
Simple.
Some time bomb.
"Hey, that's a ringer."
"O come ye, O come ye"
To Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
"O come, let us adore him"
Wanna come with me and check out a real live architecture class?
(EX CLAIMS) Not even a little bit.
"You know, I'll just hang here with Marshall and Lily."
- It'll be fun.
- Fantastic.
- Okay.
"- Well, have a seat."
Relax.
"Yeah, this is casual."
"This is all very, very, very casual."
Listen to me.
You want me to find the perfect girl so we can all grow old together?
That is her.
"Do not let any guy near her, okay?"
"That means no waiter takes her order, no busboy clears her table."
"If she bursts into flames, I want a fire woman putting her out."
I don't think 911 takes requests.
"Damn it, Marshall!"
"Whatever you have to do, keep Maggie Wilks single until I get back."
I left my tab open.
Don't abuse it.
- Target secure?
- Target secure.
"- Oh, my gosh."
How weird.
- (MAGGIE LAUGHS)
We all walked out of the bathroom at the same time.
"Well, let's all walk back to the booth together."
(WOMEN CHUCKLING)
"(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, my."
"Look at this, the table where we are sitting."
Back off!
"Sulu, our communications are being interfered with."
"Now, get this straight:"
Do anything you think necessary to protect the ship.
"Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything."
Clear?
"Clear, captain."
But you...
Never mind about me.
Protect my ship.
"Yes, sir."
"Photon torpedoes negative, captain."
I'm warping out of orbit.
Good.
Contact me when you can.
Kirk out.
"How is he, doctor?"
He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.
They're moving.
I've got to get to the captain.
"I've locked on to the enemy, captain."
They're moving toward the high ground.
They've locked on to my tricorder.
Very ingenious.
They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
We'll see how ingenious they are.
"Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher."
Lang!
Any word from the Enterprise?
Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
"They got Lang, sir."
- Did you see them?
"- No, sir."
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan...
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The F.B. I. Called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. For a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
I could postpone the meeting... find out what they asked the other folks before going in there.
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
I'll just go in then.
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett...
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was... he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
I miss him too.
"But we're working together now, and you need to trust me."
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
- I never applied.
"Oh, my God."
I cannot believe he actually did it.
"Months ago, Chuck joked about applying for you."
He said you had too much pride to admit N.Y.U. Was a mistake.
Looks like he actually did something right for once.
Congratulations.
"Oh, thanks."
You're not at the gala?
Yeah.
I thought it'd be best for everybody if I didn't go.
I see my father is still working his magic.
It's not all him.
"Yes, it is."
It's just that no one else sees it.
You make my mom happier than all of her ex-husbands combined.
"It should be you with her tonight,"
Not some guy who pulled a disappearing act.
"Well, I am already in the tux."
"Elliot, what are you doing here?"
Your father invited me?
He said he didn't think you had plans tonight.
Not me.
I hope that's okay.
"It's okay to be mad at him, Eric,"
"But it's okay to let him try to make it right, too."
All right.
I'm heading out.
Wish me luck.
You don't need it.
You're the only one for her.
After Dr. Van Der Woodsen organized
- Yes.
- Why did you fire Pete?
- Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"It's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
- Can we talk about this on Monday'?
"- No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.
"Yeah, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Holla at your boy!
"Hey, you will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer."
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
Excuse me.
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line-- you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
Can you believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"What do you want on yours, baby?"
"I want all the hot dogs, please."
He's always doing fine.
"You won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, the Nobel Prize for literature."
That's a lot of pressure on a little suicide note that you know everybody's gonna read.
It's just so dark.
Doesn't even sound like him.
But dark is good.
Dark's like the new black.
Look at Louis CK.
Got his own show.
He's dark.
"If I was gonna kill myself, I know exactly what I'd do."
"I would, uh..."
I'd kill myself with kindness.
"Take a handful of pills, hop in bed."
Maybe some Enya.
In some countries...
Get this.
"In some countries, it's illegal to commit suicide."
It's against the law for you to kill yourself.
Okay?
Are you with me here?
"Sir, I want you to focus, okay?"
I realize you're dead.
Step out of the vehicle and put your hands behind your back.
"If you wanna play tough guy, we've got all night, all right?"
"Handcuffs seem like overkill, but I have to arrest you."
You have the right to remain...
Bad law.
- Hello?
"- Hey, Chelsea."
"It's me, Julia."
- I've been trying to call Eddie.
Whoo.
What a dumbass!
"Well, probably not your finest hour, Stacey, but..."
"No, him."
I didn't want to.
Luke dared me.
"Your boyfriend dared you, so it's his fault?"
What was I supposed to do?
"Stacey, just because he asked you, doesn't mean you had to do it, you're the one who's responsible for you, and..."
We're in a relationship and you are not my guidance counselor.
OK.
Where's Luke right now?
At his mom's.
He thought I was funny.
"Well, Stacey, you now have aspiration pneumonia."
How funny is that?
Not.
You may have also done lasting damage to your respiratory system.
"- Wait, for reals?"
"- Yeah, for reals."
Stacey...
Luke sounds like a bad boyfriend.
I love him so much.
I just wanted to make him happy.
"Hmm, it's interesting."
"That's it, that's all you got?"
- The eggs are brown.
If you...
- They're supposed to be brown!
- Not really.
- It's a country omelette!
What would it take for you to reconsider your decision?
We'll end the year with our usual nice profit.
We could triple our profits.
And we could go bankrupt.
So you won't even consider it?
"I'm afraid the answer is ""No. """
"But listen, John, if you'd just..."
Hello!
"Oh, did I interrupt anything?"
"No, no, my dear."
We've finished.
"How're you, Harold?"
"Hello, Mrs. Brown."
You didn't tell me you were coming into town today.
"Oh, I thought it'd be fun to pop in and surprise you."
You can take me to lunch.
I'm afraid I have an appointment.
If you'd have mentioned it this morning...
"Well, then it wouldn't have been a surprise."
I'm afraid I can't stand many more surprises today.
Maybe Harold will volunteer to take you to lunch.
"I'm sure Harold has his own plans, dear."
"Nothing important, Mrs. Brown."
I'd be happy to volunteer.
But you do have an appointment.
I'll change it.
It's no problem for a junior partner.
"Goodbye, dear."
"Hors d'oeuvre, madame?"
"Yes, please."
Oeufs a la russe?
Yes.
It must have been a girl.
How do you feel?
"Still dopey, otherwise I'm in the pink."
What I came to say is...
"Leave off, will you?"
It could have happened to anybody.
How are the boys?
"Well, they're fine."
Can I get you something?
Not a thing.
Sure now?
"Sure, I'm fine."
"Except, my feet they're very cold."
Do you think you could tuck that blanket in for me?
I can't reach it from here.
Sure.
"Ooh, that's much better."
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master Delacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
"What's with you and God, anyway?"
"We know you love Miss Orthodox, does that mean you have to wear this costume for her?"
"Yes, but you wouldn't understand since you only love yourself."
- Witty!
- Did you find work?
"No, and please don't bug me about it."
Why don't you move back home?
"I swear to God, if you don't shut up..."
Don't take His name in vain!
Let's not waste time.
I have to open soon.
- Are we watching a movie?
- Patience.
Recognize this picture?
It's from when Morn took you to Paris.
So what?
We know the picture.
Look carefully.
See anything odd?
- Is this a quiz?
- Just play along.
Who took the picture?
"Aunt Rosa, of course."
This is from the same trip.
Aunt Rosa just had the eye surgery that she still talks about.
I don't think she went around taking pictures of you.
"Wow, Shai, James Bond has nothing on you."
She reminds me of Stevie Wonder-.
So who took this picture?
I don't remember a thing.
I was only five.
Look.
"Lower it very gently, lower it."
(Boards creaking)
Very nice.
Tie it off.
Tie it off.
"My God, that was heavy."
Good work.
I don't understand it.
"It took nine of us to lift it, we've taken two of the three coffin lids off, yet the whole thing still weighs a ton."
- Mummy must be made of lead.
- HOWARD:
Here's your answer.
The first two coffins were made of wood covered in gold foil.
The third coffin isn't wood.
It's solid gold.
And they said this might not be a royal tomb.
There is one thing that's bothering me.
Look at Harry's photographs.
The physiognomy of the second coffin is completely different from the other two.
Mace always said these shrines were botched up.
I think this one was made for someone else.
I think they buried our friend in a hurry.
"And I think it's time we had a look, don't you?"
HOWARD:
Ready?
Lift.
(Grunting)
"Pecky, tell me when you have it."
PECKY:
I'll take it now.
"Behind me, behind me, go behind me."
Behind me.
!
"No, Yoon Jae's home to get some clothes."
"Honey, Son-in-law seems different, doesn't he?"
"He doesn't seem to mind his manners, and he doesn't think too well of us."
He treats Da Ran with no care.
Right?
"You felt that too, right?"
Yes!
"Even so, I like him even more!"
I think he's comfortable with our family now!
"Now, he seems to be our son-in-law so I'm really happy!"
"Well, if it's because he's comfortable, it's a good thing."
Got it.
Come in faster.
Yoon Jae lives alone too?
His parents live overseas.
Don't just touch his stuff!
We have to hurry up and pack some clothes.
Oh!
I told you not to touch anything!
Come here.
This is where the clothes are.
Pick out some outfits to wear.
"Ah, you surprised me!"
What should I do when you take off your clothes like that?
"It's something you see all the time, so why are you so surprised?"
Change your clothes quickly.
It's something you always see.
Why are you just sneeking a peek?
Just look at it.
I've never seen it.
Why's she acting like that?
"Ted, look at this."
I can pull all these video stills up.
"Come on, we have enough here to build a case."
Do you want to tell me what's going on?
What happened that night?
"Okay, I needed him."
I needed someone and he wouldn't even talk to me.
"I understand, all right?"
You felt abandoned.
No one was there for you.
"No one was there to listen, not even Aldo."
Like I didn't even exist.
"Look, just tell me... what happened that night, okay?"
"I can help you, no matter what you did."
(sniffs)
I didn't kill Aldo.
I did something worse.
What's worse than killing?
I went looking for him in Bellevue.
He started to go there to buy his drugs.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.
"Then, as I'm watching him, someone pulls up."
The driver gets out and jumps Aldo.
Who was it?
I don't know.
"Come on, Ted, look at me."
You have to remember who this was.
It could save you.
"Whatever happens, I deserve."
Because I froze.
I didn't help him.
"Aldo got taken and I just let it happen, like-like I wasn't even there."
He's making his way north.
He'll surface.
Aubrey.
"Hey, so I was able to filter out most of the visual noise from the doorbell video."
Did you find the vehicle that was following Aldo?
"Yeah, I'll send you a link."
It's a '97 Intrepid.
Did you get a plate number?
"I couldn't from this angle, so I went through all the traffic cams in the area."
The car belongs to Ted McKinney.
He's former military.
He actually served in Booth's unit.
Booth's not gonna like this.
"Me either, Cher."
That is not something I wanted to see.
"If you think I killed Aldo, you're nuts."
I don't know what to think.
Why were you following him?
That's my business.
"Well, you're in here, so it becomes my business now."
You really think Booth's the guy for this?
They have a history.
I can't think of anyone better.
BOOTH:
Recognize that car?
It might be mine.
It might be yours.
"Oh, I think it's yours, 'cause that is you inside of the car."
Following Aldo.
That's not true.
"""That's not true?"""
Come on.
#Lap me up
# Why don't you come on and lap me up... #
All right?

Walking on the beaches Looking at the peaches... #
All right?
#...
"Well, there goes another one Just lying down on the sand dunes"
#I'd better go take a swim and see If I can cool down a little bit... #
"- It's hot in here, isn't it?"
"- Yeah, it's quite hot in here."
#...
Things on our minds You know what I mean... #
Um... hi.
"I wonder if you could help us, please."
We're looking for a...
"Hey, do you want to head outside, get some fresh air?"
#...
Looking at the peaches... #
- All right.
- #...
Just take a look over there... #
"- No, I haven't."
- Um... #...
Is she trying to get out of that clitoris?
#Liberation for women That's what I preach
#Preacher man... #
Are you OK?
#...
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches... #
Here we are.
#...
"Well, I don't have it."
- Is there anything else?
- Yeah.
Why did you bring them back here in the first place?
I was hungry.
My last meal left me just a little unsatisfied and they were yummy.
You might think about curbing that appetite.
"Hey, hairy palms, what's it to you?"
You jealous much?
I have to find Olivia before she hurts someone else.
"In the meantime, keep the door locked and your eyes open."
- Where are you gonna look for her?
- Furies always have sisters.
"Big, strong Dyson."
Is it true you're a cop now?
How tame.
I know Olivia's sick.
Tell me where she is so I can help her.
Someone tried to kill our sister.
No one we don't trust gets near her.
"Ladies, we're here under the auspices of The Ash, okay?"
Wanna mess with that?
"- Well, we can't get her out."
- That's why you bring a Siren.
I promise.
We'll do what we can for her.
It cuts the stems and pulls off all the pretty petals.
Someone's breaking in!
Not asleep.
Not me.
I'm fine.
- I gotta go check on our house guest.
"Oh, just leave it!"
You're going to wake him up...
So what?
God bless you!
Help me!
"Mom, why return so soon?"
Look at you!
"Such strength, what's yourshoe size now?"
Yourson...
Yourson.
Yourbabies will be someone else's but his will be ours.
Where were you?
If I'd known I would have picked you up...
I called many times.
You didn't answer.
"Oh dear, sorry."
Love is in the air.
"If you screw up love, it starts to stink."
Your husband's fingerprints?
Back again for a fidelity reading.
"This strong man, your lover, in his thirties, with wide shoulders..."
"Look sugar-puff; dunno about the wide shoulders with a guy at 58, I only care about his wallet."
Then he definitely has a son...
"Yes, he is cheating on you."
With a woman ora man?
"Listen baby-cakes, if you don't know this shit, shut up!"
"There is no strong, young guy."
"That old fart dumped me, okey?"
Which one?
But there's a young guy...
Enough!
"If you figure it out, just fax me orsomething."
Woman's pump at 10:00.
"Oh, so how does it feel being the, uh... little guy?"
What's that?
Earthquake?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Blech!
"And now, for the moment of truth."
It fits!
The shakes worked.
"Hi, there."
I thought you might like to try our new flavors.
"Gaunt grape and lean, mean nectarine."
"Thanks, but I lost all the weight I had to."
I don't need any more shakes.
You really think so?
You guys must work on commission.
"As you can plainly see,"
I... (gasps) look awful.
I'll take two cases.
"Quick, before the firemen have to come and cut me out of my bedroom."
"Hey, by the way, how did your meeting go with the president of Everything Emporium?"
Not bad.
"At first, it wasn't going well, but then he had, uh..."
metamorphoses.
"Either you're up to something, or..."
"No, that's it."
You're up to something.
"Mmm, Sabrina, you've got to try these croissants."
They're just like Grandma used to make.
"Well, not my grandma, but someone's grandma who knew how to bake."
"- It seems to say ignore these guys, I'm with you."
"Well, it's not Nick and His Friends' Infinite Playlist."
- Right.
"- Oh, that's sweet."
I say we do a drive-by.
No.
Absolutely...
I was loopy there.
I think it was pretty late.
Pretty early.
You can normally tell by our eyes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You didn't CGI out any of the red in some places.
I'm sure it was...
Or maybe you did.
No.
I took some of the red out of your cheeks in the exteriors because you looked cold.
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- Hey, did you have to take out some of our icy cold breath coming out of our mouths?"
- No.
We just didn't use...
- No?
Look at that face.
"Look, they were falling in love."
"You see a bit of breath in this movie, don't you?"
"- Well, this is worth talking about."
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Kevin Corrigan.
"Ari, tell us about your evening this night."
"This was, like, 3:00 in the morning and we were supposed to shoot a whole other scene."

[school bell rang]
"Okay class, we're done for today."
What do you think you're doing?
I...
I just want to take my notes back.
"Eonni, what are you doing?"
(Eonni - older sister)
Sorry.
Are you scared?
"If I only knew, I wouldn't lend it to you!"
Do I have to make it more obvious?
The President is my father!
It's not me!
Da Hye!
"Just now, sorry about it."
This is my first time as a security guard.
"When my father became President,"
I have expected these things to happen.
So I've never had any friends.
Take these.
They should be suitable for you.
"Now, I'm going to the nightclubs."
"You can't wear guard clothes when you go inside, right?"
I certainly don't want to show any surprising flaws.
We will be going to Jiaye Ban.
Ah.. noisy!
I forgot to post the invites.
Dinner is served.
-
- Last few what at the old price?
-
- W--Worry about that when we get 'em inside!
-
"- We need a bigger window, you know."
-
- What for?
So we can write bigger letters.
I doubt if they can read that across the street.
All this m--money I'm spending on advertising!
I'm n--not r--r--reaching p--people.
All this money?
What money?
One little brush and a pot of whitewash!
"Do you want to cross the road, love?"
Off we go!
It's all clear.
"How about a kiss, then, to start the day right?"
"It might start your flaming' day right, but it won't do a lot for me!"
I see you've just met Dennis.
That's Dennis.
We're training him for a round of his own.
I hope it's not round here!
Thank God it's dark.
Suppose somebody had seen me kissing the milkman!
Some of these firms spend a lot of m--money on advertising.
That's it.
"If it's gonna cost money, that's us finished before we start!"
I'll fix that guy's wagon.
"I gotta go to town, but I'll be back tomorrow."
"- But, Patsy--"
- I gotta go change my clothes.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
"- Funny, right over--"
- It would've been nice--
- It's just a hair--
- See a beautiful life in this--
"- Hey, boss."
- What is it?
"Been doing all right for yourselves, haven't you?"
And Joe's been doing himself plenty of good.
"- Well, what do you say?"
- We thought you was through.
What gave you that idea?
"- You're a reformer now, ain't you?"
- Who's running this racket?
You was.
Who is now?
- Me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
You think I built this racket up for seven years to let you guys walk away with it?
I'm telling you all something.
You're through.
And as for you....
- Wait a minute.
- Dirty son of a--
Keep those gats in your pockets.
"- Come on, let's get out of here."
"- Yeah, go ahead."
Take care of that rat.
"- of course you can, baby."

- we get our own presents this year?
- yep.
and i didn't even use the claw machine. [chuckles]
- what about me?

"- so, you need to start dressing a little more respectable."
- this is really great what you did.
we are gonna be so happy together!
"- um, can i give this to you outside?"
"awesome. bye, baby."
come on.
"- come here, champ."
let me look at you.
"- look at me, dad."
- look at that!
"she made you stronger, too, huh?"
- [sighs] here. open it.
[paper ripping]
- your hammered gold record?
"- well, i figured it would take care of your account over there at the dollar king, 'cause i know all that wasn't cheap."
- wow.

"and the ring, too?"
Let me do that.
It'II be faster and simple.
-I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
-What are those underneath?
Those are love letters yellowing with antiquity...
-...all from one boy.
Give those back.
-I'm just gonna have a look.
-The touch of your hands insults them.
"-Now, don't pull that stuff."
"Now that you've touched them, I'II burn them."
What are they?
Poems a dead boy wrote.
I hurt him the way that you would Iike to hurt me.
But you can't.
"I'm not young and vulnerable anymore, but my young husband was, and I...."
Never mind about that.
Just give them back to me.
Thank you.
What'd you mean by saying you have to burn them up?
I'm sorry.
I must have lost my head for a moment.
Everyone has something they won't let others touch because of their--
Their intimate nature.
AmbIer and AmbIer.
Crabtree.
-More AmbIer and AmbIer.
-What's AmbIer and AmbIer?
A firm that made loans on the place.
-It was lost on a mortgage.
-That must have been what happened.

And this flaming janitor comes out the door.
TJ is the janitor of the school.
"And after the building blows up, he's the person"
One that comes out in flames.
So Kimberly's gonna light him.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Now, this is a broomstick"
That's lit in flames?
WOMAN:
Just the tip.
It's like a long match.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, a long match."
OK.
"OK, so she ignites him, staggers along here,"
Runs around like a maniac.
Slides down the banister here and we'll
Put him out right down there where that big blood patch is.
INTERVIEWER:
He's playing a janitor.
Who you don't actually see before or after this.
"But you know, hey, we can light a guy on fire,"
"So might as well, right?"
"Now is there flames only on his back,"
"Or his front, or his side?"
His full back.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
Nothing on the front.
So that's why he's gonna be twisting.
"Yeah, I'll be twisting and getting the flame all the way."
And [shouting]
A little more exotic than I'm used to.

"Japanese thanks, sh..."

"That is your name, isn't it?"
You will call him Mr. swanato.
Japanese let's go.
Nick saved my life.
He has proven much to me already.
So you may call me sh...
"It's a good name, huh?"

You'll just have to accept what's happened and make the best of it.
Mother.
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.

I'm going to New York.

I was only trying to protect you.
I was an accident you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.

"- Goodbye, Selena."
Appreciate it.
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
That's an arm.
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
–What'd he say?
–He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
–Pretty ugly stuff.
–That sounds like Armadillo's MO.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
–We got cut off.
–Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"–An ax, maybe a machete."
–How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
–Three to four hours.
–So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
–Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
Really?
- Haven't you exhausted the subject?
- No.
"No, I wanna go deeper, you know?"
I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires.
"I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires."
Just different from the way we always thought they were.
What do you mean?
"Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders, you know."
Um...
Misunderstood.
"You're kidding, right?"
Don't you think it could be possible?
You did give me all that info.
"Jeremy, I made it up, okay?"
"I mean, you were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression."
- Is there anything you're not good at?
- Double dating.
This is all kind of new to me.
I usually keep to myself.
I don't always fit in.
- That's because you're that guy.
- What guy?
The guy who seems like he has everything.
So the people that don't kind of run the other way.
- Is that what I seem like?
- Pretty much.
Hm.
- What a dick.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, um..."
Yuuki-kun?
!
I thought the Supporter eliminated you!
I destroyed my Noblesse phone and disappeared on purpose so I could get revenge on him.
I have an urgent request.
Yes?
Move the third trailer to the front.
Of course.
Thank you.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that tomorrow you continue to be a worthy savior.
Juiz.
Juiz...
You were the best employee I ever worked with.
No. 09.
I can no longer be your guardian angel.
No. 01 is making a bid to win the game.
But I'm betting on you.
Don't forget your promise.
Promise?
I pray that you'll be a compassionate king.
Go.
Help him in any way you can.
Kuroha-san...
I'm going back to Japan.
Ato-san's not happy about it either.
the political fallout will be huge.
That's exactly why we need Iinuma-sensei's son as our scapegoat.
I have faith that in the end you'll prevail.
you're the man who launched 60 missiles at his own country.
You have my word.
"And one day, who knows?"
"All right, sir."
I'm sure the senator can handle Mr. Webster.
There is one concern we need to...
"Oh, right, concern."
Laine?
K told me about your little sexual romp in college.
Shit.
Tomorrow is the 17th.
- Glenda?
"- Yes, sir?"
Tomorrow is Jacobson's birthday.
Have you got something for the son of a bitch?
"Yes, sir."
You got him a leather-bound Don Quixote.
"Oh, good."
Good gift.
Metaphorical gift.
He'll be trying to figure out why I got him that forever.
"Ah, were you married at the time?"
"Uh, I was a freshman in..."
"You know, sir, I'm just not going to comment on the whole thing."
It's beneath me and it's beneath the press.
That's the way to go.
Fuck the press.
Senator Hanson does not kiss and tell.
- It's perfect.
- Maybe I was too rough on Shelly in Hartford.
"Then this would all be moot, 'cause you wouldn't be president, sir."
You know what?
"Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys, the whole football team."
Who the fuck cares?
Tiny Eyes!
I think revenge is a dish best served flaming.
Why did you do that?
It was such a cool line.
"The other day, you mentioned your Saint Bernards."
"You had two, I believe."
What were their names?
I don't think we ever got around to naming them.
Dusty and Bear?
I thought Dustybear Financial had an odd ring to it.
You made it up.
Roger didn't get me fired.
And he didn't derail my mayorship.
"I did, by being a sucky mayor."
"The jig is up, sweetheart."
"You baited me with an old newspaper, cooked up this plan, then ran me around on a wild-goose chase."
Why?
"You were so down, and I-"
- I wanted to get that spark back.
What better way than blowing up someone's office?
But does it spoil all the fun we had to know I made it all up?
The fact that you made all this up for me is so much better than any revenge.
- Boom.
- [ Chuckles ]
Listen up.
"So, Roger didn't fire you..."
but he is a total d-bag.
"Yeah, tremendous d-bag."
Shall we?
Let's.
Come on.
Hey!
"Keep him safe and I will light a candle in Torrecastro, Holy Mother."
Why didn't you tell him before?
His burden is great enough.
"Besides, it would ruin his voyage of discovery."
"Prime the pan, close the steel, butt to the ground"
"Charge the barrel, spit the ball,"
Pop it in with your thumb.
"Draw the ramrod, ram it home."
Put it back in its hole.
Bring her back and she's ready to fire
"- You wanted to see me, sir?"
"- Yeah, er..."
Teresa has a plan that might improve the odds in or favour
"I'd like to know what you think, let you decide."
Tell me.
Torrecastro has strong defences.
We can't attack from the outside.
But there must be a way in.
I will go on ahead.
"As a Spaniard, I can find it."
No!
I forbid it.
Easy dear boy
Easy.
"I said I'd let you decide, have the last word"
"Oh, forget it."
He forbids it.
Who does he think he is?
Who does he think I am?
"Evening, Sergeant Harper."
"- You want to make me sergeant, sir?"
- Get a needle and thread.
And he's very blunt with Da Ran too...
Right?
"-You felt that too, right?"
-Yes!
That's why I was so happy!
He must finally feel comfortable with our family!
"Now it really feels like, he's become our son-in-law, so I'm so very happy!"
Well...
If it's because he's become comfortable....
It's a relief then.
It worked.
"Hurry, hurry."
Hurry up and come in.
Does our Yoon Jae live by himself too?
His parents are overseas.
Don't carelessly touch random stuff!
Let's quickly pack up what we need.
I told you not to touch things!
Come here.
The clothes are in here.
Pack up a few things to wear from here.
Oh my goodness!
You scared me!
How can you...be undressed like that!
Why are you surprised when it's something that you probably see all the time?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why steal glances when you see it all the time?
"Here, just look."
I haven't seen it!
What's wrong with you?
"When I was completely naked in the hospital, you ran over and hugged me."
"'Yoon Jae, I thought you were dead!"
What?
You said you saw twenty Ree.
Yeah?
What you talking about?
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.
You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.
"Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen, it don't matter."
I wasn't gonna hang around counting fucking feathers.
As a matter of fact what was you doing down by the creek all by yourself?
I'd already brought up plenty of water.
Hey!
"Answer me, Fitzgerald."
I asked you a question.
Don't question me on account of you feel guilty.
Answer me or I'll blow your head off.
"You got a short-term memory, boy."
Your ass would be floating around the Missouri right now if it wasn't for me.
You want to ask questions?
What you want to ask?
"If you want to know, ask it."
Hmm?
You want to know why you left
"Mr. Glass back there for dead, huh?"
Or why you left your little boyfriend running around?
You want to know if he's still alive?
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.
It's 'cause you was scared shitless.
You're scared now.
The Ree.
What of them?
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor.
It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop.
Hang on.
It's the wildebeest.
Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
W-What the hell did she say?
"She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what."
That bitch!
How do you want to handle it?
"Um, okay."
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
Got it.
Is it going to be in 3-D?
What?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna say 3-D.
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.
You're kidding.
3-D?
That's what I hear.
Then the studio must have real faith in it.
Wonder why she didn't tell me.
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
No...
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?
"Well, it's not as much ""surprised"" as you know..."
uh... the other thing.
What other thing?
"Well, if you... uh..."
I don't... oh...
What's the word I'm looking for?
Okay.
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Okay, see you later."
Bye.
Good evening and welcome to The Bombay.
The next song is one of my favourites.
I hope you like it.
And now a song dedicated to La Loba.
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is our spirit and our wives, right?"
She applies the real ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need it, you have to, pay look, I like it, I want it, buy it and fuck you."
You can't do anything about it.
And when we get home tired and ask:
How did it go?
"How was your day, honey?"
They are always grouchy and reply:
Do you really want to know?
No man!
It's hard to deal with them every day.
But that's how it is.
We have to learn to live with it.
"Don't you think so, Miss?"
"Hey, Beto!"
"- Hello, beautiful!"
I don't get it.
You live in this mansion and we have to fuck in this room.
Did you like my stockings?
"Yes, they're terrific."
"I have really nice legs, right?"
Legs are not important.
- Why not?
There is a bottle in the fridge.
There's sippy cups.
Don't give her any juice though.
Only water.
"And, well, you know where the diapers are, so... well, you really should use those organic disposable kinds because they're better for the environment."
"Well, here you go!"
"Thank you, honey."
You are the best friend ever.
"- Well, thank you."
- For what?
For believing in me.
"You coulda hired a babysitter, but you didn't."
"Oh, it's okay, bubba."
Bye-bye!
Okay.
What does she like to play with?
"Uh, mostly Tupperware."
I can't believe you did that.
- What?
Adam?
- Yeah.
"I gave him the ticket as payment to look at the contract, which he did, by the way."
"Okay, you know what?"
Whatever.
"I was hoping that you guys would get back together, and just put everybody out of your misery."
"- But I'm guessing it didn't work, huh?"
- Just drop it.
"We need to focus on this interview, and I swear to God, if I hear the name ""Adam"" one more time, I'm gonna--"
Hey.
I'm Adam.
"What, are you the... doughnut guy?"
"No, dude."
-I have nothing to tell!
-Impossible!
"At least something real, at most a dream."
Do you think it is nothing?
The dreams are part of the reality.
Is this the only reality?
-Then it will let me go?
I see.
"Then you, wherever you want."
"Well, I dreamt, that I went to a shoeshop with my boyfriend."
"Is this the story, which I interpreted?"
"Yes of course, you deserve it."
It was the most wonderful shoeshop ever seen.
There was no customer.
"Only a few women dummies, a shoeshine black... and the owner of the business."
I would like some red boots!
"Suddenly I realised, that the owner was you."
Your final fulfilment.
As you would have expected.
Run along.
"-Yes, master."
"But, Lucia!"
What are you doing?
Don't you you see?
I am with Tinto Brass.
"Aye, director!"
Ripped by elcodigo and retranslated
We need this completely filled.
We don't have time to haggle over price.
Understood.
Captain.
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
"We were scared and miserable, and we took it out on each other."
Us and everybody else.
That's high school.
"But you suffer through that, and it gets better."
I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that.
"You over, Barry."
Nothing is gonna get better for me.
Not ever.
Dean!
Find the hair!
"Hey, buddy, this isn't what it looks like"
Little help?
He's giving you the full cowgirl.
"Five more minutes, Jerry."
"Amanda, hey!"
"Gettysburg Address, 1863, right?"
History test next period.
We're studying.
"Come on, baby."
She means nothing to me.
Don't be mad.
"I'm not mad, Dean."
"I thought maybe... underneath your whole ""I could give a crap,"" bad-boy thing, that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
"And you spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool, but it's just an act."
We both know that you're just a sad... lonely little kid.
"Come, give me a hand."
Come on.
That's it...
Excuse me so much!
I'm just a little dizzy.
Maybe I haven't eaten sufficiently today.
- Thanks a lot...
"- Don't be in such a hurry, Miss."
First I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.
So that you'll feel better.
"Bruno, bring the girl to the apartment."
I'll come by soon.
"- Many thanks, I really am fine again..."
- He's my brother!
Allow me:
Mechelke.
"Now just come here, Miss..."
And then nothing more.
No news and no address.
"Just poste restante, the main post office, Berlin."
My letters are there now.
He didn't even pick them up.
What do you want to do now?
Turn to the refugee centre?
Should I give the refugee centre a sob story?
That he promised me...faithfully his mother's ring.
He promised to return for me but then let me down till I cleared off to the West.
Away with it!
And I don't even know his address.
I won't be kicked to the curb like that!
I've had enough of compassion and humilation at home.
But I'll find him soon and settle the score.
Fine.
Here.
Take it.
- Keep the bell.
- What?
"I thought we were gonna handle this like adults, Jess."
"Yeah, well, I thought you were the love of my life, so..."
"Suck it, Mr. Crabs."
- You hit that guy.
- Whatevs.
You know.
You know what?
Maybe I didn't have respect for you before because if this is what respecting you feels like this is definitely not how I felt.
So you recognize.
"Represent, what?"
"Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest."
I've been messing with you.
It's just that I wanted my old room back.
"You know, you're right."
I've been away a long time and things have changed here.
So I guess I kind of gotta get used to that.
You can keep the big room.
"See, now you're just deep dogging me, man."
I'm not scared of your mind games.
"I'm taking the small room, Winston."
"- Schmidt, that's not what I mean..."
- No.
Listen to what I mean.
You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home.
I'm not falling for it.
"What do you take me for, some kind of idiot?"
Yes.
It's right under your nose.
Vadim.
You let me know the second you find these guys.
Copy that.
Somebody please shut the alarm off!
I got work to do.
Motts.
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.
I'll show you the way.
We got some important people waiting for us.
"- Are you okay, sir?"
- I'm all right.
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.
"- Your daughter, where's your daughter?"
- I couldn't find her.
I hope she got out.
Do you know these men?
"That old son of a bitch, his name is Martin Walker."
He's the head of my Secret Service.
You should have a conversation about how serious you take your protection.
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?
I think it has something to do with his son Kevin.
- Why?
What happened?
- He was a Marine.
He got killed last year in this covert action that I ordered.
Would he do this for a personal vendetta?
He said he wanted you alive.
There's gotta be a bigger play.
We gotta get out of this elevator shaft.
Maybe you got a point there.
- You bet I do.
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll be your personal secretary.
You just talk.
Tell me what you want to say.
[Clears Throat]
My dearest...
precious flower.
Ah.
Thank you for your note of October 16.
It's always good to hear from you.
- And how are things in Toledo?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
This-This is not an application for a car loan.
It's a love letter.
Let your heart do the talking.
"Laverne... this is gonna knock you off your pins, but I still love you."
Ah.
All right.
"When I give my heart away, it's for good."
- Good.
- I even loved you when you were married to me... and you cheated on me with Morty.
"After all, you're only human."
I was thousands of miles away... and there was Morty with his thriving sausage business to bring home the bacon.
"- Boy, that must have hurt."
- You bet your life it did.
"- I have feelings, you know."
- Don't tell me.
Tell Laverne.
"Laverne, I have feelings, you know."
I don't need you and Gus to use my heartstrings for a taffy pull.
"You have a religion, you?"
Noo!
"Remember, it's for you."
At least you do not kill.
My woman ...
"My cross, my skin."
Want something else?
Disappear before you do a gift pack of all!
- I will go to seek it!
"- Not tired, she's already here!"
All done.

"From him, from me."
"Impediscimi to empty, to sink."

Nooo!

Life is beautiful ...
Can you hear me?
Smell.
They wet the road for fuck sull'asfalto.
"Yes, I love you."
We have it all.
"Weaknesses, ideas, history ..."
This is what forces us to remain seated here waiting for the Cossacks!
"The weight of money, the ghosts of culture ..."
The final solution.
The Cossacks!
"If we do not, we could also go wrong, what do you think?"
"In any event, the battle sex we won."
"The final solution, Anticaglia small middle class."
"For us we just want the media, the powers of the people living, working."
He's my husband.
You said it was over
"Yeah, it was."
Was?
Past tense... wow...
Oh my God!
Who cheats on their lover with their husband?
I have to go to work.
That's all you've got to say?
- Do you want me to lose my job?
"- No, I don't want you to lose your job."
I just want you to tell me the last few months have meant something to you.
"You said it was over between you two, Laura, finished."
You told me you wanted something different.
"Nice ass, Britny."
Britnay!
"""Nice ass, Britnay!"""
Brit!
"Psychopath then, is it?"
"Being bludgeoned to death with hammer, I think we can rule out manslaughter."
"Shame, really."
She's quite hot.
"Yeah, that makes it so much worse!"
"Forensics report, from Ken."
With the DNA results from the plaster found at the scene.
The ones I asked for half an hour ago.
"Erm, we were training, Danny."
That shit is sacrosanct.
"Yeah well, as long as your abs are ripped."
"Don't wish for it, my friend."
Work for it.
"Hello, Birthday boy!"
I have this incredible house because it makes a statement about who I am.
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
What you are Vic?
You know it's time you stop jacking off and started making a serious commitment.
"Not to just carmine, but to this family."
"And the rust and most important step in doing that is to, stop thinking about what you need and start talking about what you want."
"Well, I want respect."
"Well, I want respect."
You want respect?
You take out tendo.
You put him out of business.
I don't care how you do it.
He'll have all the respect you need.
And then we'll talk about the house.

"Go and find him, tell him you've been a bloody idiot and you want to go out with him."
Shall I?
Yes!
Go on.
Hurry up.
"As for the DNA findings,"
Didn't you know this kid?
Weren't you there that day?
He was a brother of a friend of mine.
I don't intend to let that cloud my judgement.
I'm gonna deal with this case like I deal with any other: professionally.
"Alright, the murder weapon..."
Daddy!
I need to tell you something.
Right now ?
"No, mom, tomorrow night."
"Now, of course now."
And this is ?
"We were married for 23 years, Mark."
You both need to hear this.
"I told you, didn't I?"
I told you I knew he was alive.
It's a mistake...
It's a mistake.
"It's been checked, it's DNA."
It's a mistake !
Alan!
Accept it.
What accept that he's alive ?
Give myself that hope only to have it dragged away again?
- We are gonna get our boy back.
- I would give anything... anything to put my arms around my son again.
"But what is this, where does this leave us?"
Just like when he went:
with a million of questions and no bloody answers.
"Alan, Alan don't walk away."
- I can't do this again.
Ki-dong!
Ki-dong!
# You came to me in silence
# And made a hole in my heart
# I know now
# That love Is sweeter than blood
# We are so different
# But what links us # Is only love
# What we've never felt before
# Our sensuous love
# This strange but precious feeling
# If we could cherish it forever
# If we could freeze this moment
# How happy we would be
# How happy we would be
No matter how much I try nothing makes me happy lately.
Nothing is working out.
My kids only make things harder for me.
And that day is coming soon.
This looks very bad.
Want a head massage?
"If you put some toothpaste here and beat it with a brush, then hair will come out."
"It'll be 3,000 Won extra, so how about it?"
- Mr. Fox!
- Yeah.
Phone!
Hello?
"Miss Hwang left, saying she'll"
- What?
- throw herself into the river!
What?
"Hey, it's dangerous, don't do that!"
You are safe here.
This is the most important thing.
I'm frightened all the time.
And this is the prison where they killed my brother.
"Yes, but the assassination of your brother was premeditated."
And criminals do not have accomplices in every prison.
"Finally, you are being closely watched, by order of the judge."
You said it yourself:
Fantômas is capable of anything.
"Yes, but less here than elsewhere else."
"Forgive me, Elizabeth."
Forgive me.
You lied to the judge.
It's called contempt of court.
You should be here at my place.
But when you're a great journalist...
I did it because...
I want to know when they will release me.
As soon as you are out of danger.
Anyway...
I love you.
Love me?
"No, you think you do."
But you belong to Fantômas.
So leave me alone.
Happy hunting.
Ah!
At last.
"Excuse me, I went to see Elizabeth in jail."
How's your love?
Bad.
She can not forgive me for what I've done.
"All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
Road trip!
I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need... whoa!"
So many dogs!
I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
All right.
This is gonna hurt.
WELCOME TO THE LABOR MARKET
Any idea where they may have gone?
Did you argue about anything?
Notice anything missing?
"A bankbook, for their savings account."
And clothing.
Do you know why your daughters wanted to leave?
My daughters didn't want to go anywhere.
Did anyone want to hurt them?
"- Any money, anything valuable?"
- Do you know why you're here?
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.
You're here because her cousin served with Judge Andrade.
So skip the song and dance and just find them.
- Lunch.
- I'm coming.
I found it in the brazier.
Please don't tell my husband.
If he finds out he'll kill them.
They've already brought him enough shame.
- Were they with anyone?
- They were alone.
- Did you talk to them?
- They were far away.
- We were with them after that.
- Where?
"At the bumper cars for a while, then we went home."
- What time was it?
- Midnight.
- I know because we had to go.
- Where did you leave them?
"A glass of sherry wine, sir?"
No.
"No, thanks."
"Well, would you consider a letter from Monte Carlo, sir?"
- I'll take the sherry wine too.
"- Yes, sir."
"Miss Beatrix should be returning home soon now, shouldn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, Poole."
Hobson was telling me that they were expected.
"Bad news, sir?"
Miss Beatrix and her father are going to Aix-les-Bains.
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
"Sir Charles' health, no doubt?"
"Yes, yes."
"Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, it upsets me to see you like this."
It isn't right.
"All work, as the saying goes, sir."
"They say there's a very interesting musical show at the Vanity Fair, sir."
"Very comical, you know, sir."
"And very daring, if you follow my meaning, sir."
"Yeah, I follow your meaning, Poole."
"But I don't think it would be wise, even though it is comical."
"Quite so, sir."
"- I'll fetch you another glass, sir."
"- Oh, never mind, Poole."
"Thanks for the pay, sir."
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Here.
"What's the idea, governor?"
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
"- Just have fun, baby, that's all that counts."
"So, Mom, I was thinking about what you said last night."
About not giving up?
- Right.
- And I think I want the surgery.
Try to repair the nerve damage.
Ok.
Um...
The doctor said that it's a difficult and complex procedure.
"And if things don't go as hoped, your hand could actually get worse."
"Yeah, I mean, she said there's a chance of that."
"She also said that if the surgery did cause damage, that it could... it could actually be permanent."
You've got almost 95 percent function now.
That's better than the doctors even hoped.
"But if I'm gonna play piano, though, I need 100 percent."
So I'd like to give it a shot.
- So we agreed?
You're good?
- Yeah.
It's the right call.
- Ok.
- Ok.
- I'll let Brandon know.
- Ok.
"Oh, and tell him if he wants to come by, that, you know, I'm here."
- I will.
- Ok.
Gotta hit the shower.
- Let yourself out?
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot for letting me barge in like this.
Appreciate it.
"Hide yourselves, wait for my sign, then use your knives."
Right.
[Sanye] Hold it!
So you're Lun Sanye.
Uh sure.
"Truly, brother, I'm sorry I didn't meet you when you first arrived in this place."
Sorry. (Laughing)
"Yeah, but you sent your men to come and meet me, and I'm grateful."
"Ah, it was nothing."
Maybe there was a mistake there.
Wanna come to my house?
Please?
Please. (Chuckling)
"Sit down, sit down."
"Uh, what are you called?"
Jeng-Ko Cheng.
I'm a police officer from Shandong.
I'm here to arrest you.
You see?
For these 19 crimes.
"Ah, never mind."
I really shouldn't have made you come all this way to arrest me.
I'll go quickly with you.
Well then?
What do you say?
"Ah, you are a government officer, right?"
So what?
(laughing)
"When you get promoted to officer rank, or you've been arranged to become police commissioner, how much money do you think you'll make each month?"
"Working for government, money's not important."
"Ah, let's not talk so foolishly."
We can be good friends.
We dominated the department
Softball league every summer.
Great minds.

Everything.
"This is bullshit, Chief."
That's what the department's

"Bunch of micro-Managing,"
Bullshit bean counters.
Showing up out of the blue.
Pricks.
Call me when
The meal's on.
"All right, Chief."
Unbelievable.
This is what they're going to
Waste their time on.
That's my copy.

"Okay, for your information, Richard, I have had plenty of sex."
I don't tell you everything.
I've had it under my belt.
"Over my belt, around my belt."
"You know, I've pretty much worn out my belt."
Really?
So plenty of sex?
"Hey, when I gots to have it, I gots to have it."
"Look, it's not a competition."
You'll be ready when you're ready.
"Hey, I'm ready."
I'm ready right now.
Then I gots to go.
I didn't mean from you.
I got plenty guys coming here to get some sex...
"All right, what about the one with the mystic tan and the butterfly clip?"
"Yep, I think she's having sex, too."
Are you kidding me?
What about you?
Are you doing it?
"You know, maybe sex isn't your thing."
Maybe your thing is more having awkward conversations with your employees.
Sex used to be my thing.

I used to be turned on by the touch of a man.
"So remember, if your attacker comes at you, you gonna panic?"

"No, 'cause you've got your eyeball scoops, you got your kitten scratches... [grunting]"
And then you're gonna be clear to pummel the groin.
And... you're dead.

Wow.

I'll tell you what I'm inspired by...

And that's why I call it self-defense... all:

She's one.
"Her name is Charlotte, and she's a fierce warrior."
What's up with that voice you're using?
Is this your married partner?
"[military voice] Nope, I'm Emma, I'm the best friend."
I moved home to help her raise the baby...
When I kicked my cheating husband to the curb.

He's fled?
Yes.
General Gómez is leading the provisional government.

"She was done, right?"
I should probably get going.
"Um, didn't you just leave?"
"I wanted to talk to you, and, um..."
Kyle said that I should...

Okay.
"Um... your parents didn't press charges, and they could have."
They understand that what I did to you wasn't me.
And I'm really lucky that they do.
"Yeah, you are."
Kyle explained everything to you.
I didn't want to beat you up.
It was my programming.
Things... went wrong.
"So, what, you caused the most traumatic experience of my life, and now you're telling me that it's not your fault?"
I'm telling you I'm sorry.
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.
I'm here to help.
I'm trying.
"Then I guess I can try, too."
Okay.
Hey.

Do you think I'm crazy?
How do I know what you are and what you're not!
I don't want to know anything!
I always keep my eyes shut.
Because you're my brother.
You already allowed that to happen once with a minor..
If that gets out!
What gets out is up to you.
And I also know what else cannot get out...
Sometimes I ask myself why I don't tell Karl everything.
"There'll be a big washing-up, and then I'll be rid of the eternal fear."
"You won't do that, Anna."
You know very well what'll happen!

You have visitors!
Mrs John!

Did you tell him that I must go back before it comes?
"Yes, I told him that."
But I won't go back!

Are you going upstairs and tell her to cut that out?
"If I go up, I won't come down."
Let's just forget it.
Remember that night she poured boiling water through them cracks in the floor?
I gotta go home pretty soon.
"-Come on, what do you say?"
"-No, I'm out."
"Every time you win a big pot, you're out like stout."
I got a sick mother and she don't go to sleep...

I'm gonna wash up.

Wait till I powder.

- so why didn't you sell it?
- 'cause.
- 'cause why?
"- 'cause i just didn't, okay?"
kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes.
- what'd you say?
i couldn't hear you.
"- i said it kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes -- big, fat, hairy deal."
- let's go.
"- oh, come on."
like i don't see this [chuckles] guy enough every day.
- all right. i got you.
"you're looking for something adventurous and sexy, right?"
"i got you this sporty model -- very popular, top-of-the-line."
- it is a beautiful machine.
"- oh, yeah."
- but i'm looking for something a little more family-oriented.
- oh!
got you!
"little lady prego, huh?"
huh?
"- uh, no. no."
- [chuckles]
"- but i have plenty of cash for a down payment, so..."
- ohh!
what an idiot!
who tells a car salesman they have a pocket full of cash?
"- but did you notice he was looking for something ""family-oriented""?"
- I don't know how.
"Ma'am, come to this window."
Do you know Peppe?
Are you crazy?
What did I do?
"Go home, if the director sees you..."
So peaceful.
They're all happy to have you here.
"And you, everything alright at work?"
I can't complain.
Can I tell you something?
Why get involved in...
You can ruin...
Are you married?
"Yes, we have a beautiful 8-year-oId son."
Yourwife didn't come.
"No, because..."
"We'd given up on children, an incredible joy, but since he was born silvia's become apprehensive, depressed, if I'd brought herhere..."
"Why, it's depressing here?"
She might get overit.
Of course.

An outsider coming to the South cries when he arrives and when he leaves.
"It's true, when I came here I was upset."

"I Iike the fog, the people, the chaos."

We have reason to believe that the explosive was a diversion.
Diversion from what?
An armed team has taken over the White House.
Do we have the president?
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.
Radio chatter indicated they were headed for the PEOC.
No contact.
We have to assume they've been compromised.
We gotta get you to a phone.
Call SEAL Team Six and they come in here and they'll shoot these assholes in the head.
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great.
Where's that at?
Of course it is.
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?
"Unless you got a better idea, yeah."
"No, I don't."
"By the way, John Cale."
- James Sawyer.
"-I'll get you out of here, sir."
Just follow me up.
"Yeah, I'm right behind you."
Make sure you have one handhold before you let go of the other one.
"- Whatever you do, I'll do."
I ain't doing that shit.
The scene here at the White House is getting more chaotic every second.
The wolf is by nature a pack animal and one of the few proud members of the animal kingdom that mates for life.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

Congratulations.
Thank you.
That's a big-ass bee.
"Finally, Ronnie and David."
I have thought long and hard about this.
I could not decide with my mind.
I had to open my soul to the animal spirits.
"And, finally..."
"Okay, the build-up's killing me."
What do we got here?
Two cheetahs?
Couple of eagles?
You got two lions?

Stubborn and immovable.

Be an ass for love.

I'm gonna be the biggest ass you've ever seen.
"Summer, how come we keep looking for Pancakes when there's a giant elephant in the room ?"
We walk around the elephant.
"It may be big, but we are crafty."
The boys should have been back over an hour ago.
Aren't you worried ?
"No, I'm not worried."
"I'm freaking terrified, okay ?"
That's why I'm focusing on just finding Pancakes and not about the fact that my boyfriend could be laying on the side of the road ravaged by zombies.
"Okay, well, let's go look for them."
In what ?
They took the only car.
Have you thought of that ?
"Well, let's listen to the radio and see if there's any news."
The radio stopped working with the aftershock.
What was that ?
Pancakes ?
Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.
Why would they need to break a window ?
I don't know.
What do we do ?
"Quick, hide !"
Shh !
"No, no, no."
"Summer, wait."
I've got a better idea.
"Summer, come here."
Shh !
You received a makeover under false pretenses.
You lied about having asthma.
Do you even like Bob Seger ?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.
"In the parking lot over there, I have to walk a bit."

"Oh, hi."
Noona.

Anything is fine with me.
"Honey, pick a variety of ten, I'll pay for it."
Why are you passing over the sausage?
Stop butting in!
Idiot...
I haven't gotten to ten yet.
And what if you never get to ten?
"It's in the order of arrival, pick them in the order they arrived in!"
Really!
Don't even dream of having a husband who you're with all day.
"They go on about how we're such a beautiful couple, my life sucks."
"Thanks, Unni."
I'll be going.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
You don't need to come out!
Why are you coming out?
"Just because, I wanted to get some fresh air."
"You said you were going to take a break, when did you get here?"
It's time you gave back to the community.
"If you want to help,"
You could contribute to ann's defense fund.
That's blackmail.
"Don't tell me the law,al."
Everything i said is legal.
"If you want to stay out of these cases,"
Quit screwing around.
He might have pardoned you... but your wife never will.
"Ron,tom, these are ann's parents."
Great.
"You haven't talked to the press,have you?"
"Ann,what have you gotten yourself into now?"
"I'm sorry,mom."
You should be.
This is why we didn't want you to go to college out here.
They remind me of my parents.

It's right near where you folks live.
We've just posted ann's bail.
"Listen, i'm sorry about all this,"
"But,uh,ann's gonna be okay."
She's not gonna be okay.
We read the papers.
"She killed a man with a knife,"
And she's not denying it.
They called her a whore.
I'm not a whore.
Then why's it say so in the papers?
Get them out of here.
I don't want them around for trial.
You know what I mean?
"You hear conversations like,"
"""Yo, man, I got HIV."""
"""Oh, that's cool."
"""As long as you ain't got that Ebola shit."
"""Come over here, drink from my cups."
"Come over here."""
"I'm gonna tell you, look,"
I don't even shake nobody's hands no more.
I'm telling you this.
I don't fist bump.
None of that shit.
I do this just right here.
"If you can't do this, then you can't get down with me."
"This is ""Elbow-la,"" nigga."
That's what this is.
Elbow-la.
I don't play.
I was in the Western Union the other day.
"You know, 'cause my family is awesome."
"And, um, there was a dude behind me, right?"
"Dude behind me, he was just hacking."
"""A-hock-a-da-hock-a-da- hock-a-da."""
"And even though I knew he was from the Middle East,"
"I was still a little bit scared, because the chick behind him was just sneezing, achoo!"
"I was in that bitch looking like ISIS, just..."
I looked like ISIS.
"""I See Infected Sons of bitches."""
That's what it is.
"But damn, this shit's crazy, man."
We gotta do something.
It's crazy.
"Oh, did you see?"
"Oh, there's a little lizard."
Quite a big lizard.
What kind?
That was a water monitor.
"Water monitor, that sounds like a job at school."
"It does, actually."
"Today, you'll be water monitor."
That was quite big.It's a slightly weaker version of a milk monitor.
"Oh, careful, careful.Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my..."
That's a sea snake?
"Look at that, that's a good size one, isn't it?"
Yep.You're not going to handle it?
"Oh, my God, you are."
Careful.
"Oh, my goodness!"
You are very brave!
Mark told me this is possibly the second most venomous snake in the world.Yep.
"God, look at that."
Gorgeous markings.
I was just going to say.
"Because it's also called the banded sea krait, you can see why - all those dark bands across the body."
"What's amazing about it is that it spends most of its time out at sea, out in the ocean."
It can dive and hold its breath for up to 2 hours.
Yes.Good Lord.They'll come on land for mating also.
And lays the eggs.
"Is this a female, this one?"
Yeah.
Normally the female is bigger than the male.Right.
"OK, so I'm going to release it."
We should release it.
Wow.
"That's great, Warren."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"You slept with him, didn't you?"
"- Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"- Yes, you did."
"I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour."
"So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?"
"And I say to him,"
"""Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need at least 14 capacitance probes"
"""to get the kind of results that you're looking for,"" okay?"
"So then he says to me, ""Miles, don't you think that's a little excessive?"""
"And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up in front of the entire class and I say,"
"""You can never have enough capacitance probes."""
"Oh, my God."
What the hell is wrong with you?
"Oh, nothing."
I hope nothing.
"You just got promoted, man."
You should be happy.
"I just gotta write this essay for the Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing."
"And the reason that I have nothing is 'cause, well, I've done nothing."
"- Oh, give me a break, Ben."
- What?
You have everything.
"You blow me out of the water, and I'm a cerebral stud."
Is that nothing?
"Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle."
Hey.
"It dazzles me, mister."
"I'm a little stressed, OK?"
"Well, I'm just the guy to relieve that stress."
- How's that?
- It helps.
Mm-hmm.
- Ow!
"- Was that a good ""ow""?"
"No, it wasn't you."
It was this.
Whose earring is this?
"- Well, it's not yours?"
- No.
"Well, I-I-I have no idea."
"Honestly, I don't know who-whose earring that is."
"Alan, sweetheart, I'm not accusing you."
- Why not?
- I know you're not having an affair.
"Oh, you think I'm safe?"
You think other women aren't attracted to me?
- I haven't said anything.
"- And, boy, are you oh so wrong."
"Just today at the store, this slim little blonde with a low-cut dress, she came up to me and asked me if the bread was fresh."
"Alan, sweetheart, I know there are still many women that still are attracted to you."
- You don't sound very threatened.
- I'm threatened.
I know I could lose you at any moment.
- (blows)
"- Oh, stop that."
We just found an earring in our bed.
"I know... a cheap, tacky one, the kind of thing a teenager would... wear."
- Eric!
- What about Eric?
That's what always happens.
"He sees something, then the killer has to silence him before he can say what he knows."
How is he?
His heart had stopped.
"It was touch and go for a while, but we managed to revive him."
They're just getting him to hospital.
And what was it?
"Veronal, I'd say."
"Some sort of sleeping draft, anyway, in his whisky."
Who found him?
His son.
All right.
"My father was late coming down to breakfast, so I went to call him."
"I found him lying on the bed fully dressed, and at first, I thought he must have had some sort of heart attack."
I don't know.
Did he often have whisky before bedtime?
I don't know.
This your dad's?
Yes.
He didn't smoke it much.
"And, um..."
And you say you...
Haven't...
Touched anything?
No.
I thought he was dead.
I called the police.
"Well, for..."
"Someone whose mother's been murdered and father's been poisoned, you seem remarkably unaffected."
"What would you like me to do, cry?"
I never liked my parents.
My mother was cruel and stupid.
My baby has no shot at a normal life.

"Sometimes ""I love you"" is just a trick to get your dress off!"
"[ Sighs ] Laurie, you know,"
I thought I'd be the only one getting dressed up.
"But then there you walk in, looking amazing."
"A little slutty, but mostly amazing."
"You, too."
"When I walked in and I saw you in this dress,"
"I was like, ""Ah!"
"Soul mates!"""
"You know, since the day we met,"
I spent most of my craziest times with you.
Oh!

- Or when we went bar hopping and we stole that scary cop's gun?
The Nazis have seized the Ministry.

"I have to admit, you've got balls, drawing at a time like this."
"-If I don't draw, I'll shit myself right now."
"Ah, no, then you'd better keep drawing."

The museums won't be the same.

I owe you one.
Where is Espínola?
What are we going to do now?
Go to plan B.
"But, has anyone calculated how history could change... if we kill Hitler?"
Yes.
But knowing what he did it might make it better.
Are you sure about doing this?
Yes.

Yes.
Why?
Bob went to medical school for two years.
So?
So...
"So if a woman had her arm cut off, he'd know how to keep her alive."
"Oh, God, no."
No.
I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.
What'd we get back on the river basins and the state parks check?
Nothing.
We're still waiting for regional and county.
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.
"Bob's cold, manipulative."
Always been with women he could control.
Marcy accepts this 'cause she knows no better.
She's been force-fed his opinions to the point she's incapable of having her own.
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.
"Believe me, if you'd grown up in my family for 20 years... you'd recognize it right away too."
"I'm gonna, uh, go it on my own on this."
Marcy only knows how to take orders from men like Bob.
I-I can handle this.
Bob is innocent.
I understand.
You're afraid of him.
–I'm not afraid of him.
–It's okay.
"I can protect you, but only if you tell me what he's doing."
–He's not doing anything.
"–Don't lie to me, Marcy!"

"Uh, what-"
- Wait a minute.
Where are you taking them?
"Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?"
I'm putting them on a bus.
Why?
What bus?
One that takes them back to Honduras.
"Hey, wait a second."
Wait a minute.
Th-Th-This was my idea.
Don't punish them.
"You tell Gus to blame me, not them."
He does.
"Give us a minute, will you?"
We won't be too long.
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple of local nobodies.
"Very disciplined, though, not keeping anything for themselves."
"It was all about sending a message, which they did, literally."
It was written on the bucket lid.
"""Ready to talk?"""
"That, I believe, is the English translation."
"I know you're not really asking for advice, but let me hire 10, 15 more good operators, and we hit them back, hit them hard, hit them where they live."
No.
This war stays cold for now.
What about their message?
What's the answer?
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.
Does father have piles?
Actually my dad and I are thinking to come your home and discuss about marriage.
Marriage?
Who is this girl?
You wait mom.
I too have the same doubt.
Who are you?
Who am I?
- I will tell.
Friend of the Police officer who looks same as you or his girlfriend.
"Sorry, even I was confused before and now you are confused."
"He is not your guy, but our guy."
I don't believe this.
Your guy talks fluent in Hindi and my fellow murders it.
If required test him.
I am unable to understand what is happening here.
Is this true?
"Dad, what is she saying?"
- Hindi..
This is so strange.
"I just watched dual roles only in films, but never thought I would experience it."
"If you don't mind, I will take a photo and send it to my boyfriend."
Sure..
- He will be really shocked.
"Sorry uncle, sorry aunty I need to search where he is."
Bye..
Let us see the saris there.
Come on.
Tell the truth.
Is there another one just like you?
"Yes, he is there."
Here.
What did you bring in?
- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
"- Oh, Christ."
You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock.
"Walt, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a goddamn desert full of junkies out there.
- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.
This could be it.
This little candy store guy...
He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known narcotics connections.
They were all over him.
"And then, on our own, after working a whole day and night... we tail him to Brooklyn, and we sat on him for practically a week."
"Now, who do we come up with?"
"Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake."
"Now, you gotta let us have it."
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What'll it take?
- A wire.
- No.
Two wires.
- Two wires.
"One on the store, one on the house."
"You know I have to get a court order for a wiretap, don't you?"
But you'll try.
"We know you can do it, Walt."
[Chuckles]
Popeye.
You still pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie?

[Man Speaking French]
Listen to this.
She was a prodigy.
Had a breakdown at 16 and was institutionalized.
Took a while to get these records.
Emile Sayles was her teacher.
"Duval, listen..."
"Oh, it gets better."
Both their names are on the condolence books of the other victims.
And you were right about the admissions director.
He did have a secret.
Liz Kenyon was sleeping with him to get access to the applications.
He was afraid of getting fired.
That's what you saw.
Duval...
I have the warrant to Kenyon's home and office.
We're mounting up now.
This was good work.
She's been killing these kids.
We're gonna stop her.
"Skip past the part where even though I asked you to wait, you broke into her office."
Then what?
She was on the floor when I got here.
She was gone when I got back.
When you got back from where?
I went after Emile.
You saw him?
No.
No.
"Emile Sayles, her piano tutor, has been dead since 1997."
There is no Emile.
She signed both names in those condolence books because Emile is only in her head.
It's just her.
"Sifu, please be seated."
- Show me.
Where is the discomfort?
- My whole body is uncomfortable.
"Allow me, Wong Fei-hung, to help you."
"Wong Fei-hung, I can't take pain!"
I've already beaten up a few bonesetters!
"Your blood flow is blocked, and your pulse is weak."
"Sifu Wong, is there a cure?"
Sifu Wong has a cure for everything.
Everything flows smoothly now.
"Sifu Wong, you're incredible."
Anything wrong?
"My friend, you've not only dislocated your shoulder, you have internal injuries as well."
Are you pulling my leg?
Feel your ribcage.
Do you feel any pain on the sixth rib?
- No.
- No?
It could be further down.
I felt the pain.
That's not all.
You have problems breathing as well.
You're right.
You've been training too hard.
These injuries are inevitable.
Irregularities in breathing can be cured by Yin-Yang flame-cupping.
"After I unblock the flow of ch'i, you'll feel better."
Does it hurt?
"No, it doesn't."
Yin flame.
The suction's very strong.
One of many.
"Marjorie, please."
What?
She's here.
That's a good thing.
"It is, but I think I have the right to know why she's here and if she's going to stay this time."
Just drop--
"Uh, could you, um, set the dining room table for us, please?"
I cannot believe you!
"Shh, I know."
Shh...
I thought we agreed we'd be a united front.
Yeah.
"Listen, I spent the day with her today."
And I really believe that we all have an opportunity here.
"And, Marjorie, I don't want to drive her away again."
"We have been down this road before and every time-- every time, we fail."
"Yeah, all of us."
But let's-- can we just have some dinner?
As a family?
"Pasta's not overcooked, I hope?"
It's really good.
"So, have you, um... have thought about your plans now that you're home?"
No.
"Well, I'm here,"
If you want help with your resume or if you decide you want to apply to university again.
"Well, I just got back an hour ago."
Of course.
"Um, we can think ahead."
"She is, actually."
Sarah tells me that she wants to pursue art.
"Yeah, maybe even, um, art school."
We have a match and a name - Denny Lorton.
Calls himself Pica.
He has form.
Sexual assault 30 years ago.
"God, this being a detective is easy."
The dead boy is Benjamin Rigby.
15 years old.
He's been selling himself for 18 months or so.
Had he been reported missing?
Mum's a junkie.
That lane was his beat.
Is this Lorton?
Reckon they can make this room any uglier?
Probably not.
It's like they think no-one actually has to work in here.
Why do we settle for ugly like it doesn't matter?
"A bit of colour there, painting there."
Some flowers.
I'm wasted in this profession.
"Pick this creep up, will ya?"
Tommy. (Whistles)
Hmm...
Hmm...
"Strictly cash these days, Manos."
Since when?
Since I woke up in a strange hotel room with third degree burns on my arse and no idea how they got there.
"I owe you big-time, mate."
"If you change your mind, give us a tinkle."
(Phone rings)
Red.
Good morning's work.
You humiliate a young cop and keep that clump of sink hair out of prison.
Not flat.
Villa.
"Yes, it's sea-facing"
How big is it?
Nothing too large.
Some are hard put to make out what's larger...?
"Our home, or our hearts?"
"One day, I found her"
"""She looked at me and she blossomed like a flower"""
"""In my wondrous seasons, it was an exotic thing to happen..."""
"""a mild drizzle under a mellow sun"""
"""Then I hid under a church awning and she stood under a tree..."""
when lightning struck...
"""she ran to me, in fear of thunder"""
"And then, we were in love"
That's our love-story
That's our life-story
Landed the job!
My project is through
I'm elated
You'll see Jai here.
Look into the camera when you speak
Hi Om
Jai... how are you?
"I'm fine, how are you?"
"- Okay, I'm okay"
What about your results?
- They're out
Hi sister-in-law
How have you been?
Fine.
Tell us About your results
- How do you know?
I used to be a homicide detective.
- Round up the usual suspects.
- Keep laughing.
It's a sin what he turned into.
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
We've got a dead nurse.
You stay right here.
Don't move.
"Absolutely, Dad."
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
Prick!
"Paula Puglusi, a nurse."
Same M.O. as the Putnam woman.
Guess who she used to fuck.
You knew her?
- Yeah.
"- God, Tom, I'm sorry."
Does that guy you were chasing have something to do with this?
- He was a witness.
- In the Polish Hill case?
I was one of the investigating officers.
Five women were strangled.
During the pursuit of the suspect my father was killed.
- Chicanis said he saw the killer.
- And you don't believe him?
This was the case where you lost your shield.
I lost my shield because I said a cop killed my father.
You want to give her one more pop before they take her away?
- I'll give you one more pop.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Talk to the press for Uncle Nick.
Why are you making us struggle?
You should have said it from the beginning.
This is great.
What are we going to do about Turan and his gang?
They've been... watching us closely for a very long time.
Who?
These guys?
Excuse me!
What are you looking at?
Give me that ball.
"Come on, get out of here!"
"Yes, is there anything else?"
"Then we are all in, aren't we?"
"Why are you asking me, dude?"
I am already in.
You were the ones who were waiting for Mert.
Her you go.
He's here now.
You've been on my case since I came.
"You're angry, so I am not saying anything."
- Who are you to say anything anyway?
"- Gamze, it's enough."
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school."
Okay?
You won't understand this.
"So, don't drag it out."
Let's get down to business if the old issues are over.
"Kaan, you are the only one who could plan this whole thing."
"Dude, I've never done anything shameful in my whole life."
Alright?
"But my family is calling me a ""shameless man."""
"Okay, I was really angry the other day."
- All for you.
A $25 savings bond.
That's a long-term investment.
"Don't touch it for 30 years, you're looking at $45."
- A youth hostel card.
- For the young girl... who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with strangers.
'What Color Is Your Parachute?

An application to join the armed forces.
"If your dreams don't pan out, it's a viable option."
And something in a nice little velvet box.
A necklace.
The pearl almost looks real.
"It better look very real, because it is."

- This is not a funny gift.
"Christopher, this is extremely not funny."
This is totally humorless.
It's beautiful.
"I think you're awesome, Lor."
"With everything you do, and raising Rory the way you did... you're superwoman."
Have a great day.
Wish I could be there.
Take lots of pictures for me.
The camera.
I forgot the camera.
I am always scared that it might be too late.
I know that the path that I have chosen is wrong.
But when there is only one path left to be chosen the right and the wrong doesn't have any meaning.
The path that I chose following Avi's hunger and your tears that path took me to diverse destinations.
"Mother, I was a kid then."
I didn't know how difficult it would be to return from this path.
"Still, I didn't let my criminal activities affect Avi."
"Come back, Baba."
You have compensated more than you had to.
Return home now.
Take my oath.
"Take my oath, or I will slap you."
"Mother, shall I take your oath, your slaps, or food cooked by you?"
Eat the food first.
Come on.
- Mr. Kadar!
- Who is it?
- Where are you?
- l am here!
- Please come out.
- Just a minute.
"- Please let me see you, Government."
- Here is the government.
- Where are you?
- Here I am.
- What are you doing?
- l am counting the change.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
- How are you?
- l am fine.
- What brings you here?
"She ran away from the home and me, you know?"
But I didn't give up!
I have brought her back!
"And that, too, after she has a child!"
I see... but how did you accomplish all this?
One has to apply his mind for the children's welfare.
One cannot live on love alone.
One needs money.
One needs comforts...
"And luxuries, too."
What happened?
My heart...
Janki!
Janki!
I want a truck-load of flowers.
Have the house washed...
Have the boss's white attire ironed.
And I want 200 kgs of ice...
That's a must!
We'll lay the boss's body on that... or his body will stink till his brother arrives from Nepal.
He must be given a National Hero's farewell!
He is leaving us so much!
I'll ask his daughter and let you know more.
Hang on.
What happened?
Everything is fine.
Call off everything!
Bless aunt!
The worst could have happened if she had not rushed you here on time.
She carried you all the way as if you were a child!
"You ought to take part in the Olympics, aunt!"
India would be assured of at least one gold medal.
"But, Mr. Connors, there has to be a reason you thought initially that it was sabo..."
I said I wasn't thinking.
Okay?
My son just died.
PRIDE:
"Mr. Connors,"
"I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, but our job is to find out what happened to your son."
"You know that, right?"
Sure.
Of course.
Do you know of any reason why somebody might have wanted to hurt Jared?
I-I don't know.
"What about you, Ms. Wells?"
Did you see anything suspicious?
(sighs) No.
(clears throat)
"We were just chasing each other around the track, you know, messing around."
Jared was showing me how to race.
So it was your first time.
I've been in racecars before.
I'm the advance coordinator for Warbury Racing.
We're in town this week for the race.
You two work for the same team?
"Yeah, about a year now, yeah."
That's how I met Jared.
We've been dating ever since.
Was he a good driver?
He was great.
RUSS:
"Well, he's been racing his whole life."
All the way back to go-carts.
He was gonna turn pro after his discharge.
- Somebody die?
"- Oh, hey."
What's up?
What took you so long?
"Oh, I had to catch a cab from my parking space, and I stopped by to pick up the tickets for the game tomorrow night."
Here you go.
Tenth row.
Great view of the cheerleaders.
"Oh, that's right."
The game's tomorrow.
"- Oh, you forgot."
"- No, no, no, I didn't forget, man."
I'm psyched.
I'm not gonna miss it.
- What's up with all the files?
"- Uh, ""vision state"" stuff."
Marketing ideas.
Info about the webcast we're doing on Tuesday and the Leviathan contracts.
"- Adam's here, right?"
- Yep.
I'm gonna give it to him today.
"You know, Leviathan's in a hurry to get it, and he did offer."
That was before you crashed the wedding.
"- I'm never gonna live that down, am I?"
"- No, pal."
It's only been 2 weeks.
"I don't know what the statute of limitations is on something like that, but I'm thinking it's probably longer than 2 weeks."
"Look, we don't have a choice, Dave."
"The company's on life support, and we can't afford a new lawyer."
- You're right.
It's fine.
"- No, I'll take care of it."
Or not.
And you don't have the harder part.
I have the harder part.
He wants me to meet him at his house and lie to Mr. Boykewich.
"If we all get caught, what's Mr. Boykewich going to think of us after all he's done for us?"
He's going to think we're Ben's friends.
But we don't want Ben with Dylan.
We don't like Dylan.
She's okay.
"No, she's not."
She got him in trouble.
"First it was the pot, then it was the fire, what's next?"
Is she going to have him murder someone?
No.
I'm not going to do it.
I don't like her.
And I don't like him dating her.
"And for once, he should do what his father tells him and we should encourage him to do what his father tells him."
That's what a real friend would do.
That's not what a real friend would do.
A real friend would do anything a friend needs him or her to do.
I'm happy you said that.
Anything?
Yeah.
What if Ben asked you to have sex with him.
"Well, that's ridiculous."
Ben would never ask me to have sex with him.
Ben didn't...
"Ben didn't ask you to have sex with him, did he?"
Did he?
Did you?
When!
"It'sokay,yourbaby'sfine ."
Not...
Thebaby.
Okay.
HekilledSean.
"Honey,thepoliceknow."
Theydon't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Please... no...
"I'msosorry,Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Yourimmunitymakes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
Lydia!
Jackson will be there seeking his next target.
-My butt too!
What do we do?
!
-What's going on?
"-I don't know, I don't know!"
Oh please!
"Oh mother, father!"
Oh please...!
Oh Jesus!
"Oh yes, right there!"
"Oh please, please!"
Jesus!
To commit such dirty deeds in such a divine school like this...
"It's because of an allergy to mushrooms, if you take the medication and put on some ointment, you'll be better soon."
I should have checked the body sooner.
Is our school nurse's office a welfare office?
Or a hospital?
So unbelievable...
Is he an idiot or something...?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
The money that was in the house was spent paying for the taxi last night...
"But with my whole strange body thing, I couldn't go to the hospital."
I came because I was worried something may happen to precious Yoon Jae's body...
But...
Did you get into a lot of trouble?
-Are you okay now?
-Yeah.
This guy must be really healthy!
I mean the medicine worked like a charm on his body!
Make sure to eat something when you get home.
And take your medicine too.
Yes.
Only such a handsome man could have sent such marvelous flowers.
"Thank you, mademoiselle."
L- i wonder if you'd care to join me in a bottle of wine at the astor house?
Just we two alone?
Just we two alone.
But we'll have to hurry.
Fleurique is ready.
We go.
"Good night, my dear."
"Uh, we better go this way."
Come in.
Mademoiselle fleurique in?
She's gone to the astor house.
"Well, already."
Well- with that fool mr.
"Fisk, who sent her these."
What does that fool mr.
Fisk look like?
"Tall, dark, kind of handsome."
He's going to have a peck of trouble on his hands tonight.
Everybody that has any truck with her has got trouble.
"Look at this room, will you?"
She threw all these things at me.
"Peppery, ain't she?"
"Oh, she'd throw anything anywhere."
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't blow up at the astor house.
"If she treats you that way, why do you stick?"
It's a long walk back to illinois.
"Excuse me, please."
"Besides, if you want something real bad, you've got to take some hard knocks to get it."
You've learned a lot for a young lady.
"- And to be honest, I got scared, so..."
- Have you checked your desk?
He didn't give me anything.
I swear he just came here to talk.
This was my father's.
I've never seen it before.
- Why were you hiding it from me?
"- If I knew it was yours,"
- I wouldn't keep it from you.
- Why would he even give it to you?
Do you know what this key is for?
Lionel wasn't in his right mind when he was here.
I don't know why he left that.
You're fired.
Escort miss Sullivan from the building.
Aren't you gonna give me a second to clear out my private things?
Your personal items will be boxed up and sent to your home.
"Your name may be on the building, but that's my personal stuff."
I got rights!
"If anything is missing, I swear to god, you won't hear the end of it!"
I'll pack up miss Sullivan's belongings.
You go back to the mansion.
Get some sleep.
"We did it, Lex."
Lionel not suicide.
Have Pic.
Come to archive room.
Jimmy.
That's it.
I'm leaving.
"I want to start working on this picture, but we haven't heard from Chloe yet."
I really think that we should wait.
Who were they?
We couldn't find out...
Do you have any idea?
I do.
Some migrants probably just felt threatened.
It's not worth the worry.
Prince Daeso will be furious.
Keep quiet.
"Yes, sir."
"Since you killed Jumong, I'll give you the reward I promised."
One states your new title as a noble.
The other states your new estate.
"Come on, take it."
I'm honored.
Bubunno.
Yes?
I'll appoint you as Vice Commander.
Help Naro prepare for the war.
You're familiar with Jolbon... so organize the spies and think of ways to strike the enemy.
I will.
Eupru is a few hours away.
A man named Buwiyum is head of the pirates now.
But we don't know where he lives or what he looks like.
"Gosh, I'd rather look for a needle in a haystack."
"Commander, what should we do now?"
Do you know your way around Eupru?
"This is Sanchun, Magok and Geodu."
I'm sure the pirates trade their loot.
We should ask the merchants in the area.
I've done business in Sanchun and Magok before.
I'm sure they'll help us.
"I'll go to Magok with Oi, Mari and Hyupbo."
"Come on, wrap up your gear."
You're coming with me.
Hurry up.
Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
"For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son."
"You shall grovel, I say!"
Look here.
"I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen."
"Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride."
Take him away!
"In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants."
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
"What do you mean, elephants?"
This ain't elephants.
"This is Annie, my Annie."
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
"Good morning, gentlemen."
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
"Higginbotham, I could just fall on your neck."
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one.
"Hello, there!"
"Tommy, hello!"
How wonderful of you to meet us.
"I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me."
"- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney."
"Take care of yourself and whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Do me a favor, Dad?"
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask, but she might need it."
I'll keep an eye on her.
"Would all the draftees assemble over here, please."
"Come right in, folks."
"Now, as chairman of the draft board, let me say that all of us regret having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
Please try to come back safely to your homes.
"Now, we've prepared some gift packages."
"If you'll just step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
- Best of luck.
"- Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the goodbyes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
"- Culver, Jones... ."
- Harvey.
Keep going.
You boys are gonna love the Army.
- Elliot.
"- Elliot, right."
Hurry up in the back.
Plenty of seats.
Nothing in the world's gonna stop me from coming back.
"I love you, Selena."
"I love you, Ted."
And thanks for being the way you are for as long as I can remember.
So I'd like to propose a toast for Mom and Dad   the loveliest couple here tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Hi.
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Because I want to.
Weren't you ever taught not to abandon a lady with 7 old maids?
"Listen, I've got a plan."
If you wait a little and I wait a little   we could go into town after they dance.
You and me.
I know a place where they make fruit with drinks in them.
- You could come along.
- I don't think so.
"I'd like to be alone for a while, okay?"
- I mean it.
- Yes.
I won't tell anyone if you come along.
I won't tell Anna.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No.
- Are you angry?
- Are you stupid?
Go away!
"I don't know what the hell to think, Helene."
- About what?
- Too much fits together too well.
But then I think   you wouldn't have done that to me.
"I'd like to talk, but not right now."
I simply can't believe you've done this to me.
I haven't done anything.
What have I done?
You just need someone to distract her friend.
"Oh, thank you, that is really solid of you."
I didn't volunteer... oh!
She's hot!
I volunteer.
"So, how'd it go with Emma?"
Not great.
"She, uh, did not think it was a date."
"Neither did Kevin, the dude she ended up making out with."
"This whole ""taking action"" thing is a disaster."
Except for Kevin... it's working gangbusters for Kevin.
[groans]
"Amy's nice, but she's so boring"
I almost didn't have sex with her.
You and Amy had sex?
How did that happen?
"Well, that's a conversation you should probably have with a parent."
Hey!
Holy hell!
She's boring from inside the house!
Okay.
She's not the first woman to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex.
"Mason, you go distract her..."
"Dude, Amy works here, in payroll."
She works here now?
!
"Well, she's not the first woman to get a job to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex."
Did you guys even talk last night?
She's worked here for three years.
She started here three years ago just to stalk me?
!
Jack?
Tell your father that they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
"You know what to do, right?"
"Keep pressure on the wound, and there should be some morphine syrettes in the, uh, supplies I gave you."
"Yeah, we've got it."
"Listen, Jake."
People are gonna be looking to you now.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
"Okay, the guys will be back."
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
"My guess is, they're waiting for reinforcements, so you should have a little time to regroup out there."
"Just keep the radio close, and I'll update you."
Out.
Out.
"Um, please, I need a doctor, whoever's in charge."
Right over there.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Colonel Hoffman.
"You don't have to call me sir, not unless you plan to enlist."
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town of Jericho.
People are gonna get killed.
"They tried to kill me, but I got away."
You've got to help these people.
Where is this?
"Kansas, not far from the Colorado border."
I wish I could help.
My orders are to secure the roads in this area.
In front of rabid dogs ...
"Buon appetito, ladies!"
"Oh, ministers integrated!"
"Thanks, today there is no more."
For me it is not finished.
I have offered a theater for quarter of an hour and we are grateful.
"I quell'innocente for delirium, came down, wounded, from its hole in Hungary, has made cornificare all."
The dog is innocent.
"I contended that a bitch, I was deceived."
Want more?
- I want everything.
"- Where do you want and when you want, but immediately."
And he is present.
You embarrassed?
Perquisitelo.
The wax of the seventh seal drips on the fingers of the butcher ...
The lamb is ready ...
"Please, there, like whores."
- Are you afraid of me?
- No.
"Further, where it is more true, where he feels."
Front.
[The door behind you ...]
I ...
Let!
Coglione.
So the tape that kills?
Gone with the wind ... hole ... culo ...
"Not angry, I rivedrai more."
"I just wanted to understand, I forgive."
If Mickey is in agreement.
You hurt?
MAN:
"Well, where does the [inaudible]?"
"Yeah, you got to-- you can't do that, right?"
"Hey, you guys can't do this stuff"
"Until he's wrapped, right?"
I'm the director.
I'm the boss.
Don't wrap until you get the word directly from the top.
I'm sorry if you were misinformed.
It obviously was a boo boo.
"And again, I'm grateful."
"It's the best makeup we've ever had,"
The best Toxie we've ever had.
But there might be some major miscommunication.
"And if it happens, it'll be a four-hour wait."
"So please-- this didn't matter, this one."
"But please just check first, right?"
"Please, please, please."
"Tox-- uh, David, thank you very much."
It was a wonder day.
Are you satisfied?
Everything all right?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
But you're OK?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
We can't do any better.
We cannot do any better.
I can't make the movie any other way.
This is the best-- this may be harder than most of the days.
I don't know.
But the only good-- the only thing I can suggest
"Is when we're outdoors, we only have so much daylight."
"I found him rubbing his face along the carpet, and he seems to blink in strong light-- that sort of thing."
"It's just some minor irritation, I expect."
"Bring him in, and I'll give him a check."
Best to be on the safe side.
"Thank you, James."
I'll pop by in a few days.
- Good.
Just look at those legs go.
"Tea is ready, Mr. farnon!"
"Thank you, Mrs. hall!"
"Aha, the cup that cheers, but not inebriates, eh, Mrs. hall?"
That's what I like to think.
Nothing like a good strong brew to keep the seasonal maladies at bay.
Here you are.
"- Lovely, thank you very much."
"A cup for you, Mr. herriot?"
"- Yes, please."
"Well done, James."
Just in the Nick of time.
"While you've been swanning around on the moors-- excuse me, Mr. farnon."
"- Yes, Mrs. hall."
I thought I'd mention fence again.
"- Fence, Mrs. hall?"
"Yes, I do recall."
"Perhaps, you also recall"
I asked you to tell Mr. Tristan about that.
It's the sort of thing he looks after.
Mr. Tristan says fence is your responsibility.
Does he?
Would you be good enough to tell him-- you tell him.
"It's not my place, is it?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
Wednesdays?
Goni?
"Come take the stool, sweetie."
What does he need the stool for?
- Why are you taking the stool?
I understood the Russian.
"The stool is mine, I brought it and I'm taking it."
"Goni, we're leaving."
Aren't we waiting for Mommy?
She'll come in a minute.
Why are you taking the magazines?
"When you were a baby, we lived in a small apartment and there was no room for all my things, so I asked Grandma and Grandpa to keep them for me."
Why are you taking them now?
Because now there's room in our apartment.
And we don't need any favors.
"It's okay, sweetie."
Why did you have to do that?
- Because I wanted to.
You do it to spite my mother?
"Yes, I direct little operettas and do things to spite her."
Don't start with that.
"I will start with that, I've had it."
"Do whatever you want, but not in front of the child."
I have no problem with it being in front of the child.
Hi.
Where should I put it?
- Anywhere.
Thanks for bringing everything back.
You're paying.
"- Yes, I'm paying."
There's more.
How do you feel?
"Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible."
Where am I?
Where are you?
Shoot!
You're in Radiator Springs.
The cutest little town in Carburetor County.
"Oh, great."
Just great!
"Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town."
"You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town!"
"So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off, you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene..."
- Dad-gum!
"- How'd that be, Tuhmater?"
- Cool!
- Mater!
What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused?
To not to.
"Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court."
"Well, we'll talk later, Mater."
"""Later, Mater. "" That's funny!"
Ah!
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!
"Hey, you scratched my paint!"
"I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!"
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!
- Fascist!
- Commie!
"Officer, talk to me, babe."
How long is this gonna take?
"I gotta get to California, pronto."
Where's your lawyer?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"When you get to the strip club, instead of going inside, just bang your head against the wall outside, take the money out of your pocket, and light it on fire."
"You'll still wake up in the morning with a raging headache, your dick in your hand, and no money, but at least you won't be late for work."
See you.
We're going to be late for work tomorrow.
"Yeah, that's what I figured."
"- Bye, asshole."
"- See you, douchebag."
"King of the douchebags, ok."
My title deserves a little respect.
"Yeah, whatever."
You all set?
I ain't gonna go to scores.
You want me to stay?
"No, no, I'm good."
You sure?
You're gonna be by yourself in a room full of booze.
"Yeah, I'm good."
- You sure?
- I'm your sponsor.
"Come on, i know what I'm talking about."
"Yeah, but bottom line, tommy, we're both just a couple of drunks."
"Yeah, but I'm a higher ranking drunk than you, so if A.A.Was like an army, I'd be a 5-star general, and you're just a grunt."
Take it as an order.
I'm fine.
Get out of here.
"- Yes, sir."
- All right.Bye.
Rescue Me Season 5 Episode 08
I love you.
I always loved you.
- I...?
Something's always the problem with you.
"Today, I've missed... the train, thanks to you."
- To me...?
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
"So you go your way, I'll go mine"
Strange!
"We're fellow-travelers, on the same destination, same train"
Why split up?
"Besides, aman like me ought to stay with a girl like you"
Wrong!
A girl like me doesn't need a guy like you.
Stop pursuing me
I'll sew it up.
I have a thread and needle.
I'll buy you anew dress
What have you got yourself into?
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you
And I don't fancy touching you.
Thank your stars I came in the nick of time
"Else, you would've been in jail."
"I help her, and she says this"
"Hey, take her away"
What did you say?
I got carried away
"Never mind Senorita, never mind."
"In big places, such small things happen"
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain
-The moon is an artificial construct.
it is a base where Alpha Draconians and other races have been manipulating human perception by means of a projected signal.
"In your way of understanding, they've hacked into the human consciousness."
They programmed exactly what they want you to see.
-Corroborating the stories that NASA adopted photos of bases on the moon's dark side.
-The role of NASA in this deceit is greater than you imagine.
-Stop right there.
-You know it's coming.
You know we're gonna lose.
It's inevitable.
What do you think you're gonna do?
What do you think you can do?
I'm a human being just like you.
"-No, you're not."
-Are you there?
-Yes.
-He... took our baby.
-I know.
I'm so sorry.
-Where are you?
-I'm coming to you.
-Aren't you going home?
-No.
-But they'll...kill you.
Please... stay away.
-I can't.
"-If I don't hear from you again,"
I love you.
What will life be like there?
-Harmonious.
Tranquil.
Our planet is a single continent.
Sorry.
"Sorry, Artie."
"It's, uh--that is really cool."
"oh, thank you."
We try.
- You--you made this?
- In record time too.
With the help of-- things.
This is a copy of the finest samurai sword ever forged.
"The Honjo Msamune,"
Owned by the ruling family in Japan for centuries
Before it disappeared.
The real one unearthed a few weeks ago
At a dig site in Okinawa.
the real one.
Which does what?
Which will arrive in D.C. first thing in the morning
In order to be presented as a gift to the president.
But it's not going to happen because you two
Are going to intercept it at the Japanese embassy.
- that wasn't what I meant.
"- no, I know what you meant."
But you've got to pack.
and you got to catch a plane.
"And it really doesn't matter, does it,"
What the real sword does?
"Because, remember, ""snag it, bag it, and tag it?"""
"Well, get snagging, bagging, and tagging."
You're off to swap Masamune for an Artie Nielsen.
- Arigato.
- Bitte schön
- What is that?
She seduced me with Herman's picture.
Who are you talking about?
"About Christine, doctor."
Christine Halslag.
She's a witoh.
Everything checks.
She even has a numb spot on her back like the witohes in the middle ages.
It all connects.
Keep on talking... about witohes.
She killed them all!
Don't scoff at the poor girl's misfortunes. I've known her for years.
Those were tragic accidents.
Especially for her.
But these things happen!
Four accidents in a row is damn strange!
Use your head!
One plus one is still two!
Alright.
Then let me tell you how a physician sees you.
You turn a dead tourist into a giant with 30 grieving dwarfs.
You're a compulsive liar.
You lie the truth!
I heard you say so!
I diagnose an enlarged liver due to mild alcoholism and you're in shock.
Otherwise you're as healthy as a horse!
No!
She fucks you and finishes you off!
"Okay, I'll go along with you."
"He slept with her, you slept with her."
He is dead.
Why are you still alive?
- Because Mary helped me.
- That was funny.
Remember how much fun we had because we weren't outside for once?
And we were just all girls for once.
- It was the only day off that I had.
- I know.
That was great.
It was the only day I could kind of walk around.
- What'd you do that day?
- I slept late because I was on the weird night schedule.
So I slept basically half a day away.
And then got up and maybe got some food or something.
I think I hung out with my friends.
"If you really wanna know, she actually supported our music and our band when nobody else did, not that that's any of your business."
"- Okay, forget it."
I can't do this.
- Do what?
Just make a U-turn and take me back to Ludlow.
I'll find my own way.
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag at your party.
- You don't have to yell.
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.
- Just drop me off.
- I will.
"Oh, my God!"
Are you crazy?
"Mike, is this the night somebody confused you for...?"
- Denzel.
- Denzel Washington.
"- That's right, that's the night."
- What do you mean?
"They knew I was his girlfriend, and if I saw him, they wanted me to give him some money... a check for a couple of thousand they said he loaned them."
"Well, I returned it, naturally."
Naturally.
I'm scared of those guys.
"They want to hurt Roger, and I don't know why."
We gotta find him first.
So you made up... the whole story about the gold teeth... to find them while we were looking for Roger.
Do you have a photograph of him?
"Oh, in... in my bag."
You lied to me about that!
You said you didn't have one!
I know.
Hmm.
Fine figure of a man.
"Honolulu's a big place, Thomas."
I'll check it out and see what I can turn up.
"Come on, T.C. just one beer."
You're in training.
I'm not going to have my contestant... barfing his guts all over the race from guzzling beer.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Just because I thought it would help me forget how... sore my shoulder really is.
Aw.
"Well, Beauty Knows No Pain."
And I should know.
Cut that out!
"- You really believe everything she's telling you about Roger, huh?"
- Yeah.
Sure.
"Well, 65% I believe."
"Hey, what about that, uh, government guy in the sedan?"
But I did attack.
I was in a simulation controlled by Jeanine and the rest of the Dauntless that she recruited.
Tris found me.
"She managed to break me free from the simulation, and then together we..."
Together we fought our way out.
So you're saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?
Yes.
One last thing.
"If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless, why didn't you just leave?"
Why did you stay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY) I wanted 110 leave.
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.
And I couldn't leave her.
Thank you for your candor.
ALL:
Thank you for your candor.
JACK:
"Tobias Eaton, this trial is concluded."
And you are absolved of guilt in the attack on Abnegation.
"Miss Prior, if you would."
May the truth set you free.
"Tris Prior,"
Mr. Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim.
TRIS:
Yes.
JACK:
So you were never under the simulation yourself?
No.
How is that possible?
Because I'm Divergent.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
I see.
"I was watching him, disgraceful."
Fancy a man of that class daring to put his hand on a lady's knee!
"- Ah, well done, Barnes."
- Thank you.
"Thank you, Barnes."
I'll give you one.
I'll give you one.
'Twas a dirty night and a dirty trick
When a ship turned over in the Atlantic...
They'll be here all night at this rate.
(Chuckles) It's the toffs entertaining the workers.
What about us?
We're workers.
Pearls before swine.
They were guzzling that fine wine as if it were beer.
"It's a topsy-turvy world, James."
Have a glass of port.
(Laughter and applause)
"All right, I will."

He must have been a criminal mastermind.
He struck the one second she wasn't taking pictures of Joe.

"I had a chance to do something and be a hero to my mom, but I froze."

This is why the terrorists hate us.

You sent him out in this?
You don't send Jerry out in the rain.
"I've heard that, too."
Maybe I should get DCFS involved.
"Well, have you talked to the husband?"
Maybe he could convince her.
A voluntary admission would be better for everyone involved.
I'll try.
"Frank, where's Jerry?"

"- Oh, no, you didn't."
What is the big deal?
Big man does not do well in the wet weather.
What the hell does that mean?
Excuse me.
Could you help us find our dad?
Lawrence Digby.
He was hit by a car.
The doctors are still treating him.
They said he got hit while crossing the street.
"Yeah, this guy was talking on his cell phone, wasn't paying attention, went right through the crosswalk."
Come on.
I'll take you back to him.
"Sam, you can go home now."
I've got a float from ICU coming down.
I'm gonna stay and help with this guy's kids.
"You're welcome to do so, but if you do, you're off the clock."
Fine with me.
"Come on, you guys."
Can I take her home now?
We live together like this.
I see.
I don't see it that way.
You don't call people merely living together a family.
I don't want to talk anymore.
"Get out, Big Brother."
Sure thing.

"Listen, I really do have to say that I never, ever thought I would fit in anywhere in that school, and I'm just so happy to have met you."
Christine?
What are you doing here?
"I'm having coffee with my new friend, Marly."
What in the hell are you doing here?
This is my house.
And your friend is my housekeeper.
"You did great out there today, man."
Your swing is really coming along.
I didn't hit the ball once.
"No, but the ball didn't hit you either, so we're doing better than last time, huh?"
"- Let's get washed up for dinner, slugger."
"- Thanks, Dad."
- You did great.
"- Thanks, Uncle Matthew."
"- I'm serious, you did great."
- Thanks.
Really great.
"I'm proud of you, pal."
"God, why can't he be better at baseball?"
Or at least stop using the bat as a dance partner.
[DOOR OPENS]
[SIGHS]
Bad day?
I made a new friend.
"I finally met someone at this school that I connect with, and she's Marly's maid."
A maid?
"Oh, dear."
And she has the audacity to hobnob with a wealthy industrialist like you?
That was it.
"Alright, keep your eyes open."
"Because they're busting my balls about this bastard, alright?"
"Okay, everybody, let's eat."
I want my money.
I want my money.
He owes it.
"Otherwise, pitch baseball cards."
We gotta real problem.
You know that thing we took care of upstate?
-Paulie was just talking about that.
-We gotta get it outta there.
They just sold the property they want to make it into condominiums.
"-Jimmy, it's been six months."
"-I don't care how long it's been, we gotta get it outta there right away."
"Henry, hurry up."
My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.
"-Henry, here's an arm."
"-Very funny, guys."
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
"What do you like, the leg or the wing Henry?"
Or you still go for the old hearts and lungs?
"Oh, that's so bad."
What happened to the car?
"I hit a skunk Karen, all right?"
Go with your mother.
"It's disgusting, Henry."
I set up Janice in an apartment around the corner from the Suite.
That way I was able to stay over a couple nights a week.
My new antique lamp.
Karen was home with the kids.
Yeah.
Ella used to hate him.
I can remember she threw his latest novel clear across our bedroom.
She was so angry.
"But, uh, look at you."
You've turned her around.
How'd you manage to do that?
A silent auction.
For charity.
When are you supposed to see Toby?
"Tomorrow, while Jenna's at her music lesson."
- Take it.
- No.
"No, you take it."
The storm has passed.
What was going on with you two?
"Okay, so, you know how I went to that museum with Ezra?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, A tried to get Hanna to ruin it."
Ruin it how?
A gave me another ticket and made me give it to Aria's mom.
"God, Hanna, why didn't you tell us what was happening?"
"Well, I tried to stop it."
"I mean, her mom's car didn't just stall."
"Caleb fixed it to keep from getting there, and that's why I owe him."
He's the one who's been breaking into vending machines at school.
"I mean, he's practically living there."
In school?
"Oh, they found his stuff, so he's not sleeping there anymore."
He's sleeping in my basement.
Wait.
Rewind that a little for me.
"I love you, too."
Bye.
Oh...
I hate lying to my father.
But I am good at it.
"Well, this is a new Alex."
Bad Alex.
Lying-and-sneaking-behind-your-father's-back Alex.
I'm only sneaking around because there's nothing to tell him yet.
"Oh, right."
Nothing to tell.
"What was all that stuff in the hallway, then?"
You two were undressing each other with your eyes.
Were not.
"Come on, you did such a thorough job of it I could see you both naked."
"By the way, he has love handles."
Not from my angle.
"Look at me, I'm like a giddy schoolgirl."
And over what?
One kiss.
What's one kiss?
I'll tell you.
Paris.
I was an art student.
She was a sculptress.
"After one kiss, I was hopelessly in love."
"Oh, I didn't know you were so romantic."
"Yeah, well, the French bitch cured me of that pretty quickly."
She dumped me after the second date.
Maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself here.
"For all I know, he takes every girl he meets on a motorcycle ride."
"Before you stick your neck out any further, you might want to find out exactly where you stand with him."
He's really fun to be with.
"Maybe ""fun"" isn't the word."
He's interesting.
- How many men can you say that about?
- Not many.
Is a tie too personal a birthday gift?
Are you using it on something other than his neck?
Does he look good in vests?
Why do you want him to meet your mother?
"I kept saying I was a great cook, so I offered him a birthday dinner."
Now I need something nice.
"After meeting her, I won't see him again."
"- Hi, girls."
Rose!
"- Hi, Claire."
- I'm starving.
Can we eat?
"- I can't, I have a date with a post-grad."
Help her find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
Who?
We should get you some blush.
"- I'm hungry, Claire."
"- No, fruit."
Why are you so grumpy today?
"If he wasn't gorgeous, rich and straight, I wouldn't have bothered."
"I'm sick to death of the man I am bound to for eternity, that's all."
Why are you saying that?
"No matter where I go, what I do, there he is."
"In the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the phone, on my finger."
I was asleep the other night.
"When I wake up, he's staring at me."
- I think that's sweet.
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me,boss."
"Oh,the coffee."
Ran the military id our local leo's got off the body.
Lance corporalames finn.
Stationed at quantico.
Went ua when his unit was shipped to iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
"It won't be far,mcgee."
"Had e trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay,I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to skeh itself.
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney,Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes,doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene,or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh,you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Alough the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"- Oh,geez!"
- Hello.
Sorry.
Nicrophorus americanus.
"So known as ""the carrion beetle."
""" In here,you little mkey."
I thought you were self-obsessed and spoiled and your teeth were so white it made me angry.
"But then I got to know you, and now I can't imagine my life without you in it."
"Now, go out there and keep talking to her until you find some way to connect."
"I'm sorry, I just can't."
Do you want me to leave?
I can call my caseworker.
No.
I want you to stay very much.
I'm just so bad at this.
I think you're doing okay.
- Really?
- (grunts)
Did you hear what she said?
She thinks I'm doing okay.
I have never once heard that from my daughter.
Hang in there.
"Hey, Violet, it's your mother."
"Just checking in, haven't heard from you in awhile."
"I thought maybe you and Luke might want to come over for dinner on Sunday, unless you broke up with him, in which case, bring the new guy."
"Love you, bye."
Hey.
What's going on here?
Just chilling with my favorite tenant.
(chuckles)
Okay.
"Hi, Beverly."
Mouse.
"You're still gonna wax me, right?"
Yeah.
"So, Jill, how's it going with your foster kid?"
(grunts)
"I'm sorry, what?"
"But it seems like that arm have not recovered fully, right."
What about his arm?
Heard he's got an injury in his left arm.
"Don't talk about strange things, Atobe."
Just play with me seriously.
The four of us will practice with you.
That's called the Rondo to Destruction.
Remember it well.
That's high!
"Oi, why didn't he smash the last ball?"
It won't matter much just to win.
"Let him play with that arm, that's slowly breaking down."
"If you go on playing the way you do, your arm will be shattered."
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
- Hah!
- Game to Seigaku.
One game to love.
"Tezuka, you're really..."
What a fearless guy.
30
- All
It's already been an hour into the match.
"Tezuka, your arm would have already exceeded its limit."
Do you want to destroy your arm just to win this match?
Here comes the Rondo to Destruction.
Take this!
Again.

Yes!

"We must go now, my dear, pressing business engagement at the theater."
"Waiter, check if you please."
"Never mind, I paid."
"My dear duchess, why are you always paying the check?"
It's deuce and embarrassing.
Anybody think we were married.
"Oh, Commodore, what are you saying?"
"Oh, come, come, we must be dashing."
[engines revving]
Taxi.
[car honking]
"Drop you at the theater, Commodore?"
"No, my dear, just a bracer from here."
I shall call for you opening night and escort you to what no doubt will prove to be one of my greatest successes.
"Until then, au revoir, my dear."
"- Set right, cabbie."
"- Bye, goodbye, Commodore."
"- Ah, Chowsky."
"- Please, Mr. Commodore."
"Ah, what's the trouble, what's up?"
I'm going to drown myself in a sea of vodka.
"Pleasant death, any particular reason?"
Particular reason?
It is the end of Chowsky.
A smart looking guy is a big shot!
So what?
"Oh, good, you're here."
"I know things have been a little slow lately, but I have made a decision that is going to change our business in a profound way."
You're getting out of clocks and into something that makes sense.
SALEM:
I got it.
Designer cat food.
"No, and fat chance, Tubby."
I have something in the store room that is going to have a line of customers snaking around the block.
Ta-da!
"Well, I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say ""creepy."""
"Well, there'll certainly be a nice deduction come tax time."
"All right, I'll give you one more chance."
"Salem, what do you think?"
Let me be delicate.
Those clocks are awful.
Is that so?

"And he missed, and we'll be lucky to get her out alive."
Pull everybody back.

We can't afford to lose her.

Look up at the window.

"You don't have to be scared, Mum."
This is all going to be all right.
A lot of things are going to happen because of this.
That's all.
But it's going to be all right.
"You better hope you're right, or you're gonna have to start praying for a little intervention from your grandfather's side of the family."
You're not gonna get it any cleaner.
He's gonna kill her.
We've gotta take him out.
"I'm not gonna be a party to any more killing, Mary."
I'm done with that.
I know.
"But hey, this should turn up for one around."
I've invited Boss to our party.
It was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
"Is that Russ calling to wishes a happy vacation because if it's not, he's got a wrong number."
- Oh...
- Jerk...
I don't know.
I've to check with Violet.
- Vi?
- No fucking way.
- Violet says no.
"- Violet says ""Fuck no""."
I thought you said we'd had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you'd pull something like this!"
"Oop yea, no kidding she said you'd do that too."
Up the money and call it an easy gig.
"That's text book, Russ!"
"What you think we are, stupid?"
Yea!
Same to you!

"I love the OLD Rose, the one with no makeup, and baggy clothes, who loves the perfect bite."
"I love her, it's real."
It's not based on passion... although I feel that.
Or lust... although...
I feel THAT.
"Or... or even physical attraction, because she wasn't... although I..."
I thought she was quite beautiful.
"Her eyes, her mouth, the way she held herself, the way she made fun of herself."
"She eats carrots now, isn't that tragic?"
What am I going to do?
Do you know that in the last two years I've been with 11 different women?
"Most of them half my age, not one with a sense of humor I understood."
"Now, I don't date these girls because they're well read."
"I gave one a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"", she thought it was a diet book."
- Can I help you?
"- Yes, I want to see a Miss Morgan."
"It's kind of late to be visiting people, don't you think?"
"Please, just ring her apartment."
And you chose pizza?

"Well, Carson takes time."

"Whoa, whoa, what?"

Okay.
"Okay, I can see it."
"Now that Bill's out of the picture, I feel like you should go for it."
[laughs] He's not gonna do that.
"Excuse me, how do you know what I'm gonna do?"
"I don't--I just know what you're not gonna do, which is talk to her, or be a man."
"[laughs] What, you scared?"
"Yeah, I'm scared."
"No, none of you know what the fuck you're talking about, okay?"
Okay.

[clears throat] Wait.
Honolulu Lulu's Pool Hall.
Honolulu Lulu's!
I don't believe it.
Corner of Kaula and...
and Hannaliki.
I'll send one of the gardeners round with it.
"Oh, and, Magnum, don't forget to tell him which bus to take back."
I wouldn't want him to make the wrong transfer or whatever it is one does on a bus.
Nobody here ever saw Roger.
Let's hit the next one.
I've got my car coming.
We went all through that.
I got no time to wait around while you wait for a car coming from...
"Barbara, we can cover the pool halls faster from my car than we can in the back of a bus."
"Besides, how do you know Roger won't come through that door any second?"
"Look, I'll tell you what."
My car will be here within the hour.
I'll play you for that hour.
"If you win, I still owe you 23 hours of investigative time."
"If I win, 22."
"But either way, we'll have my car and we'll move faster."
What do you say?
You a hustler?
Do I look like a pool hustler?
No.
Rack 'em up.
"Uh, no."
"They're, uh..."
They're still in Lulu's.
No.
They haven't spotted us yet.
All right.
"- That's a hint, by the way."
"- Colonel, I didn't mean..."
Pierce!
I've had it up to here with your forever putting the knock on the army!
The military has produced some great men...
"George Washington, Andy Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt."
"And if Klinger wants to re-up, I'll be proud to swear him in."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, no."
- After he's had some time to cool off.
- Thank you.
"- Oh, no."
"- Son, this is too big to rush into."
Take some time.
Think it through and through.
- You understand?
"- Yes, sir."
The colonel is very wise.
"This is a major step, and I shouldn't take it in the heat of passion."
Smart lad.
I'll be in here when and if you're ready.
Now get going and start thinking.
- Colonel...
"- Pierce, you just get going."
"Now, look, I want you to go sort this out."
I'll keep doing your work so you can give it your full concentration.
"Thank you, sir."
I'm gonna sort real hard.
- [Potter] Come in.
"- Sir, I thought it out."
"Well, I must say you have a very nice leg up on your recovery."
"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you."
"CSU's working to break the encryption, but it's gonna take time."
"Jerry, that's time we don't have."
"Come on, I mean, this girl's life is at stake."
"Well, unless you know of some computer genius who can do the work of an entire crime lab in half the time, we're out of luck."
"Actually,"
I know just the guy.

"Hi, excuse me, um, is that you on the cover of that magazine?"
"Oh, boy, that's so embarrassing."
My publicist insisted that I do it.
My name's Adam.
My friends call me Toast.
Mia.
I should probably know who you are.
Not unless you're a gamer.
"Yeah, I created one of the fastest grossing mobile games of all time."
We hit ten million downloads in the first month.
"Oh, wow, that's incredible."
That's what Tim Cook said.
"But enough about me, what is it that you do?"
"Um, I'm a model."
I was just in Lanai doing a swimwear shoot.
Ah.
"Swimwear, very cool."
"Dunkirk, evacuation of troops, trapped by the German advance."
700 fishing boats and the world maybe on a mission to bring our boys home.
"Twin sisters, took their father's cockaboat, and, joined the rescue and came back with a deck of soldiers."
It's everything the Ministry are after.
Authenticity and optimism.
"Contradiction in terms if you ask me, but, this could be a bloody good story."
"Before they will give it a go ahead, they want someone to go down there and talk to the girls."
Me?
Unless your artist object.
"So, how did you meet?"
Came in to avail steelworks.
Ah!
He's one of those artists.
Older than you?
Yes.
Fifty?
No!
Sixty!
?
Oh!
That is tough.
You can't afford to be an artist.
Actually his family dis-inherited him.
Because of you?
Because of his politics.
So what do you think?
They there at the sea-side.
"And you never know, if there's a film at the end of it, it might be a better job in it for you."

Five possible sniping positions.
"Sousuke Sagara, correct?"
Correct.
There is a taxi waiting at the north exit of the park.
Get in it.
Who asked you to do this?
Does this have some connection to the incidents occurring here?
State your name.
What would you do if I told you?
Sousuke Sagara.
Go to the second floor of the building behind you.
He is waiting for you in the back room there.
"Who is ""he""?"
I suggest you try to remember what this place is called.
Kowloon?
Yo!
"What has it been, three months?"
"I'm so glad to see you, Kashim."
Ga-Gauron!
You seem so completely shocked.
Is it really that strange that I'm still alive?
Back then...
You should've...
"Died, is that it?"
"I sure hope you haven't forgotten, now."
"My Codarl was equipped with a Lambda Driver, you know."
It can even protect the operator when the unit self-destructs.
"Well, I still ended up like this anyway."
"Hey, now."
Just look at the kind of condition I'm in.
I think it's pointless to be hasty.
- Really?
"Hey, Rhino!"
Why did you use the room freshener?
"Boss, Sadhana is here."
"Taunting me, are you?"
You always over use the perfume!
That's Victoria Secret Line's Perfume.
"You bought it from the local store, right?"
Country attar packed in a fancy way.
This your Victoria Secret?
What about you?
You use the local ingredients and sell it as international cuisine.
Hey!
Don't make fun of my recipe.
I have won awards.
I was given the best...
Enter... something like that.
That's Entrepreneur.
- Exactly.
Forget it...
Let me come to the point.
You are one among the top 25 upcoming stars selected by a weekly magazine.
I wrote the article about you.
Let me read it out.
Chef Arun.
Age: 25
He lost his eyesight at the age of 15.
That didn't stop this self reliant man... from mastering the art of cooking.
Traditional Indian cuisines...
"To Italian, Mexican cuisines..."
"Chef, the food is superb."
- Thank you.
"- Wait a minute, you're seeing someone?"
- Who is this?
"Dad, this is the reporter from Manhattan Monthly."
"- Ike, this is my dad."
- Whatever.
"Honey, look, what I don't understand is what you see in this guy Scott."
You deserve somebody better than that.
"Someone like, like... like you."
Excuse me.
I really need to ask you a question.
"No, no."
No more questions.
I need to talk to my daughter.
- Are you eligible or not?
- Answer that question.
"Dad, I really want to talk to you about this, but not in front of him."
"Could you give us, like, five minutes?"
Molly has muffins.
And she's very eligible.
"Yeah, she told me."
"Look, last night you said that nothing would make you happier than if I found the right guy."
And you think Scott's the right guy?
No.
I don't know.
It was just one motorcycle ride.
That's it?
A motorcycle ride and a kiss.
And a kiss?
That's not what Johnson saw at the party.
"Yeah, believe it or not, he cracked."
"The point is, it's not serious."
"Like, Scott's going on a blind date tonight, with someone else."
He said he'd do it yesterday!
"Every hour he puts it off, there are more things that can go wrong!"
"Every hour he puts it off, there are more things that can go wrong!"

Oh.

"Well, it's cutting into good drinking time."
"Well, it's cutting into good drinking time."
Yeah.
Just...watch the legs.
Yeah.
Just...watch the legs.
"Oh, bugger it."
"I'll call the lady, tell her we'll deliver it tomorrow."
"Oh, bugger it."
"I'll call the lady, tell her we'll deliver it tomorrow."

"When it comes to beer, I am."
"When it comes to beer, I am."
I can't help.
You sent me to study law in Britain.
"Maybe, perhaps, I think I can give him a..."
little help.
I can hear fear from your voice.
I am no match for you.
"I think, I have to help you!"
Master...
It's meal time.
"Where can I get my food, mister?"
Are you new?
Right...
Time for Playing games.
Don't bully me!
My master is really something.
"About the case of Ho Foon, the British and Chinese governments have reached an agreement."
The case will be judged in the British court.
No appeal.
"And, Chan Mon-gut will be the defence counsel for Ho Foon."
I've been informed already.
"And, His Excellency Li Hung-chang said, if you can free Ho Foon from charges, you'll become a hero."
Money and fame will come sooner or later.
Congratulations.
"If I lose, I don't think I will have any lose."
It's an insult to the country.
"You will be punished, maybe capital punishment for your tribes."
You are throwing me to the sharks!
"Come on, don't get mad."
"The chairs are not enough for all of us, you know?"
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong?
Where did you cut it?
- Huh?
You about ready to take the wheel up here?
- Learn the how-tos of driving?
- Huh?
"I mean, you had your learner's permit about seven years, bud."
I'll just do that later.
"Hey, come on."
Changing subjects.
Who wants some waffles and ice cream?
"Oh, I know I do."
"But I'll take my ice cream first, because real men eat dessert first."
Dessert first!
All:
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Did you quit work?
Why would I quit?
You're not going to work?
I don't work on Sundays.
"It's Monday, not Sunday."
Do you have two Sundays on your calendar?
"Yesterday was the last day of your break, Sunday!"
What's wrong with you?
Is it a side effect from your painkillers?
Stop taking them.
Stop taking them and go to the hospital.
Isn't it Sunday?
You were complaining about how your break was ending.
You were so fixated on that that you didn't even know the day had passed.
"It's way past seven, you're already late."
"If it was me, I'd fire any employee who was late on the first day after their break."
They love playing  tricks on us.
Back to the dressing room.
Some people might look at it and say  this is not very professional with all the clown acting and jumping and fighting and all that kind of stuff but that's just part and parcel of what One Direction is.
I don't even have a Iicence!
"Sorry, I can't hear you!"
Put me down!
Guys!

Stop.
"-Sorry, mate!"
"-Hey, guys!"
Six minutes till the biggest show of the whole tour and here they are taking bloody golf buggies.

We want a sea of orange in the Ziggo arena tonight.
Amsterdam.
We're going orange.
Orange face paint.
Orange clothes.
Orange and only orange.
Let's do it.
So Harry are you going to wear orange then
"Can't tell you, it's a surprise."
've seen a few fans outside with orange on.
I don't know if there's gonna be loads but I'm hoping there will be.
"Good evening, Amsterdam!"
"Ready, steady clap."
Everybody clap your hands.
- Oh!
Um...
"Oh, I..."
"- Thruppence, please."
Please.
There.
"Well, as long as you receive an adequate coaching fee,"
I see no objection to your continuing to instruct him.
- Fee?
- Yes.
Certainly a fee.
I shall be raising the matter with Mr. Baker today.
Is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Your dressing room is adequate?
Uh...
"Oh, your intimate needs are being catered for?"
Mmm?
Sammy once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew.
Electricians in particular?
Yes.
"Well, one mustn't complain."
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work, uh, people..."
People seem to be responding rather well to Uncle Frank.
I look-
- I look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
It smelt of you for the longest time.
"And then one day, I went in there and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
"It's purple, bitch!"""
"Let me tell you, and they used to smoke all the time when I was in school, and I ain't never partake."
I was an outcast in school.
"A lot of folks are always like,"
"""Jay Pharoah, how you learn to come up with so many voices?"""
"I be like, ""Because I had no fucking friends."""
"I had to make people up."""
"That's why I get mad when people talk about bullying, like it's such a bad thing."
"You hear the, ""Stop the bullying!"""
Shut your dumb ass up!
"If I wouldn't have got bullied the way I got bullied,"
I wouldn't be on national television right now.
So all the time it's not a bad thing.
All right?
"Shoot, 'cause these little kids are punk asses nowadays."
They are punk asses.
"They be coming home bitching,"
"""Ehh!"
"He's bullying me."""
"""Well, bully him."""
"""Ehh!"
"He's talking about me."""
"""Talk about his ass."""
"""Ehh!"
"He hit me with a car."""
"""Then, bitch, shoot him."
How 'bout that?
"You know what I'm saying?"" Okay, all right."
I know.
I shouldn't talk about guns.
We've had terrible things happen.
"To the people in the Boston bombing, my heart goes out to them."
I came about Isabel.
- Is something the matter?
- Yes.
I fear she's being manipulated.
- Manipulated?
"- And the way they have her dressed, like she's some sort of common peasant..."
- Hmm.
"Roderick, I know what you're going through, with the loss of your parents, and now your sister, her illness."
And I understand that you've taken over your father's business entirely on your own.
Is that correct?
- I did not come here to discuss myself.
"- And I appreciate that, but you mustn't underestimate the toll the past few months have taken on your own psyche."
- I see.
"Thank you, Doctor."
"- Tell me, what is your name?"
- Isabel Porter.
- That's incorrect.
Where are you from?
- Worchester.
- Look at me.
That's incorrect again.
God!
Ah!
- Does that hurt?
Does that hurt?
"No, that does not hurt."
"When one is nothing, one feels nothing."
Okay?
Again.
I do this for your own benefit.
"Through me, you shall understand pain."
Now.
[Sobbing]
"I'm so sorry, Chip."
What you thinkin' about?
Oh.
"I was thinkin' when I was young,"
I couldn't wait to move out and start my own life.
I thought I'd be an actress or a successful business woman.
"And then I told myself when the boys got out of the house, and started their lives, that I'd do the same thing."
And then I thought Dale had it together.
But he didn't.
He's starting over.
"And, well, Chip. [Chuckles]"
"I help them, I wait for them, and for what?"
My life gets lost in the shuffle.
I don't think this time
I'm gonna be able to forgive them.
[Cell phone rings]
You don't have to answer.
"You're a good mom, Christine."
You're also a lot more.
Hello.

I'm sorry.
Me too.

I'm sorry.

Gaston has escaped the Bastille.
And the King and Aramis have not returned from the Mausoleum.
This is not a coincidence.

And I would apologise for the surroundings.
"But I imagine, as a soldier and a priest, you are well acquainted with death."
More than I'd have wished.
"Yes, I too am acquainted with death more than I'd have wished."
Death has a grip on me.
One I cannot break.
I am so sorry.
I don't want your sympathy.
That's not why you're here.
"But there is something I need from you, Aramis."
"Without it, I will not find peace."
"A truth I need to hear from your mouth, and don't lie."
You and my wife may think I'm a fool but I am not a fool.
I know.
Say it.
It will serve... no purpose.
You are a musketeer.
You only exist to serve my purpose.
I am ordering you!
Why dredge up the past?
Admit!
Admit you slept with the Queen!
I slept with the loneliest woman in Paris.
Don't you dare make excuses!
This woman suffered years of neglect and betrayal from your part.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day...
I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in.
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
You lose everything.
Everything...
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.
Can we talk?
- Okay.
"- ""Talk."""
In your truck.
Okay.
Now that was just right.

"Oh, take your drink, you Goldi-lush."
Tread Goldi-lightly.
"So, that's no toe-curlin' then?"
It's impolite to kiss and tell.
Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down.
Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades.
A little hizzin' in the skizzins.
"No, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little goin' to the bone yard, I know that."
Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'.
Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters.
A little building the blanket monster.
I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're ready, Mr. Fowler!"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Whoops!
We're hooked.
I'm terribly sorry to have this happen at such a tense moment.
"Mr. Fowler, we're ready!"
"I said, I'll be there."
"I'd better watch this, Lieutenant."
Do you mind?
SID:
"What's the story, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're running a little late, Sidney."
"Let's move it, huh?"
"Lieutenant, what about this robber?"
Do you have any leads?
"Well, sir..."
"The truth is, it seems to be a little bit more complicated than a robbery, sir."
Oh?
What the Lieutenant is saying is that he's come to the conclusion that Claire may have been murdered and the robbery may be a cover-up.
Murdered?
That's insane.
"Don't you think you should have come to me first with this, Lieutenant?"
"Well, I tried to, sir."
I've been looking for you ever since last night.
I was with my lawyer last night.
"We meet for chess once or twice a month, and last night turned out to be a marathon session."

You are dismissed.

"Ah, so that's him."
Could you please tell us what your first impressions were of your visit to us?
There he is!
"Really, you're right."
Sometimes even in your case it's possible to talk about intelligence.
Doctor.
-I didn't suspect that you know it.
-We scientists are one family.
Doctor Yansky is my best co-worker.
The pillar of our institution.
-Have you seen Mr. Cimrman here?
-He's at yours.
Master Miller!
I have read in Scientist your essay about the curvature of space.
Your hypothesis is absolutely crazy.
But these days crazy hypotheses have the right to be applied.
Congratulations.

I'm telling you here on this grain of space dust they tap excellent beer.
Come.
"I suppose, space is curved like this."
-I agree.
But...
Let's see what else you could have got.
"A sidecar - cognac, Cointreau lemon juice, sugar, syrup."
And you could also found Negroni.
Don't think I've ever heard of it.
"Gin, red vermouth, Campari, garnished with an orange peel?"
I bet you could do with one now?

"Would you like the A hive, or the B hive?"
I think go we'll choose the A hive.
You're choosing the A hive.
You are looking for...
"You have two minutes, reveal the hive."
So...
You've got...
Cowdrey's maybe somewhere?
"Yep, yep, yep."
"So, who've we got?"
Gower.
"Hang on, you've got Brearley."
Gower...
That's clashing with Brearley.
Put the other Y for Cowdrey.
"Oh, OK."
Put the other Y.
There we are.
And then put Brearley round it.
Right.
And then it keeps on splitting wider and wider
When it hits each successive bird 'cause it makes it easier for the birds to fly that way.
- Good.
So--so what... does the sword...do?
The blade in this particular sword
Is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path
And goes around the person holding it.
"Um, are we--are we talking about, um, invisibility?"
Mm.
Kind of.
In effect.
"No, the person's still there."
"Although, you know, the light that we see"
"Doesn't hit-- yes, invisibility."
Awesome.
I knew-
- I knew that was possible.
I knew it.
Okay.
Invisible swords now...
"Hey, Artie, these are-- these are the same sword, right?"
- Yeah.
- They don't match.
What?
"Well, you see, disc thing that's attached to the grip--"
"Well, it's in the painting, but it's not in the sword"
From the dig site.
It's missing its tsuba.
"This piece right here is called a ""tsuba."""
"It's actually a collectible in its own right,"
"You know, separate from the sword."
But this is missing its tsuba.

"You are Jocelyn, right?"
Alex?
We met at the Couture Birthday Fashion shoot.
"- Oh, yeah!"
How are you?
"- I can't believe these people, man!"
They are nuts!
"What's up with the tooled on that broad, you know?"
"We're doing fashion here, not high art."
I guess she just takes pride in her work.
I need you to fill the water bottles to spray on Resin.
- What?
"- Pierre insists... on the misty look, I need you to put this Evian into the bottles... and practice spraying, now."
"- Yeah, I'll help you."
- That's what he said.
- He said to paint the cow...
- You!
You are the sprinkler?
Fantastique!
A vision!
Gentle worrying eels just outside Dublin...
"Meteorology: 66 degrees, a crispy October haze on a gray day... the charcoal clouds, they come, yet, back home..."
I'm ready now!
"Okay, okay!"
Let's get this party started now!
I'm not painting that cow!
I don't care!
I told you on the phone I wanted an all-black cow... and you and your make-up people are gonna paint the goddamn cow... all black.
You have to do what I told you...
They're weirdly popular.
I can order you one.
"Yeah, yeah, why don't you do that?"
"That'd be great, because then they'll get here, in what?"
9 weeks?
"Which is just in time for my daughter's recital, which is tomorrow."
It's the minimum basic requirement that a party store always have Hawaii.
"Children have recitals and their parents, their mothers, can't do it all and we rely on our party store to keep up their end of the bargain so that our husbands and our children don't despise us when we come home empty-handed."
I'll buy the lei.
He's really wrecked.
Usually we like to let this kind dry out for the night in lock-up.
"It reinforces the point, you know?"
"Sure, sure,"
We have driven all the way from Los Angeles.
There's a motel nearby.
See you in the a.m.
Bring coffee.
"All right, thank you."
Thanks.
Hi.
"I'm Justin's mother and this is his big sister, Kitty."
"Kitty Walker, ""The Right Idea"" and ""Red, White and Blue."""
- You're kidding.
- No.
You're her?
"Yeah, I am...me."
Yes.
I love your show.
And we're not asking to be the exception here...
"Yes, we are."
"No, we're not."
- Yes.
O
What is going on?
What is going on?
Why are they all being so mean?
Being mean here and in the club is no fucking difference than all those fuckers out on the street.
Or anybody else in the goddamn world.
The only difference is out there they all pretend to be nice.
And in here we ain't pretending shit.
What do you mean nobody's pretending?
We're all dressed up like for a masquerade going on stage playing hoodlums.
famous bags.
The biggest eye bags around chicken with the eye bag.
It's just like a three penny
You're too old to model.
Don't make me hate you!
You're so ugly.
And you are so beautiful.
You're the most beautiful boy in the world.
You're the most beautiful boy.
What?
I don't care what you say.
I don't love you.
Margaret what's wrong with you?
Let me see your eyes.
God what eyes.
Chicken woman.
"C'mon, Jimmy!"
And your lips.
"You're so old and ugly, I can't look at you."
"Come on, she's beautiful."
"No, I know I'm ugly you should punish me I'm not good enough for you."
I'm just an old and ugly whore.
A bit.
Don't catch a cold.
"When you get home, have a glass of hot milk, with some honey."
I will.
I like rainy days since I've been here.
Have you seen the new lawyer?
Yes.
He was here.
He told me everything.
"I'm screwed, right?"
"To be honest, yes."
At least Alicia wasn't affected by the birth.
It's the only thing that consoles me and gives me hope.
Are you all right?
I'd like to be able to hug you.
But I'd have to ask for a visavis.
"I checked it out, y'know?"
They asked if you were my boyfriend.
"I didn't dare to say yes, in case it bothered you."
It doesn't bother me at all.
You can say what you want.
I've hugged very few people in my life.
A message...
"Marco, I wanted to tell you how glad I was to see you today and be able to say goodbye."
You know they won't let me out of here.
Or it'll only be to lock me up somewhere else.
"I don't want to live in a world without Alicia, a place where I can't even have her hairclip with me."
So I've decided to escape.
"ldidn't tell you, so you wouldn't worry or try to stop me."
"A big hug, Marco."
Taxi!
To Segovia.
Please.
Promise me you'll never see my daughter again.
A promise is only good if you shake on it.
Don't squeeze that hard.
Just promise you'll never see my daughter again.
I promise.
"I promise that every morning, the first thing I want to see is Marcia and the last thing I want to see at night... is Marcia."
I promise that I'll never let anyone get between us.
Let my hand go!
I promise to accept all we suffer together and truly enjoy all we live together.
Let go!
I promise to never think that I'm better than her nor that she is better than me.
"Marcia, tell this man to let my hand go."
I promise to use my own life to give Marcia a good life.
Don't squeeze it!
"And if I must,"
I promise to give my life to save hers.
Get out at once!
"Marcia, where do you think you're going?"
I won't let you date any...
low-class.
Date?
"We're getting married, mom."
I'll never let our daughter marry a worthless man.
"Hey, I'm right here!"
It's me!
"Mom, dad!"
I'm here!
Maria!
Maria!
"Get back, Maria."
We're too far up!
- What way was it?
Stuart had always been crazy jealous.
"That night, he was drunk too."
He started hitting me and jabbing a gun into me.
"He was mad enough to kill me, and I was terrified."
"Suddenly, Johnny came into the room."
He'd f ollowed us home f rom the club.
"He took the gun f rom Stuart, or was trying to but it seemed to go off right in my ear."
I passed out and when I came to Johnny was kissing me.
"That was the last time I saw him until he came back, two days ago."
I remember he said goodbye.
I think he was crying.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter."
Let's get out of this lobster trap.
We need salt air.
They say salt's antiseptic.
"Rip, what's the matter?"
is something the matter?
- Yesterday you called me Dusty.
Today--
- Johnny used to call you that.
Yes.
What would you like to call me?
- l'll have to think about that.
"- Yes, think of that."
- l want you to.
- We'd better get back to town.
I couldn't stand there looking at her. I had to keep moving.
Her story about Johnny sounded real.
"I'd buy it, on approval, as the dolls say."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans.
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
We can expose U.S. Forces... secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
[Elizabeth] It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.
- Which truck do you drive?
- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
- Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by... and they call the police when we're in the camp?
No one hikes around here.
- Philip.
- Come on.
"Come on, buddy."
[Engine Off]
-And just hustling?
I said you're coming to mass You!
You're fucked in the head!
OK?
There!
Pierre!
"I wanted to find before you, but I have not arrived."
Sit.
"I can not, I parked illegally."
And my friends just go.
Come on!
I visited some Tellier.
"He wants 50,000 euros for an accident in the basement."
"Funny, it seems to think that I'll pay him."
This guy's a jerk.
I do not know what a lawyer.
What kind of accident?
UltimateFightChampionship.
Berserker fight in which all blows allowed.
"Not allowed, but the posjeæeno well the money is on the bet."
I know it is not good engage in illegal things.
"I'll stop, but I will not over become a provincial night clerk."
What exactly happened?
Stupid Tellier's cousin sent into combat.
In the second round broke his spine.
"Will no longer walk, but I do?"
He should not have come.
You know that you can be prosecuted because of the violence and causing disability?
"No worries, I have a very good attorney."
-Just so.
"I am a lawyer, I'm not to your debt."
Solve it.
There are other people interested.
You thinking about selling to the Vietnamese?
I'm not gonna say who.
"I gotta do what's best, right?"
"You want my money in your bank, I want that Eastern territory."
"I'm not saying we won't make a deal, but there are other people interested and I wanna listen to what they have to say."
"You sell me the East, I make sure you make a lot of money."
- Keep talking.
- It's all I'm asking.
I got a meeting with this guy in 10 minutes.
- Where is this gonna be?
"- 400 block, Powell."
I'm in my car.
Let's go.
Julianna Vejzna?
Immigration.
"Would you come along with me, please."
- Am I being arrested?
"- Yes, you are."
Why?
Why are you arresting me?
"I'm sorry, I don't know the details."
Watch your head.
The Chickadee club's laid out like this.
"Two exit doors at the back, Ronnie's office, then you got the stage."
"These exits doors are open, or locked up?"
I don't know.
Can I get out that way is what I need to know.
Have they got chains?
I'll see if I can find out.
"This is the club here, all this."
"This is the lounge and your front doors, here and here."
Mood:
"- Hassled, hot, hostile, relaxed."
- You're histerical.
I'm used to hanging out with these people too long.
- It catches on.
- Totally.
I like to stay away from the fashion car when I'm not working.
"But it's so incestuous, everybody is doing everybody else."
They feel like they don't get to miss out or something like that.
- It's pathetic.
"- Listen, I gotta get back to work... before I get fired, but maybe we could grab a drink after?"
"I'd love to, but unfortunately my day doesn't end here."
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Great.
"There's this cool band named Nimbus, playing at the Rebard's... it's like some disco, some funk, interested?"
"- Sounds fabulous, I'd love to."
- Cool.
And definitely bring that silly putty.
I'm all over that.
- Time to take your places!
- I'm not ready yet.
I'm still in make up.
"See, Chi Chi?"
I told you.
I don't work like this.
- Supermodels.
- I know.
Attendance!
"I needs standants, standants, you..."
- spritzer girl.
- Did I hear my name?
Go stand at the top of the balcony.
- We're negotiating.
And how do you know that?
And are you really opening with a Shakespeare quote?
- Is that your plan?
- That's right.
Sonnet 65.
I assigned it.
I'm feeling nostalgic.
"Come on, Brooke, you don't miss me at all?"
"Consider this number blocked, too."
"This is my cousin, Eli."
Feel free to ignore him.
"This is Audrey, Noah."
"Hey, man."
"First day, huh?"
- School is school.
"- Sure, except, in this school, people get killed by knife-wielding maniacs every 20 years, give or take."
"Excuse me! ""Girl's only"" moment."
"(SIGHS) So, out of nowhere, Branson hits me up this morning."
Yeah.
"He said he just ""heard"" Jake and I broke up."
Whoa!
How did he hear that?
Barely anyone even knew that you were together.
What is it with men from the past mysteriously showing up?
"Wait, what does that mean?"
"Emma's deadbeat dad resurfaced, too."
"Okay, not cool."
And that is a totally different thing.
And I was also not ready to share that!
You weren't gonna share it with me?
"The person I told this morning wasn't exactly supportive, so..."
"- Yeah, uh-huh."
- You seem a little...
- Distracted.
"- I'm sorry, Amaar,"
I'm just trying to schedule an important meeting with Charles.
- Oh!
"Well, I can come back..."
"- No, no, you're here"
Interrupting me now.
Let's just get this over with.
- OK.
I was wondering if...
- You know the thing is...
"Charles and I are both so busy, we just can't line up our schedules."
I can't even get in touch with him.
"I've emailed, texted, phoned!"
The only thing left is Facebook or kidnapping.
"Oh, Facebook!"
"Hello, Facebook Charles,"
I'm poking you.
"Yeah, you like that, don't you?"
"Poke, poke, poke."
"You know, you can only poke someone once until they poke back."
"OK, really quick question:"
what do I do to build a mosque in Mercy?
"You know, what you really need is to start off with a press conference."
"Invite the media, invite the town."
You know what?
"There's a town meeting later on tonight, you can piggyback it."
I'll even waive the permit fees.
- What permit fees?
- Bribes.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
- Was her father here?
- Yes.
- He asked me if I was a faggot.
- You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
- What was my orientation?
- What did you say?
- That I'm into men.
- Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me if I like men or women?
- Who cares?
"- Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches."""
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
40.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
My God.
You really are a Chemistry teacher.
You mind?
I was terrible at Chemistry.
I'm more of a Humanities guy.
How did you find me?
We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
"My PI charged me for three hours, so I seriously doubt it took him more than one."
"So this is what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shake-down racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
"Is it in a jelly jar, buried in the side yard?"
"This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last."
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit!
Right now you're Fredo.
You scared me.
Hey!
You scared me.
"Hey, hey."
Why are you acting like this?
You came recently.
Yes.
"You were born in 1980, year of the tiger, right?"
"Your parents didn't register your birth early or late, right?"
Do you look at any half good-looking man with that kind of nauseating gaze...?
Are you a crazed fan of pretty faced men?
Fine.
"Watch, watch."
Watch as much as you want.
I'm going to sleep.
I'll hear the good news first.
The good news is...
Synced  ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Blue Sea @ Viki
Ah dah~
Ah dah~
"Say, ""hello"""
That's how we greet.
We've already forgotten that place a long time ago.
We can't remember that distant time long ago when life first sprouted in the sea to when we stepped onto the land to live. (THE LEGEND OF THE BLUE SEA)
What is the sea to all of you?
How many times a day do you think of the sea?
What are you doing?
Did you stay up all night like that?
How old are you that you've fallen for a celebrity?
Are you a crazy fan girl?
Stop watching and give it here.
Hello?
What are you doing?
"Before it was even time to go home, he was pushing me into the car then pulling me out."
It was ridiculous.
But Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday night.
We agreed.
"Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood me up."
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.
"He really liked you, too."
That's all he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date that night.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
"Tommy, what the fuck?"
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
"Who the hell do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?"
"Slow down, alright."
I forgot. I thought it was next week.
"It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!"
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you were gonna stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
What did you expect?
Let me make it up to you...
Karen.
I'll think about it.
"I remember, she was screaming on the street, and I mean loud."
-But she looked good.
Two gyms and a cheese shop.
And he's going to Turks.
12C?
"Oh, my God, we're 12A and B."
"Oh, we'll be fine."
No.
You'll die.
Would it be awful to change seats?
Not as awful as composting right before you come to the airport.
Ugh!
"Okay, wish me luck."
"Jake, real quick."
The metabolism-- how does she eat like that?
"Pretty, isn't it?"
"Uh, oh."
"Yes, dear."
"It's just lovely, mm-hmm."
"It's lovely how it turned a one-hour drive into three, soaked a brand-new pair of my shoes right down to the toes."
Yeah.
Simply spectacular.
"Well, at least we'll be getting away from it for the holiday."
I'm going to Calgary.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the unexpected weather conditions, all incoming and outgoing flights are being temporarily delayed."
"Every effort is being made to clear the runways, but until the snow lets up, everyone get comfortable-- could be an hour... could be more."
Ooh.
Excuse me.
"Hey, I said excuse me."
"Yeah, I heard you."
"Is there a problem, sir?"
I don't know.
Is there?
"I heard my wife say ""excuse me"" just now."
- Okay.
- Homesick?
I don't know.
How's Asger?
- Okay.
- Say hi.
I will...
See you.
"Hey, don't forget your little present."
"So I pocket the lump, catch the night train and go back to Jutland."
End of story.
But it doesn't work anymore.
It's like a prison I can't get out of.
I'm not like this.
I'm not.
"I only do it, because Asger hasn't got anybody else to do it."
And because I'm the one who knows people in Christiania.
A pusher frau.
"She waits on drug users, who come around to buy drugs."
"I get them coffee, while they tell me I look good   because they want to suck up to the pusher, who couldn't care less."
He's too stoned to notice anything.
That's Asger.
He's pretty spaced out and indifferent.
To me as well.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
He used to be a bouncer.
"Big and strong, with a sexy tattoo on his ass."
With Asger it was so different!
He ate pussy like nobody else.
"He was so good at it, and I felt I was in love for the first time ever."
Asger is not a bouncer anymore.
He's a full-time pusher.
# Just put a melody to the words #
# That you're sayin' and soon you'll be-- #
"Dad, I wanna join the basketball team."
What did you say?
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do.
That's what I really wanna do.
Basketball?
!
No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
"But, Dad, it's what I really want."
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"I know, that's kind of why I like it."
Don't you even think about it!
"If I had a jock for a son,"
I'd be the laughing stock of the men's choir club!
"It's my life, Dad!"
Don't make me slap you.
I will slap your face so super hard!
I am the man of this house!
You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
Maybe you should let him try it.
"What did you say, woman?"
!
You aren't being fair.
That's it!
I'm gonna slap you!
"No, please!"
# I slap you I slap you #
"# I slap, slap, slap you #"
# I'm slappin' you slapping' you silly 'cause you disrespected me #
"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class."
"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
I think this is about it.
- She hit an artery!
"- Michelle, call medical!"
"No, she's bleeding too much."
We got to take her there now!
- Tell security!
- We need someone from medical.
- Interrogation room 819.
- Uncuff her.
Now!
So what did Sherry have to say?
That Alan had a heart attack.
And you believe her?
I'd be a fool to believe anything Sherry says to save herself.
But murder?
I can't imagine she'd do that.
"David, we can't allow ourselves to be caught off guard this time."
Now we have to assume the worst.
Then we'd also have to assume that Julia was somehow involved.
What?
"Whoa, whoa, listen."
"David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not the same kind of person that Sherry is."
"When we find out all the facts, we'll proceed from there."
I have to go over the morning brief with Jerry.
All right.
- Hello?
"- Julia, it's me."
Wayne?
"I just heard about Alan, and I... are you alone?"
The police are here.
I'm was just going to speak with one of the officers.
"All right, tell me what happened."
In Benigno's house?
Yes.
Why are you living there?
Benigno is dead.
"One day, you and I should talk."
"Yes, and it will be simpler than you think."
Nothing is simple.
I'm a ballet mistress and nothing is simple.
TALK TO HER
The stage is full of wooden chairs and tables.
"Two women come out, wearing slips."
"Their eyes are closed, like two sleepwalkers."
You're scared they'll bump into everything.
"But suddenly, a man appears, with such a sad face."
The saddest I've ever seen.
And he knocks all the chairs and tables out of their way.
You can't imagine how moving it was!
"There was a man sitting beside me, in his forties, good-looking."
"He cried several times, from emotion."
I can understand why.
It was so beautiful!
I have a surprise for you!
I got Pina Bausch's autograph for you.
I had to buy the photo.
It's in English.
"It means: ""I hope you overcome all your obstacles and start dancing."""
"- Look, she's got her period."
- It's early.
Good evening.
"Benigno, could you stay tonight?"
My sister can't stay with the kids and I've got no one else.
- and I can't help feeling that...
- It wasn't your fault.
It was his.
Son of a bitch never did anything without a plan.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he wanted this.
What are you doing with your hand?
"Maybe he wanted us to, you know, be partners."
Think I'm going to be sick.
I think Snart knew.
"He knew that I'd keep an eye out for you, and you'd keep an eye out for me."
While doing what?
What we haven't finished doing.
What was H.G. Wells' childhood nickname?
- Bertie.
- Incredible.
You've gotten every answer correct tonight.
Since when did you become such a history buff?
I guess I developed a passion for it recently.
During your sabbatical?
You hardly ever talk about it.
Martin?
"I know, I'm sorry."
"My sabbatical was, um..."
I left some very important work unfinished.
"Ship's not going to be here, Gray."
"We saw it take off, remember?"
"Yes, and in doing so, it would have left..."
Quantum signature.
That's what I've been trying to tell Mick.
- Radio beacon.
- Quantum entangler.
So she's Alice.
"David,itis alwayssomething."
whynotme  like to leave with you.
Childrenfall.
Alice?
Why did not you wait presented to you?
Than?
They teach all days in the kids room not to talk to strangers.
Four years old.
How I am supposed to know who you are?
Do you have any idea how much It has taken me time to negotiate just see it unsupervised in a public space?
"- But David, fell off!"
"- Expected more from you, Alice."
I'm sorry...
Alice?
You lied about your name.
The Most swingers do.
"You have an STD, right?"
Do not.
"Worse, you're a journalist."
If you do not understand do you want to talk to me.
"Actually, it's time tell my story."
I have cancer.
Sinus and glands.
"If it removed, not would be nothing left of me."
I tried to get me this blow away.
Did you ever have children?
Good...
"You have to understand that it was the principle of the life of a woman, family planning ..."
Many of us did things that in retrospect ...
Abortion.
Adoption.
Tell her I'm pleased about her and the plumber.
It's handy to have a man with a trade about the house.
She deserves a bit of happiness.
"I know I was never the father you needed or deserved, but you will always be my beautiful girl  and I will always love you."
Always... always... always.
He still had six weeks in solitary.
"If people don't respect the law, what have you got?"
"Anarchy, mob rule, and mice in your garibaldis."
What are you going on about?
You think his mouse brothers come and busted him out?
Mind you...
I think I can see a tunnel.
Ooh...
Back already?
Ahh... there's your culprit.
- A bleeding' heart liberal like Paul.
- What?
"Yeah, that's it."
"He's got the hump about that three-and-out thing, and he's come down here and he's let Mickey have it away on his toes."
"That's your man, Victor."
He even looks guilty.
It was a joke.
We were having a laugh.
What you talking about?
You know.
"The rule, the big game, three and out."
- What about it?
- You know what?
I think he believed us.
"You knew it was a joke... a wind-up, didn't you?"
What?
You actually fell for it?
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Oh...
"Unfortunately, I don't have the resources."
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
Excuse me?
London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya...
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
(CHUCKLING) Oh...
I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
Fuck you.
- We need the information on Latif.
"Yeah, yeah."
"In Latex, I know."
Should we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
"In Dieter's file, it said that he was a chopper pilot."
"It's a long shot, but they might have had a bird out here..."
To extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange.
"How unfortunate that you killed him, then."
"(LAUGHING) Is it worth a hand job, if I didn't?"
GRANT:
"Hello, Dieter."
"I'm Colonel Grant, British Military Intelligence."
(GRUNTING) GRANT:
"Don't move, please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you..."
GRANT:
It's a very nasty way to go.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
Shit.
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
It's amazing the things you notice.
Like the corner of his collar that was coming undone.
LIke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts.
That's all I could see.
The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric.
I think I have to go.
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
It's such a lie that you should do what's In your heart.
"If we all did what was In our hearts, the world would grind to a halt."
And they know that he knows and I can't believe he didn't tell them.
He got a perfect score on his PSAT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
- Hey.
- What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
But why?
Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina.
"Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Oh, you mean Ken?"
"Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group."
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Atta boy.
Chumley.
The beverage situation around here is reprehensible.
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
"Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh."
I need to change your Michael Jackson thing.
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"And to go unnoticed, we created a whole new language."
"Words were numbers, and numbers were words."
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.
- Plus 6.
- Gun.
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
- Plus 14.
- Ring.
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
"Man, that sugar's sweet."
"Because I knew the count, I knew which cards were left in the deck."
That's how I knew what to bet.
You're doing great.
"Micky, I just want to let you know that I'm only doing this for medical school, which is $300,000."
"I mean, if I can get anything close to that, then I'm done."
"Well, in the first place, Ben, it's not ""if,"" it's ""when."""
"And second of all, I get it."
I completely understand.
- You do?
- Yeah.
It's a means to an end.
"Look, they've got this new computer software that reads people's faces, so who knows how long this gig's gonna last for any of us?"
What if we get caught?
"Our system keeps us under the radar, you'll see."
"Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal."
"- So, there's no danger in it at all?"
Especially her own. (LAUGHS)
"No, this is more of a general grief... about everything."
Love is a farce and everyone dies.
See?
Especially in our family.
Look at Mum?
"I'm sorry, have you lost your mother as well?"
"No, she lives in a house-truck near Stafford."
Denise had a change of heart.
Mum turned lesbian and Dad cried for a year.
Now she's with a man again.
George doesn't need to hear about any of that.
How can we help our esteemed new editor today?
"I'm actually not feeling that esteemed, Monty."
Welcome to my world.
I want to apologise.
"Well, look no worries."
You're welcome.
Job didn't mean that much to me anyway.
I meant to Bill Jr.
"Oh, what for?"
For being the one to tell Lindsay.
That should have been his to do.
You would have done a much better job than he would've.
I'd still like to talk to him anyway.
Do know where I can find him?
Mm-hm.
I can do better than that.
"Siouxsie, cancel my appointments for the day."
You don't have any.
Excellent.
He likes the way the balls roll across the grass.
"Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do."
Right?
You know the man you married.
Look.
"I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh,"
"I'll leave a man behind to watch you, аnd Aisha can get you whatever you need."
Aisha doesn't seem too happy I'm here.
"Well, me and Aisha have been having problems for a while."
"Yeah, well, maybe I'm making things worse."
Nah.
It's not you.
"With Aisha, nothing's ever enough for her."
"She helped set up this deal but as soon it's done, me and Aisha, we through."
What you looking for?
Won't know till I see it.
"I know what you want because you and me, we want the same thing."
Isaac.
Why are you worrying about Isaac?
He treats you like a little bitch.
He is still running things.
What if he wasn't?
"What if I said,"
I got a way for you to get what's yours?
Hey.
Theo.
"Okay, okay,"
"I had enough of that when your mom was alive, come on."
"If this is about, uh, Rebecca not coming, we were able to tweak the speech."
"No, no."
It's not about that.
You asked me to do a little recon
For you with some of my old media contacts.
"Number nine, Nathan Road."
"You know, you should not follow the trend to cut your hair like this!"
Different people should have different hair styles.
"See, your hair doesn't match your face."
And your face doesn't match your body.
Your body doesn't match your hair.
Completely ugly!
What the hell do you want?
"Master, I know it's my fault, please don't blame me."
I regret to cut my hair.
Sit down first.
Tell me the whole story.
Alright.
"Oh that day, I wandered off alone on the Nathan Road."
"When I reached number 9, Nathan Road, a fat woman waved to me."
"She said, ""Come to have your hair cut, it costs 5 cents only!"""
That's why I followed her.
"I always told you, cheap things are no good!"
You know your mistake now?
"Let's go back to the case, alright?"
"On that day, I went to the HK Club for the lion dance as usual."
"After the performance, I went back to the back stage."
"Suddenly someone covered my head with a rice bag, he pushed me on the wall, when I struggled with him..."
"Suddenly, someone took off my pants..."
Did he...
Yes!
What did you feel?
Painful?
No.
Funny?
No!
"My ass was seen, and I felt a bit cool."
Kissing with inside lip?
Is this nothing?
"Good my lord, be cured of this diseased opinion and belimes,"
- For 'tis most dangerous
"- Say it be, 'tis true."
No!
"No, my lord!"
It is!
You lie!
Mightst hospice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink.
What stand I in?
I must be the poisoner of good Polixenes.
The King hath on him such a countenance as he hath lost some province
What is breeding that changes thus his manners?
"Sir, I will tell you"
I am appointed him to murder you.
"By whom, Camille?"
- By the King.
- For what?
"He thinks, nay, with all confidence, he swears"
That you have touch'd his Queen forbiddenly.
"O, then my best blood tum to an infected jelly."
- How should this grow?
- I know not
But I am sure 'tis safer to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis bom.

Merry or sad shall't be?
As merry as you will.
A sad tale's best for winter.
Play you?
That's right.
You win-- I tell you everything I know.
What's to stop me taking that basketball and beating it out of you?
Bring it.
They got better food at the hospital anyway.
"What the hell you got to threaten me with, man?"
- More lockup time?
- Okay.
We might be able to help you.
Shave some time off your sentence?
"I'm doing double life, gimp."
Excuse me?
"You got a busted ear, too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
"You could shave 10 years off my time, but I ain't never getting out."
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."
I got all the time in the world.
What do you get if we lose?
I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard.
"Oh, yeah, play basketball."
"It's not like we got a killer to catch, or anything."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."
Ten.
Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is-is bad."
"Danno, shut up, all right?"
"Please, do me a favor and don't call me Danno, huh?"
My name is Jean.
Jean Jacquemonde.
Where is Mayzel?
!
You want to pick on an old man?
I'm here.
I've got you.
My body became like this because of you.
Ominae!
Jean?
Don't move!
brainwashing him with all the troubles of life your abilities are still only this much.
I'm going to stop the source of your breathing now...
Ominae!
...with this machine body of mine!
You've finally shown your true colors!
That is ENOUGH!
He's already dead.
Both Little Boy and Fatman failed to obtain Mayzel.
They were just big talk.
It was predictable.
that was all they could do.
what if they continue to hold Noah?
Don't worry about that.
When our satellite probe was destroyed the investigation into the magnetic field occurrence was quite significant.
along with the other message plate prove that we are the ones who are holding the key to Noah.
What great confidence.
I will kill all who interfere with me.
quietly.
You seem to be tired.
Who was he?
My former boss.
And we've learned over the years to separate the real Lucy from who Lucy is when she's ill.
"- Yeah, because that's so easy."
"- No, I totally get it."
You what?
"Well, I understand what your mom's saying."
"I mean, people can't be blamed for something if they're sick, right?"
Hm?
- Thank you.
- So now you're on her side too.
"No, no, no, I'm not on anyone's side."
"- Uh, uh..."
- Except for your side.
I'm on your side.
Don't let the sniping fool you.
There's affection there.
I'm sorry.
Are you new here?
"Because my loving sister, well, she tried to kill me."
"That was just the illness, right?"
She didn't want you dead.
Dead enough.
How dead do you have to be around here till someone takes your freaking side?
Let me guess.
This wasn't a typical dinner at your house.
Heh.
You can't even slam a freaking door in this house!
"Look, I was just trying to understand your sister."
Everyone is always trying to understand my sister.
"Trust me, no one has come up with anything yet."
I thought you were gonna be the person who'd try to understand me.
"- Everybody can hear those voices, right?"
"- Yes, honey."
"Uh, I-"
You were the one that trained me in the delicate art of giving people useless information.
"I said nice things, for what it's worth."
Thank you.
You have a job for me?
A woman I met.
Evelyn.
She heard I worked security.
She asked me for help.
I guess her ex ran off with their son.
"We ran checks, credit cards, airlines, got nothing."
"Somebody's gonna have to do some legwork... but a job that small, not really our thing."
You thought of me.
"I would consider it a favor if you took the job,and the money's not bad."
- Money's not the pressing issue.
- Why?
What do you need?
- Identity.
- Not for traveling.
"Michael, if you leave Miami-"
I can't help you with that kind of thing.
Seriously.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Fine.
"Get your documents together, I'll have my guys do an I.D. package."
Go see Evelyn first.
Thanks.
I separated from Doug a few months ago.
"I tried to keep it together forJasper's sake, but-That's our son."
But it was hard on him listening to us fight all the time.
He started acting up at school.
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
- I'll read them to Alicia at night.
- They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
- About what?
- Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
You're crazy!
We get along better than most married couples.
Why shouldn't a man want to marry the woman he loves?
Because the woman is in a coma!
"Because Alicia can't say with any part of her body: ""I do!"""
Because we don't know if vegetative life is really life!
Get in the car.
- How can you say that?
- Get in the car!
Your relationship with Alicia is a monologue and it's insane.
I'm not saying talking's no use but people talk to plants and they don't marry them!
I can't believe you're saying that.
I thought you were different.
"I mean, isn't it?"
I can hardly stand it when he's away for a night.
"Oh, stella."
"When he's away for a week, I nearly go wild."
-Gracious.
-When he comes back I cry in his lap like a baby.
I guess that's what's meant by being in love.
stella.
I haven't asked you the things you probably thought I was going to ask so I'II expect you to be understanding about what I have to tell you.
"What, BIanche?"
You're going to reproach me.
"I know you're bound to reproach me, but before you do take into consideration you left."
I stayed and struggled.
You came to New orleans and looked out for yourself.
I stayed at belle Reve and tried to hold it together.
"Oh, I'm not meaning this in any reproachfuI way."
-But the burden descended on my shoulders.
-Best I couId do was make my own living.
"But you were the one that abandoned belle Reve, not I."
"I fought for it, bled for it, almost died for it."
Stop this outburst.
tell me what happened.
-I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
-About what?
please!
The loss.
The loss.
belle Reve?
"Lost, is it?"
"Yes, stella."
But how did it go?
What happened?
- Why don't you?
Or maybe you're scared.
Takes a strong man to admit his fears.
Fine.
I'll go myself.
"[People Cheering, Laughing]"
What's going on?
"Mr. Harpel is playing every table at the high-roller pit, hundred thousand a hand."
"That's way above pattern, even for him."
Mmm.
"It stings, doesn't it?"
You have no idea.
Cézanne.
You have a good eye.
Harpel is a collector.
"Yes, I am aware of the fact that Harpel's a collector."
So you bought him a Cézanne to get him to gamble?
Not fair.
Fair?
That's a quaint American notion.
"You realize you're going to have to subtract the cost of this painting from your clients' total winnings, which is going to make it next to impossible... for you to win our little bet."
What is that?
Hmm?
[Sniffing] Is that the scent of desperation?
"[Chuckles] Understandable, I suppose, the way Harpel's been playing."
I'd guess I'm up on you by at least half a million.
"Oh, I doubt that."
"Anyway, I didn't buy the painting for Harpel."
I merely borrowed it for him to enjoy while he plays.
"Oh, you just borrowed it?"
Friends at the Musée d'Orsay.
Oh.
We forge some German documents and make the clothes of French peasant workers out of these blankets.
It's a great night for dying!
"Then we wheel the wooden horse into the exercise yard, we build a glider and we pole vault over the fence."
- What do you think?
- Pathetic.
"- Let's do it, then."
- Yeah.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Your plan worked brilliantly.
Yes.
Shame about old Spurty getting shot by the Gestapo.
"No, the SPG, Eddie, the SPG."
Not the Gestapo.
They're completely different things.
"The Gestapo, er..."
- speak German.
"- Ah, yes."
We're all right.
That's what matters.
"Of course, Eddie."
Safe and sound at home.
Perhaps now I can prepare for my fantastic dinner party.
Empty the big trousers.
"Okey-dokey, me old spunky cock sparrow."
"Now then, I've invited Tarby, Lynchy, Parky, Brucie,"
Tommy O'Connory and you and me.
Have we sufficient comestibles?
Oo-er!
I don't know about that but here's the grub.
"Good Lord, how did you get so much meat in your trousers?"
That's what all the girls say.
"Smut is the last recourse of the emotional cripple, Eddie."
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
S  P's lowering the city's credit rating.
We're gonna close two firehouses.
Result: 1 50 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit...

The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
-And a drug dealer.
-And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but..."
... he'sverywelcome.
"Where is the stock exchange moving to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"-No argument, Lenny."
-And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
"Ms. Ramsey, uh, would you say that you and your niece"
Are close?
"Oh, of course we are."
But she's my sister's only daughter.
"And, uh, now that Stephen is..."
"Well, now that Stephen is dead,"
She's the only family I have left.
How did Stephen and his sister get along?
"Oh, just fine."
They were as close as any brother
And sister I've ever seen.
Why do you ask?
"No particular reason, Ms. Ramsey."
"Uh, we just have to ask a lot of questions"
When we're checking out a possible homicide.
Homicide?
What are you talking about?
I thought it was an accident.
I read it in the newspapers.
"Well, yes, it may appear that way, ma'am."
"But, you see, we have to, uh, check out everything,"
Every possibility.
It must have been an accident.
Run over by a car?
"Uh, that's the way it appears, yes, ma'am."
"Well, if it wasn't, then someone wanted Stephen dead."
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
"I don't believe that boy had, uh, an enemy in the world."
RICHARD:
Seems like everyone we talk

What stark had for breakfast two months ago.
Mm-hmm.
You feel him sweat?
Wife's the key.
Stay on the wife.
"Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet..."
I'm afraid I mistakenly took your stolen-car report.
"Well, thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen."
"Unless you're going to arrest and charge me,"
I'll be on my way.
"If there's anything further you'd like to discuss,"
Please feel free to contact one of mr.
Stark's attorneys.
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?
I didn't...
exactly.
You didn't think.
"For the love of eve, will somebody tell me what I did,"
Who I cheesed off to have you dumped in my lap?
Why you never catch any actual assignments.
Hey.
You see this man?
"He did exemplary work today, and you ruined it."
"Now, what do you have to say to him?"
"Agent thompson, I apologize."
"Agent carter, sorry doesn't even begin to cover it."
Doesn't even begin to cover it.

Dr. Croatman will see you immediately.
"May I use the phone, please?"
Certainly.
"How do you do, Mr. Brown?"
I'm Dr. Croatman.
Won't you sit down?
We'll have a little talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
"You want me to take some medicine, give me the prescription, let me get out of here."
"I don't prescribe medicine, Mr. Brown."
Sit down.
Just what kind of a doctor are you?

Will you be able to manage things if John should have to take a long rest?
"If it's long enough, I'll have this business coining money."
That's what I thought.
I don't want to stay.

What about Nick McCullers?

Everybody knows Emily's the better swimmer.

He came here to school and said that?
In front of everyone.

The district attorney can't go to trial without it.

They can charge me anytime they find new evidence.
This is the center of the collection.
You'll find this in the Main Room.
All the artworks are to be removed and all of them handled with the utmost care.
"You'll enter the property at midnight, on my command."
Is that clear?
"Yes, sir!"
Alright.
Good evening.
"Good evening, everyone!"
"Ok, let's not stand on ceremony, let's jump straight in with"
item number one in your catalogue:
"""A drive around the circuit in Monaco"", beginning bidding at... 50 thousand!"
"Now don't be shy, do we see 50 thousand?"
50!
Do I see 55?
55!
I see 55...
Do I see 60?
Your hand up?
Do we see 60?
"Is that 70, sir, or wonderful hair. 70!"
That's gone to you.
Thank you very well!
Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs.
Yes!
"I believe the last time you and I saw each other, we were bidding on the Malevich."
"You won that one, I guess."
Have you still got that Mondrian:
"""Study In Composition number 2""?"
Red and Blue!
"Yes, of course, that's one of our favorites."
Constantine hung a Rauschenberg next to it and would talk about the unbroken tradition between the two.
Romeo and Juliet.
"Act 2, scene 2, line 2."
The balcony scene.
That's-
Your favorite scene in the play.
I like that you pay attention to weird little details like that.
You do?
You're blushing.
I am?
I shouldn't have said that.
I totally embarrassed you.
No.
Amanda... you can always say whatever you want with me.
"Glazed Cornish game hens on a bed of sautéed greens, sweet-potato soufflé and asparagus, with shaved Romano and pancetta."
I don't think this is what we ordered.
Right. 'Cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.
I took some liberties with the menu.
You made this?
No one knows I'm secretly a fan of Top Chef.
And no one ever will.
Bon appétit.
Stop staring.
I can't.
I'm O.D'ing on suspense.
I wonder how it's going.
You wanna know if it's going badly.
What you witnessed earlier was a completely uncharacteristic outburst.
"No, it's how you really feel."
It was just a mini meltdown brought on by some stupid homework assignment.
"The ""Who You Really Are"" essay?"
No one ever takes that seriously.
"Well, almost no one."
"See, this gentleman thinks that we should comp his room... because it was haunted by a ghost thief."
- Delinda!
- Wolfgang!
What a surprise to see you.
Ed.
"Hey, Wolf."
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
I wanted to get here early to make sure everything is perfect... for the grand opening tomorrow night.
"""Wolfgang Puck at the Montecito."""
"Has a good ring to it, don't you think so?"
I think so.
Wow.
Just rolls off the tongue.
"Ed, let's go."
Where we going?
- In the kitchen.
- [Delinda] I so don't need this right now.
"On top of Wolfgang's opening tomorrow,"
I get a tip the health department's inspecting Mystique this week.
- [Danny] Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
- Pay up.
You heard her.
So you gonna pay your bill and leave nicely or is this gonna get ugly?
[People Cheering] There you go.
Can you believe this guy actually thought he was gonna get a free room by saying it was haunted?
"He said the ghost was a dark-haired woman, right?"
"Uh, no."
I think he said the ghost was a ghost.
Oh.
Maybe it was Monica.
"What, stopping dine-and-dashers from the great beyond?"
- But who?
You knowwho.
And what about you?
Can you voice your own opinion some day?
"OK, take them."
These twins are like a needle and a thread.
They had it the hard way.
You can not even imagine what will happen to them ifthey are taken to our premises.
Take them.
Theywill make up fortheir guilt.
I've my orders.
I do not have the right.
And I have my orders as well and they are about our offensive.
So you'd better stay awayfrom me.
It is underyour responsibility.
Surely it is.
It is not your business.
All this war is only my business.
The division security section speaking.
I need Captain Shulgin.
He is in the headquarters.
- Kotov!
- Kotov!
Private Kotov reporting.
-Why have you been sent to the court martial?
-A intentional self-wound.
Yourfile states that you used to be a sergeant and had battle awards... including a Medal for Battlefield Courage.
"That's right. ln fact I was discharging the gun, it came off and the bullet hit my leg."
No one believes me.
-Will you believe me?
"-Yes, I will."
when I see you in the battlefield.
I wasn't sure if you cared about me being here and him not.
- I do not.
- Right.
Because you are a guest.
And this is probably your summer home.
He used to bring other women here so he could cheat on my mother.
"So, no family vacations."
"Only horrible, traumatic ones."
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(LAWNMOWER)
(ENGINE STOPS)
You never smell cut grass in the city.
I don't find you charming.
"You are just like him, and I hope you learn to take responsibility for yourself before you destroy the lives of people who care about you."
(STRAINS)
This is really nice.
"Thanks, Dad."
"So, how's it been up here?"
It's been good.
I've really enjoyed all the alone time.
I'm sorry about the scheduling problem.
Will you admit that you made a mistake?
I don't think that's necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
Could happen to anyone.
Was anybody speaking to you?
- I thought I was part of the conversation.
"- Well, you weren't supposed to be."
"In fact, you're not even supposed to be here."
I am.
Does that make sense?
You are the scheduling problem I was referring to.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Ugh.
"Well, that goes beyond stupid."
Agent Gibbs.
"Is Leon coming, too?"
Assault with a deadly weapon.
You left that one out the last we talked.
"Uh, well, I was..."
I was just... just a dumb kid who-who didn't know any better.
"I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal."
You put someone in the hospital.
I'd-I'd say that was a big deal.
What's this got to do with anything?
One: you lied to me.
Two: you have the potential for violence.
"Yeah, when I was 14 years old."
"Look, I-I admit, I had some tough times as a kid, you know?"
And-And I made a mistake.
I lashed out.
"But I learned from it, and I moved on."
It never happened again.
What else don't I know?
"I told you everything, Agent Gibbs."
I didn't do this!
Why can't you just accept that?
"Because a young man is dead, and I can't accept anything yet."
"All right, that's enough."
"Michael, don't say another word."
"You should be focusing your energy on real evidence, real suspects."
Michael is a suspect.
The only person you need to be worried about is Petty Officer Brian Smith.
"UA after the crime, fight with the victim..."
"-Yeah, I'm romping in the fields now."
[KNOCKS]
ROBERTS:
Hey.
"This won't take long, Roberts."
"M.E.'s finding was suicide, right?"
He didn't have doubts?
I read the report on the Santini case.
I talked with Sipowicz and Kelly.
I also read her diary.
That's pretty sad reading.
"I never actually gave her any drugs, right?"
What I read in that diary made me sick.
"Lieutenant, let's remember she was a junkie, huh?"
-lt's not like you can take their word.
-You took control of a weak...
"... suffering,dependentperson."
You beat her.
-You made sexual use of her--
-But I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.
"Which is what I understood this inquiry to be all about, right?"
"I mean, you don't see anything criminal coming out of this, do you?"
-You put in for retirement.
-l need three years for full vesting.
Today!
I don't care what you lose in vesting or in benefits.
I won't have you in this precinct or pass you on.
You fight me...
... I'llturnthepackageover tolad with a recommendation to dismiss.
I'm gone.
Fancy iced me.
Told me he'd smear me if I fought him.
You're Fozzie Bear who's been ripped up and used to smuggle heroin.
A Nazi doctor.
I don't even know what the fuck you are.
This is not about serving yourselves.
This is about serving the president.
"So let's do that, shall we?"
- Tom.
- Tom.
"-  Shut up, Gary."
- Shut... mm-hmm.
"I do the team talks, okay?"
"You're absolutely right, ma'am."
And I agree with everything you just said.
"So get it together, people!"
"Yes, ma'am."
Find Pierce.
Call NASA.
They've got to have a satellite that can pinpoint a moron.
"Yes, ma'am."
"If you want to catch a fugitive, you got to think like a fugitive."
- Where's he going?
"- Uh, to the airport."
Why would he be going to the airport?
"To catch a plane, Dan."
"You know, you could just hit the fucking gas, Jonah."
"Dan, I'm not getting a ticket."
That's the kind of shit that comes back to bite you when you run for office.
"Yeah, that's what's gonna hold you back."
"Okay, new rule in the Cube."
"If your name begins with D, you need to shut the fuck up immediately."
I'm fine because my name begins with an R.
- Not if we shorten it to Dick.
"Looks like we're clear for now, but we can't stay here too long."
Sam.
"Michael, give him a minute."
"Okay, so, those fake I.D.s..."
Worthless.
Wonderful.
Got another I.D. guy?
None that I trust -- not now.
There's a passport office up in Boca.
We could try to break in --
"Mike, come on."
"That's a crappy idea, and you know it."
Riley's gonna be expecting us to do exactly that.
"Now, I think I know a guy -- he's a friend of Dixon's, but..."
"It's a long shot, so if anybody else has a better idea, let's hear it."
"Okay, then."
"Even if you evade the FBI, ATF, and DEA, a life of crime is tough to explain to the IRS."
That's why many career criminals have a day job.
"It gives them a cover I.D., access to equipment, and a real W-2."
It also makes them easier to find if they won't answer your calls.
"Hey, buddy."
"Aw, Sam!"
What are you doing here?
"Good to see you, too, buddy."
This is my work!
And I'm not your buddy.
"Oh, come on, Dixon."
After all we've been through?
Didn't I get you a cargo plane last time I saw you?
"Oh, yeah."
That was easy to sell.
"I just put it on Craigslist and said, ""ignore the bullet holes."""
It should fetch millions.
Money?
Is that all that it means to you?
Money bought me my title.
This estate.
And now it'll help me go down in history as the discoverer of the Treasure of Atlantis.
"Sorry, co-discoverer."
You think you can buy your way into the history books?
I wouldn't be the first.
Come in.
Anybody.
"Answer me, please?"
"Come in, this is an emergency."
Have a sherry to celebrate.
"I may be forced to work with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it."
"Please, professor, spare me the hypocrisy."
You and I are two of a kind.
"Now, Zavros, he only wants the money to fund his little revolution in Macedonia."
"But you and I share the same dream, to find the Treasure of Atlantis, no matter what it takes, or what the cost."
Go on.
Kelly.
Miss Carson.
"Hey, now, there's no need to be rough with her."
"If she's here, so is MacGyver."
General Zavros is right.
Where is MacGyver?
Answer him.
Tell us where MacGyver is.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
"Kelly, I-I do think you should answer them."
I don't betray my friends.
I'll make her talk.
EZRA:
Josiah.
-Josiah.
You're as handsome as ever.
"If eyes were meant for seeing, then beauty is its own excuse for being."
EZRA:
"If you'll excuse us, Josiah."
Heartwarming family reunion and all.
You understand.
"Oh, of course."
[sighs]
"Honestly, Ezra, you've been as sour as a grape since I arrived."
Perhaps that's because I have a distinctly uneasy feeling...
... aboutyouandI both owning businesses...
... onthesamestreet in the same town.
Why ever for?
"Hey, it's not like we're in competition with each other."
"We're not, Ezra."
I provide beds and baths and food for weary travelers.
"True, and I offer music, gambling and liquor."
"Well, there you are."
"Now, you make sure to secure that real well."
MAN:
"Yes, ma'am."
I don't want that toppling over on my patrons.
Stupid.
Stupid.
How could I be so stupid?
I got too wrapped up with this town and these people.
"I should've never quit hunting that bastard, Eli Joe, till I cleared my name."
All those years of looking over your shoulder...
... sleepingwithoneeye open.
What did you say?
I said i don't like you.
Hmm.
That makes me feel very badly.
"I don't like you, either!"
Are you quite sure of that?
I wish i were just as sure that jim was safe over in jersey with all that cash.
Always leaning on jim.
"What do you mean, always leaning on jim?"
"Well, aren't you?"
"What would you do without his brains, his generosity, his shrewdness?"
You'd be lost.
"Without his friendship, i'd be lost."
"Excuse me, miss mansfield, there are two reporters from the paper to see you."
Send them in.
"Oh, hello, mr."
Boyd.
"We thought you were over in jersey with the erie gang- i mean, fisk and drew."
"Good evening, miss mansfield."
Good evening.
"What do you want, boys?"
Anything jim fisk does tonight is news.
We're running down a story.
What kind of story?
"You won't get mad if i say it, will you?"
What is it?
"They're saying in wall street that the only person smart enough to get the best of jim fisk is-excuse me- is miss mansfield, that vanderbilt's 10 millions will slip through fisk's hands into hers."
"Wait a minute, mr."
Boyd.
We were sent up here to ask you.
That's our job.
Exactly.
"Everyone has someone except for me, you know?"
"Okay, well, I thought you weren't ready for that."
"Well, I wasn't, but I..."
I don't know.
- Maybe I am.
"- Well, if we had to verbally abuse some game night guests for you to figure that out, then that is totally okay."
"And, just so you know, if you wanna get out there, all I have to do is put out an APB."
- Let me handle this one.
- I'll probably get involved.
Why don't you get involved with Mark's peen.
"No, 'cause guess what?"
"This is 40, okay?"
"Do you really think, when you take your clothes off, that he's gonna run the other way?"
"No, he's gonna jump on you like an old hound dog."
What if I just wear Spanx during sex?
What do you think?
"Mark, I wanna rock your body all night long in so many different ways."
"Not right now, we're watching ""Happy Feet."""
"- Dave, hit the road."
"- Dave, you gotta go."
- Really?
- You gotta go.
"Ugh, I wish I had somebody to rock my body."
"You will again, man."
You will again.
See you later.
"- Mark, I am so sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry, right?"
The warm banana?
What is that?
"- No, I loved that."
"- And then I snuck into your house, ""Dawson's Creek"" style."
I don't like green cars that much
This is an assault nobody moves!
"Get down, c'mon, lay on the floor"
Lay on the floor give me the car's keys
Don't make a move
Put your head down and don't move
"Let's see.... you, open it for us open it!"
Do it or I'll kill you
Let's go
Faster!
"Come on, open it!"
Open it fast or I'll kill you
What's up now?
"The key, I don't have the second key"
Who has it?
Who has it or I'll kill you
The interventor
- Who is he?
Who is he or I'll kill you
Ramirez
- Who is Ramirez?
", who is Ramirez?"
Who is Ramirez?
You are Ramirez?
", come on here You have to open the locked door"
Did you ring the alarm?
"- No If you ring the alarm I'll kill you, eh?"
"Get out of here, c'mon"
Faster
"Come on, faster"
What are you looking at?
"Come on, lay on the floor"
"Love comes, love goes"
NO BEGGING OR MUSIC PLAYING ALLOWED
It wafts in on the breeze and then it's gone
No one makes a big fuss over love these days
You get along or you slug it out
A day is like a year...
"Miss, take some change out of my pocket."
I can't reach my piggy bank.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
Put the rest back now.
A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
"See, I didn't steal any."
Then reach in again.
Your fiancé isn't as old as he looks either.
What's going on here?
Good thing that sign says you're blind or no one would know.
Mind your own business.
I'm just doing my job.
Better guide your music director back to his chair.
Meet me at 5:00 at the fountain in Friedrichshain Park.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can do anything about it
So here we are.
"Yes, here we are."
So you think we should be organ grinders?
Were you in the war?
And how!
- What's your name?
- Me?
"Biberkopf, Franz."
"She was like-- She was like,"
"""What's next, motherfucker?"
"What's--"""
I'm--
"But, look, it's a few entertainers who got that power, okay?"
"It's like--there's another dude that can do that,"
Chris Brown.
"Yep, y'all gotta give it up for Chris Brown."
"Come on, dog, why y'all ain't clapping, man?"
"Come on, why y'all ain't clapping?"
It's not like he hit y'all.
What the hell?
He's an all-around entertainer.
"He can sing, he can dance, pop-lock, box just a little bit."
"Um, okay, I know he was in a situation with Rihanna."
Okay.
And that's in the past.
"And, folks, you know people's love."
You can't help who you love.
You just can't.
You can't help who you love.
"Some women love their man so much, even whatever situation they are in, they make up excuses for them."
"""Girl, this is a circle of trust."""
"""No, bitch, that's a black eye."
"""Go get that checked out."
"That's terrible."""
"And fellas, I ain't condoning--"
You should not put your hands on a woman.
"You should not do that, okay?"
"If you do that, you should be ashamed of yourself, 'cause that's sick."
Violence isn't funny...
all the time.
And don't change the subject.
"Then there was the Pender Drug account, and Sheridan Cement."
All first class.
And all the others.
I haven't thought about hours or days off.
I've proved my loyalty and it's about time you gave me an unqualified vote of confidence.
"Now, Larry, either I get that Waterhouse account or you get yourself a new boy."
- You got it.
"I mean it, Larry."
I've got the Waterhouse account?
That's what I wanted to tell you when you came in.
Yesterday you said I couldn't have the account because I was too immature.
"What did I do, age overnight?"
"I just thought it over, and this morning I changed my mind."
"And Darrin, I know you'll do a great job."
- Good luck.
"- Thanks, Larry."
You won't be sorry.
I still don't get it.
What made you change your mind?
"- Oh, it's the boss' prerogative."
- I'll buy that.
"Boy, I can't wait to tell Sam."
I was tempted to tell her myself but I knew that you wanted that pleasure.
"Oh, yeah."
When...
When did you see Samantha?
"Oh, just now."
Down in the parking lot.
There's a great little wife you've got there.
Has your every interest at heart.
She sure has.
"Look, I'm like you, Mom."
Worried sick how Ruby's gonna feel when her teacher dies and her grandmother goes to prison all in the same week.
Tell Ruby I'll call her later.
"Mom, stay away from the District Attorney's family."
Okay?
"This time, the horse comes back, he's got a blond that's like 10 times hotter than the brunette, right?"
"And the bandit's like,"
"""Okay, cowboy, you got one more wish, then you die."""
"And the cowboy's like,"
"""I think I better talk to my horse again."""
"He goes, grabs him by the ears, and he goes,"
"""You dumb lousy animal!"
"I said posse!"""
"Well, I guess what happened is what every reporter dreams of... being in the right place at the right time."
"Or the wrong and the wrong, in this case."
And will the police be questioning you as a witness to the murder?
Revenge killing.
"And, yes, I think so."
Which would be a good reason for us to stop right here.
- We good?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- Thank you.
"- Appreciate it, Laura."
"- Thanks, guys."
Thanks.
Hey.
"Hey, angel."
That looks great.
What's going on with you?
And don't tell me everything's fine.
There is nothing.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
I think being on stage at Woodstock was good.
"At that time, I thought we did good."
My opinion of the show was this :
it was obviously fucking chaotic.
You were going off.
"The fucking music was like, sloppier than usual I felt."
"Yeah, that was one of the best show I ever done, personally."
"I connected, I said fuck it and I didn't get tired..."
I broke everything I could and it was an insane show.
Fuck it.
I felt as if the world...
the weight lifted up off me.
I felt just relieved...
But...
"then I heard the tape, it was awful."
"Live, I think, anger becomes a main source of energy to get off of."
The shows become very disorder(impossible a piger?
--dissolved ?
BIZARRE?
)
The lights look amazing...
that's another story.
"Ah, I don't really want to do it, but."
"The one who brought back the Bonheur chocolates, was this boyfriend."
The guy you're spending tomorrow's Valentine's Day with is him.
"That guy smokes, right?"
"What, so you had noticed."
"If that was the case, you should have said something earlier."
This girl.
This girl is...
It's okay!
It's fine to go on like this!
What?
Two-timing is fine.
"If that boyfriend takes off for some place again,"
I'll help Saeko-san pass the time.
It's fine like that.
What's wrong with it?
- What?
I'm totally fine with it.
"Or rather, I don't mind it much."
"If I can be with Saeko-san, and one day, be loved properly, then I'm fine with that."
It's fine even if that's far out in the future.
"So, okay?"
I'm sorry.
"Saeko-san, wait."
"If you feel even a little sorry for me, at least accept this."
But...
- It's fine if you throw it out somewhere nearby.
It's pretty harsh to personally throw out something you made for someone.
"So, if Saeko-san could do it,"
I would be a little saved.
Akamiso is excited to present...

# By seeing the other side as a threat... #

"God, this sucks!"
"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losing her, S-Stan?"
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
Maybe you should just talk to her.
"You know, a little conversation."
Tell her what you feel.
# Sometimes ya feel like there's a b-b-burnin' inside ya like a-- #
Just stop.
All righty then.
"Uh, Wendy..."
"Hey, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
- I would never leave you for Bridon.
- Really?
- No way!
That'd be stupid!
"He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it."
- That's it.
- What do you mean?
He's gone.
That's it.
I knew it!
I can't fucking believe it.
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.
Fuck.
Are you all right?
It was revenge for Billy Batts and a lot of other things.
And that's that.
There was nothing we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home.
I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
"Right away, I knew he didn't want them, and I'd be stuck for the money."
"I only bought them because he wanted them, and now he didn't."
What good are these?
None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not paying for it.
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye."
Stop the drugs.
Which really is quite bloody strange.
But I'll take a shaving and test it later.
Come here.
I'm glad you're uh... moving on from Anna.
It's about time.
"Whoa, whoa."
That's not what's happening.
I still love her.
But does she still love you?
Course she bloody does.
OK.
"Look, I'm just saying."
Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won't work anymore.
"Right, Confucius."
MAN:
I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation.
"It's no secret that in this department, in this police force, there have been sins committed."
And that's why I'm here.
And why my predecessor's enjoying an early retirement.
- Now I'm sure I come with a...
- (DOOR OPENS)
With a certain reputation.
But I like to think I'm fighting on the side of the angels.
It's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I'm doing it.
I want London to be proud of its police force.
And I'll do anything to help make that happen.
(DOOR OPENS)
This is Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Former dancer at the Pleasure Palace.
"Yeah, I know who she is, Doug."
"Why's she next to my victim, Freddie Lau?"
Because she was strangled too.
I didn't think I would care.
"You know, I had a plan."
I wasn't even gonna look at him.
"And when I realized he wasn't coming at all,"
I just got this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.
He doesn't even want to see me.
Ugh!
I just hate that he can make me feel like that.
I know.
That's the worst.
At least when my birth mom balls
"I can tell myself it's 'cause she's a drug addict, right?"
Jealous.
Don't hate.
"I did kinda want to see him, though."
Just once.
Just to know.
"Hey, uh, do you have any plans tonight?"
"Um... no, why?"
Why do you care?
Are you so shallow that you're afraid your social status will be diminished by a big brother who doesn't
Yes.
"No, but really, Jesus and Emma are going to some all-ages show tonight at the Groundspace to see this band that Emma's friend is in."
"Now, Callie wants to come, but because Wyatt's out of town,"
I'm going with her so she doesn't feel like a third wheel.
- So why do you need me?
- We need a ride.
I feel so loved.
Um...
"I don't know, why don't you ride with Emma?"
"We're trying not to be third and fourth wheels, remember?"
- You have to come.
"- I'm going to get a farm, maybe something simple,"
"I'm going to start a practice, a fertility clinic"
"Dr. Conner, helping bring light into the world."
The only thing I need is Natasha.
Ah!
"I remember where it is, it's this way!"
Let's get a drink.
I'm so totally weirded out right now.
- It was so weird!
"- Oh, come on, it happens."
- Peter was defending him!
- Who?
- The jackass.
"- Oh, the jackass."
"He said it was an ""accident""."
"Well, that's a way of looking at it, or it's criminal negligence causing death."
Exactly.
Why didn't I say that?
"Well, my guess is that there's plenty of weirdness to come."
What?
You're moving to Dallas with a man you barely know.
"It's going to be a voyage of discovery, that's for sure."
I gotta get downstairs.
I'm going to try to get your brother's job back for him.
Anybody hear from him?
"Sandy hasn't heard from him, neither has Zoe."
"OK, it's just been a couple of days, give him some time to cool off,"
- then if I can just...
"- He's not cooling off, Dad."
He's in a crack den somewhere.
You don't know that.
None of us know that.
"I have no problem with that, Mr. President, as long as we realize we are working against a clock."
I want all departments present to work up an open versus covert containment strategy and report back to me in 30 minutes.
"In the meantime, I want Health Services to issue guidelines, but only to be distributed internally."
That is all.
I'll be in my office.
David.
"Give us a second, please, Aaron."
"Of course, sir."
Secret Service just received a phone call from the west Los Angeles police department.
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.
All signs point to a heart attack.
It isn't possible.
"Well, apparently, it is."
You told me Sherry was on her way over there about an hour ago.
She changed her mind.
Made some phone calls from her car.
Came straight back here.
"David, is that what she told you?"
Yeah.
And where is she now?
Resting.
"Aaron, take me to Sherry."
"Yes, sir."
She's right this way.
Hasn't your shift ended?
I stayed on.
"I sense it's a difficult day, and I wanted to be here for you."
- I appreciate that.
"- Right in there, sir."
Sherry.
They don't understand anyway.
"Excuse me, sir."
Are you saying you're going to recognize Red China?
Thatwould cost us our strongestsupport.
"No, I can do this because I spentmywhole career... building anti-Communist credentials."
"If Kennedy orJohnson tried it, they'd have crucified them, and rightfully so."
"Damned risky, Mr. President."
Why don'twe wait until the second term?
"- This will get us a second term, John."
- This will getme a second term.
"Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism, there's no history."
Nixon was born to do this.
Give history a nudge.
- Come on.
I
"- Hear, hear."
"I mean, if Cambodia doesn'twork we'll bomb Hanoi ifwe have to."
That's right.
"And if necessary, I'll drop the big one."
We have to entertain the possibility.
Goddamn it.
I Who cooked this damn steak?
"Manolo, there's blood all over my plate."
Take it away.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Are you all right?
Yeah.
"My brother, Harold, was the same age as those kids, John."
- Tuberculosis got him.
"- Come on, itwasn'tyourfault."
The soldiers were kids too.
They just panicked.
That may help you at the bottom end.
"But at the top end, it means earlier, you know, David."
So I wish we could do better for you.
Your patience is gonna be tried.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"There is, but it ain't-- the movies-- at least,"
"In our movies, the shooting schedule, it means very little,"
Because things happen.
"Shit happens, you know."
So you got to let me know if there's some problem.
You know what I mean?
"Hopefully, things will be better as we go on with this thing."
"But there are gonna be unexpected things, and--"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
It won't happen.
I'd love it.
"No one would like it more than I,"
But I don't think we will get it.
I just am afraid we will not get it.
"This stuff, we had a lot of actors."
"So maybe, you know-- maybe tomorrow"
Will be a little easier.
I don't know.
[Laughs] He cant' leave.
I told him to dye his hair.
"I told you I needed to make his hair black,"
Because otherwise it looked like-- people
Was saying it's Tromaville.
But now I don't know where he is.
We're late again.
"Every day, it's late."
"It's fucking-- we're shooting exteriors, right?"
"Stenz worked for the CIA, right?"
Right.
If we can track the way that Walker contacted..
"these guys, we can figure out how to stop them."
How do you propose we do that?
Keep an eye on Caulfield.
"Wait, what?"
Hi.
I'm Carol.
I'm not supposed to talk to you right now.
Run a database search on the guys in that building.
"CIA, NSA, everything you've got."
"Okay, listen, Walker's not doing this for the money, trust me."
There is something else going on.
"I can't do that, ma'am."
On the worst day that our country has ever had..
you could be the key to figuring all of this out.
Couldotherwisenotaccomplishthat  is take back the White House.
I'm gonna have to get that out.
When did you become a doctor all of a sudden?
"Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it."
Talk to me about your daughter.
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.
She even tried to get me to vote for you.
You didn't vote for me?
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.
She was like 3 when I enlisted.
And to be honest with you..
I was probably just running from my marriage.
"Right after I deployed, Emily was watching TV.."
I ran away from home to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.
I thought you looked familiar.
Got plans for mother's day?
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.
It's supposed to be my day and he gets all the fun.
"That's okay, when he's older,"
I'll let him make it up to me.
A little guilt goes a long way.
How about you?
Cemetery.
"- Oh, I'm sorry."
- Thanks.
I lost mine too.
Still hurts.
I am not so good at losing family.
Who is?
What's weird is that it didn't hit until I picked out her burial dress.
I pictured her while buying it...
Not knowing it would...
"You know, be the one."
"Seems unfair, doesn't it?"
Not knowing things like that.
"Hey, how about spending the day with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?"
Sounds dreamy.
"Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?"
Armed robbery.
"Oh yeah, that's right, because me and Jackson had you pegged as a paedophile."
"Ain't that right, Jackson?"
"Shit, probably guilty of that too."
"Hey, I don't see what's so fucking funny."
Y'all clowning this motherfucker like it's some big joke.
Well it ain't!
Just a minute.
What's your name?
"McKendrick, Sir."
The British Army appreciates your generosity in donating gratuitous lessons in hand-to-hand combat.
"As it happens, the army's already prepared a manual based on some actual experience in real fighting."
In future you will cooperate with your instructors and refrain from exhibitions of circus gymnastics.
Is that clear?
"Perfectly, sir."
Who's that new geezer over there?
"Don't ask me, I've never seen him before."
He don't seem to like our Canada.
Fall out.
"Carry on, Sergeant."
"Very good, Sir."
If you can.
Next man.
"How long is it now, Flash?"
I was born up here.
That sergeant must be Dracula's big brother.
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
You ain't even queasy.
"How come, Canada?"
I'm a rollercoaster man.
"They've completed, Sir."
"Thank you, that was most instructive."
"Thank you, Sir."
If a little bothered.
"Excuse me, Sir?"
Yeah.
As you've only just arrived and I've er...
You're saying?
"Well, somebody who'd been here some time might be useful to you, Sir."
They're gonna fly him out at 1400 hours.
"If we abort the transport, Salt's husband dies."
"Letting it continue, it's a big risk."
There's not a lot of upside.
You said it yourself.
She's a decorated Agent.
She's dedicated her life to the Bureau.
"Mejia's capture cost hundreds of lives, and thousands of man hours."
"We put him out there, we risk losing it all."
"Okay, no one's personal situation can justify that."
We know what their plan is.
So we let Salt keep going with it.
We make the cartel believe everything's going their way.
Escort Mejia right up to the hand-over if we have to.
"And in the meantime, we look for George."
"The minute we grab him, we pull out Mejia."
"John, you want to chime in here?"
I agree with Bryan.
That's why I'm standing here.
You're on Mejia with Dave and Rem.
Do not let him out of your sight.
"Bryan and Scott, the two of you go find George Salt."
- When does the cartel plane touch down?
- Six hours.
[Suspenseful music]

♪
"Listen up, everyone."
Our ODNI friends and I are in the van with Mejia.
FBI team will be in the follow vehicle...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
I thought FBI was taking Mejia.
Thank you.
you killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but lionel luthor left a lot of damage in his wake, clark."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"Lionel did a lot of things, chloe, but he'd never commit suicide."
"I don't know about that, clark."
He was beyond disturbed
- when he came to the daily planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
"He was pretty rattled the last time I saw him, too."
He was desperate to give me something... a locket.
What does a locket have to do with lionel luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
When I was a boy...
- Or a CD.
You didn't know what to do.
"No, in homeschool club, you get tapes only."
- So you never had a locker?
- No.
Or I got...
I felt embarrassed.
That's kind of the best part of high school.
- Having a locker?
- Yeah.
- I never used my locker.
- You see it on Saved by the Bell.
"I don't know if they can clear that, can they?"
- Can I say Saved by the...?
- Saved by the:
"Yeah, you could say that."
Can you see beyond looks?
I see a bad future for my daughter.
How are you returning?
Jai's picking her up in a helicopter.
- We'll drop you
I'm ashamed!
He claims he's building the fastest car in the world!
Here?
What's lacking here?
- We needn't suffer like this
"Problem is, you've lived comfortably."
You got no idea how difficult life is
Why should I care?
My parents can give us a life of comfort
"For your comforts, not mine."
- You don't care for me
If my determination is selfishness do whatever you wish
Are you giving me an ultimatum?
- I'm trying to make you see reason
I don't want to see reason I'm not living in this junkyard
This is home!
Not junkyard!
- Even that line is your brother's
Hello Shekhar
I'm Jai.

I Take Nothing for free
"You are wrong,I only know your name, and I am not interested in knowing you."
Alex.
"Where where you, I was looking for you."
Adriana
Its just that I came out for a stroll on this wonderful night.
"to take in the fresh air, and to gaze upon the moon."
A moon in a blue bikini?
"No...you are wrong, Adriana."
"Excuse me, Madame, I forgot my bracelet."
Valet?
"Please give this to Mr. Dinamo, at the casino."
No more bets.

I will teach you how to win at this game.
You don't say. it seems I always loose when you are along.
seventeen.
"Listen to me, I am an expert."
No more bets.
seven red
"Oh my, that is the only time I did not play seven red and now it comes up."
"and its all your fault for interrupting me, just when I was going to play seven red."
"Do not worry, we will win now, on seventeen."
"No more bets, ten black."
"Ah, so you are quite the expert, eh?"
Now you will believe.
Tokens please.
"Unfortunate in games of chance, fortunate in games of love."
Lets put that theory to the test.
"Mr. Dinamo, a message thanks seventeen black"
We won!
"We won, Alex!"
what?
The heavens must be saying that everything will be fine.
Nuna!
Nuna!
(Nuna - older sister)
Who is it?
"My sister is acting very strangely, she can't breathe."
How can that be?
"Put her on oxygen, and inject her with epinephrine."
Yes.
Does she have asthma?
"I'm not sure, but she is allergic to flour."
She ate food containing flour today.
It's possible that her allergy caused anaphylactic shock.
"Her blood pressure is 70/40, and her pulse is only 41."
Her oxygen saturation is only at 70%.
"Nuna, Nuna, Mi Jin Noona..."
(Nuna - older sister)
"Then we'll leave it to you, Doctor."
"Let's not be too worried, let's go out and wait."
"Oh, why is there such a thing!"
"Kim Na Na, can't I go first?"
What did I do?
I don't know them.
Do you think I'd ask you to bring me here if my leg didn't hurt?
Ah... seriously.
Mi Jin!
What if your father comes back late?
You should clean the house.
Make some food to eat with your brother.
"You clearly knew that flour would cause problems, so why did you still eat bread?"
"Eonni, you don't know what happened."
Our water and gas were cut off.
"- Mom, I'm not going to be alone"
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me
I'm not going to object.
But you will need his permission
Ask him when he's home
"God, please keep Babuji in a nice mood"
It's just beer.
It's over there.
- I told you.
The store is shut
Get out
Got the beer?
- Didn't find any
Can't even do such a simple job?
- That was an angry man
I'll get it.
- You won't
Can I have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut
My head is about to crack up!
It's sinusitis
"If I can't find an Aspirin, I'll faint."
All the other stores are shut
Please let me have one Aspirin.
One Hindustani ought to help another
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are
I'm feeling bad about forcing you to open your store for a small medicine
I'd like to buy some other things from you
I'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.
"Listen, Dalton, what do ya have on this?"
"I just got here, Judy."
I don't know...
Give me a break.
"Come on, Dalton..."
You're here.
"It's gotta mean one thing, the exterminator."
"The first one was johnathon minor, age 37, male Caucasian."
"Forty-two arrests for promoting prostitution, assault, rape, white slavery, corrupting the morals of minors."
Lately he specialized in young boys.
He was convicted twice and served a total of 18 months.
"Jesus, it looks like he got hit by napalm."
Most of that's from the burning mattress.
The fireman says it's like that every time someone falls asleep smoking.
Step this way...
I'll show you our next attraction.
Jesus.
Who was he?
He was a state senator from new Jersey.
"Hey, Dalton?"
"Yes, Steve?"
I have the autopsy on the third ghetto ghoul and the print out that you ordered.
I also have a telephone message from the CIA.
- The c.I.A?
- Yeah.
An agent shore called.
"He wants a briefing on the ""the exterminator"" case."
He says he cleared it with the commissioner.
"Here, he left his number."
"- Thanks, Steve."
- All right.
[Phone ringing]
What's the problem?
- It's your sister.
- I just got off the phone with her.
Not Kitty.
- What do you mean you knew?
- I ran into her at Holly's house.
You didn't think it was worth mentioning?
- I didn't think you wanted to hear it.
- You were right.
"- Well, what was she like?"
- I don't know.
She...
She seemed fine.
How long is she staying?
"If this is just a visit, drop it."
It's not just a visit.
She dropped out of college and was living with a friend.
"When that didn't work out, she moved back home."
Indefinitely.
Sounds like Holly raised a real winner.
"Despite your opinion of Holly or Rebecca, the question remains, what are we going to do?"
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Not with everything that's been going on here.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- What I mean, Tommy, is do you think this business with Holly can go on if Mom finds out about Rebecca?"
This is exactly why I didn't want to say anything.
Holly is working here.
What if Nora runs into Rebecca?
What if your mother asks questions?
I say we tell her.
"I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, Saul."
- You've always despised the Wu-tang.
And you're afraid that someday we'll overtake you.
You...
So you used your medicine to poison my master.
Nonsense!
You're scared that our power will surpass yours.
"Nonsense, don't flatter yourself."
Our Wu-tang...
Someone is trying to pin the blame on us.
Then where did His Highness get your medicine?
Where is your proof that the medicine is ours?
His Highness said so.
His Highness?
Then why did he lock you up with the crazy women?
Because I'm guilty of killing my master.
Your master threw himself onto your sword.
And now His Highness wants to learn your secrets.
I won't tell him!
Master told me before he died not to let the Tartars have the secrets of Wu-tang.
The Shaolin would never reveal our secrets either.
"You want to see the Wu-tang destroyed, hence your trickery."
Brother!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Mr. Chao!
Mr. Hong!
"Fung-wu, even if we were to learn your 8-divine sword, she already knows Chin Kang Fist."
Chin Kang Fist?
"Jun-kit, you taught her the Chin Kang Fist to help me, but you still haven't taught me."
You haven't learned it?
Did you teach him?
- I!

"Mrs. Quick, no!"
"Mrs. Quick, we've got to get you out of here."
"Now don't get too upset, okay?"
There's got to be a simple explanation.
"It's a bee sting, isn't it?"
Okay.
"I thought I heard buzzing earlier, but I attributed it to my tinnitus."

Everything will be fine.
I just need one minute.
Got him.
I knew he couldn't resist that thumbnail- sized Toblerone.
Thank goodness.
Zap him back so we can go home.
Right.
But first a little good-natured torture.
Hilda.
Where am I?
Um... we found you wandering out in the street.
I-I think you may have hit your head.
Do you feel all right?
Do you perhaps feel like you now understand what it's like to be the little guy in constant fear of unfeeling giants?
No.
I feel strong.
"In fact,"
I feel like I could withstand a nuclear holocaust.
I suppose this means you're going to go ahead and build your Everything Emporium now.
What?
"If he gets out of line again, I will be back."
Keep it!
Ahem.
"Excuse me, Mr. Reed."
Mrs. Laws is waiting for you.
You wanted to see me?
"Well, you've done it this time, Mr. Reed."
What did I do?
Look.
"Louis, what happened to you?"
You.
You're the one filling his head up with all this junk.
"We have taught this boy to stand up for himself... to fight the bullies, but he doesn't listen to us."
"He said, ""Mr. Reed teaches us differently."
"""Mr. Reed said that we should run from the bullies..."""
"and that Mr. Reed encourages the smaller kids... to practice running, hiding, and eating their lunch quickly!"
"I didn't say ""quickly."" I said ""rapidly."""
- I was trying to help.
"- Well, thanks to your help... every bully at this school is beating him up."
A younger girl did this to him!
"Mr. Reed, have you ever stood up to anybody?"
"Or better yet, have you ever had your butt..."
"Mrs. Williams, I'll handle it from here."
"Mr. Reed, may I remind you... that you are just a substitute teacher?"
No more of this.
I was simply talking about how life is.
I don't care.
Teach only from the books and not your philosophy on life.
That's all for now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
He wasn't exactly fond of his mother.
"What's the opposite of an oedipus complex, do you think?"
Sir?
"He was reading Freud, who said the aim of all life is death--matricide."
Could he really have killed his mother?
"These, um..."
Background notes on Spencer:
"Well-connected-- journalism, treasurer for the friends of national Spain."
No criminal convictions?
No.
None that I could find.
What do you make of him?
I'm not sure.
"I'd say a man has to be quite brave to hold the opinions he does, especially at a time like this."
You admire him?
I don't think he's a fool.
"I mean, you read the medical report of..."
"Isaac wolf, the man who got beaten up?"
"I don't think you can blame Spencer for that, sir."
He knew nothing about it.
How do you know?
He told me...
And I believe him.
Margaret Ellis' will-- he had the most to gain from it.
"I still think that Spencer was the likely target, sir."
All right.
[Clock ticking]
Sam:
Arthur Ellis-- who'd want to kill him?
Foyle:
"I don't know, but you probably do."
"My guess is, he probably saw something."
- Me!
Oh.
"Okay, I'm heading out there."
"If you need anything, if there's a crisis, if you have a question-"
"Jack, you're 1 1 feet away."
Don't worry.
I can handle these animals.
- That's what she thinks.
- I heard that!
[ Laughing ] Girl is like a flipping bat.
"- Now go be pretty, okay?"
- Okay.
"Go, go."
"We're fine, really."
[ Sighs ] Waste of time.
Let's get this over with quickly.
- Where do I start?
"- Actually, table eight just sent compliments to the chef."
- [ No Audible Dialogue ]
- Gotta do what I gotta do.
Everyone enjoying themselves tonight?
[Jack Narrating ] Every chef will tell you that he feels out of place... ifhe's not sweating over a hot stove.
But the truth is you can get used to the sweet life out front pretty damn quickly.
I just always had this real need to please people with food.
"I just think it's, like, uh, a gift that I have, as God made me."
"Hey, uh, if your father calls... tell him that I'm working the floor like he asked, okay?"
"-Yeah, you're really taking one for the team."
"-Actually, I'm shooting for two."
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
"No, I'm not."
This table needs a complimentary everything.
Okay.
"Oh, Dad's here."
I gotta go.
"I love you, Mommy."
[Karen] I love you too.
- Hey.
- You set to go?
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.
"You can call the Romans a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them."
"Okay, well, not really stupid, but, all right, they built roads, and they had a million armies, but all they did was enslave and conquer people."
- What about their system of law?
"- Oh, great."
"They introduced law to barbarians, but how did the barbarians feel about that?"
"All their art was copied from the Greeks, all their philosophies were stolen from the Greeks."
The gods were stolen from the Greeks.
They just gave them different names.
Think of one thing that they did that was original.
They didn't even invent Christianity.
"If I was a Roman, I would be so ashamed of myself, I couldn't show my face in the Coliseum."
[Lily] Pasta's ready!
"Eli, you have to save me from Dad!"
I'll set the table.
Don't worry.
"Thank you, Jessie."
"We're gonna get through this, whatever happens."
"Rick, whatever happens."
Did she actually cook for us?
That's pretty cool.
- [knock on door] - l got it.
Cook County Sheriff's Department.
We have a warrant to search.
"Very clever, very careful, and then...a bomb hit the building where he was working and everyone was killed."
We thought...
But he wasn't dead.
He was buried in the rubble under a stairwell.
"He survived, you see... for three days in the dark until they dug him out."
"And there was a girl in there, too."
But she was dead.
- They were trapped.
- For three days?
We sent him to a psychiatrist... because he was...different afterwards.
Still good at his job...
"almost too good, but different."
I often feared what might have happened down there.
"But the psychiatrist said he was fit to work and I needed him, so..."
Where is he now?
(Sighs)
There was a fire.
We found his body.
"His signet ring, his keys."
"No face, of course."
"I chose not to pursue it, not to question it."
I was almost relieved when I heard.
I'll let you have all the paperwork I've got on him.
"There's not much, I'm afraid."
There's been some sort of accident.

This court is in recess until there is order.
"If ever there was a justifiable killing, this is it."
It's still murder.
Catchings caused the death of Obediah's wife.
The law allows you to defend your family.
Twenty years later?
The law doesn't allow for that.

You can't hang him.
He doesn't have long to live.
-What?
-He's got consumption.
Nathan told me he doesn't have much time.
The court is now in session.

- Remote access?
"- No, sir."
We've looked three times.
"He developed this machine, it only stands to reason he knows it better than us."
"Sir, I viewed the schematics, the data, the results."
We work together.
You talk to her.
Sounds like date night didn't go so well.
No.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I just feel like the walls are closing in a little bit."
Yeah.

"Well, maybe you should go in there, you know, in person?"
"- Yeah, sure."

Couldn't get air into my lungs.

Know the best way of controlling that?
Singing.
"If you sing to yourself, it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
Sing what?
Dunno.
"Not sure the lyrics make much difference overall, Calum."
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
Much darker than you think.
"Like, he freely admits he was high."
And once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that... ..the curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
"That, or La Bamba."
"Remember what you need to dance the Bamba, Calum."

And I know you know that we're not exactly on the same page on this.
"But I don't know what to do, B."
"If we let you have the surgery and it causes more damage, are you gonna blame us when you're older because we let you make this decision when you were only 16?"
"And if we don't, are we getting in the way of your dream?"
- I would never blame you.
- But I would.
"I'm your mom, B, ok?"
I'm supposed to protect you.
"And, uh  that's a lot harder... these days."
I don't know what the right choice is.
"So if you want the surgery, I will talk to your dad, and we will consult with some other specialists so that we get a better picture of what we're looking at."
Ok?
We're not saying yes.
"But, uh, we're not saying no either."
Um...
I think I'm gonna wait.
"Yeah, maybe... maybe the feeling will come back on its own, right?"
That's what you want?
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.

Yes.
I have it right here.

"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"

"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."

Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
"Hello, Higginbotham."
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
"I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better."
"- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?"
"- Thanks, Cutter."
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
"I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement."
"Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?"
"We can look after that, old boy."

He managed to escape with a group offellow prisoners.
They got to our lines with a lot of arms seized from the enemy.

Theywere arrested.
The arms were confiscated.
They accused my brother oftreason.

It's 120 pounds overweight.
"And when it was booked into Marseille, it was 4,795."
That's still 120 pounds overweight.

- I am Mr. Devereaux.
Why?
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux... but we get a lot of cars here at night, and sometimes it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
We would now have one of our own as a member.
-Who's this?
-This is Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.
You know what I mean.
"He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it."
What do you mean?
He's gone.
He's gone.
And that's it.
I knew it!
I can't fuckin' believe it.
-They fucking whacked him.
-Fuck.
Are you all right?
"It was revenge for Billy Batts, and a lot of other things."
And that's that.
And there was nothing that we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open-coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had gotten.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and pick up some stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
Right away I knew he didn't want them and I'd be stuck for the money.
I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them and now he didn't want them.
What the fuck good are these things?
"–Well, what do you wanna do about it?"
I went through Tio's place.
I found his business ledger detailing payments made to a landlord.
I wanna check them against Vic's cash deposits in his bank accounts.
I need your authorization.
"Claudette, Vic's one of us."
I got a dead drug dealer.
I got a suspect who's probably skipped town... and the only person who can shed some light on it... is an uncooperative cop with a bad rep.
"You want me to let this case just slip away, son?"
I.A.D on Danny's shooting.
Draw up the authorization form.
I'll take a look at it.
Everything looking good for my officer?
–Getting all the cooperation you need?
–Pardon?
"'Cause if anybody's giving you any interference, I can help."
Ah.
Thanks.
"Claudette, witness brought in a freshly amputated arm."
"I'm thinking sadomasochist, probably keeping her alive."
–I've got a suspect named Jordan Arnold.
–Let me help you with that.
Thanks.
I can use a sounding board.
Know who lives there?
Cocksucker who cost me my job.
–Fleetwood.
–Yeah.
City paid off the lawsuit: 1.2 mil.
He moved back just a couple months ago.
–Son of a bitch.
–Hey.
So is there an echo in here?
Why him?
Because he's a hero!
So?
"Well, how do you know he's a hero, if he doesn't do anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
Are you trying to put up a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
Johnnie can't go in the water!
He's injured.
Badly injured.
Manly slash on the biceps for Christ sake!
He's...he's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"""Mrs.Rosen Lily story"" and you won't let them do anything."
Then go to Dunkirk.
And Johnnie pirates them home.
They are girls!
Here girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to have by him!
Huh?
Tom?
Cab.
"And back in there if Viper just even gets her nose through the office door while we are out, you are sacked!"
"And don't think I won't know, I can smell her shaving cream on the wind."
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up."
I heard furniture.
"Angels of the sea, across the waves, two to Dunkirk, three to Dunkirk, Dunkirk O'bust, busts Dunkirk."
"Somewhere in the world, there is bullet with that man's name on."
Why hasn't he been called up?
Apart from Parfitt's too old.
"But, Buckley?"
"- He died, Dad."
"Well, he should have spoke up!"
Squeaky wheel!
You're my squeaky wheel.
And you were magnificent.
Sometimes a man's got to do what a man does.
And a man feeds his family!
I'm taking you all to dinner!
- Yeah!
- All right!
"Frank, a restaurant?"
Isn't that a little extravagant right now?
"Oh, we're fine, Sue."
"This might be the adrenaline shot to the heart speaking, but I feel great again!"
"- Ooh, can we eat there?"
"- No, that's a titty bar now, Bill."
Your old man is gonna take you to the fanciest place in town.
"And so, you know, I had nothing better to do,"
"TV was on the fritz, so I figured, yeah, why not?"
I might as well get married.
It's funny when you pretend you hate each other.
Tell us the real story.
- It was such a lovely summer day...
- I'll take this whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.
- Your father looked so handsome.
"Grampa Joe walked me down the aisle and I wore my mother's dress, little Cindy was the flower girl, Monsignor Kreger married us."
- Who?
- He's Father Pat's father.
Long story.
And of course I didn't know then that you three angels were coming.
But I looked at your father
Yes?
"Tat-chi, you have realized the secrets of Shaolin."
"Chief, I think Tat-chi is skilled enough to be our representative."
Amida Buddha!
The Shaolin and Wu-tang parties have both arrived as planned.
"If they can fight each other,"
Your Highness will surely have the advantage.
You'll be the ruler.
Will the two representatives please come out?
Remember to eliminate unnecessary doubts.
Please start the fight!
Stand back!
Shaolin monks say that the Wu-tang school originated from them.
Does the Shaolin still say that?
"Amida Buddha, yes!"
Wu-tang founder San-feng broke our rules and was expelled.
That's enough!
He was expelled because Shaolin was jealous of his ability.
We are the best fighters.
Nonsense!
Wu-tang is too proud!
We're only telling facts.
Please don't argue!
I trust this contest will decide which school is better once and for all.
- Yes!
- Yes!
Who will be the representatives?
Ming-kai!
Tat-chi!
Fung-wu?
Jun-kit?
You!
"If you get picked up now, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in the Hole."
"Yeah, I thought of that."
I don't blame you guys for laying down on me.
"But do something for me, will ya?"
Sure.
"Yeah, what?"
Get out of here.
I don't like the way ya smell.
"Go on, all of ya."
"Come on, beat it."
"I guess I'm a sucker, but I just can't get it out of my nut."
Ross doing all those months in the Hole just to cover up for me.
"But still, he didn't have to, did he?"
"No, he didn't have to."
Remember what Ross' dame said that day about...?
"About Ross and me wanting the same thing all our lives, and he was doing something about it--?"
"Yep, I remember."
What about it?
"I think she had something there, so--"
So what?
So maybe I better do something about it.
Don't be a fool.
If you're picked up--
Shut up!
Where did you ever get the idea I was a fool?
"I broke out of that pen once, didn't I?"
And I can do it again.
"Now, listen, Stacey, you can't-- You heard me, shut up."
"You do the listening, I'll do the talking."
And pay attention.
"Because if there's any slip-up on your part of this, you'll answer to the boys for it."
"Now, here's the gag."
Our whole fucking lives.
- Tito:
"Okay, good night."
- Eddie:
Good night.
Show me the safe.
- I take the money every afternoon--
- Show me the safe or I'll shoot.
- I don't have a safe.
- Show me the safe!
"Don't shoot me, because it's gonna be worse for you."
- Show me the fucking safe!
- The rest of your fucking life...
See here?
The bullet shattered your father's vertebrae right there.
It severed the spinal cord.
And my guess... is that the gun was fired at close range.
- He's lucky to be alive.
- So...?
He'll never walk again.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.
Viejo?
Viejo?
Soy yo.
"Soy yo, Carlos."
"When you're working in a bodega, there's this unwritten rule that when some crazy motheftucker walks into the store to rob you, you treat him like he's king,"
like he has God-given permission to own that fucking bodega.
"You chill and you smile and you hand him the money, then you throw in a pack of Camels, for the road, on the house."
- What are you saying?
- I'll bet you that the old man-- talked trash with the asshole who shot him.
"- Baby, that guy was a nutcase!"
"- He never saw the safe, babe."
That's gotta wear on a man.
That's no excuse.
I let my guard down.
"Hey, you know me, Chris."
I ain't afraid of dying.
"I just don't want to go out like that, strung up like some mangy dog."
I ain't gonna let that happen.
"Oh, no."
"You go messing with a federal marshal, they'll string you up right alongside me."
Chris.
Larabee.
Chris.
"Gentlemen, can you not picture this becoming..."
... thefinestentertainmentemporium in the entire territory?
All I can picture right now is them fixing to take Vin away and hang him.
"Now, son, don't fret."
"Besides, when we rescue him we'll need a fitting place to celebrate."
"So, what say you, boys?"
Are you ready for success?
NATHAN:
"I don't know, Ezra."
"My daddy used to say, ""Best horse you ever saw..."
"... wasasgoodasthemanriding ."""
Pure wisdom.
"Good morning, Luce."
"How have you been, Buck?"
I've missed you.
"All due respect, it doesn't look like you've been missing meals, there, Lucy."
[LUCY giggles]
"Well, it happens when you're going to have a baby."
Hoo!
-Sweet Lucy's gonna have a baby.
As long as I am still wearing a prosecutor's clothes...
I'll do everything to preserve it.
Choi Eung Chan.
Why would you you come here?
!
Our Prosecutor... became like this because he was following you.
Right?
City Hunter!
It's you!
At the site...
Because he was fearlessly running around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor became like that!
You killer!
Hey!
By any means...
I will catch you!
"I promise you, I will catch you!"
Hey!
Let go.
Let go!
Seriously!
Aish
"I came because we lost a precious prosecutor, but"
I think I should just go
I found that Chairman Cheon Jae Man and President Choi Eung Chan have something going on.
"After the President assumed office,"
Hae Won got the bid to construct the bridge over Minja Expressway.
"For that, there was a controversy over the favoritism."
"Right before the presidential election,"
Haewon moved a pile of money.
And that was used for presidential election.
And that contract was the payback.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.
Maybe?
"Come on, the guy's in a hurry."
He wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna play games.
"Look, he's one ofthe shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
"He could see a couple of shows, visit the top ofthe Empire State Building."
"Don'tjerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot oftime setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major-league game, Sal."
"One thing I learned: move calmly, move cautiously, you'll never be sorry."
"Look, I've been damn careful up to now."
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin' all over you like fleas.
- He'll take the deal somewhere else.
- Let him take it and find out how easy it is... ..to put together a half a million in cash.
There's no hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We can make the switch in an hour!
"Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll split ifwe don't move."
This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.
"What about you, Sal?"
Are you everything they say you are?
Maybe we can take that walk afterall.
Sounds great.
Aren't they amazing?
Aren't they the best French fries you've ever tasted?
I'd give them a silver medal.
Silver medal?
"- What are you, a German judge?"
"- No, but I've had better."
- We're gonna do a taste test.
"- Fine, if you go by the Printer's."
- Where is this place?
"- In Bruges, in Flanders..."
- it's probable in Belgium.
"- Yes, I know."
I see someone with you or with a bunch of girl friends.
- I went by myself.
- Did you?
- How many countries did you visit?
- I traveled the world.
I graduated early and got a grant from my college... to do a photo essay... as part of my thesis and that was incredible!
That is amazing.
I can't believe you did all that by yourself.
I'm so impressed!
So... were you scared?
They tried to stripsearch me in Indonesia.
"I got a little heat from my bubblelicious probe but in... other letters, smooth sailing."
And did you make...
Did you make any disposable friends?
"A couple, but no crazy night with Ethan Hawke in Vienna... but I still have this Moroccan family who writes to me."
- I have the best pictures of them.
- Really?
Then I'd love to see them.
I wrote this song about
An 11-year-old girl who wanted to be a rock star.
"But she also wanted a normal life, so"
She pretended to be somebody else and
"That was great for a little while, but"
She's 17 now and life is even more complicated.
And she just doesn't want to pretend anymore.
Her name is Miley Stewart.
[Audience gasps]
Whoa.
Take that kitty cat flushing a toilet!
[Laughing]
Anyway.
"It's been a long time since I've sung without my friend here, so"
I hope you like it.
"[Singing ""Wherever I Go""] Oh, yeah."
Here we are now.
Everything's about to change.
We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday.
A chapter ending but the story is only just begun.
A page is turning for everyone.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
Wherever I go.
So excited I can barely even catch my breath.
We have each other to lean on for the road ahead.
This happy ending is the start of all our dreams.
And I know your heart is with me.
- Is this a trick?
"- Nope, just, you know, wanted to do something nice for someone other than myself for a change."
"So hopefully, I don't know, we can all hang out, we can be friends."
Friends.
If you want.
"Anyways, enjoy the show."
"- Do you want this closed, or...?"
- Yeah.
"Thanks for letting me stay over, and thanks for breakfast."
"You finally learned how to make French toast, huh?"
"Mm, anytime."
Happy to have the company.
- I know what you mean.
"- Yeah, what do you know about being lonely?"
Hmm.
"Well, let's see."
My stepfather blackmailed me into living with my mom.
"My mom shipped my little sister off to boarding school, oh, and my boyfriend spent the entire summer with a girl, who may or may not have been pregnant with his child,"
- and now that he is back he won't talk to me thanks to D.J.
- Who's D.J.?
"Doesn't even matter since he's not talking to me, either."
"Mariss, honey?"
You ready to go?
I'm gonna go get my stuff.
Back to the gulag.
She knows I heard that.
It's a little game we play.
Mm-hmm.
So how's Caleb?
"Fantastic, never better."
"- Facing prison, we could lose everything."
- So you gonna divorce him and take his kids?
She was everything to me...
Everything.
Stanley is 22?
Yes.
"We were courting when Peggy found she was expecting, so, yes,"
I did the decent thing.
But that doesn't change anything.
I'd have married her anyway.
"I loved her, always did."
Were you aware of the changes your wife made to her will?
Spencer is a swine.
"I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen to me, and so now..."
Half the hotel.
How do you expect me to go on living when...
Everything I care about has been taken away from me?
Do you cure your own meat at the hotel?
What's that got to do with anything?
Would I be right in thinking that?
I don't know.
Yes.
Margaret was in charge of the kitchen.
Thank you.
"Christopher, I'm afraid I've got some bad news."
"Sir Ernest bannerman, the mp at the white feather, he's managed to pull rank."
"He's made some phone calls, and the long and the short of it is I had to release the lot."
Ok.
They've all gone?
"Yes, they went this morning, except Spencer."
"He's here, and he wants to talk to you."
All right.
"How can I help you, Mr. Spencer?"
"You're holding my assistant, and unless you're going to charge him,"
- Can't you just do what I say?
"- Of course, dear Anna."
Don't I always do what you want?
"Well, just get going..."
"Morning, Mrs Ziemann."
Is everything fine?
"Selma, you shouldn't place the child here in the fumes."
It's so unhealthy.
"Outside it's too cold, in the stairwell too draughty, and here it's too fumy!"
Where shall I take the little mite?
"Well, maybe you can make yourself useful at least!"
"Come, help Mrs Ziemann with the basket."
I need to lie down for a bit.
"Are you not feeling well, Mrs John?"
"Oh, Mr Hassenreuter, it's the usual, you know..."
The child is coughing!
It comes from smoking.
"Mother smokes all day and because the child coughs, she cannot sleep."
and I'm fed up with it all.
That's tragic!
It makes one ask oneself who the real mother is.
"Well put, Mr Hassenreuter, and so true!"
Sometimes it seems to me as if I gave birth to it myself.
"Are you looking for me, Anna?"
"Man, did you give me a fright, Bruno!"
Where have you been?
Upstairs.
What are you doing here?
As if I didn't suspect that we'd need rat poison again.
I've just brought some from the drugstore.
You lay it out tomorrow so we'll get rid of that plague.
"Using the Lisol, you mop up here."
"David, my wife Sally."
"David, hi."
Pleasure.
Pleased to meet you.
Shall we get you home?
(Door opens)
Just passing.
Mm-hm.
Am I correct in remembering you handled a drug case two years ago with a key witness who's a guy called Shrimpton?
Stanley Shrimpton?
You got a conviction on the basis of his testimony.
That's what you've come here to talk about?
"Yeah, I think I might be defending a genuinely innocent guy."
"I mean, an actually innocent guy."
Why did you go to bed with me if you didn't want me?
Hmm?
Was it just about landing me?
"Once I'm flapping about on the deck, I'm just a dead fish."
"What are you talking about landing you, Red?"
We'd already done it before.
"So you tell me, then."
Why did you want me?
"Because at that precise moment, there was no-one more beautiful on Earth and I had to have you."
"No, no, no, you're so full of shit!"
OK.
"Because I was drowning, and because you were a lifebuoy and you were in the same wet place."
Stanley Shrimpton.
A piece of vermin who got off child abuse charges by becoming a police informant.
"Now, go, will you?"
"Thanks, Red."
"OK, I'm sorry."
I was bored stupid.
Police have arrested a man and charged him with the murders of five women in London.
"Gerald Wiggins, a railway ticket inspector, was apprehended at his home yesterday"
Inspector Lawley of Scotland Yard said that Wiggins appears to be mentally frail
Police believe they have found evidence linking him to all five murdered women.
The petrol and fuel oil shortages at home maybe worsening...
"That's it, isn't it?"
He's gone.
"Lucy, I'm so sorry."
It's not your fault.
Did he take anyone from the train?
Not that we know of.
No -one's been reported missing.
- The police must have scared him off.
- That's something.
That's a lot.
- That's a life you saved.
"- I know, but he's still out there."
We still don't know who he is.
"I do know who he is, actually."
(Clears her throat) He's Malcolm Crowley.
- You got a name from Cavendish?
- Who's Cavendish?
He headed up a classified department during the war.
He trained Crowley.
Jean found him.
So we have a name and whatever else is in there.
Bloody hell.
- How's your friend?
- Recovering.
- What happened to her?
- Harry beat her.
It's not the first time.
REED:
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
REED:
They were opening a vortex.
They would have escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
If you'd explained to them why we were here... you might have avoided a fire-fight.
"With all due respect, sir, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
ARCHER:
Archer to Major Hayes.
HAYES:
"Go ahead, Captain."
ARCHER:
"Report to my Ready Room, on the double."
HAYES:
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as Tactical Officer.
ARCHER:
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain!
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
ARCHER:
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.
"Xiamu, since we were young until now, have I not been with you?"
"When you graduated, when you entered the university, also... when you get married, I'll be with you giving my blessings!"
"You will do the same to me, won't you?"
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you for the attendance!
Thanks a lot!
Good!
Continue!
"Qu Weiran, the love child is finally legitimated!"
Love child?
"People from Haide Industry said, his father had an older son with his wife."
"The older son likes to exploration, and got himself killed in a snow mountain two years ago."
So Qu Weiran was naturally promoted to be a project manager.
Qu is such a lucky guy!
"Yes, he is."
"However, the point is..."
"Qu Weiran with his Bentley, is less adorable than our Zhang Jingwu with his broken car!"
- My car is fine!
- Pervert!
It was just a kiss!
Why did you scold me?
Don't you take it personally too quickly?
- I was referring to Qu Weiran.
- Oh...
He is a pervert!
Did you know?
He messed with and occupied woman before.
"So the woman's boyfriend went to his house, beat him up and broke few ribs of him!"
- Good!
- Really!
Don't worry!
That's just how life is though.
- A marvelous woman with a marvelous voice and a marvelous song.
Nora and the Pope dancers!
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
I'll play along for a little while.
To take advantage of this would be wise.
As long as I'm a part of the game.
"- If I were to leave, I wouldn't know where to go."
"If I order a schnitzel, she says I'm too fat."
I should get myself something vegetarian.
Why is it my mother's business what I eat?
- I don't get involved with her life.
I don't tell her what she should and shouldn't eat.
You also have a mother who's sticking her nose in everything?
... for such a long time.
Shall I leave?
- It couldn't do any harm to have men and money on your side.
"Here, just give her a ten."
She doesn't need money.
What's with you!
?
Why are you taking my money?
What are you doing here?
He shouldn't be giving her money.
She doesn't need money!
"Please, goodbye, and thank you."
Here comes another one.
That was Nora and the Pope dancers!
"Now, ladies and gentlemen..."
"And now, yet another dream comes true."
- It's finally here!
What we've all been waiting for.
They're gonna lock you away.
You come here to get my statement?
Huh?
Expecting me to... say I'm innocent?
I was gonna make that boy walk.
I was gonna put him on that back road.
"Leave him to the boogeyman to rip him apart, or return him to whatever ungodly dirt he came from."
And if the road couldn't do it...
"I'd do it myself, 'cause sometimes that's just what you got to do."
"Well, you've done enough."
Ah.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
Asshole.
Ken Mersey didn't go home last night.
He's been reported missing this morning.
Boys need stupid things to do.
That's how their mamas wire them.
"Well, his mama wasn't no electrician."
Explains the dim bulb.
It's not like you to be so funny so early.
Well...
I always figured Ken Mersey liked you a whole lot more than you liked him.
Maybe he just don't want to show his face.
"He's missing, I'm worried."
"It doesn't have to be so black-and-white, Lilly."
For fuck's sake.
All I'm saying is that... maybe he's gone because he wants to be gone.
"This ain't hardly about Ken, is it?"
This is about Wallace coming back.
"Hey, do you want to take care of this?"
"Oh, Jerry, you're just aching for coffee, aren't you?"
Here.
"Hey, Ken."
- What's up?
- You're getting skinnier on me.
Yeah.
Where's my money?
Your friend was late four hours last week.
And he's late again today.
I see... go have a talk with him.
The talk is happening right now.
You're going nowhere until Clive gets here.
"# Yeah, the kids call him Conejo #"
# 'Cause he was fast on his feet #
# And he was quick with his fists If he had trouble in the streets #
# But when his old man would hit the bottle #
# He'd kick Conejo's ass #
# And with a wounded heart Conejo swore he'd outrun his past #
"# Run, Conejo, run #"
"Never seen no speed limit on this road, Sheriff Kilbaught, so I... so I made a... a modest estimate."
"Never been anything modest about your modesty, Clive."
"This truck don't go a mile over 50, Sheriff."
"Now, you were driving a different truck this morning."
"I've been watching you the last few weeks, driving back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"Now, we both know there ain't nothing in this town worth taking a second look at."
Yeah.
"That against the law now, Sheriff?"
"Okay, come on, out."
Even your mama thinks you're a piece of shit.
You don't belong here.
You got me thinking.
Two trucks...
hauling the same junk in the same day?
- Isabel.
- Isabel.
"- Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter I wish to discuss with you."
"Um, Nurse Oaks?"
"- Yes, Madam?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse Oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
- It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"- Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
- Roderick.
"- They're quite nice, I must admit."
"- Yes, indeed."
- What order shall be taken
- with the prisoners?
- Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.
Where the evil which thou has driven to mingle with my being will slip away like a dream.
"- Lucy, this is not a good time."
- Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers... which will no longer taint my breath in the Garden of Eden.
- Is that Hawthorne?
- What do you mean?
"- You were quoting one of Mr. Hawthorne's Twice-Told T ales, were you not?"
- I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"- There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, Nurse Oaks."
The plan worked.
I did it once.
I can do it again because I believe in myself.
"- No, granddad, my point is..."
"- Less talk, more training!"
Let's go!
"The more you fight, the more he fights."
"It's your ego, granddad."
You're the problem.
"I'm rising to the challenge, redeeming my honor!"
That's a nice way to say you want payback.
What's the opposite of a nigga?
- I don't know.
- Think about it.
- Mr. Rogers?
- Perfect.
Can you imagine Mr. Rogers in a nigga moment?
Of course not!
"So to end a nigga moment, you have to be Mr. Rogers, and what would Mr. Rogers do?"
He would follow normal white-people rules.
So if Stinkmeaner confronted Mr. Rogers in a parking lot...
"Oh, yeah, he wouldn't fight."
He would walk away and call the police.
And if he keeps coming back?
"File a complaint, get a restraining order."
"Eventually, they would put Stinkmeaner in jail."
"But then he has to snitch, and then I got to live with that shame!"
"Yes, dumb idea, Huey."
Stinkmeaner get away with beating me in front of everyone!
I never get redemption!
But it ends.
You're saying that I should just let him get away with beating me in front of the whole world?
"- mom, i told uncle bob -- - i don't care."
please don't leave me alone here with her.
"- these bullies are hassling tim again, and just because someone had him kick them in the nuts."
"- well, that's not my fault!"
it's his dingdong haircut and his silly eyeglasses that make him get in trouble!
- mom!
"- oh, you know what i mean."
come on.
"i'm your mother, and you're staying right here."
damn kids!
- dang kids.
- da-- dang kids.
"[chuckles] yeah, they're always listening to their friends and not their parent."
"- it, um, appears the only items you have in your refrigerator are two cans of cheese-please and a liter of pop?"
"- yeah, it's -- it's grocery day."
- it's grocery day!
it's grocery day.
"look, i know these kids."
"they -- they eat a full balanced diet 'cause they're still growing and crap, so..."
- oh.
so you do have a job?
- no!
working's for suckers!
- [chuckles] - skoal!
"- i'm, actually -- um, i'm, like, in this transitional phase right now."
- i've seen enough.
"[door creaks] uh, who is she?"
i-i don't have her on my list.
- oh.
"um, she ain't really mine."
"see, her daddy is my friend with benefits."
so she just comes around here sometimes.
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen."
You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do
"- I think, you need to ease off a little bit."
- Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you but actually they all getting really annoyed."
They are?
"Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a thirdgrader but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
"All that singing and dancing, I can't stand it."
You don't like doing it?
It's just don't me.
What I really wanna do is just-- play basketball.
- Basketball?
- I love it.
Always have.
I've missed a game on TV.
When my dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
Dude.
You should do that.
"You should join the basketball team, right now."
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want."
- Really?
- When you grow up into a fourthgrader you'll understand that you'll have to be tough and direct with your parents.
Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
You're like the good-looking guy from high school who knows how cute he is and just won't take no for an answer.
"I've got your black Mercedes,"
I'm sending you the grid coordinates and imagery now.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"Next leave, beers are on me, okay?"
"Oh, you are not getting off that easy."
You got her to use a military recon satellite and then you made a date?
I'm a multi-tasker.
Impressive.
"There, address that."
He just pulled in to Makani Kai Aviation.
It's a helicopter tour operator.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
- Fly.
"Please, I'm begging you."
We didn't do any...
- Will you shut up?
"- Hey, where do you wanna go?"
There's an airport on the north side of Molokai.
Get me there and I'll let them go.
- Danny.
Dawkins has hostages.
"No, no."
"According to Makani Kai Aviation, their bird took off with a pilot and a family of three coming back from a tour."
"- Chin, where's your friend?"
- On his way as we speak.
"Danny, contact Honolulu approach."
"Get me the direction that island bird is headed, okay?"
- You got it.
- Good.
"- Hey, it's all good, bro, mahalo."
- No problem.
"Then I took a second to get to know the guy, and he turned out to be a pretty good friend."
"- Well, um, I'm not here to make friends."
"- Yeah, well, mission accomplished."
"- Look, clearly, this isn't working."
- Clearly.
"So, let's just..."
"Look, you do the first half of the assignment, then I'll go over it before I put it together with mine."
- And I'll go over yours.
- Fine.
Then I guess we'll have to get together this weekend and go over it together.
Sounds like the perfect way to spend the weekend.
See ya.
- The Bait Shop.
Where is that exactly?
- I don't know.
"- So where'd you get these from, then?"
"- Uh, you know, uh, Cohen."
- He gave them to you?
- To us.
Hmm.
Why'd he do that?
"Um, well, he said he wants to be friends, that he's trying to change."
"Um, to be less Coheny and more like, well, a person."
- Don't you think he might be trying that just to win you back?
- No.
- I mean no.
"- Okay, let's just say, hypothetically,"
Seth really is changing.
Would that mean you'd want to get back together with him?
"- Well, hypothetically?"
- You know what?
Don't answer.
- Buying myself a piñata.
- A personal piñata?
"End of a hard week, you just string up a piñata, whack the crap out of it, and it rains candy on you."
- It's the best.
- But I don't understand.
"Cookie, you were also buying a piñata?"
"Yeah, I mean, what are the odds, right?"
When two people who both love piñatas find each other?
Very unexpected.
"'Cause, you know, normally I date, you know, really tough guys, right?"
- It's what I would assume.
"- Yeah, bounty hunters,"
"MMA fighters, and large animal vets, but, man, none of those guys made me laugh like this man."
- You're a party in a bottle.
- There's no denying that.
"And the physical part is just... it's, um... seamless."
"When you say ""seamless,"" what do you mean by..."
"- Well, we need more apps."
- You don't know where his body
- ends and yours begins?
- You guys need more apps?
- Is that what it is?
"- I do, yeah."
- Who wants more apps?
"- I'm good, thanks."
I'll get you some then.
"Oh, my God, can you believe it?"
"We thought Nancy was gonna be some terrible woman who was like, ""my Crock-Pot,"" and instead, it's Cookie!"
- [laughs]
- You must be so psyched.
"- I am so psyched, really."
"- Oh, God, imagine what."
I'm gonna marry her one day.
cool.
"Man, this place is huge."
"-Imposing, is what it is."
-It's big.
Just looking at the size of the place just gives that extra edge to the nerve in a way because there's like double the people to impress.
How's it going?
"Hey, man."
"Wow, this is big."
Let's have a look.
This is mad.
Bad idea.
Nice day.
"Oh, my God."
This place is huge.
This is mad.
Sick.
his is absolutely mad.
can't wait to get out here and play.
I just wanna get on with it.
hello.
t was the most exciting thing in the world.
"I really wish my parents were here, actually, to see it because they don't get to see a Iot of us and to see us doing something like this and see what it's all about...."
"But it's good we're getting it in the film, so they'II get to see anyway."
So everyone's a winner.
You know if we'd got ask ed  two years ago what we thought would happen we never would've said this.
hen think about how lucky we actually are to be in this position....
"It's, Iike, probably one in a million chance to be where I am."
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"f one of us just didn't happen to go to our audition then you know, it could be so different."
e are definitely the five Iuckiest dudes.
"Well, he's come back to life."
What are his paintings worth?
Depends on size.
"And artistic merit, presumably."
"Not really, just size."
(Mobile phone rings)
He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.
What's he done with all of it?
"Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you."
"No, I won't."
"This is crap, isn't it, Flick?"
Complete.
"No, this time you've gone too far."
"I've spoken to the lawyers, you're never going to see your son again."
I don't know how you can look at yourself every morning without throwing up.
Am I going to get a look-in on this conversation?
"No, because I know exactly what you're going to say so you can spare me the smart remarks."
"I don't know how you could let this happen in your own apartment, your own son."
"Oh, that's what this is about."
"Wendy, he's 15 years old, alright, almost 16."
He's got a girlfriend.
"Oh, you are genuinely sick if you think this is appropriate."
All I did was save our son 50 bucks on a room in some flea pit.
He's a kid.
He's in love with another kid.
With another kid?
!
Yes.
It's a girl in his English class.
He told me all about it.
"The girl from his English class is his fucking English teacher, you moron!"
Oh...
"They called me Minx, sent me to New York, and I sent money home to mother and she stopped crying."
That's when I learned that the best medicine is money.
Money.
I still dream of being a psychiatrist.
Because I think I could help people with their problems.
Really I do.
Do you?
"I've been developing my ideas, Michelangelo."
And I'm here to make a proposal to you.
I've seen your site.
"Yes, I have."
"I know my way around the web, all right."
"Now if you put your mind to it, you could become one of our brand-awareness operators, Michelangelo."
You could become... an influencer.
Do you know what that is?
That is a kid who sets a trend.
And we employ a lot of them.
"Now tell me, OK, honestly."
How many hits did your site have yesterday?
Wow!
Really?
"You see, I knew that the youth market was the niche to explore."
It is just where the numbers are...
"Except for the ageing population, of course."
Wow!
That just came to me.
Geriatrics!
"They sure need fragrance, right?"
"See, Michelangelo, you have to think ahead in the world of the new."
That's a pity it's not called N.
"""N is for new."""
But then that wouldn't work for the old.
Here he is.
He waded in the water to help someone out.
He was helping them onto the boat-- they're here.
They made it home.
But he took a bullet.
"It came out of I don't know where, and..."
"He was as near to me as you are, and I saw the light go out of his eyes."
"But I said I'd bring him back, and I brought him back, even though it meant taking up space that could have been used by someone else."
Here he is.
Edith:
Dead?
Foyle:
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
But why?
He weren't a soldier.
The war was nothing to do with him.
Why did he have to go?
"Well, he believed it was right."
"Edith, whatever Margaret Ellis has told you, there isn't going to be a German invasion now, not today, not tomorrow, perhaps not ever."
How did she frighten you into cutting the wires?
She didn't.
What did she say was going to happen to you when the Germans came?
Nothing.
"She knew, didn't she?"
She knew that your grandmother is Jewish?
She said I wouldn't be allowed to work anymore.
She said I'd be put in a camp...
[Sobbing]
"That she wanted to look after me, but first, I'd have to prove myself..."
Do something to show I was on her side.
I didn't think it would matter that much.
- Don't waste any time.
- Goodbye.
"Who was it, Ben?"
"It was the, uh... the, uh... concierge at the hotel."
He found out we were being held by the police.
He just called to see if there was anything he could do.
- That's very nice of him.
"- Yes, I thought so."
"I told him if we weren't back there in 15 minutes, for him to call the American Consulate at Casablanca."
"But, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Come on, Jo."
There is just one small formality.
I must request you to sign a statement.
"If it doesn't take too long, of course."
Wait a moment. I will send for a typist.
(Hoofbeats)
Ben?
Yeah?
Aren't you going to let me see the message?
I don't - l... I don't think I should.
"Darling, I'm not the police inspector."
I think that I should see it.
"Ben, why didn't you give this to the police?"
- Because I didn't want to.
"- But, Ben, a man's life - ls at stake, yeah l know."
I just - l-l don't know what's the right thing to do.
"We should go back to the hotel, pick up Hank and get out of here."
- Maybe.
- Think about Hank.
"What a terrible thing this is for him, seeing a man murdered right before his eyes."
- It's a horrible shock to a little boy.
(SHIP'S BELL TOLLING)
(GREETING IN FRENCH)
How much for this?
It's my daughter's.
I'll give you four francs for that.
Four?
It's worth 10!
(CHUCKLING) No.
(SINGING) I smell women Smell 'em in the air
Think I'll drop my anchor In that harbor over there
Five?
(SINGING) Lovely lady I'll love you till I'm broke
Seven months at sea and now I'm hungry for a poke!
Even stokers need a little stoke!
PROSTITUTES:
Lovely ladies Waiting for a bite!
Waiting for the customers Who only come at night
Lovely ladies Ready for the call
Standing up or lying down Or any way at all
Bargain prices up against the wall!
What pretty hair!
What pretty locks you've got there!
"What luck you've got It's worth a centime, my dear!"
I'll take the lot!
Don't touch me!
Leave me alone!
Let's make a price
I'll give you all of 10 francs
Just think of that
It pays a debt
Just think of that
What can I do?
"Dominic Palladino, do you remember him?"
"-BE guy, a real juicer."
-He's in AA now.
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.
They can treat this shit nowadays.
Me with the competency hearings.
You with the head shrinkers.
This one in rehab now.
I was so upset when he didn't bring me a present back from Italy.
He got something for A.J. and for Meadow.
"He gave me some vinegar, but I don't think it was meant for me."
"It must've meant something, that he felt bad."
"Carmela, you sound like you're 15 years old."
I say I'm helping him decorate.
I bring A.J. with me.
Now even he smells a rat.
"If Tony suspects one iota, you know what'll happen to Furio."
These guys are living in a different century.
-It didn't stop you.
-Steve at the gym?
I felt so guilty all the time.
The lies and the sneaking.
It took Jackie going in the hospital to get me to stop.
-We haven't slept together yet.
-You're not fucking him?
So this isn't really real.
It is real.
We communicate.
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.
"Just those few minutes when we see each other, I live for those."
I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers and I will never be happy.
He's like...
"I guess like all treasure hunters, I mean, a little bit on the secretive side, you know."
"Youknow, I don't know how Dan reallyseesFred'spassing."
"But, look, they both persevered intheface of all kinds of adversity."
"Theyrisked,theysweated, they worked, they labored towards the common goal."
You don't get any closer than that.
"So,tothatend ,Iguess, theywerecloser than they thought."
"You know, whenever Rick would talk about this place, it was always about, well,"
Blankenship's doing this and Nolan's doing that.
"But we always thought, or it was our hope,"
- that we could work together.
- Yeah.
- It was my belief that we could.
"- Well, we did."
We did work together.
"Sounds like, to me, that you see it, and I think we all do really, we see Oak Island as a big giant puzzle."
"I know that Fred told me once that that's how he saw it,"
-a big giant puzzle.
-That's why they call it
- the Oak Island mystery.
-Exactly.
"So, you know, we got to get busy and start putting pieces into the right places."
- Amen.
- Amen.
- All right.
"- Okay, Dan."
"Okay, off we go."
We'll get back to work.
Yeah.
"Hey, remember, you're not going anywhere."
Okay.
"See you, Daniel."
[ Cheers and applause ]
I don't know why you keep encouraging our man Rutledge.
"I mean, so, your solution for everybody who owns an electric car is to buy a gas-powered truck, a gas-powered generator, and have him lead you around everywhere you go."
It's genius.
[ Laughter ]
It's about as good an idea as you getting behind the wheel of a race truck.
Aw.
[ Audience groans ]
I'm just saying.
"All right, all right."
"I think the important thing to remember is, we've all learned something here today."
Thank you.
We've learned never to let you be in charge of this programme ever again.
That's all we have.
We see you next time.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year down at uni and we're all still breathing.
- Chin-fucking-chin.
- Chin-fucking-chin!
"Yes, thank you."
"We'll be celebrating later right, Gemma?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Oh, it's going to be a bumpy ride to Heaven and back."
Get off me!
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower."
You won't be reaching Heaven.
"- Screw you, Eleanor."
- Without your beretta?
"- Just shut the fuck up, all right?"
- She's only winding you up.
"- Uh, yeah."
We got rid of that.
Okay?
- Yeah.
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the ""I got caught cheating"" diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
- It's a family heirloom.
- Yeah.
I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half sister over Christmas.
So I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully that she can suck it.
Okay.
I gotta bounce.
- Stop saying that.
- This deejay from Dubai... is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
I was still young.
And I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me...
- would be a total...
- Disaster.
"I mean, she's like an entirely different species."
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
Wow.
"You got 80% of the company in bed with the Navy, and..."
"And what, Ron?"
We need that military contract.
Not gonna happen.
Navy wants to go light.
"Steel is out, poly fiber is in."
"Dalton, did the contract expire, or did it expire?"
Expired.
And are we gonna get it back?
Don't see it happening.
"Legal doesn't see it happening, Ron."
Maybe we should stop yapping about a Navy contract we don't have anymore and figure out how (slams hand on table) to sell some damn steel!
I have to go.
Give our best to the Secretary of the Navy.
And good luck with the speech.
"As President and CEO of Wickes Steel  Shipbuilding,"
I'm proud of the work my family has put into building these great machines.
They're an unshakable foundation upon which the Navy can take her fleet to new heights.
How was that?
MAN:
"That was perfect, sir."
Thank you.
WICKES:
Was I loud enough?
JARVIS:
Always are.
(laughs)
"Mr. Secretary, I..."
I feel sorry for you having to follow that.
"Oh, I was going to have you take a look at my speech, maybe do a little punch up."
WICKES (chuckles):
"Like old times, huh?"
"Oh, yeah, I know that."
"Me, on the other hand..."
The doctors say you're going to be fine.
Although you're going to have to wrap your head around the fact that we're really brothers now.
We're blood brothers.
You donated blood ?
"Ah, I had an extra few pints flowing through my veins."
It was no big deal.
Hmm.
You're not a big fan of needles.
"Nor of fainting, it turns out."
But the bank was a little low and us O-negative guys got to stick together.
Hmm.
"That's weird, 'cause all of a sudden I have this strange urge to listen to Death Cab and read comic books."
Really ?
"No, I'm kidding."
"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause if we could have turned this into a body-swap comedy, we could have squeezed another year or two out of this."
Mm.
"So listen, I don't know if I've said this at all today, but..."
You did.
"But after all the times you've saved me, I was up, so..."
All right.
Where's everyone else ?
"How are, how are the girls ?"
"Kirsten, Sandy ?"
"Uh, the girls are fine."
"Veronica Townsend and Pancakes, however, have matching casts."
And Frank is here with Julie and Caitlin.
"He gave me a ride, brought you here."
"Um, but my mom and dad are doing some tests with the doctor, 'cause she fell."
Is it bad ?
"Hey, boys."
"Alvin, please think about what you're doing."
May I remind you that you are addressing the president of the United States?
"Mr. President, I don't wanna write off any Americans yet."
"Trust me, sir, we'll get your house back for you."
"Mission'sa go,colonel."
"Thank you, sir."
You heard the president.
Six minutes.
"So, what's it like being president?"
It's not like anything.
"Once you get into office, it's all about reelection.."
and what the other side can use against you.
Politics.
You don't start out a politician..
but you become one.
"Just once, though, I wanna do something that's presidential."
"Something along the lines of Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson."
You wanna make history.
No.
Not history.
I wanna make a difference.
If your little daughter says that I'm her hero..
then I gotta earn that.
"All right, we go in low and quiet."
Time to target is two minutes.
"Falcon 2, maintain 30 feet."
"Falcon 1, copy, 30 feet."
Dropto10 feet!
Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.
Complete chaos on the streets of D.C. There's total gridlock through..
"Oh, my God!"
U.S. Special Forces are flying over us!
"When you want a story, all you have to do is ask."
Bye.
Don't you want to get out of the box?
Can you tell me a story?
People story or animal story?
Happy or sad?
"A thriller, comedy or horror?"
Made-up or real?
A story about people.
Your story.
Mine?
- Don't you have a story?
- Sure.
- Can't you tell me?
- I guess so.
"I was born, and I had a lot of brothers."
My mother used to tell us stories so we should not think about eating.
"Then I grew up, got married and had a bunch of children."
I told them the same stories my mother used to tell me.
"I grew old, my husband died and one by one, my kids went away."
So I kept reciting stories aloud to myself.
I told them in the streets.
Some of the passers-by liked them and gave me some change.
"One day, your grandma came up to me and asked:"
"""Would you tell your stories to my grandchild for food and shelter?"
"She said I could eat myself sick, if I wanted."
"I agreed, so they put me in that box."
"Before they closed me up,"
I asked if I'd get paid on the spot.
"""Once my grandchild opens her present, you can eat,"" she said."
"Well, that's my story."
May I eat now?
TheWorstof theWorst
"It's her, right?"
Give me the phone now.
No Jik!
Thepersonyouare tryingtocall-
What's wrong?
I told you to give me that girl's number.
"No matter how you look at it, she's messing with a student."
Is Sin Joon Young that great?
Yeah he is.
This girl isn't that weird either.
She's normal but Joon Young is so awesome that he's even able to change her.
I'm not saying that right now.
Don't fall for Joon Young.
-What?
-If your always around him filling the documentary then you'll definitely fall for him.
This rascal...
You dont know Jin Joon.
Joon Young is know a person in a different world now.
Joon Young's saying something without thought.
Don't be mistaken and don't get any useless hope.
You'll get hurt.
Did you eat something wrong this morning?
That's right.
"Those ribs must have tasted weird, right?"
"So that's why I told you to stay away from them and not to eat them, you punk!"
"Noona, I hope you and Hyung will have nice courtship."
Even if he doesn't have anything he's a really good person and you fit with him.
That's the way that you'll be happy.
Then this is the end of my nagging.
No Euly!
Film the documentary well.
95th Rifles.
Colonel De L'Eclin.
I have the honour to command the garrison in this town.
"May I present His Excellency, the Count of Matamoro."
You know my brother.
Major Blas Vivar.
I have the honour of knowing the Count.
"The title of Count is in dispute between us, as, of course, is Spain itself."
Why?
You're a Spaniard.
Why do you fight against your country and your brother?
Politics.
I am what is called afrancesado...
- one who suports France
- Why?
Bonaparte brings the light of reason.
"There are two Spains, Lieutenant."
My brother's Spain is a monastery - silence and superstition
My Spain is a court - science and scholarship.
"If you were Spanish,"
- which would you choose lieutenant?
- I am neither monk nor prince.
So I would choose a tavern.
You have 30 minutes to surrender.
I suggest you surrender your sword and order your men to lay down their muskets.
We don't use muskets.
We use rifles.
My men are all crack shots.
We call them Chosen Men
- They never miss.
"- I will stop you raising the banner, but many men will die for a superstition."
"Ten minutes, gentlemen."
I remember that a little bit differently.
Your parents didn't want you hanging out with me when I was pregnant.
Right.
But they came around eventually.
"Of course, I don't think you're their favorite friend."
Madison is.
Madison slept with your boyfriend.
But she didn't get pregnant.
And my parents like her parents.
"My parents like your parents, too."
"I don't think they'd go away on vacation with your parents or anything, but... (SIGHS)"
This sounds negative when all I wanted to do was say
I'm happy for you that Kathy made some friends.
"Now, I have to go meet Madison."
Why can't I go meet Madison?
Uh... 'Cause we're looking for guys?
(SIGHS)
Hi.
"Hey, Grace."
Hi.
"Um, I don't guess that you'd maybe want to do something tonight, would you?"
Tonight?
Yeah.
My mom wants us to try to be friends.
"Oh, yeah, I think my dad wants the same thing. (CHUCKLES)"
"Um, but, I mean, you've never not been my friend and I've never not been your friend."
"We haven't been close, but we haven't not been close."
"Right, yeah."
And I owe it all to you that I have a job at the church nursery.
I'll always be grateful to you for that.
Thank you.
"Although, being grateful is not quite the same as being a friend."
- So weird.
"- Yes, yes."
I mean the way people talk.
"I mean, people think we did it."
I know.
It's like we might as well done it anyway at this point.
"I mean, you know, if everybody is talking about it already..."
maybe we...
"I mean, not to make a big deal of it or anything."
Out of what?
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
"It's amazing the things you notice,"
"Llke the corner of his collar that was coming undone,"
"Llke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts,"
"That's all I could see,"
"The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric, I think I have to go."
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
"It's such a lle that you should do what's ln your heart, lf we all did what was ln our hearts, the world would grind to a halt,"
And they know that he knows and I can't believe he didn't tell them.
He got a perfect score on his PS AT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
"Sexually aware, but you just don't know it."
But when I read it...
You know what I mean?
"You're in denial of the fact that your parents had sex and everything and the second you pull that out, it was like,"
"""You bastard!"
"You know."""
"You know that he knows, because he swapped it for that."
"And you're lying there, in a foetal position."
My dick went backwards - I had a vagina.
"I'm lying on the bathroom floor, a new woman."
"I'd already undressed so I'm like, ""Oh, God, I've gone the whole hog!"""
"I went through the whole, like, opera of having a bath."
"You know, like..."
"# Just in the bath, la la la!"
#
"Singing too loud and kind of,"
# No wanking here Just enjoying the soap
# Nowhere near my testicles!
#
"And went downstairs and you know that thing of going, ""You know what?"
"""Maybe they played a trick."
"Maybe your brother..."""
I walked into the living room and I was just like...
"I felt so dirty but you're going,"
"""Just don't..."
"Play it cool, play it cool."""
Sat down.
And people think that...
This is genuine - Juliet Bravo was on.
I like Juliet Bravo.
I like Juliet Bravo.
Not in that way.
Dr.Roncero. Psychiatrist.
7th Left.
Twenty three.
The day I spent waiting at the window was the day she wouldn't come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr.Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
- Can't it be sooner?
"- No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?
- I've got an appointment at 5:00.
- Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
- Benigno Martin?
- Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"- The last fifteen years, you said?"
- Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, make-up and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's make-up and her hair?
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
I love New York.
"Doing a show here, man."
"You know, 'cause sometimes I do shows in weird places."
"Like, I just came back from Seattle, Washington."
That place is weird.
"'Cause Richard Sherman is there, and I'm scared of that guy, okay?"
"'Cause he's so forceful for no reason, right?"
"""Well, when you put me up against"
"""a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's what you gonna get!"""
"I said, ""Calm down."
"It's not that serious."""
"Ladies, let me tell you something."
"That's the type of dude, if he say you in a relationship, you's in a relationship."
There's nothing you can do about it.
"He walk right up to you, ""You coming with me."""
"You say, ""Bitch, I guess I'm going with him then."""
"""Fuck it."
"That's my baby now."""
"I'm serious, man."
"Oh, boy, it's so diverse in here."
I love it.
Ten Black people.
Thank y'all for coming.
It's--
"You aware that we are seriously a minority right now, and it's-- And it's cool."
"You know what, 'cause I love white folks."
"You gotta understand, I do."
"You know, 'cause when I first moved to New York,"
I moved into a dangerous neighborhood.
"And when I saw y'all walking around,"
I felt safe.
"'Cause I know when it all come down to it, y'all would get robbed before I will."
"I saw him once from a distance, though."
Handsome boy.
"He's got a long struggle ahead of him, that's for sure."
"Doctors, rehab... physical therapy...."
I think I'm going to have the medallions of veal.
You make me late for a table at Tavern on the fucking Green?
How's the real estate business?
-Excuse me?
"-You know, HUD."
"Garside Street, you, Ralph, Zellman."
Zellman tell you this?
Carmine doesn't know anything about this yet.
"I'm giving you an opportunity to cut a deal, make it right."
"Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut you in out of friendship, but that's over."
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.
You sure you want to go down this road?
"How much to paint a different suit on him, change his face a little?"
-Pardon me?
-Why throw it away?
"A stronger chin, maybe."
I was thinking like those paintings in the courthouse.
"Something classy, you know, like a Revolutionary War general."
Napoleon and his horse.
That kind of thing.
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.
"Not Napoleon, exactly."
Like Napoleon.
Sit down.
Relax.
"What's going on, Ton'?"
"I think I know what happened to Ralph, and if I'm right... he ain't coming back."
"-Still, I'd like to give platelets and FFP."
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Even a tiny bleed can become serious if she can't clot.
"It's possibly a good idea, Dr. Kovac..."
... butyoudo realizethatbloodproducts carry the risk of infection...
"... andtransfusionreaction,don 'tyou ?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, was the CT negative?"
There's no bleed that we could see.
Do you wanna expose your patient to those risks because her platelets are low?
Scan was four hours ago.
She might have a delayed bleed.
I'd worry more if she had mental status changes...
... ora focalneuroexam.
-He's got a point.
-She's drunk so that's hard to assess.
Drunk people get sober.
And careful observation is still better than any lab.
That's right. I'd have to agree.
What just happened?
They've been pulling that on me all morning.
"I don't know, some sort of competitive agreeing contest?"
-l wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
-Did you hear what I said?
-They got you on tape.
-Couldn't have been me.
-You were up there long enough.
-They had to look for that infuser thing.
"Don't give me that crap, K.J."
Okay.
"There's this girl, one of the volunteers..."
-... she'sfineas hell-- -l went out on a limb for you.
That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.
"I hope, nobody in this room is, planning anything for my birthday."
"Like what, Bob?"
"Oh, like people jumping out of closets, people jumping up from behind furniture... and, expecting me to be surprised when I'm not surprised."
"Oh, don't be silly, Bob."
"Now we agreed it's just gonna be a nice, quiet dinner with a few close friends."
"Yeah, the... quieter, the better when you're past 40."
Why celebrate?
"I mean, It's all downhill from here."
You're heading into the twilight time.
"You think I oughta cash in my chips, Howard?"
"I don't know, but I'd keep them handy, if I were you."
Okay.
"Here's your dinner, honey."
"Lettuce, cottage cheese, tomato, a slice of melon and some cold chicken."
- I hope it's all on your diet.
- A diet?
"What's wrong, Bob?"
"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, That's bad."
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.
"I mean, Look at this."
"Cantaloupe and cottage cheese and tomatoes- I mean, it's full of carbohydrates."
"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
It is called Nymphs And Shepherds.
Who knows what a nymph is?
"Yes, Brierley?"
"Please, Miss, they're pink and they live in the sea."
You eat them in little pots.
Well...
"That's not nymphs that's shrimps, you fat head."
Hey!
Sh!
"Have you been in a Berni before, Enid?"
No.
"What I like, there's no surprises."
Can I show you to your table?
"Thank you, Barry."
Thank you.
"Thanking you, Barry."
"This is lovely, very kind of you to invite us."
"Yes, very much appreciated."
"We know you're an insurance man, Tubby, and you're basically a secretary, Enid, but we thought you'd like to know a little bit about us."
Shall I launch in?
"# I'm a man, just a man I am happy and contented"
# I appreciate the finer things in life
# And my house is detached and it's obviously not rented
# I've a car and I've something else... # A wife!
# And my life's complete when I take her out to eat
# We have all that we possibly could want
# When we journey in to the Berni Inn
# Our very favourite restaurant
# Please don't panic when you see the Berni menu
# All uncharted waters to explore.. #
Lovely.
# No need to be Magellan... #
I know the difference.
I hope you told the cops that.
Did you have any alcohol at all?
"Like two glasses of champagne, three tops."
And the boys were in the car?
Does it help that I was taking them to Disneyland?
It does not.
"So, what do we do about Diane?"
I have no idea.
You have no idea?
You're my lawyer.
"Yeah, well, I'm thinking of leaving the law..."
Starting a zoo.
Because I seem to have discovered the only animal in the known world that can actually fuck itself.
Wow.
"Please don't take this the wrong way, Matt, but you are the worst client I ever had, seriously."
I'd happily trade you for two Mel Gibsons and a Tiger Woods.
Jesus!
"As far as the D.U.I., this is your first offense, amazingly, so we can probably get you off with a little community service."
"As far as Diane, you're on your own."
Jesus!
Yep.
The new guy's changing everything.
Time to get out the old résumés.
"Well, I think that's premature."
I don't have a résumé.
How do you not have a résumé?
This is the only place I've ever worked.
"Well, except for the summer after college."
I was one of the snow whites at Disneyland.
I never knew that.
I worked the Graveyard Shift.
And now I'm a cheating scoundrel?
"As long as you're a do-yooder, everything's hunky dory... as long as I deny myself, as long as I give away millions... without a word!"
"Am I to apologise because I'm rich, moneyed?"
Mr Om is saying nothing of the sort.
Why are you getting upset?
I'm upset because I considered him my friend
He's more than a brother to me
And he says I have deceived him?
"Well all right, I have deceived you"
Why don't you return my money?
Why not prove that love is stronger than money?
"The three of you, Om, Jai and Jagadish"
"Come on, get together!"
Pay me back
"Else, vacate your house in 48 hours."
I'm going to get a court order
And don't come to work from tomorrow onwards
They will vacate the house.
"You told me, they're men of word"
"Papa, Uncle Jai is leaving"
Brother...
Yes Jai...?
I want to talk to you.
You are returning?
"Yes, I'm leaving"
"If I don't leave, there will be a big problem"
Do you have your green card?
I have it
But I might lose my job.
You got my go-ahead
"Besides, what can you achieve living in this country?"
Go away
"I was really eating this, because I use..."
I remember I said that I thought when girls ate in movies it looked fake and like they weren't swallowing.
Like they were just gonna throw...
"Like, barf it into a thing after."
Because usually they give you a bucket to spit stuff out.
I hate when I see it in movies where they're not eating and not swallowing.
- It does get disgusting.
"- Yeah, it was gross."
And I regretted it.
I skipped lunch that day and went and...
I did a scene once where I ate a fig per take.
"And we did it like all day and I was like, ""Why did I do this?"""
Because you can't get out of it once you've started.
And drinking stuff too.
It's hard too.
"Like, if you have a lot of beverage."
Don't get me started about drinking things.
God.
This is a real phone.
"- Oh, boy."
- And in the background...
"There were people in the background, like Rachel Cohn, who wrote the book."
And David Levithan.
"Yeah, where are you?"
Did you leave the city?
- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?
Second and Ninth.
"Okay, well, don't leave."
"I'm gonna come over, okay?"
"In the meantime, could you pass that message on?"
I'm happy about something.
"Look down, look down"
There's 20 years to go
I've done no wrong
"Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!"
CONVICTS:
"Look down, look down"
Sweet Jesus doesn't care
CONVICTS:
I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true
CONVICTS:
"Look down, look down"
They've all forgotten you
When I get free
You won't see me Here for dust!
CONVICTS:
Huh!
"Look down, look down"
You'll always be a slave
"Look down, look down"
You're standing in your grave
Retrieve the flag.
(GRUNTING)
(THUDDING)
"(SINGING) Now, Prisoner 24601"
Your time is up And your parole's begun
You know what that means?
Yes.
It means I'm free
No.
Follow to the letter Your itinerary
This badge of shame You'll show it till you die
Rescue Force Sigma-17 reporting for duty.
I was not aware rescue teams were... still active.
"Wherever there is an emergency, there are rescue bots, sir."
"Hey, why wouldn't we be active?"
How long were we in stasis?
We better check it with Cybertron H.Q.
That will not be necessary.
Or possible.
Cybertron is no longer our home.
This planet is.
Script by Arvegtor Timing by Deska
"Hi, mister Harrison!"
I'm OK!
"Cody Burns, Griffin Rock PD."
"Please, pull over."
Figured you wanna say goodbye to the old rust bucket.
It's her last day on the job.
"I still don't understand why the city is making you get a new car, Dad."
- This one works fine.
"- Progress, kiddo."
It wouldn't be high-tech testing ground if we stayed back.
"Give it up, Dad."
"If Cody had his way, we all would be paddling everywhere."
"'Course you'd still be on training wheels, Kade."
The helmet may mess up your hair.
"Quit it, Graham."
Don't forget to be at the dedication this afternoon.
Think I can test-drive the hotty.
"We're getting rescue vehicles, no go-carts."
"Sorry, pal."
For authorised emergency responders only.
"So basically, everyone in the family but me."
John F. Kennedy?
Jon Bon Jovi?
Jon Bon Jovi.
Too easy.
"And, if I may say so, a complete load of bollocks."
"In my opinion, all men are islands."
"And what's more, now's the time to be one."
This is an island age.
"A hundred years ago, you had to depend on other people."
No one had TV or CDs or DVDs or videos or home espresso makers.
"Actually, they didn't have anything cool."
"Whereas now, you see you can make yourself a little island paradise."
"With the right supplies and the right attitude you can be sun-drenched, tropical, a magnet for young Swedish tourists."
"Hi, it's Kristina."
I haven't heard from you.
I had a great time last weekend.
"So give me a call, okay?"
'Bye.
And I like to think that perhaps I am that kind of island.
I like to think I'm pretty cool.
I like to think I'm Ibiza.
There were people who had a good time in life.
I was beginning to realize I wasn't one of them.
I just didn't fit.
I didn't fit at my old school.
I definitely didn't fit at my new one.
I heard that some kids got taught by their parents at home.
"Mum couldn't do that, unless I paid her to teach me."
Because it was just her and me.
And she went to work.
She made £400 a week.
Where was I gonna get that kind of money from?
She was just Fanny.
Fatimah Fareeeha Taarhira al-Amatullah.
Not at all like the kind of girl you'd meet back in Illinois?
"Actually, sir, not that different."
When did you find out she was a princess?
"When I asked her on a date, sir."
She told me she wasn't allowed to be seen with me in public.
And yet you spent time together anyway.
We used to meet at the Botanical Garden.
Nobody much went there.
We'd just walk and talk.
"While you were in Al Khair, the only time you had together were these few stolen moments?"
Mostly.
We spent a night together in a jeep once.
"Well, I'm sure the members get the picture."
"Not like that, sir."
I got an urgent message from Ops.
My mom was having an operation to diagnose a tumour.
It was my mom.
I felt like I was a million miles away.
Fanny held me all night.
"Just held me, till I could call my dad and know my mom was okay."
"Why do you suppose Fanny did that, petty officer?"
Because she loves me.
You're sure about that?
"Yes, I am, sir."
And how do you feel about her?
"I love her with all my heart, sir."
And so you broke these laws so the two of you could be together?
"- Yes, I did, sir."
- And you'd do it all again?
"No, sir."
I thought you were dying.
I thought so too.
The pain was excruciating.
"Julia, do you think if you asked him, Wilcox would give us champagne tonight?"
I hate champagne and Mr Ryder has already had dinner.
Mister Ryder?
Mister Ryder?
Charles drinks champagne at all hours.
"Do you know, looking at this great swaddled foot of mine, I can't get it out of my head that I've got gout, and that gives me a craving for champagne."
- Which way?
- This way.
Dinner was served in the Red Dining Room.
"While they dined, I ate a peach and told them of the war with my father."
"And he said to him ""Living in London, you must miss... your national game."" And Colin said What national game?""... and my father said ""Cricket, of course."""
I really think he's sometimes quite mad.
He sounds a perfect poppet to me.
And now I'm going to leave you boys.
- Where are you off to?
- The nursery.
I promised Nanny a last game of halma.
Dear Nanny Hawkins.
She lives entirely for pleasure.
"Goodnight, Mr Ryder and goodbye."
I'm leaving early.
I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for relieving me at the sick bed.
My sister's very pompous tonight.
I don't think she cares for me.
I don't think she cares for anyone very much.
- I love her.
She's so like me.
- Do you?
Is she?
Echizen Ryoma National champion for four years running never lost a single game in the championships.
"- No defeat, that's impressive."
- Ah that's more.
Ryuzaki-sensei.
What kinda guy is that Ryoma?
Playing with the world's top masters with 37 consecutive wins.
"People said that as long as he wasn't injured during the Grand Slam, he wouldn't lose."
Japan's greatest player.
It was also because I looked up to him when I was young that I began playing tennis.
Even now he's still my most respected senpai.
Nitouryu no Samurai Nanjiro.
Exactly.
That boy is Samurai Nanjiro's junior.
"Even if he's famous,"
I still won't give him preferential treatment.
I will treat him fairly.
Now it's just to ensure that we will achieve victory in the Nationals.
Only these.
"As expected, it's here."
We are the same group.
"Ah, o-xhibi."
Come to see the groupings?
About the tournament to decide the regulars...
First years aren't allowed to take part in the ranking matches.
Why would there be your name?
Saa because I am strong.
Don't be so arrogant.
Kaidou.
Give me your guidance.
Tennis is about hitting the ball back fast.
Let's have this practice first.
Don't want to.
- when he came to the Daily Planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
He was rattled the last time I saw him.
Desperate to give me something...
A locket.
What does a locket have to do with Lionel Luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
"When I was a boy... we took a trip together to Washington, D.C...."
It was just the two of us.
"I thought I was just tagging along on another business trip, but... he wanted to show me the Air and Space museum."
He knew I loved things that could fly.
We were looking up at the Apollo 11 command module.
I couldn't believe it went to the moon.
My father held my hand.
"And he told me, ""The right man, can make anything possible."""
You have his locket.
How did you get him to...
"Lionel was a cruel, sadistic man."
What are you suggesting?
No one will ever know.
I promise you.
Where's the key?
It was empty.
My father must have given it to someone.
I asked you to keep an eye on him.
Lionel stopped by the Daily Planet before going to Luthorcorp.
He was spotted in the basement.
Get the helicopter ready.
Of course.
You killed dad for a necklace?
You're not real.
- Nice.
"Good work, Bobbi."
- Of course it is.
"L""m the best."
We were wondering.
Could you be a little more explicit in your report?
"If we""re going to use this in court, we""re going to need more interaction."
You want any extra foam on that?
"- You mean, more touching?"
- Right.
"Just like that, right?"
"Like in the dressing room, could you say... my wife leaned over... and slid her hand between Lisa""s thighs?"
"You mean, like this?"
"Yeah, that""s good."
And maybe something like this?
"Mr. Caine, you do understand that men and women are different."
That women sometimes like to kiss and hug and carry on... and they have absolutely no intention of having sex.
Right.
"I take the cheating business very seriously, Mr. Caine."
"And it doesn""t take a private investigator that""s first class, like me... to know that y""all have an agenda."
"So whatever that is, you need to take it someplace else."
"Now, hold on."
"Blue Moon doesn""t play your dirty little games."
"If someone""s cheating in that marriage, it ain""t Pam Caine."
"L""m keeping the pictures."
"No, I will not be flexible on the issue."
"I gave up the house, he gave up the kids."
"What do you mean, legally?"
"Legally, I""m their mother."
"I got to go, okay?"
"L""ll call you back."
Hi.
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.
"Sort of looked up to me, you know."
We did our first work together.
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.
During Prohibition we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune.
"Your father, too."
"As much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him."
Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for G. I.s going to the West Coast.
That kid's name was Moe Greene and the city he invented was Las Vegas.
This was a great man.
A man of vision and guts.
"And there isn't even a plaque, signpost or statue of him in that town."
Someone put a bullet through his eye.
No one knows who gave the order.
"When I heard it, I wasn't angry."
"I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong."
"Talking loud, saying stupid things."
"So when he turned up dead, I let it go."
"And I said to myself,"
"""This is the business we've chosen. """
"I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business."
That two million in a bag in your room...
I'm going in to take a nap.
"When I wake, if the money is on the table, I know I have a partner."
"If it isn't, I know I don't."
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.
"Good to see you, Mike."
I'm glad we spend this time together.
- I'm apologizing!
Has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
"Stan, listen to me."
It was my fault too.
"I tripped over the cable, I."
This is not about you.
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people."
Let's get that stage reset and make it look good.
"Big, big jackpot on monday."
- Garfunkel?
"- Yeah, I'm probably the biggest garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
That's not the...
point exactly.
Natalie's a human being.
"Now all this attention can throw a person off-balance, especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly."
"I once wrote a book on body language, and it... it spent all of three minutes on the best seller list."
"Now I was very young, and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
- I didn't like myself very much.
- So now you're on her side.
The question is why aren't you on her side?
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie's your friend.
Maybe you're afraid...
She doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
How maybe I could have stopped it all
"If I had been braver and said something,"
"Well, that's when all this started."
"I'm sorry, daddy."
I should have said something to you.
Sir.
I've...
I'm so sorry.
"I had a dream last night,"
And in it... :
I saw ev-everything.
Now I know why you did what you did.
"I'm so sorry if I was short with you yesterday,"
So sorry about what happened to arianna...
To you and lily.
For everything.
Thank you.
It's been quite a burden.
The hardest part has been keeping my wife in the dark.
"Unfortunately, it looks like that's..."
No longer an option.
You are gonna come forward?
I don't think I really have a choice.
I should have put it all together sooner.
The obituaries that he was leaving everywhere...
That's how he figured it all out--
He must have come across one in prison
"And when he saw her picture, imagine his surprise"
When he realized that he raped
The daughter of his own defense attorney.
I'm gonna call a press conference
"Tomorrow, late afternoon,"
Joyland!
Joyland!
Happy-girl-and-boy land
Laughing and playing From year to year
Trouble and care Never enter here
Singing!

Under sunny skies
Happy forever and ever
In childhood paradise!

- Count off.
USHERS:
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
At ease.
"Now, men, Mr. Jeffries has something important to say to you."
"Boys, I've been managing picture theaters for a long time."
This is the neatest and best-drilled company of ushers I've ever seen.
But some are not measuring up to the necessary standards of discipline that I insist upon.
I won't mention any names.
This is merely a friendly warning that any usher caught chewing gum during the performance of duty will be dismissed.
I also have a report that a certain usher is making a habit of using the men's lavatory on the mezzanine floor for dice and crap games.
This must stop.
I think I've made myself clear.
Come on.
THE END
Doomed.
"Doomed to a violent end, that Clara Nash was."
"I'm telling you, Sergeant."
Doomed to a violent end.
"I know, Mrs. Slocum, you told me."
"Three times, already."
"And I'm trying to find out, with your help, who murdered her."
The horror of it all.
[sighs]
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
And that poor little boy.
Whatever is gonna become of him.
"Mom, please, mom."
Try to control yourself.
And to think that I was practically the last one to see her alive.
Me.
"Mrs. Slocum, if you could just give me a few minutes of your valuable time, l--"
My valuable time.
"Well, thank you very much, Sergeant."
"You hear that, Janie?"
The Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
Just goes to show how a person's whole life can be changed... just by somebody getting murdered.
"First, there was the flowers from the women's club... with a very kind note of sympathy."
Plus an invitation... to tell about my experiences on the fatal night.
And now the Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
"Well, let's face it, Janie."
"How much was my valuable time worth, yesterday?"
"85 cents an hour, plus carfare."
"I was just a plain, simple baby-sitter."
Then one day...
Congratulations on your graduation.
It's beautiful.
"Thank you, Kojima-kun."
I even managed to get a kiss.
"Next is, at last, Valentine's day."
Lately we're not selling well.
"Dad, I'm going to be using the kitchen."
- That's the working place of a pro!
"If you're doing things for your hobby, go do it in the kitchen at home."
"Since we don't have any customers, it should be fine, right?"
"Ah, Souta-kun."
Are you making chocolate again?
Should I help?
"- Thanks, Kaoruko-san."
"But I'm making this for my girlfriend,"
I have to do it on my own.
"- Well, I guess."
An adult man making chocolate for a woman.
"After asking to go to a confectionary school, then making things that won't even be for sale, it's hard to bear as a parent."
Then we should put them up for sale.
- Eh?
Souta-kun's chocolates.
"The prototypes from the other day were high quality, with a delicate impression."
I think it's on a higher level than the chocolatiers around here.
Really?
Thanks.
That's thanks to my DNA.
DNA?
"DNA, he says."
Alright.
"But, well, there really aren't many guys who make chocolates for their girlfriends."
"""Is it OK by you?"""
Oh!
"I know, it should have ended on a big laugh."
"But listen, we have a responsibility on As Yet Untitled to think of the title for the show."
"Every time I look at you now, I imagine you having sex in the woods."
Yeah!
I would say we go one better than that and we just say Queefing In The Woods.
Queefing In The Woods is an option.
Can you remember any of our conversation?
Bits and bobs.
I like...
What was your line for the judge?
"Where you go, ""Do you want to speak to the judge or do you want this?"""
Oh...
As a title?
For this show.
"It kind of gives the end game away, though, doesn't it?"
"""You can either sit with the judge or you can face this."""
"""You can face time or face this."""
You Can Face Time Or Face This.
What about Colour Me Orange?
I'd like to thank my guests -
"Grace Dent, David O'Doherty, Johnny Vegas, Sean Kelly."
You have been watching You Can Face Time Or You Can Face This.

"No, it's this thing with Alan Davies..."
"No, not QI."
He's doing something on his own for Dave.
I know he's got some massive tax bill.
This gets me out the house.
I only hope Alan's changed his hairstyle.
- I don't think we should talk about classes.
"Like, if-if you're taking playwriting with Sam Shepard,"
"It may hurt my heart,"
"But if you take intro to mime, I need to know everything."
I want to be with you when you buy your leotard and your beret.
Playwriting competitions-
"I think we can go out for the same ones,"
But we can't read each other's submissions.
"And looking forward, I guess it's the same thing"
With internships and jobs.
So the only things we can talk about openly
"Are-are politics,"
"""jersey shore""..."
And where we want to eat...
"Which reminds me, I actually,"
"Um, I need to get ready."
I'm gonna be late for breakfast at my dad's.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
"No, I'm sorry."
"I, uh, I have something."
"Oh, oh, is it something related to our list?"
"Actually, yeah."
"Well, thank you for not sharing."
See?
I can't believe how much easier that is.
Ooh!
Another sext session with your new b.F.?
"Okay, I'd hardly call Elliot a boyfriend."
Between me spending all my time with my mom
"And him being in every club in school,"
We haven't even been on a first date.
Hey.
What I really wanna do is just play basketball.
Basketball?
"I love it, always have."
I never miss a game on TV-- when my Dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
"Dude, you should do that."
You should join the basketball team right now.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my Dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your Dad what you want."
Really?
"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents."
Go to your Dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
"You know, you're right."
I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.
Sweet.
"Sit up properly, Bridon."
You know how strict your father is about posture.
"All right, dear, dinner's ready."
"Okay, let's eat!"
"Dad, I need to talk to you about something."
"Ooh, that sounds emotional!"
# What is it son #
# What's on your mind #
"# Whatever it is, you know your Dad has the time #"
"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
# If you can talk it you can sing it #
# You can lay down the rhythm and bring it #
"Okay, let's just focus on the positive, okay?"
- Mm-hmm.
"- I mean, I just got out of a relationship too, we've never been single at the same time, this could be fun."
"- Ah, I don't know."
"- No, it'll be good."
"You guys can go to clubs, and you can do ""special k,"""
"and, um, you can have sex with European backpackers."
"Okay, I haven't been single in a while."
You know what?
You guys are right.
I've got to get out of this apartment.
Take my mind off of him.
"Yes, yes, see?"
"Good, we'll go out tonight."
Yes.
"I mean, I'm already buzzed and wearing spanx."
I think that's the name of Chelsea handler's new book.
"Hmm, yeah."
Whitney is taped in front of a live studio audience.
"Don't lie, staying with me has been pretty awesome, right?"
"Yeah, this couch is surprisingly comfortable."
"Come on, dude, we both know you're not here for the couch."
You're here because your heart just got its ass kicked.
Right in the balls.
"And of all the people that you know, you came to me."
"Well, I didn't want to impose on Alex and Whitney, and..."
Bup bup bup bup bup.
I'm just happy somebody finally recognized
I'm the emotional go-to guy for our group.
I was actually just about to say that I...
Shh.
"Look, I used to be just like you, okay?"
His car number is MRX 4060.
"Sylvia, he alone is poised to win this year's derby."
"I'm sory Mr Daaga, Prakash couldn't deliver your gold to the right man."
Prakash?
Who Prakash?
I found your telephone number and address on him.
Are you talking about the Prakash who fell to death from a train?
"Yes, I remember. I read about him in the newspapers."
I am delighted to hear that you read newspapers.
But why did he keep my telephone number and address?
He could have told you.
Your misfortune.
He is dead.
The news of his death was a false news spread by us to cheat you.
He isn't dead.
He's alive and kicking.
He is alive?
And he has testified in the hospital itself.
"Don't you fret, Mr Daaga."
Prakash is dead.
I just wanted to see the change in colour ofyour face.
"These things are trivial, Inspector."
The court asks for evidence.
And as long as the police doesn't find any evidence against us it can't even shake us.
Little mouths don't open in front of elders.
Understand?
"Inspector Vijay, you have insulted my man."
I can sue you for this in Court.
"Well, Mr Daaga, you will have to produce evidence for this smack."
How can I help you in this matter?
Vijay is a close friend ofyours.
He is.
There was no ransom to be paid
"No song unsung, no wine untasted"
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
(SOBBING)
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
(SOBBING)
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed!
Now
Life has killed the dream
I dreamed
Have you anywhere to go?
No?
You need to get warm.
(FANTINE COUGHING)
BAMATABOIS:
What do you have for me?
PIMP:
"Here's our youngest, sir."
(SINGING) I don't want you
"You've got some nerve, you little slut."
It's damn filthy here!
The furniture and the mattresses are all covered in dust.
You beat those out before it starts snowing again...
"Can I do anything else for you, dear Anna?"
"Yes, make it so clean here that one can eat from the floor!"
- Before Karl returns home again...
- When does he come then?
"Then he'll ask me again what you have done in the meantime, and I can lie again..."
"Oh, Mrs John."
I'll get the child right away.
Mother's already in bed...
- Is Mr Hassenreuter there?
"- No, how come?"
Mrs John!
Good evening.
Mrs Knobbe!
"I'm so grateful to you, Mrs John."
That you can look after the little one for a few hours at least.
- It has to stay somewhere.
- Its neverending coughing and crying never lets me sleep.
I have to be on duty at night...
Won't you take a seat?
And all that after the difficult birth!
It's a blessing that it's so dark in the bar.
"Tell me, Mrs Knobbe, for how long have you been staying in bed?"
"For six days, Mrs John!"
Six days and then it's:
"""Out, we need the bed!"""
"Having children is no illness, says the health service."
Not the slightest consideration.
"When it comes to paying, they squeeze everyone."
But he won't let himself be squeezed...
- Tropic Thunder.
- Shooting Tropic Thunder.
"He was like, ""You won't believe where I've been."""
"He said, ""I've been in the jungle holding my guts and carrying my intestines over my shoulders through the forest."""
"We're like, ""Yeah, right, buddy."""
"Well, now I know what he means because I've seen the film."
This was such a different role for him.
Didn't he keep saying...
"Kept being like, ""I'm not really an asshole."""
"Like, ""I'm not really like this."" He was so good at it."
He kept saying he felt really bad because he was manhandling me and being so...
It's a pretty obnoxious character.
- But he's so not anything like that.
- He did it really well.
"I felt like the fattest girl in this fake club here, because I was."
That's so stupid.
Look at how gorgeous you are.
"Well, because I was..."
My face was completely obscured in shadow just then.
"This was, like, the coldest night ever."
- This is as bad as it got.
- Poor Alexis...
- It's true.
"...who has, you know..."
"Weighs, like, 5 pounds and didn't have any clothing."
"Also, we were like on..."
- We were near the bay.
- And on the water.
- You were right on the Hudson River.
- Hudson River.
"It was, I don't know, 3 or 4 in the morning and it was probably about 5 or 10 degrees."
- This was the day...
It was a non-alcoholic reception.
"I was like, ""I hope they get diarrhea on the honeymoon."""
That's not a very nice thing to say.
"I was like, ""Really?"
"I was gonna say I hope they die tonight."""
Nothing gets me on the dance floor like a big old pint of sweet tea!
"I like to be fully present in the moment, fully aware I'm not a good dancer."
The sweet tea reminds me every step of the way.
I've used a Fleshlight before.
"Guys, don't be like that."
Don't be like that.
"I was at a show, doing a festival in Texas."
They gave all the performers a gift bag.
In the gift bag there was a free Fleshlight.
I don't know if they gave us those as a joke.
I didn't take it as one.
I pulled myself aside... and immediately reprioritized my entire afternoon.
"I said, ""Rory, we skipped lunch before."
Didn't kill us then.
"Will not kill us now."""
"""Fuck this thing!"" Out loud in a hotel lobby."
"""I gotta get my dick out!"
"I gotta do it!"""
"Some women in this crowd, you're like, ""I think it's gross he used a Fleshlight."""
Some women don't care.
"Some women still think I said ""flashlight."""
Now you know who you are.
So do the people around you.
"""Well, then what is it?"" ""I don't fucking know."
Dude fucking loves 9/11.
I don't know.
"I don't know."""
"I don't know, I've had feelings for Jamie for quite a long time."
Really?
Yeah.
Romantic feelings?
"Yeah, all my sexual fantasies about Jamie Oliver don't really actually contain sex."
What do they contain?
"Well, it's really, it's sort of..."
"He's in the kitchen, he's cooked me a roast chicken."
"And then he, like, draws me a bath."
"And then I, when I come out of the bath, I come back into the kitchen, and he's just, like, washed up and tidied everything away."
"Oh, stop it!"
And that's it.
Did you say sexual fantasy?
"Yeah, but that's the thing about being with Jamie, there's no pressure to put out."
Yeah.
That's what I like about him.
"I mean, in this fantasy, though, is the bath really hot?"
"And then you look down, and there's carrots in it as well?"
"You'd want to worry about, like, if I was his wife, I'd feel really sad."
Jules?
"Yeah, Jules, Jules."
"Because, like, he'd come home and go..."
She don't like her.
Yeah.
"Um, if I was his current first wife... ..Jules, and he was telling me, ""Oh, you look gorgeous."""
"""I just saw you on the BBC calling a trout gorgeous!"
"""How am I supposed to feel?"""
"He's got so many kids, in't he?"
"It's like Daisy Boo, Poppy, Honey, River Rocket, he's running out of names!"
"Next one he'll be like,"
"""What should we call this, Spaghetti Pete?"
"I don't know."""
"Tom, what do I do now?"
Frankie.
You were always interested in politics and history.
I remember you talking about Hitler back in '33.
"Yeah, I still read a lot."
I get good stuff in there.
"You were around the old-timers, who built the organization of the families, basing them on the old Roman legions, with ""regimes,"" ""capos"" and ""soldiers""."
-And it worked.
"-Yeah, it worked."
"Those were the great old days, you know."
We was like the Roman Empire.
The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
"Yeah, it was once."
Frankie.
When a plot against the Emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?
Only the rich guys.
The little guys got knocked off and all their estates went to the Emperors.
"Unless they went home and killed themselves, then nothing happened."
And their families were taken care of.
"That was a good break, a nice deal."
Yeah.
They went home and sat in a hot bath opened up their veins and bled to death.
And sometimes they had a little party before they did it.
"Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels."
"Thanks, Tom."
Thanks.
"-See you, Tom."
"-Addio, Frankie."
Kay.
You have to go.
They took a cast to Aberdeen Proving Ground and shot a missile through it.
They showed me video.
What can I do for you?
"Sir, there's something very important we need to talk to you about."
What?
"Well, it's delicate and surprising and I wanna make sure your first reaction is measured, so I'd like us to..."
I'm a recovering alcoholic.
- Really?
"- Yes, sir."
- Is there anybody left who's not?
- Sir...
- For how long?
- I'm sorry?
- How long have you been in recovery?
- My last drink it was the year I was 22.
- Did you say 22?
"- Yes, sir."
- You haven't had a drink since 22?
- That's right.
- I didn't start drinking till I was 25.
- What the hell do you guys count...
"- There's a history in my family, and I had a few experiences in college."
I liked beer a lot.
So I started going to meetings.
- I'm pretty sure if I stopped...
- Twenty-two?
"- Yes, sir."
- You and James Bond ought to team up.
- I don't... .
- Don't worry.
"He's ordering a watered-down martini, and Leo, what is this meeting going on across the hall?"
- We can talk about it later.
Laura's fingerprints were all over the section on sexual harassment.
She was thinking of suing him?
"Well, he might have tried to trade a promotion for sexual favors."
"She balked, and he withdrew the promotion."
"""Fearsome Phil""."
The guy's already got a reputation.
Lawsuit might have cost him big time.
So he killed her.
Guy's seen too many operas.
Every union in building's got grievances against Fearsome Phil.
He's a rage-a-holic.
Thinks he's the only artist in the building.
Can't imagine working with someone like that.
"Long as he keeps filling the seats, management won't touch him."
But an harassment complaint...
- Who we talking about?
- Laura Booth.
Laura?
You're kidding me.
"Yeah, he promised to make her first violin."
You're her union rep.
We thought she might have talked to you. / No.
Laura was pretty single-minded about getting where she wanted to go.
But I was sure she was off-limits to Reinhardt.
- Because of her age?
- No.
Reinhardt's had an on-and-off thing with Laura's mother.
With Gillian Booth?
Really?
"If she knew he was harassing her daughter, could she hurt him?"
"Well, singers talk to other singers."
She could make it very hard for him to get hired somewhere else.
-You look lovely.
"-l look good, huh?"
You look wonderful.
Be careful.
Congratulations.
I love you.
"Don't paint any more religious pictures, please."
God be with you.
We always called each other goodfellas.
You'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us. """
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian.
To become a member of a crew you've got to be 100 percent Italian so they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
"See, it's the highest honor they can give you."
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
"It also means you can fuck around with anybody, just as long as they aren't also a member."
It's like a license to steal.
It's a license to do anything.
"Hey, how many years ago was it you was made?"
"Ah, I'm an old-timer."
Thirty years ago.
"30 years, huh?"
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a fuckin' pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
Educational.
I left to escape my foes here and to confront another foe on the field of battle.
But I realized that my only true enemy had accompanied me all the way.
Who was that?
"Welcome home, brother."
You've changed.
Though I cannot yet see how.
You soon will.
How is your wife?
"Oh, you know her."
Bouncing through life.
"Well, that was fun!"
"Can't possibly see the King now, unless he likes being vomited upon."
You must see a doctor.
Tell His Highness to come immediately.
That's really not necessary.
I'm certain it was the pastries I had last night.
"Your Highness, you must see a doctor, given all that's happened of late."
"Oh, I see."
"Yes, perhaps, you should call for a doctor."
An invitation from the King.
An invitation from the King.
You must send a message to my dressmaker and the Monseur Cornereau in Paris.
Tell them they must come to the palace immediately.
Monsieur Cornereau?
"He makes fireworks, you idiot!"
"Queen of Versailles, that's what he called me, and I'm going to show him how Queens welcome home their Kings."
"This is most heartening news, Sire!"
I was deaf to your advice.
I shall not be again.
Even the Lord Jesus was lost in the widerness.
"In three weeks, we shalll celebrate Easter, Sire."
- Just the AV guys again.
"DC Sonic, they're replacing the surround system in the theatre."
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...
She's coming back tonight?
"Carol, is she coming back tonight?"
"Yes, sir."
Wheels down at 1845.
"Yes, of course."
"As many of you are well-aware, this is my last week here so I wanna make this clear to everybody:"
If there are any congratulatory cakes or any of that nonsense I will be compelled to use deadly force.
I hate you.
I hate you all.
Thank you.
No incendiaries in the White House.
"All right, baby, I just gotta get my weapon real quick."
"You're gonna have to sign out, sir."
Hello.
You guys here for the tour?
Do you think we can see where you'll be working?
"- Yeah, sure."
- Great.
"Gather around, everyone, gather around."
My name is Donnie and I'll be your guide today as we take a walk through American history.
"I wanna give you all a warm Washington, D.C. welcome to the White House where each year we get millions of guests from every corner of the globe."
Where are you folks from?
"Washington, D.C."
- Bad choice.
"What about you, ma'am?"
- Nebraska.
What brings you to the White House?
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK snuck Marilyn Monroe in.
What's with the gym bag?
"Just got back from a ""Boxercise"" class at the gym."
"""Boxercise""?"
What kind of queer shit is that?
- I'm learning self-defense.
"- You wanna learn self-defense, you come to Daddy."
"I mean, all during the '60s, before I met my whore wife, I was a boxer."
They called me Frankie Fast Hands.
"Frankie Fast Hands, everybody."
"Yeah, keep livin' in the past, Dad."
"Is this about that stupid Million Dollar Baby movie, Dee?"
"No, actually, Mac, it's about being left with a mugger... because my chickenshit brother and his friends ditched me."
- You ditched your sister?
- Absolutely.
- With a mugger...
- The guy had a knife.
Of course we did.
What were we supposed to do?
"If I was there, I would have used my Frankie Fast Hands technique."
Technique don't mean shit out on the streets.
Guys have knives.
Yeah.
"In boxing, there are rules."
"On the streets, we ain't got no rules."
Ain't no rules out on the streets.
"- You guys got no rules on the streets, you."
"- Oh, please."
"Will you stop talking about the streets... you three jackasses, like you've been there?"
"I mean, any underground street fight in Philadelphia, you'd find tons of technique."
- You think you could teach me?
- In a month I'll have you kicking all their asses.
Right.
Where did he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes.
A headpiece like that one.
Except around the edges which were rougher.
"In the center the Frenchman had a bit of a crystal... and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They've made the calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig."
Out away from the camp.
"The well of the souls, uh?"
"Come, come, look!"
Look here!
"Sit down, come!"
Sit down.
What is it?
This is a warning...
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
What about the height of the staff?
Did Belloq get it off of here?
"Yes, it is here..."
"This was the old way, this means six kadams high - 'about seventy-two inches'"
Wait!
And take back one kadam... to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.
You remember the question 4?
"No, of course not."
Addons to the fourth question is:
"""With how many men you sleep"""
That's not your job.
Addons That's not my job?
Then you add the Addons test results in your public profile?
"Are you happy and Addons to believe that you Kinky,"
Addons but fear to tell the truth.
Addons
- With how many people are sleeping?
"- I say, it's none of your business."
I bet there are 10 in the record.
"Addons Well, Gwen."
Addons Let me help you to explain this.
Addons you have access to a lot of forums ...
"Addons But, you are active, from 5 to 15 times a week."
Virtual reality.
Addons Your avatar shows a white rose ...
"Addons And your screen name is ""Terry Bomb""."
Addons So Terry bomb ...
Addons How many people have you slept with?
- Nine
Not have to end like this
Addons you hide behind a user name behind the avatar
"Addons But wherever you go Apapunyang you download, upload, is Online locked and stored"
Addons A trail of information available for those who want it.
"Addons downloads fact, every website visited You've visited in the last 1 month"
Addons And we made some discoveries.

So what's wrong with cheering myself up with a little denial
"And a ""Gossip Girl"" blast or two?"
"Nothing, I guess, but you can always make it right"
With whoever you take down online.
And who knows if Chuck's even gonna have time
To do that with Lily or not?
"Morning, sunshine."
"I've got the Dom '95, your favorite."
"No, thank you."
And I much prefer Roederer nowadays.
"Oh, I apologize."
Nadine left behind some of her intimates.
She must have wanted an excuse to come back.
Or maybe she just left in a hurry.
"If you're here to mock me, I'm not in the mood..."
Unless you have some punishment in mind.
"We've broken up, Chuck,"
"And frankly, I don't care what you do."
But I can't sit by and just watch you avoid Lily.
I'm actually quite busy with work.
"Well, you had time for Nadine."
"Trust me, she was work."
"And I promise you, Lily is not sitting around,"
Wondering when she's going to hear from Chuck bass.
Justify not seeing Lily all you want.
You and I both know what this is.
"You've lost Bart,"
"Elizabeth betrayed you,"
And the thought of losing Lily terrifies you.
Please.
Spare me your N.Y.U. Freshman psych analysis.
- Great song.
- It's a great song.
"I'm seeing some of the faces in the background and remembering all these people that we spent, like, two weeks with."
There was one female extra that had a thing for Kat.
- One female extra?
- Just one.
"One that came up and said something, but half a dozen had their eye on you."
"A little, like, ""Oh, yeah."""
"There was one female extra, blond girl in a hat, female extra who worked her way into every shot in the first third of the movie."
Really?
"You know what, I have to say it was a point of frustration."
"Because I felt like every shot we cut to, she'd snuck in there."
We should call Rafi and see if he has anything he wants to say.
All you have to do is put an ADR...
"Put an ADR line like, ""Oh, the O'Malley triplets are here tonight."""
- Jeez.
- They're all over the place.
This moment was reshot.
"- Yeah, this was reshot."
- That thing that just happened.
"Oh, yeah."
"Now, Pete, did we use the reshot kiss or the original kiss here?"
- We reshot the kiss.
- The reshot kiss.
"- Okay, because there were a few..."
- Why did you reshoot the kiss?
Because Rafi wasn't handsome enough in the background.
"If you look now, look at the face he makes."
- Not handsome.
- It is stunning.
- Everyone's...
"- I mean, look at that."
But this money has been accruing interest?
How much money?
TONY:
$327 million and change.
"Boss, I'm seeing multiple attempts to hack into this account over the last week."
It's got to be Amanda Baylor.
Baylor was hired to steal the AUTEC file and this money?
Blackmail was a diversion.
It explains why they never really said anything that hurt us.
"We're watching the AUTEC files, they have a better shot getting in and out of the bank account undetected."
It's all about the Benjamins.
"Well, it looks like Baylor's taking another stab at the account right now."
"She's accessing remotely, and she didn't bother burying her IP so deep this time."
She did not expect us to look for her there.
"Right, I got her."
Getting a Wi-Fi ping.
"Ziva, DiNozzo, go..."
She's just off the I-95.
I'm texting you the coordinates.
Are you sure this is the place?
"Well, what happened?"
"You don't trust the, uh, authority of McMaps?"
(truck horn blows nearby)
(whispering):
All right.
It's like Silence of the Lambs meets Scooby-Doo.
Freeze!
Hands up!
Do I look like I'm running?
"Amanda Baylor, you have the right... (sniffs) to take a bath."
You smell like a wild goat.
I've been busy.
they find each other and reunite.
I went there every day hoping I'd remember the title.
But you know what?
That scene's not actually from a movie.
huh?
Aren't you gonna get in trouble for hacking into corporate databases and school records?
Little late to be worrying about that!
We're trying to find Takizawa's graduation photo over here!
Got it!
No wonder we couldn't find him!
Freakin' Juiz.
She took everything related to Takizawa Akira on the net and changed it to Iinuma Akira!
what's in No. 09's logs?
There's nothing like that in his...
It's gone!
All evidence of Takizawa Akira's history is being erased!
Even the Seleção logs!
what?
Then they've been erasing the logs when we weren't looking?
Chill out. so I have my PC set up to save a copy of all the logs as they're created.
master!
you're making me blush.
it's like a defense system and attack bot rolled into one!
you ever seen anything like this?
!
bring up Takkun's request details again.
look here.
use their image recognition system.
Pants!
Wha...
Juiz!
Iinuma Akira is going to completely replace Takizawa Akira.
"No, there are 3 more barrels upstairs."
"Nicholai, go and get them."
PROPERTY OF THE US ARMY
"When the American military ordered the canisters destroyed, the authorities here 'followed the instructions'."
"It wasn't until later, that these surfaced in the underground."
and was put here for safe keeping.
It's ironic that it is the American government that wants them.
"Let's get something absolutely clear, the American government has nothing todo with this transaction."
Of course Mr. Garrison.
"Now, how many do you want for your personal use?"
All of them.
Nicholai!
What are you doing?
Excuse me.
Nicholai...
Brains  and we make your favorite snack foods too.
Hybra Tech...
Hey Pyro.
Get moving.
You are going to be late for school.
I am using one of my sick days.
Stop with this!
You're burn the whole house down.
I can start with your room if you like.
"You are having a good old time, aren't you?"
If Mom and Dad was still alive.
But they're not are they?
Why don't you just blow up the whole neighborhood while you are at it?
"Morning, uncle Charlie."
Don't forget to mauld the lawn after school.
Sure.
How was the convention in Bakersfield?
- Gordi.
- And Toe.
"Guys, time to put on a foil."
"Play some old-time hockey, like Eddie Shore."
- Dit Clapper.
- And Toe Blake.
- And Gordie Howe.
- Gordie.
"- You all right, goalkeep?"
"- Riley, you okay?"
"Hell, no."
"Look here, you okay?"
- Yeah.
- You sure?
Great!
Good!
Get him again!
This is how you get the jersey over your opponent's head.
"Today, if they have the balls to show up, the Newman boys face the much-hated Scranton Night Hawks."
"Two-time runners up for the Hounds, the Hawks are reloaded and they are as tough as they got."
"Holy smoke, the Newman team takes to the ice in a manner that can only be termed tremendously tacky."
They have donned the sacred shrouds of the Chiefs.
This is a sacrilege.
"Yeah, tacky like that time when you got sloshed on communion wine."
"Well, yes, exactly like that."
"0-1, same old butt-whopping."
It is clear these Newman boys are decidedly doing disservice to the lasting legacy of the Chiefs.
"Hey, Riley, I think it's time."
"Toe, Dit, Gordi, let's do it!"
"Okay, boys, make your daddies proud."
"Talk about their family ties, sports fans."
It appears the offspring of the Hanson brothers are making their first appearance as part of this ragtag team.
What are they lugging now?
Steamed cake!
We were supposed to kill this boy
Is this a store room or a mortuary?
"Sir, Principal and ISO officers are coming here to inspect"
I was asked to tell you to keep the students here even if the bell goes
- Even after the bell rings?
"- Yes, sir"
Who is this?
For 3 days no time to even breathe 1 minute
Time to ring the bell
Let me ring the bell
What happened?
You fainted on that day after you drank juice?
- When?
- On Sports day
"Yes, why?"
Who gave you that juice?
My name?
Then this book should also have more copies
NSS students gave me
Who told them to distribute the juice?
I don't remember now
"- Forgot, Shiva"
- Think...think
Then?
KS sir had arranged it on the table
What are you doing here when Inspection is going on?
In the absence of a teacher don't you know it is wrong to access the computer?
"I know, sir"
"Why are you not in class, sir?"
You've changed your shirt too
- They go quicker than The mail On Sunday.
- Any chance of using the little girls' room?
"Oh, er, top of the stairs, first right."
"Mind if I come, too, hilly, love?"
"- What are you doing here, Pam?"
- Just welcoming the new girl.
"Oh, I thought you had Weight Watchers on Tuesday morning."
"And to think, you were worried about making friends."
Oh!
Uh.
There just seems to be so much more community spirit here.
"- Everything OK up there, ladies?"
"- (Choking) Fine, thanks, Jerry."
- Joyce won't be joining you.
- CamiIIa says otherwise.
I don't give a fuck what your handler thinks.
So take your basket of shit and go back to your kennel.
- Likewise.
- Oh!
"Now, if any of your crew so much as fart in the same room as Joyce, we'II turn the lot of you into organic mince."
Nice big airing cupboard you've got up there.
Is Pam OK?
pelvic floor gave up the ghost after baby number five.
Didn't manage to make it to the bathroom.
- Oh.
- Sends her apologies.
"Oh, you poor love."
I know how fond you are of that trouser suit.
Margaret.
I thought I couId show you round little Stempington.
I haven't really started unpacking.
There's someone I'm dying for you to meet.
When do we start?
Today?
Can we make it official?
I don't mind it.
Ah!
Can I say on SNS that I'm dating Sin Joon Young?
Welcome.
"Noona, what's with the both of you?"
"I don't know, I think she caused a problem again."
She's been like this for thirty minutes.
Do you think you'll die like that?
Did you cause another problem?
I'll get fired from Sin Joon Young's documentary.
Huh?
I think I'll get fired from Sin Joon Young's documentary.
Why?
I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a variety show as a documentary.
"I mean, I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a documentary as a variety show."
"No, no."
I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a documentary as a documentary.
- What are you saying?
- I think she went crazy.
I'm not crazy!
"Why are you always only like that towards me, Unni?"
"Since you look down on me like that, everyone else in the world doesn't take me seriously and looks down on me."
"You can't even make a sound to Sin Joon Young,"
"You don't say anything about him being crazy, but how come you only call me psycho?"
Am I that easy?
This little...
Hey!
Was I unable to say anything to Sin Joon Young?
"The real question is, why are you being like that to me?"
"And then they come in all dramatic for that final ""yes."""
"So, it goes a little something like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"And then they get all dramatic for that final ""yes."""
"Say, ""Yes!"
"Oh."""
I don't think that's how they do it.
I'd have to hears it again.
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Yeah.
"Yeah, porno girls do that."
"But only when the porno guys aren't busy finding some super-low tone and repeating over and over again,"
"""Ah, fuck."""
"""Ah, fuck."""
"I takes a bit offense to that, Miss Katy, as I have a naturally low voice, and I do likes to say, ""Ah, fuck."""
"""Ah, fuck."""
Exceptin' I don't do it in pornos.
"Well, then you should do voiceovers for English-dubbed foreign pornos, Dan, because that was a text book ""ah, fuck, ah, fuck."""
"Why thank you, Miss Katy."
"I've never had any complaints from any of my sexual companions about my ""ah, fuck, ah, fuck."""
KATY:
"Let me hear yours, Dary."
"Well, I..."
"I'm confused still on the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's."""
"So, Wayne, it's like, uh,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes""?"
"See, it's not as if it's a fuckin' question, Dary, is it?"
You're saying it like it's a question.
"So, it's like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"You're gettin' closer, Dary, but what you want to do is put a little pepper on the end of it."
You just want to put a little pepper on the end of it.
"Like, ""Yes!"""
"""Yes!"""
Do not listen!
It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."
-She's convinced that--
-There is only one.
"What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?"
Teresa.
What a lovely name.
"""I command you..."
"""...by the Judge of the Living and the Dead..."
"""...to depart from this servant of God!"
"""It's the power...."""
"Stick your cock up her ass, you mother-fucking worthless cock sucker!"
Be silent!
"""Our Father, who art in Heaven..."

Hallowed be Thy name.
"""Thy kingdom come."

"""Give us this day our daily bread."

"""And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one."""

That superinjunction cost a lot of money.
DOORBELL
LAUGHTER
It's Rhys Darby!
Welcome.
Wow!
"Rhys Darby, ladies and gentlemen."
Have a seat.
Hi!
How are you?
Rhys Darby from Flight of the Conchords.
"Now then, everybody tonight has come dressed up because it's party time."
Are you a big partygoer?
"Oh, I'm king of the parties."
Really?
Not really.
LAUGHTER
Did you used to go...?
"Do you remember at the school disco at the end of the night, all having a great time, and then they'd play Happy Christmas (War Is Over)?"
# So this is Christmas... # And that was when all your mates would pair off with girls and I would be stood at the edge of the dance floor with my nose pressed against the window pane.
A metaphorical window pane.
Or were you one of the boys who managed to nab a girl for that important last dance/snog?
"Well, I'll admit"
I'm a keen dancer.
"And...and what I lacked in the initial, social, conversational period"
I would more than make up for once the song's come on.
I really clear my own space.
You can ask anyone and I am probably the hottest dancer that I know.
"Well, Rhys, I mean, we have a band."
We have a rug.
"We visited so many pool halls that day and night, I couldn't begin to remember them all."
Barbara's 24 hours were about up... that is...
until your figured our pool bets.
"According to my calculations, you owe me through dinnertime, which is 6:00 p.m. in Bayonne."
Right.
My paranoia was in full bloom.
"Every time we came out of one of those pool halls, the blue sedan was cruising by."
"Even after we switched from the bus to the car, his tailing didn't improve."
It was almost like he wanted to be spotted.
Barbara?
Hmm?
Are you a girl who gets nervous in a car?
Never.
Wah!
"Barbara,"
I'm going to the bathroom.
"In two minutes, you go to the bathroom."
But I don't have to go to the bathroom.
"Please, go to the bathroom."
But I...
I don't have to go to the bathroom.
Please.
Okay.
But I don't have to.
"When somebody drives a car that tries too hard to be average... and sports a haircut with white sidewalls, government."
But why would the government care about Barbara's missing fiancé?
That's funny.
Higgins usually has the dogs greet me.
"Yeah, me too."
"Except today he was in a really, really good mood."
Kept laughing and saying something about busing.
"Why don't you make yourself at home, T.C.?"
Just then...
Seo Yoon Jae's spirit thought his body to be dead and selfishly rushed into my body.
Yoon Jae...is not the kind of person to selfishly take someone else's body.
Whatever.
"Without any choice, my spirit went into Seo Yoon Jae's body."
This all happened because Seo Yoon Jae went into the wrong body.
Yoon Jae is a person of discretion.
He's not someone to make mistakes about his place like that.
Whatever.
Whatever!
This one has to leave...
There will be some sort of a solution whether it be just another switch-a-roo.
Yoon Jae...
How did this happen?
Why did you go to a place like that?
What?
A place like that?
I don't like..places like this either!
"Yoon Jae doesn't drink carbonated drinks, so can you drink something else?"
What?
"This isn't your body, but Yoon Jae's body."
"Until things go back to normal, I hope that you treat it preciously."
Preciously?
How?
"Just like Yoon Jae's always done, when you're thirsty, drink water instead of carbonated beverages."
Also the weather is chilly and this is thin.
Don't you have anything thicker and warmer?
You weren't even examined thoroughly earlier...
Oh my...
"Oh my, you're scraped here."
What do we do?
Wait a second.
But every bit of you hammering away at my wall of denial is what finally brought it down.
So I'm here to tell you thank you...
Because now I feel like I can finally move forward with my life.
"You're welcome, Louis."
And I think that this means that you're officially ready.
"- Uh, for what?"
- To take back the associates.
"Okay, Donna, no, I appreciate that."
But they're yours now.
"They were never mine, Louis."
I was always just taking care of them for you.
I don't know how I can repay you.
You just did.
♪♪
♪♪
"Louis, if you're here for the Stevenson brief,"
I can have it to you in the morning.
"Go home, Brian."
Am I fired?
"Nope, there's just more to life than working here."
Am I being punked?
"No, not at all."
"It's just that you have a new supervisor starting tomorrow, and he would like you to get a good night's sleep."
And he told you to tell me that?
"Oh, Jesus, Brian, please, will you work with me?"
I'm the new supervisor.
"And listen, I am sorry for saying all those horrible things to you about undedicated."
I can't even imagine how you balance being a new dad with this workload.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
"Before you go, I got you a little something."
"Louis, this is the best onesie a man has ever gotten another man."
Fast scan is negative.
"He's got some bruising behind his left ear, so we'll also need a head C.T."
"Thanks, man."
Sam...
It looks okay?
"Uh, you've got a stab wound to your abdomen."
"If you ask me, you're lucky that's all you got."
What about Tammy and... and Michelle?
Is the baby okay?
"Oh, so you're worried about them now?"
"A little bit late for that, don't you think?"
"So he says, ""she's not dead."
"She's just electroencephalographically challenged."""
So it looks like everybody is settling in.
Yes.
"Thank you, Dr. Bennett."
It's good to be here.
Okay.
"Well, if you, uh, need anything, just let me know."
My door is always open.
Interesting dynamic.
"Even a group of top-notch, einstein-type professionals feel the urge to get out of the room when the boss comes in."
"Oh, well... they'll warm up once we all get to know each other."
Yeah.
So have you had the chance to see Violet and Luke?
"Pete's been telling me it's a bad time, politely, as he blocks the door and refuses to let me pass."
H... has he said anything to you?
"Um, they're... kinda not talking to me up there."
"But, uh, Addison and I actually had a real conversation this morning, so hopefully things will get back to normal soon."
What?
"Nothing, nothing."
"It's just... well, another interesting dynamic."
"Be damned to you and your rag, sir."
My Rifles march at dawn.
"South, sir."
"Good night, Miss."
Lieutenant Sharpe!
Surprised to see me Richard?
Oh you've done a grand job a grand job
"But now, at dawn tomorrow, with the help of my agent,"
Comandante Teresa whom believe you've already met
I want you to seize the chapel of Torrecastro and hold it against all-comers until Major Vivar has raised the gonfalon of Sant'lago over the chapel roof.
Seize Torrecastro?
With six men and a straggle of Spaniards?
It can't be done.
"May I remind you of our main mission, sir?"
- To find a missing gentleman
"- Not now, Richard."
Our mission is Torrecastro.
Spain is a sleeping tiger.
"If the people of Torrecastro rise up, even for an hour, the shock will shake the whole of Spain."
"- Carry on, sir."
- Rise p?
"Do you really believe men will fight and die for a rag on a pole, sir?"
"You do, Richard."
You do.
Richard!
I knew you would not march to Torrecastro for a superstition.
I'm like you.
"I don't believe in virgins or holy candles, but I believe in Spain."
I had to choose between Spain and Richard Sharpe.
- I had no choice!
- You did your duty.
Now I must do mine.
"All we have to do is to get you a real show tonight, then Eddie can crawl around surreptitiously, change the audience's watches back to the time you blagged the store."
"Yes, yes, I know just the venue."
'Très chic.
Très bona.
"'Yeah, only the nicest young ladies need apply. '"
"A peepshow, Filthy?"
What if Tarby finds out?
I'll be thrown out of the Royal Order of the Charitable Self-Publicising Showbiz Bog Otters.
Don't worry about the Bog Otters.
They were in here themselves half an hour ago.
They had to leave cos they run out of 50p's.
How's my boy Richie doing?
"That audience are getting a bit restive at the moment, trying to see if bouncers really do bounce."
Don't mither the act.
"He's got enough to concern him, what with being crap."
You were supposed to be changing the audience's watches while they ogled the girlies.
I was trying to but the hands are moving too quickly.
Get on with it.
"Right, that's it."
"Richie, you're on."
"God, I'm not ready."
"How do I look, darling?"
"Not good, daughter."
"Très, très bollocks."
- He's absolutely bloody right.
- Philistines.
I'd better do my superstitions.
What are you doing?
"Titch ""Oo-er, madam, don't start me off"" Juicy always did this before a show."
- But he was notoriously awful.
"- God, you're right."
"Boys and girls, lads and lasses, please welcome to the stage a very funny man indeed, the world famous Mr, er..."
"Whatever, dude."
Nice.
"So, I went to the big meeting."
In two months the town will vote whether or not to close us down.
"Now, that will give people time to think."
"- What if they vote, ""Yes?"""
- I don't know.
"Look, what's with you guys?"
Don't you remember who we are?
Sonny Newman founded this home before there ever was a Charlestown.
His dog Dexter saved the entire city from the great flood of 1938 with one proud woof.
"The amazing Hanson brothers, whose ferocious might and legendary skill won the Federal Cup for this town in 1977."
They lived in this very house when they were boys just like us.
"Gentlemen, we are the Hanson brothers."
We are the children of the great Sonny Newman.
"We are the princes of Charlestown, and we will never be forgotten!"
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Double dessert for everybody!
- Yes!
Except for you!
"Time was, we never had a free skate on a Saturday."
Everybody'd be playing hockey.
I'm talking from toddlers to old guys like me.
"Good or bad, it didn't matter."
People loved it.
When the Chiefs won the title in '77...
I won a couple of banners myself playing junior in the '80s.
- You know what they used to call me?
- What's that?
- Fireball Rick.
- Are you serious?
You hungry?
Want to go out?
Tired.
"Yeah, all right."
I need to tell you what I found out about Ronan Murphy.
"What, you looked into it?"
Murphy was a person of interest in the inquiry into the murder of Tommy Hunter.
In what way?
Ronan Murphy was one of Hunter's closest associates.
We never interviewed him.
Major Violent Crime did.
Ronan Murphy was interviewed about the conspiracy Lindsay Denton was convicted of?
Looks like it.
None of this was in the file.
It must been doctored.
You didn't get any of this from me.
"Well, well..."
Who'd have thought?
What are you after?
You ever heard the name Ronan Murphy?
Why d'you ask?
Just thought you might have heard the name.
Are you reopening my case?
"Forget it, all right?"
That's not why I'm asking.
"Look, I don't expect you to care, Steve, but I'm never, ever going to get back to being that person that I was before all this happened."
"You know, the only thing that kept me sane, the thing that got me up in the morning, was being a police officer."
"I want to find the people that framed me, Steve, and I believe..."
"Well, I HOPE that you do, too."
The audio file on this phone is as embarrassing to you as it is to me.
"Believe you me, I've got it backed up."
I don't enjoy threatening people.
Where is she?
This did not happen on my watch.
"When she clocked in I was still in my pj's, jamming to Luther Vandross."
"Wow, this is a beautiful setup."
They're running themselves?
"No, Mrs. R."
They're being run remotely.
Amanda Baylor.
Are you there?
ZIVA:
"Amanda Baylor, 28, unmarried, freelance encryption specialist, graduated from MIT with a degree in applied mathematics."
What else?
"That's pretty much it, boss."
"With the exception of a few personnel files from the Iron Crypt, it's like she doesn't exist."
"Well, she existed enough to have stolen that file from AUTEC and set up a pretty good alibi."
How often was she logged in at work when she wasn't actually there?
Can we link her to Phillip Wickes?
We have not been able to tie Baylor to anyone at Wickes Steel.
Not even the board stooges.
Wickes is still only talking to them and only about pushing paper.
What about a line from Amanda Baylor to our dead guy?
ZIVA:
"Baylor does not have a history with firearms, but it is still possible"
(phone rings) that she shot Ridgeway.
"Yeah, Abbs."
Tell her you're on your way.
I'm on my way.
"There, there it is."
I don't see it.
She's right.
There was a bounce.
Damn it.
"Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down right there.
You should have seen him.
His eyes were-were crazy.
Just 'cause he changed the channel?
"No, no, bro, wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first-class airfare, seven nights at the Kohiko Hotel all-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of The Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now."
"And since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue, we're throwing in $1 million!"
She's the reason that Dawkins broke out of prison?
She just won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
"Okay, but why her?"
"Like, there's not enough rich people on this island?"
"She's away from home, she's out of her element."
Maybe Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
I need everything on Dana.
Okay?
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rental."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
That's it.
It matches the description of the car Dawkins stole.
Five-O.
We'll take it from here.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
Food or water?
We have been fighting side by side forthree years.
Should I feel pityfor some criminal scum?
"-To make a long story short, do you have such people?"
- Surely.
-How many?
- 11 people.
Eleven.
I take all ofthem.
"- No, there is no wayto take all 11."
"- Captain, I hate repeating my requests."
"Sergei Pavlovich, you do not have the slightest idea who they are."
"Two deserters, three military criminals... who started a drunk fight and gave a beating to the duty officer."
There is one rapist and a maraudeer.
These two have capital punishment sentences.
So go and tell them that their Motherland gives them their last chance... to wash their shane offwith their blood.
That's all.
Filfil this order.
-May I ask you a question?
- Come on.
is lieutenant Malyutin guilty of anything?
Why should he be?
Otherwise you wouldn't be sending him out on such a mission.
I do not have any information on that man.
It is very good that you do not.
And do you have any information on me?
Answer quickly!
"You have gone huts, accountant..."
Get outa here!
You'll rememberthis day!
"That's how it is, brother."
-Do you understand the assignment?
"-Yes, sir."
hey were slightly anarchic.
And that was their appeal.
Today is our last day in the UK  for a while you know e're going straight into the ak e Me Home tour for 1 0 months.
U.S.A!
U.S.A!
he first time  it was literally just the UK that we were playing out to.
"Whereas now, it's all around the world."
hen we started getting ready for it we just knew that it had to be good.
think we felt lik e we had a lot to prove.
he fans have spread the word about One Direction so much that I think it might be a little bit different this time.
e never expected any of that so now there's something to live up to.
"And if we don't live up to it, then I don't know what happens next."
You hear about bands who've-- hey've come and they've gone.
don't wanna be one of those.
""" Madison Square Garden."
"The world's most famous arena."""
Now that sums it up.
"I just don't know where it goes from here, really."
It's mad.
I'm really nervous.
"Me too, bro."
"Proper nervous, Iike."
So crazy.
Madison Square Garden.
No way did you ever think that you would be coming to Madison Square Garden...
-...to see them perform.
-No.
Here we are hours before we head off to see our babies.
Yeah.

"Once inside, I could direct the flow of electrons through the wires hidden in the walls."
I was able to find my way to Amanda's room.
"Finally, I got my message through."
"And finally, we would have our chance to talk."
Phase Three.
MEET ME AT THE RACK ALARM CODE 12154
You owe me... big.
"Trager, you really embraced your inner Hallmark card."
You've gone soft.
I know.
You can cut the irony with a spoon.
I just hope it's worth it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
All this for puppy love?
"I mean, seriously, what are the odds that the person you're gonna spend the rest of your life with is literally the girl next door?"
"I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo on the whole love vibe, but I don't want to set Kyle up to get his heart chopped, sliced, and diced."
"God, that felt good."
Did you see where I put the napkins?
Is there a garlic convention in here?
Too much?
Never.
What's the occasion?
Take your pick.
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.
I appreciate the life we have and that we have such good kids.
Um...
I'm incredibly hungry.
How about all of the above?
Stephen.
Hmm?
You mentioned Amanda would be missing an opportunity.
- I just gotta put out a fire for a client.
- Can we talk about that later?
- This is more important.
- Wayne:
"I thought you were gonna tell me it was something important, like a testicular cancer scare."
"No, not that important, but still nonetheless, it's important."
More important than bringing your team to Vegas?
"I only stuck around for this lunch, Spencer."
I'm heading back to LV today.
Jet is washed and the Joe's Stones are on ice.
"- Vern, what's up?"
Wish I had better news.
"- Wayne, yeah, I understand."
"I get it, it's only a onetime pass."
"- Yeah, it happened again."
- It's not gonna happen again.
"Yeah, he's more than a little upset, Vernon."
"- Wayne, hold on one second."
- He's cutting you.
Cutting me or cut me?
What tense did he use?
"What the fuck does it matter what tense he used, Vernon?"
- Jesus Christ.
Come on.
- You didn't listen.
"What the fuck are we gonna do, Joe?"
Me and Spencer are heading there now.
We are gonna beg for mercy.
"You are gonna fucking divest yourself of the entire weed business ASAP, you hear me?"
"First off, calm the fuck down when you talk to us, man."
We ain't done nothing that wasn't in accordance with Colorado state law.
"- Reggie, please stop talking."
Yeah.
"You got a lot of heart, carnal."
Maybe too much.
"You've always gotta give it your best shot, you know?"
"Which one, ese?"
Don't matter.
"Fuck it, homes."

It's the temporary bamboo bridge that the savages used in the past
"It's ugly and insecure, but they keep walking over it"
I'll tear it down sooner or later
But it saves them lots of time if they walk over it to fetch water or to the field
Look!
This wire bridge is strong and firm
Tado?
This young man is Tado Mouna the eldest son of the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
But he saw us without saying anything
Is there anything wrong with him?
"No, it's a habit of the savages"
It's not a very good habit
"Oh well, they're savages after all"
Can you stop talking about them like that?
- Sugiura!
"- Welcome, sirs"
This is Officer Sugiura
This way please
"You should've informed me before you came here, sir"
I could've asked those savages to welcome you with dances
Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
-What for?
I got pinched.
"-Everybody gets pinched, but you did it right."
-You told them nothin' and they got nothin'.
-l thought you'd be mad.
"I'm not mad, I'm proud of you."
You took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life.
What?
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
Oh ho...
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
"By the time I grew up, there was 30 billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport, and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it."
"See, ya gotta understand, we grew up near the airport."
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place... and they would tip us off about what was coming in and what was moving out.
If any of the truckers or airlines gave us any trouble Paulie had his union people scare them with a strike.
It was beautiful.
It was an even bigger money maker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all.
"Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport."
"To us, it was better than Citibank."
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy and me.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
"And I was like, ""It's cool, really."
"You can call me Sheer for short if you can't get it."""
"And she looks at me and she goes,"
"""Can I just call you Jane?"""
"And I was like,"
"""If you want to give me a slave name."""
[applause]
You can't do that.
Just change someone's name for the convenience.
"Is this ""Roots""?"
Are you trying to Toby me right now?
"And every time that happens,"
"I want to get so sassy and be like,"
"""Oh, I'm sorry my name's too ethnic for you."
"""Sorry you can't fit all that heritage in your little lips."""
[cheers and applause]
"But I don't really have a right to be angry in that regard, because my name's not actually from any island or African culture."
"It's from ""Star Trek."""
My parents are Trekkies.
Technically Trekkers.
That's what the fans were called when the show first came out.
And they were watching an episode together--
"Season 2, Episode 50-- and Captain Kirk was flirting with this alien princess, as he does."
"And he gave her a rose, and she goes,"
"""Oh, we have something like this on my planet, except it's made out of crystal and it's called Sasheer."""
"And my parents were like, ""Yes!"
"That'll be our daughter."""
And they gave each other a Vulcan high five and called it a night.
Then why were you out in it the night before last?
I wasn't.
"I was here all night, Mum."
Do you know how many nights I've stood on that bridge?
"How many times I've... climbed over and stood on the parapet and... wanted to jump, wanted to end it all?"
You want the truth?
The truth is...
I'm a coward.
I'm fucking scared.
I need your help.
I need you to be there for me.
The only way I can do this is if you help me.
You said we were friends.
Mm?
Then help me to do this.
"Please, Paul."
"As my friend, all right?"

MydearestFrances  I know you're angry and hurt.
You don't want to hear anything I have to say.
I don't want you to feel bad for not speaking to me.
I don't blame you at all.
"And, of course, you're right."
I don't expect you to understand why I've done the things I've done.
I don't even understand them meself... though me pals Arthur Guinness and Jack Daniels might have an idea.
Anyway...
I need you to know it was never my intention to hurt you.
"I've been stupid, and selfish, and pig - headed."
I don't have much to show for me time...
except you.
And I couldn't ask for more.
Look after your mother.
You don't need me to tell you she's one of life's good ones.
Far too good for someone like me.
Hood rat.
Huh.
"Oh, my God, you don't even know what are animals and what aren't."
"Okay, can we please just focus on the fact that in that moment we just made a pretty good team?"
"Well, yeah, I don't know, I didn't do much."
"Well, that's what a team is."
"You're not supposed to have the same strengths, you know."
You're supposed to trade off.
"Like, with the squirrel, I was strong, and with the mugger, you basically hung out with him and played Wii."
"You know, I'd like to see how brave you'd be if the little squirrel pulled out a tiny gun and asked you for your wallet."
"If the squirrel pulled out a tiny gun and asked for my wallet, we would be millionaires."
"Okay, in a hundred-meter sprint,"
I am beating you every time.
"In high school my nickname was ""fast Whitney."""
"Look, I'm sure that's true, but I'm talking about physical speed, all right?"
I'm pretty sure that I'm faster than you.
"Okay, you do a lot of things fast, but running is not one of them."
"All right, look, we're not having this discussion right now, all right?"
"Men are faster than women, end of story, good night."
- Really?
- Really.
"All right, on your marks, get set..."

...I've watched you grow into this incredible woman.
And that is who I love.
"Thanks, Cohen."
What's wrong?
I met GEORGE.
I'll kill him.
This guy came by from GEORGE to recruit me.
He heard about my work with the sea otters and invited me to travel across the country and talk to college kids about voting next November.
What about Brown?
"I'd have to defer a year, live on a bus."
Sounds like a great gig.
I don't know that we could see each other.
So you have to choose between me and GEORGE.
That's the thing-- I don't know that I have to.
"I do believe that you are my destiny, I do, Seth."
But I just don't know that you're my only destiny.

Happy Valentine's Day.
Mm-hmm.
I picked couples through time.
"Oh, and where are we?"
I was hoping that someday we could go in the middle.
So can I tell you what Bullit's surprise is?
I can't hold it any longer.
Sure.
His plane is sitting on the tarmac gassed up and ready to take you anywhere in the world.
"Mom, you're going to be spending Valentine's Day anywhere in the world that you want to go."
"I mean, that's pretty amazing."
'Cause he can handle any situation.
"I think if he was accused of a sexual scandal, he wouldn't even care."
"Reporters come at him,"
"""Eddie, so you slept with some congresswomen, man."
"What you got to say?"""
He'll be...
"""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
"""Let me tell your ass something right now."
"""I just want to be honest with you right now."
"""Let me tell you something right now."
"""Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"""I did it."
I slept with her.
"""Let me tell you something."
"It was good,"""
"""it was sexy, and in the morning, we had waffles."""
"""Oh, yes."
"""And I would have slept with your ass too,"
"""'cause I love sex."
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Please don't tweet that.
I like my job.
"Don't tweet it, okay?"
"I know it 'cause there's always a group of women ready to tweet something and mess up somebody's career, even though, observationally, groups of women together are so funny, 'cause one of y'all always ends up"
getting too drunk...
"Oh, my God!"
Flirting with the wrong--
We've learned a lot about you tonight.
"Getting too drunk, flirting with the wrong guy, and then your girlfriend's gotta play Save-A-Ho and get you out the situation."
It's so funny.
"As soon as it happens, the girlfriend's like this, the one that's trying to cock-block, she's like,"
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette!
"Okay, Officer, I think we..."
we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
Let me check with my supervisor.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
"I missed you at Dad's funeral, Mare."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
You know the last time I saw you was at Mom's funeral?
I guess that's the way we do our family reunions.
"'Cause I was thinking it could've been cool to have a picnic in between, or something, you know?"
- A picnic?
- Yeah.
A picnic.
"Something that, I don't know, normal families do?"
"How did you say you were injured, again?"
"Well, originally, uh... playing high school baseball, but, uh, it hasn't bothered me in a really long time."
"Anything traumatic recently, with the knee?"
"Yeah, actually."
I got a new partner.
I was thinking more about a physical injury.
"No, no, this-this guy is like a physical injury, Doc."
"Ten minutes after meeting him,"
"I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay?"
"A few hours after that, he drives a car-- not joking-- onto the deck of a Chinese freighter ship."
"And, yes, I was in it."
"The car, not the ship."
He drove a car onto a boat?
-Hiram?
Great.
What is he?
An assistant librarian with little pince-nez glasses and a nervous twitch?
"God, I never realised you had such a fertile imagination."
"Well, what was I supposed to say?"
That I came around to break the news to you our relationship was over?
-He'd have gone potty.
-What relationship?
-We never had a relationship.
"-Okay, look, we got to make a move, sweetheart."
"Mick says he can help shift my stuff back today if we get there by 3:00, so...."
"Oh, yeah, the other thing, Gil, and it's bit of an odd one."
"My mother, you know she's in this nursing home now in Lower Ledbury, and maybe the old marbles are starting to go or what I don't know, I mean, she's 81 ."
But all she kept saying when I was there yesterday is how much she wanted to see you.
Me?
Are you joking?
Why would she want to see me?
I don't think I've ever even met the lady.
"Well, I said I'd pass it on."
"Anyway, look, we'll see you around, okay?"
"And, you know, I really hope it works out for Hiram."
Right.
Thank you.
-What is it?
You're not ill or anything?
"-No, it's nothing like that."
No.
"Well, then listen, if you've got your health,"
"I tell you, there is nothing else in life worth getting that upset about."
"So, come on, you can share it with me."
What's the problem?
You've earned the right to see this.
"Hey, there, buddy."
It's me.
"And by ""me,"" I mean you."
"And if you are seeing this, then you are an idiot, because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles."
What you discovered about Bracken's partnership with LokSat is too dangerous to pursue.
LokSat?
I knew about LokSat?
I am barely living proof.
I was shot trying to figure out where LokSat's plane was landing tonight.
I barely escaped without being identified.
I am erasing our mind for a reason...
To protect Kate.
"'Cause if she found out, then she will die."
"So do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles, for her sake."
Do you know what this means?
Yes.
You tracked LokSat.
"If we can cross-reference airports and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot, then we have a real chance of finding out who LokSat really is."
"No, no."
It means what happened was my fault.
The murders of Beckett's former AG team...
"In trying to protect Beckett from LokSat,"
I inadvertently sentenced them all to death.

Welcome to AUTEC and the surrounding areas of the Caribbean.
What is this?
The Bermuda Triangle.
And an ode to my inner mapper.
I'm marking the site of each and every amazing thing that happened here.
"Well, you can't just say that and not give us a little taste."
I wouldn't dream of it.
"Okay, so this bullet marks where the USS Cyclops vanished in the Triangle, and this bullet is the Bimini Wall."
It's a possible location for Atlantis.
"And this bullet, Gibbs, this is the Tongue of the Ocean."
"It's like an underwater Grand Canyon, and we think that AUTEC is running cables down more than 6,000 feet."
To what we don't know.
"Any of these bullets have a point, Abbs?"
The bullet that killed Ridgeway.
I traced that back to a company called Vita Foras.
Vita Foras.
It's Latin.
Rough translation:
"""Great Outdoors."""
I'd guess we're looking at hunting weapons?
You would guess right.
"More specifically, extremely rare hunting rifles, the kind that crazy hard-core collectors would trade."
Hard to track.
Exactly.
"Love your triangle, Abbs."
I...
I just have to ask.
You're in the business of proving things with science.
Why this need to chart the unexplainable?
"Wait, you're in my head, right?"

"What do you think of it now, Tyler?"
"Uh, shouldn't Miss Chummy appear for Mr. Tyler's benefit?"
"You see, uh, Judge Peterby owns a small piece of the show."
"I've contributed, not only in the shape of money but also in the shape of, uh, Miss Chummy."
- Like it?
- It looks pretty good.
We have enough capital for a good show but we wanna put on a great show.
"Your 15,000 would allow us to do it."
"Hmm, well, I feel it needs certain changes."
"Now, the Bill Robinson number."
"I think if you played that in a street in Harlem, you'd get more out of it."
"Good idea, we'll use it."
Right Grady?
Right.
Miss Chummy brings a new personality into the theater.
"Uh, my advice would be to accept the boys' generous offer, Tyler."
"You don't have to sell me, Commodore."
"All I wanna know is, will I have a voice in the production?"
"As a partner, you'll have as much to say as Grady and myself."
"They've adopted a little idea of mine, Tyler."
"You can fix them, maybe, but it doesn't mean they didn't happen."
So don't go in there to that girl and try to sugarcoat it and pretend it's all better when it's not.
"Well, I should've seen it."
"You know, I could've stopped it."
You are not responsible for what that girl did any more than you're responsible for what happened to me.
"I'm sorry, Violet."
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
You came when you could.
"No, no."
"I'm sorry that I did not come sooner... before, with Katie."
You came when you could.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mm.
"Shh, shh."
You're here now.
"So a bad thing happened, and I can't change that."
"And sometimes the things people say to try to make you feel better, they just come out sounding... stupid."
"So, um... you tell me what you need."
What if he dies?
"What if he dies, and I never get to tell him I'm sorry?"
"Nobody beat me, nobody tried to steal my baby, nobody stabbed me, but..."
"I am wounded, Sam."
Noah?
"Oh, my heart is broken."
And I shouldn't even complain about it because... nothing happened.
"I mean, nothing happened to me, not like what happened to the Larsens and Violet."
"You know, sometimes..."
I'm almost jealous of them?
"Because everybody can see their injuries, so they have a right to be messed up."
I sent noah back to his wife.
I did the right thing.
Jesus.
What if I fall asleep and all the good stuffs taken away instead?
They'd have to find it first.
"I am your superior, you know that?"
"Harry, why don't you just stop gambling?"
"Look, I have patches for my addictions."
They have patches for porn?
Why are you really here?
You're making my girls nervous.
I want to know what has spooked Freddie Lau.
Why has he called in my debt?
- Belshazzar was the king of Babylon.
- Here we go.
A man of immense wealth and power with many scary friends.
Just like Freddie Lau?
"One evening, he holds a fabulous feast for them all."
"But during the feast, Belshazzar notices a hand come down from the heavens and starts writing on the wall."
- It predicts...
- Belshazzar's own death.
"So, what, you're saying that someone's threatening to kill Freddie Lau?"
Why else would Lau be planning to sell up and leave London?
"Ah, come on, Kaleem."
Freddie Lau would never let anyone muscle him out.
You're not telling me something.
"Come on, leave now."
I have to watch my girls like a hawk.
"Oh, did that um..."
missing stripper of yours ever turn up?
- What was her name?
- Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Some of my colleagues fished a girl out of the Thames yesterday.
- Matched her description.
"Say, uh, hey, Billy, look up there."
See that building up there?
That's where your mother and I went to high school.
"[woman] Do you see it, Billy?"
"Remember, I told you those stories?"
Yeah.
"Hey, well my dad's a professor at Princeton."
"Oh, yeah, great."
"Well, he's not exactly a full professor."
"[woman] Anyway, I really wanted to go to New york."
"And then after I was there a while,"
"I don't know, I kind of wanted to come home again."
"Even when I went to New York to visit you, I missed it."
"It's not that I didn't have a good time, but, uh, this is really home."
[woman] I know exactly what you mean.
"Like, do you remem-- well, you probably don't remember when I won that silly contest, Miss, um-- oh, what was the-- miss Orange Blossom?"
"Yeah, um, Orange Growers Association."
How did you remember the name of that contest?
"Listen, I took your picture for the paper, remember?"
"As a matter of fact, that's when I started to fall in love with you."
"You look terrific, Billy."
"Yeah, a real cowboy."
"Right, mom?"
"Very funny, get in the car."
You're hard to please.
"Try to be nice to him, Billy."
"Okay, I'll try."
That's my pal.
Here you go.
"We're going into gold mine country, full of claim jumpers."
You're going to need that.
"That's the same kind of gun that William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid, used in 1875 when he shot it out with the James Boys."
Tony's.
"You know Tony, sir."
He's the one who...
"If you tell me that one more time, I'm gonna kill myself."
"Sorry, sir."
Have I said that before?
"So the number of people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night,"
"her secretary,"
"Mr. Sid Daley,"
Mark...
I'm curious as to how Mark knew.
"Well, sir, Mark offered to bring her a cheeseburger and she told her secretary to tell him that she not only didn't want a gofer, she didn't want a cheeseburger, either."
And that she was going to get a sandwich over at Tony's.
And she said to tell her husband the same thing.
I see.
"Well, no you don't, sir."
"I mean, you must have seen before."
"Because you were in the room when she took the call, werert you?"
She made it from this dressing room.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I'm not in the habit of listening to other people's telephone calls.
I didn't know that Claire was going to Tony's.
"You didn't, sir?"
"Absolutely not, Lieutenant."
"Then how did you know, sir, that there were only four people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night and how did you know that you were one of them?"
The same way you did.
I asked Claire's secretary and she informed me that the call was made from my room.
"You did, sir?"
"Oh, yes, I did, Lieutenant."
"Oh, that's very good, sir."
"Thank you, Lieutenant."
"The horses can be harnessed, we are on our way"

"Yitzhak, you're a king, the audience loved it."
How was it?
"Good, I have a few comments."
What's wrong?
"Goni, how did I sing?"
Slow.
"For a general rehearsal, it wasn't too bad."
It was a great general rehearsal.
- It was a helluva general rehearsal.
Thank you for letting me be in the theater's biggest hit.
Amazing.
Amazing.
"- To Daddy, break a leg, from Mommy and Goni -"
I have a problem in the entrance to scene 3.

I'm more worried about your future your vast vocabulary?
you don't sound like a kid so I think that there's a plan we can work out plan?
what?
new slogan?
I talked with hirano-san again and
"What, like you were honest with me, going behind my back"
To apply for the one thing I wanted more than anything?
The reason I couldn't talk to you earlier-
It's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.
"She's sick, and I don't know what's gonna happen."
It's not working exactly as I'd hoped.
I need you to write Lily another prescription.
I doubt the authorities
Would be pleased to know what you've been doing.
It's said that we're all strapped to fortune's wheel...
Nowhere is this truer
Than the ever-changing landscape of love.
As one couple enjoys an upswing...

"But top or bottom, don't get too comfortable,"
Because the one thing you can rely on
Is that the wheel will keep on turning.
"All right, I'm heading to my mom's for breakfast."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You're coming in late and leaving early all week.
I'm starting to feel cheap.
"Oh, I'm sorry I haven't been around much lately."
Just with everything going so well with my dad-
"Hey, Serena, no worries."
Okay?
Mm.
"Look, I love being your crash pad,"
"But, you know, maybe you'd feel better if you moved back in"
With your mom while she's getting her treatment.
And have to see Jenny's lying face first thing in the morning?
"No, thank you."
The Cult... of Solon.
Splendid.
"Yes, uh, the Cult, or descendents of the Cult, uh, lived peacefully in England for hundreds of years, and that is until the Romans invaded and then they were hunted down and slaughtered."
"But a few... survivors escaped, uh, with the Ark and the Torch, and sailed from England."
And came to these catacombs.
And then died.
But not before hiding the Torch somewhere down here.
I'd bet my life on it.
"Them's some pretty high stakes, professor."
"Let's hope you don't lose that bet, huh?"
"Oh, relax, my boy."
The soldiers don't even know the catacombs are here.
Colonel Petrovic...
Well...
Wa...
This must be the oldest part of the catacombs.
These must be the remains of early Christians who hid from the Romans.
"Over centuries, others followed, like the Cult..."
of Solon.
"Professor, please."
"Let's skip the lecture, find what we came for and get out of here."
There's a civil war going on upstairs.
"Oh, nonsense, United Nations ordered a cease-fire."
"Yeah, well, I don't think they care."
"Oh, these people never got on."
They've been waging war amongst themselves since the 12th century.
"When I find the Torch of Truth, we can use it to continue Solon's quest, and find the Treasure of Atlantis, and there won't be any more wars."
I can feel it.
I know it.
We're close.
Professor...

Pobre pendejo thought he could hide from me.

Let's go in.
Silent sculptures are looking at us.
They can only speak through their shape.
"And what we can read from their language, we'll be forever our property."
This works of art must have been made by an artist working in turbulent 20th century.
He expressed the tragedy and dignity of a man of our times.
His name is Xawery Dunikowski.
"Sculptor, painter, educator, builder of the People's Republic of Poland."
"During 60 years of his career, hands of the artist knew no rest searching forms for ideas that were always original and full of humanism."
In 1955 we were celebrating his 80th birthday and 60 years of creative work.
"So much work, so many battles with recalcitrant matter."
So many works of art.
Let's go between the sculptures.
"- Me, too."
Where's Riley?
Let's be honest with each other.
Charlestown needs a makeover.
"It's time to look toward the future, folks."
And the first step toward that future is the Frazier Point Golf Community Country Club and Spa.
Two hundred luxurious new homes!
- Thirty-six holes and...
- Twenty-five orphans without a home.
Who let him in?
Anyone?
He works for me.
I thought he should hear what you have planned for his home.
- Of course.
"- By all means, please continue."
"Yes, do."
"To survive hard times like these, we all have to make sacrifices."
Those making the biggest sacrifices are the boys at Newman.
"But we could use a Wii in every room, or some new dirt bikes, or even a year's supply of Lucky Charms, but other than that we're fine, thanks."
Is that so?
"Hope, the report please."
Rats in the soup pot.
Girlie magazines.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes."
"My dream is simple, folks."
"I want to help the orphans and create a new Charlestown full of life, energy and growth potential."
Help us?
By destroying the only family we've ever known?
"By shipping us off to dangerous big-city homes where kids have tattoos, piercings, and, God forbid, Facebook?"
"City Council, ask yourselves this."
Is a round of golf really worth an orphan's happiness?
Daddy will.

Could we say that half of those were non-Jews?
"were Christians, atheists and pagans."
Hitler:
Awkward language.
"What term covers Gypsies, Polish intelligentsia,"
"Russian upper strata, prisoners of war,"
"French and Yugoslavian partisans, political opponents?"
"Well, should we say ""gentiles""?"
But if 12 million were liquidated and only six million were Jews-- or is it 5.7?
Why can't I get accurate figures?

Where's Himmler?

I would stand behind this wording.
Almost half the dead were from the Christian world.
( Hitler mutters ) Yes.
And yet the Jews take their removal so personally.

"New testimony will be provided by Harris' 17-year-old stepdaughter, Amy."

"We really thought they""d make it."
I thought so.
We prayed for them.
Why did all of America become so obsessed with the Clara Harris story?
"Because it happened to a middle-class, dual-income, respectable family."
"Because it happened in the suburbs, where good people like you and me live."
Because if a sickness can grow inside the Harris family... are any of us really immune?
We all know...
Clara received the maximum sentence:
20 years in prison.
David's own parents forgave Clara.
They begged the judge for leniency.
The woman prosecutor used this argument to convict:
Why didn't Clara Harris do what every other woman in her situation does?
Take her husband to the cleaners.
Divorce David?
Take him to the cleaners?
"I'm sorry, but that woman missed the boat entirely."
Clara didn't want a divorce.
Clara Harris was in a life-and-death fight for her family.
Her survival instincts kicked in.
I want you to ask yourself:
Would you kill to save your family?
"Oh, my!"
You ready?

"Mamma, where have Uncle Jai and Uncle Jagadish gone away?"
"They have gone out for a while, they're going to be back"
Don't lie to the child
"Om... my son, this house is rooted on rock-solid foundation"
Jai and Jagadish will be back.
Surely
Only if we have this house.
What does that mean?
"As of now, this house belongs to Shekhar Malhotra"
What...?
- I borrowed forJai's education
Then I couldn't repay.
Now he has claimed this house
Joys you have always shared
Will you keep your sorrows to yourself?
Why...?
Because he is Om and he wishes to become a god among men
"High time that you thought about yourself, my son"
When must we leave this house?

"Rita, they're married."

Why did you move campsites?
I move whenever I want.
It's the beauty of a home on wheels.
"This is your knife, is it not?"
Might be... might not be.
But I doubt you can prove I ever touched that thing.
So if I'm the murderer... show me the evidence that'll hang me.
I didn't have enough to hold him in custody.

"Well, I'm sure you know she applied for a transfer out of the D.P.D."
And yesterday she filed for a week off.
"- She has vacation days, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
Many.
"Well, that's what they're there for--vacation."
I'm sure she just needed to recharge her batteries.
"In all the time I've known Annie, she's never been one in need of recharging."
"If she needs the time off, just give her her space."
"Look, right there."
"Joan, maybe we'll hang on to our jobs after all."
You still haven't answered my question.
Do you know where Annie is?
"No idea, Joan."
"Look, I know it's not my place to give you advice, but I'd ease up on the micromanaging."
"In my experience, operatives only rise as high as you let them."

You didn't hold her for me.
You didn't do anything to keep her here including grabbing that lawyer by his legal briefs.
I needed five minutes.
You let me down.
"Maybe, but you better figure out what you're really angry about, Frank."
"Is it because Wilgis may end up in a mental institution instead of the electric chair, or are you ticked off because you weren't the one to get her confession?"
Frank Gallo left a message for you a few minutes ago.
- What did he say?
"- He said you and Mike better not be trying to screw him over again, or you're gonna regret it."
"Harvey, what's he talking about?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out."
♪♪
What the hell are you doing with Frank Gallo?
Harvey...
Don't pretend like you don't know.
He just left me a message asking me to make sure that you don't fu... him over.
"I told you, I'm working on a Brooklyn Housing Authority case."
Gallo is from Brooklyn.
He knows people.
And don't tell me he's making you pay for his information.
"Yes, he is, and I'm gonna pay him."
"Mike, odds are he doesn't know jack shit and he's just using you to get money."
"No, I looked into it, all right?"
What he told me checks out.
He's on the right side of this thing.
You're telling me he's all of a sudden Mother Teresa?
- This guy tried to kill you!
- I know that.
"Look, I'm not saying he's a saint."
I'm saying that I know what I'm doing.
Don't you get it?
A guy like Gallo finds people to get revenge on.
"He thinks about it and thinks about it, and the only way to survive that is to stay out of his mind and let him find someone else."
"Maybe you're right, but I already promised him something for his information, and if I back out of that now,"
I'm gonna end up on the top of his list.
Does Rachel know about this?
♪♪
- No.
I wanna kiss you more than anyone in the world.
I wanna kiss you 1000 times.
I never wanna stop.
That's pretty good.
I'll give you one kiss.
What would Allison say?
Why bring her name up at a time like this?
Only one kiss to a customer.
"Betty, I couldn't help it."
My father made me call you.
Wouldn't you rather be with me?
"- Oh, yes, yes."
- Tell me how much.
"In the whole world, in the whole wide world there's nobody I'd rather be with than you, Betty."
Give me another kiss.
"Oh, honey, honey."
- You want to make love to me?
"- Yes, yes, of course I want to."
Now go make love to Allison MacKenzie!
Go get the girl you brought and try it with her.

"Next time you miss a payment, ladies, we'II bury you alive in matching wicker coffins."
Am I dreaming this?
"What do you think, hilary?"
Is Joyce dreaming?
"Were you on the receiving end of cunnilingus from Robert KiIroy silk, Joyce?"
You...you just blew up The Wicker Barn.
"technically, Joyce, it was actually you who blew it up."
"I, I..."
"That's it, Joyce."
Let it all out.
Those women could have been killed.
"Goodness me, no."
LiIIian can blow the door off a Smeg fridge without so much as damaging an organic vine tomato.
Why?
Why did you do it?
"Let me ask you a simple question, Joyce."
Why did you move to little Stempington?
"Jeremy was posted here and, can't quite believe I'm saying this now, but..."
Yes?
"When we came to look around, I fell in love with the place."
Oh.
Because it's clean?
Because there's no graffiti?
Because there are no delinquent teenagers sniffing toilet Duck in the arcade?
And how d'you think it stays that way?
"Ooh, hello, Wendy, love."
Is that a My little Pony lunch box?
"Pop in the back and sit next to Auntie MiIIie, darling."
"You see, now your fingerprints are all over this little box, Joyce, you're the prime..."
"No, you're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn."
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, gosh, you don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the cIick-cIink for the next ten years, do you?"
And...
Jimmy here is an educated guy.
So go fuck yourself.
"- I was gonna go with a more diplomatic response, but it's Pete's bar, so I guess, go fuck yourself is an order."
"Go fuck yourself, young lady."
How dare you ask the teacher a question?
"- Hey, Dad."
You wanna go lay down?
- What?
- Why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a minute?
- What for?
"- Maybe you're tired, maybe you want to lie down."
- Iâm fine.
"- Iâm on the boardwalk, me and my daughter."
It's quiet.
"Suddenly, you hear ""Homicides, Homicides, Homicides."""
"- Ooh, Homicides, the Homicides."
"- Worst gang in Brooklyn, worst gang in Brooklyn."
About 80 of them in their leathers running right towards us.
"And they're yelling ""Homicides, Homicides."""
"Iâm looking at my daughter like, is there something you're not telling me?"
Are you in a feud with the crazy Homicides?
They stole your pop rocks?
I don't know.
They're coming right at us.
George:
What happened?
"- Just then, right behind us, but in the same direction, four or five members of the Jolly Stompers."
"- Oh, thatâs the guys who's in the satin jackets."
"- Jolly Stompers, I mean, terrifying when you see them on the train, but when there's 80 Homicides chasing them, fairly docile."
One of them had a little ball of shit rolling down his pant leg as he ran.
They were scared.
"Betty, would you please ask Mr. Waterhouse to come in here?"
"Larry, you just leave everything to me."
"Well, if it isn't old J. P. Waterhouse, thumbtack king of America."
Stephens is my name and advertising is my game.
"Lay it on me, baby!"
Stephens?
Is that the name of the man who's handling my account?
"Yes, Mr. Waterhouse."
- This is Darrin Ste...
- You bet your bottom dollar I'm your boy.
But time's a-wasting.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
Brass tacks!
I got a million of them.
"All levity aside, Porterhouse."
"Now, I've been looking at your advertising, and believe me some of your ideas went out with hoop skirts."
"I mean, it's "" Hey, you, kid with a wow-wow brush!"""
"What Darrin means, Mr. Waterhouse, is that some of your ideas could be brought into better focus..."
"Oh, no, no, Larry."
"Larry, that isn't what I mean at all."
"What I mean is, Waterhose, baby, you gotta get with it."
That TV commercial of yours where the executive comes in and he puts the poster up on the wall.
"Oh, that has got to go."
"But say what if you should take a cute little secretary and she comes into the boss' office and she's putting thumbtacks in the boss' drawer and one of those thumbtacks, it drops on the boss' chair."
"The boss comes in, and he sits down."
That'll bring the TV viewer right out of his chair.
- Bring the boss out of his chair too.
"- That's enough, Darrin!"
"Hold it, Tate."
I'll talk to this boy.
"Young man, you might as well know it now."
I don't like you.
- Just stop.
"Nobody's doing this job, okay?"
Not even Uncle Eddie.
[alarm sounds] [radio announcer] ...
many consider Cezanne to be the bridge between Post-Impressionism and Cubism.
"In fact, both Matisse and Picasso called him ""the father of us all."""
He was a remarkable innovator...  [grunting]
Little-known fact:
Cezanne was rejected by the Paris Salon for 18 years.
"But he never gave up, until 1882, when they finally exhibited his 1866"
"""Portrait of Louis-Auguste Cezanne,"""
"the father of the artist, reading L'Évenement, his first and last successful submission."
"[Eddie] What the fuck you mean, it won't play?"
"I'm telling you, it won't play."
"It won't play, or you won't play with your brother?"
Ah!
Thought you guys were supposed to eat about it.
"Can you not yell, please?"
"What, do I gotta sit you two punks down again"
- and talk about family values?
"- Eddie,"
I cannot work with him.
And I will not work with that psycho girlfriend of his.
"- For Chrissake, she attacked Sonja."
- So what?
"A couple broads, they get handsy with each other and you wanna call the whole goddamn thing off with all that money just sittin' there waitin' for us."
Listen to me.
It's not.
"These people that you're tryin' to rob, they're not just some banditos from down South."
Okay?
They're degenerate killers.
"Yeah, well, they ain't never met Eddie Cruickshank."

She's not the type who would sell her body
"By the way, what kind of prostitution is it?"
"It's not the ""real thing"" but they make you feel good"
"What's ""the real thing""?"
"Um, well that... umm"
"I'm kidding, I know."
Please stop it with your gross reactions
For now I guess it's good
I didn't say it out loud but I was thinking that maybe she was dead
My wish is to meet with Miyu as soon as possible
Right?
Lin?
"Um, yeah"
I'm just gonna take her home anyways
We have some time until 3PM
Let's go to a BL manga shop
Now?
I forgot to get Miyu a gift.
I'm gonna buy her something special
I'll get her that hella-expensive one
We still aren't sure if it's her
We must always be prepared
Always be imaginitive
That's the only way to become strong
You sound like Haruki Murakami
That makes it sound like I'm ripping him off
"As your punishment, you need to pay for that book"
Bon is surprisingly calm
"Yeah, I think it's cause it makes no difference for her"
What do you mean?
"It's hard to say, but even if Miyu did it with a lot of guys..."
"And if he's not going to do something about marrying me, it's time I moved on."
But in spite of myself I...
"I mean, when I left him, I didn't..."
I didn't really want to.
So...
Next to arrive on track five is the scheduled Buffalo to Trenton.
"Looking at Anne on that platform,"
I kept thinking of my own mother.
Neither one of them ever got married.
They both live alone.
"They were both single mothers when being a single mother was a major scandal, and they both believed in my father completely."
Anne left Philadelphia in 1953 and went to Rome for a year to have Alex in secret.
Lou wrote many letters to her while she was away.
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""last night, I dreamt about you."
"""I was in our office telephoning."
"""You walked in and mentioned to me"
"""that you could wait no longer."
"""Your eyes somehow were black and flashing,"
"""looking at me reprehensively."
"""Annie, Annie, I think of you always."
"""I miss so much our meetings together."
"""I hope nothing changes about our way of life."""
"Well, of course, it would change."
"When Anne returned, she collaborated with Lou on a small community center and bathhouse in Trenton, New Jersey."
It was Lou's first chance to fully apply his ideas about ancient architecture.
Anne is 80 now and hasn't been back to Trenton in 40 years.
"Well, how do you go in?"
"- I think we go right in there, I think."
- Is this a door?
- Looks like it's boarded up.
- Was it not like that?
"Is there a person that you feel, lately, has been around you all the time?"
Chief Jung Soo Hyuk?
"In his position, he is responsible for taking care of retired agents."
"But, do you think that's all he does?"
Chief Jung...
He was only focused on getting President Hwang's memoir.
He was hung up on that memoir...
Do you think... he was trying to divert your attention from his real motive?
Do you think you are... seeing Chief Jung Soo Hyuk for who he really is?
Chief Jung Soo Hyuk... is controlling Park Seon Woo's every step.
They said that Detective Im could be accused for the murder.
Because it happened inside the Chung Gye Plan office.
"Hey, but he's a police officer."
But there are people out there who try to pin murders on cops.
Who?
Park Seon Woo of Yong Moon Plan.
"The man with the weird sunglasses who says, ""Chan Gyu..."" all the time."
"But he doesn't show up without an agenda, does he?"
It looks like someone close to me will be accused of murder.
But it's obvious who the real bad guy is.
I shouldn't be sitting here doing nothing.
That's true...
But you should cut all your ties with that man.
"Not to mention, he isn't the kind of person that we can take on."
99 percent of me agrees with you.
But the remaining one percent...
is trying to crawl out of me...
It's telling me to do what I need to do.
"Bro, why are you pretending to be the shadow, all of a sudden?"
Where are you coming from?
- I paid off my credit cards.
- Oh... wow.
"Dakis, have a drink"
Go home and get yourself dead-drunk
We can't drink anymore
- We already...
- Drink!
"The millet wine that we make can set our people free making them sing and dance, cry and laugh freely"
You'll see once you're drunk
Go home now

"Mouna, the tattoos on your face are still so dark and clear"
You're indeed a Seediq Bale
You're a true hero

In the dim light at dusk the lightening splits a rock into half

My sister's got a convertible.
She's only had her license three months.
[laughs] I could never drive one anyway.
Why not?
Have you ever been in one at night?

"Who could possibly keep their eyes on the road with all those stars, right?"
[laughs softly]
Yeah.

[clears throat] Ernie Falk wants you to give him a call.
Who the fuck's Ernie Falk?
"Uh, he's the big-time TV producer you tried to hustle the other night."
You mean hustle like you told me to?
"Hustle, as in you take a 20 percent cut?"
"You know, I grew up in Cold Lake, Alberta?"
"My father used to walk across Cold Lake to work every morning when it was frozen, which was most mornings."
"Then one day, when I was 17, he fell through the ice and drowned."
What the fuck does that even mean?
Wasn't his day.
"You walk across that lake every day, and then one day--"
"No, no, I-I get it, sort of, it's--it's just a fucking terrible analogy."
It's a fucking brilliant analogy.
You're comparing your father drowning to me having to make an unpleasant phone call?

Uncle Kwai's dead wife was so ruthless that Uncle didn't even dare to say a word
She left Uncle without any children
Uncle Kwai wants a son so much
"Look, he lives there"
He lives by himself on one of the floors
His flat landlord is an old man who often travels to America
This is a good area
"That helps her, not me."
I got it.
Why don't we charge one of the personalities with harbouring a fugitive?
Or I could just audition as the court's new jester.
"Look, here's the point, this is not about evidence, this is about insanity."
"The voice, the voice."
We sent the tape to the Feds to be analysed.
It makes no difference which personality is talking
- if that voice is hers on the tape.
- How many ways do I have to...
"Danvers, you ride with me."
"Megan, Frank, meet me at Russem's office   she's confessing."
- Wilgis is confessing?
Matt Rhodes rang me.
She's going before the cameras live
- to confess to eight murders.
- All eight?
"She wouldn't give me a confession but she's willing to tell all to 150,000 viewers?"
- Excuse me.
"- She's using you, y'know?"
For giving me a live on-camera confession
"- she can use me, use me, use me."
"- Matt, you only got ten seconds."
"Can you people wait outside, we got a lot of bodies in here?"
Police.
Good evening.
I'm Alison Chandler with the Late 8 news.
"Tonight, a stunning revelation in the murder of three local women."
"Our Matt Rhodes is in the law offices of Baltimore attorney, Darren Russem with a Channel Eight exclusive."
"Thanks, Alison."
Channel Eight has just learned that the brutal murders of three Baltimore women over the past two days were all committed by the same person.
These killings are tied to the deaths of five women in two other cities.
She shaun't be alone
It is Hatice's first baby.
She's very worried
You'll calm her down with your experience
You were absent all day long
I miss you.
Where have you been?
I had things to do
Will I always be yearning for you ?
Won't this pain have an end?
You'll always be in love and yearning for me
"This is the love, Hürrem"
I miss the sky and clouds of Castilla
Signore Gritti should have sent a message
Your fiance Prince Friedrich will absolutely find a way
I don't know if we can really rely on Gritti
She lives in this Ottoman hell willingly
He's among the barbarians
A wagon arrived
Can it be Sultan Süleyman?
What's she saying?
She's asking why we came here
We are here with the order of İbrahim Paşa
By now Melek Hatun will be at the service of Princess Isabella.
She'll teach her Turkish
She doesn't want to learn our language
She won't stay here for a long time
She doesn't need it
It would be for her sake to learn Turkish
She'll be more comfortable as long as she lives here
She says that if they really think about my comfort they can bring a table to eat dinner
They make a princess eat on the floor like a barbarian

So this entire length is the thickness of ice that has melted throughout all of lower Greenland in the past 5 years.

- How about now?
"- No, still too dark."
- I can barely see you.
"- I know, I'm trying to keep it mysterious."
"Okay, so I can roll around in lingerie, but I don't get to see you jerk it?"
- All right.
"- Well, listen, first of all, baby, you're gonna ruin the whole romantic thing that's happening now, and, believe me, the last thing you wanna do is see me in all my shame."
"Do not be ashamed, okay?"
I am so proud of you.
What you are doing is proactive.
- Okay.
"- Checking to see if you can reproduce even when you have no intention of doing so anytime in the near future, that shows maturity."
"Yeah, listen, honey, I gotta tell you,"
I really appreciate the support.
It means a lot to me.
"Uh, but what would also mean a lot to me is if you take your perfectly round, beautiful ass and hike it in the air."
( chuckles ) Like this?
Just like that.
"Damn, don't move."
"But rather, Saeko-san, lately carries a faint smell of cigarette smoke..."
"Well, it's fine anyway."
I began dating Saeko-san one week before last Christmas.
"And, our first kiss was on Christmas Eve."
"That was the only time we kissed, after that things have been in a unclear state of deadlock."
"We met on the spring of my 15th year,"
Ah!
"- Ow, that hurt."
"I'm sorry, are you okay?"
"Ah, cute."
- Are you okay?
"The me that just started high school, fell in love with Saeko-san, who was one year my senior, at first sight."

"Saeko-san,"
didn't even consider me as a partner.
"I don't know if our first year was a bad crop, but, before I realized, Saeko-san had began going out with good looking guys from other schools."
She was someone I couldn't reach.
That hairstyle is super awesome.
- Really?
"That's why, in order to get closer to Saeko-san,"
I began trying to butter up her boyfriends.
Can you go buy yakisoba bread and melon bread?
With pleasure.
"I'm Koyurugi Souta from year 1, class 1."
"In the end, I would be made into a gofer,"
"I would join the crafts club as the only guy, even though I have no interest in it, just because Saeko-san is there."
I'm done.
"Wow, amazing!"

I'm Koyurugi Souta from year 2 class 2.

Set me up straight in a chair comb my hair 'cause tonight I'll see an old friend
and I wonder if she has been thinking of me now and then
like a candle that burns for the sailors who turn she's a fortress that's safe from the storm
she's brave and she's free and she's waiting to keep me warm
and save all your small talk for some other lady
just give her your love and your pride
and lay down beside her and give her what's left of your hide
set me up straight in my chair comb my hair 'cause tonight I'll see an old friend
and I wonder if she has been thinking of me now and then
just give her love and your pride
and lay down beside her and give her what's left of your hide
set me up straight in my chair comb my hair 'cause tonight I'll see an old friend
and I wonder if she has been thinking of me now and then
Are these pictures you've made recently?
"Yes, recently."
They aren't like your usual work.
Maybe not.
It's an old film negative I took from my mother.
It's a picture she took of me as a child.
That's me.

"So, are you buying a new dress for the Snowflake Ball?"
"No, I've already got plenty that are fine for loitering awkwardly around the punch bowl and that's all Harvey and I ever do at those things."
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
"Your attention, please."
The finalists for the King and Queen of the Snowflake Ball are:
"Gracie Charters and Dan Kael,"
"Jean Huang and Hans Tercek, and Sabrina Spellman and Harvey Kinkle."
"You know, I've won lots of academic prizes, but never anything as meaningless as a popularity contest."
Do you think Harvey and I have a shot?
"Well, they say the cutest couple always wins."
But those girls are really cute.
"You and Harvey are cute, too."
Right.
"We'll just be ourselves and let the chips fall where they may, and I'll just take the high road."
"But while I'm taking it,"
I may as well do it in a killer new dress.
"Zelda, I've got bad news."
"Uh-oh, is Salem running five minutes fast again?"
"No, I just found out that one of those gigantic Everything Emporium stores is going to open outside of town."
"Oh, one of those great discount places?"
They have a huge selection of clothing and appliances and... (gasps):
clocks.
And I really love this place.
I was hoping to struggle for a few years and then file for Chapter 11.
"Oh, Hilda, don't overreact."
It's probably just a rumor.
Do you want to start boarding up the windows or should I?
"Hey, Josh, do you think I'd look good in this dress?"
"I mean, you can't see the outline of my liver, though."
Why do women do this to themselves?
"Sabrina, you're smart, you're beautiful."
"As I recall the newspaper story, one of the cleaning women said that she heard him talking to someone about an hour before he died."
She said his voice sounded very angry.
I'd quite forgotten.
"Mason, what does this have to do with Lita Krail?"
The stroke may have been the result of a fight with someone.
"Mason, you've got the wrong foot in the mouth entirely."
"Oh, sure, Lita Krail may have been #1 girl in the big firm, but--"
Did Lita earn just her salary here or do you think she had another source of income?
I don't follow.
"Well, for keeping quiet or arranging deals here and there."
"Beth Sandover tells me that the job was a regular funnel of gossip and influence,"
- if a woman so wanted to use it.
"- And so she did, your friend Beth."
Lita's told me what a big snoop she was.
It's her husband who was the snoop-
- Sandy.
Of all the creepy calculating guys I've had to stand--
"Now now now now, Frank, sticks and stones."
"Oh, Mason, you know Sellers?"
How do you do?
Frank Sellers?
Jess Devro told me that you were the one who would probably run the company when he stepped down.
You mean Devro  Sellers instead of Devro  Banks?
"Now Mason, you've been shooting apples off my head ever since you came in."
"I'm curious as to who's being blackmailed around here and by whom, that's all."
- Blackmail?
What kind of a--
"- All right, all right, Sellers."
"It's a stormy morning-- police, murder and all that."
- [phone ringing]
- We can't blame Mr. Mason if he doesn't recognize a big happy family when he sees one.
"Excuse me, sir."
"You shouldn't have, Pasha"
"I want you to be happy, Abdu, very happy"
"God bless you, Pasha"
Drink up
"It doesn't taste good, but it's nice"
"It's nice, sir"
"You know, Abdu... after you have another glass... you'll feel like you want to do nice things very nice things, the nicest thing in the world"
"I know it, sir, but my wife is in our hometown all the way in upper Egypt"
Does it have to be with your wife?
By the way... most women are not very nice
"- Take your hand off, sir"
- Calm down
"Calm down, people are watching us"
Be normal
Abd Rabbu
- Abd Rabbu
- What?
Are you stupid?
You want to make a scandal?
You know that I can hurt you but hurting people is not in me
- Where are you going now?
- I'm going to hell!
Damn!
What your asking me to do is shameful and forbidden
- It shakes heaven and earth
"- OK, enough"
Just come and spend the night... and leave in the morning
Come on
What's wrong with the tenants?
There are no more manners... and people are not responsible
Why doesn't everyone make sure he closes the lift door?

No more had oaths
Only a ray of light on the wall
When I wake up from our sleep
To a bright new sunny day
I no longer miss the shadow
I want to touch the air
Where the antennae Reach for the stars
You'll be free to fly
The flame won't die
It'll just bum my chest
Your hand in mine
"I look at you, touch you"
I feel the yearning too
And secretly
I'm in love
Where the antennae Reach for the stars
You'll be free to fly
The flame won't die
It'll just bum in my chest
Your hand in mine
"I look at you, touch you"
I feel the yearning too
And secretly
I'm in love

"These segments of your story, these pages lie scattered"
"Your Meenaxi is walking on the strength of your pen her steps are firmly grounded, she isn't wavering"
Meenaxi has walked a very long way through your story
Your pen wrote uncertainly at several points
Yet Meenaxi accelerated her speed till the day she could come out of your story
"Then this pen was no longer yours, it belonged to Meenaxi"
"You were shocked, you weren't sure where I'd lead your story to"
The story was no longer limited by the pen
You tried to snatch the pen away from Meenaxi
Now your Meenaxi stand before you as real as life

Fred was a perfectionist.
"After exhausting hours of rehearsal when we all thought we had it just right, he would say:"
"""Come on, Annie, let's do it one more time. """
What I wouldn't give to do it just one more time again.
Fred and his sister Adele were already stars in the New York and London theater before he came to MGM in 1933.
Do you feel like going through that number with Mr. Astaire?
- All right.
- Freddie.
Show Miss Marlowe the routine on that opening number.
- Good evening.
- Miss Marlowe.
Do you know the routine?
- I've seen it often enough.
I'll try.
That's fine.
"Harry, give us the pickup on that gang number, will you, please?"
It was a little more than a guest appearance for Fred for he was soon to be under contract to RKO Pictures where they were about to team him with Ginger Rogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow.
Fred didn't return to MGM until seven years later at which time he starred with Eleanor Powell in Broadway Melody of 1940.
"In 1945, Fred and a new partner, Lucille Bremer stepped out to ""Coffee Time"" in Yolanda and the Thief."
"Its director, Vincente Minnelli."
That's for me
"I'm drum crazy, yes I'm drum crazy, yes"
I'm plumb crazy for drums
Fred could make music out of almost anything.
And he often found new challenges that stretched his talents.
"In Easter Parade, he uses drums to make a melody."
"First, soft violins"
"Then, sweet saxophones"
"Then, blue clarinets croon"
When it's my turn I turn into a loon
When the drum takes the melody
"the Baltimore Inner Harbor Development Project, the Kansas City Office Tower, the Roosevelt Memorial in New York City, the Palazzo dei Congressi in Venice, the Abbas Abad development in Tehran, Iran, and two that must have really hurt:"
the Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia;
"and in Jerusalem, the Hurva Synagogue, a building that would have shared the spotlight with the great monuments of the holy city."
That was the commission of a lifetime.
"There is a flight at 1:00 at night, in the morning."
"Yeah, in the morning."
"So I don't think we'll finish, you see."
I don't either.
"When I arrived in Jerusalem,"
I found myself surrounded by pilgrims.
"Everybody comes here looking for something, so I fit right in."
The synagogue Lou was commissioned to build would have overlooked the mosque known as the Dome of the Rock and the Wailing Wall.
My father never talked to me about being Jewish.
I don't know how he felt about it.
"But when he stood here looking at the remnants of the temple of his ancestors, he must have felt a connection."
"It was impossible not to, even for a half-breed like me."
Thank you.
Saulie cannot come in by himself.
When was the first time you met Lou?
- Do you remember?
- Can I offer you one?
I'd love one.
Is this satisfactory?
Teddy Kollek is the legendary former mayor of Jerusalem.
He and Lou worked together on the synagogue project for seven years.
"Look, first of all, I'm 90 years old."
And my memory has gone altogether.
I remember single items but not... you came a little too late for me on that.
What was it that made it not possible to build it?
Ruthie?
'Cause unfortunately he died so soon.
"No, you had nobody... you had nobody who dared to take the plans of your father"
The Government needed to look inside its subjects' heads.
"An oath was framed requiring all citizens to reject the United Societies, but there were questions, too."
"Could the subject say, ""God save the King""?"
No-one from the United Societies could say that of Charles II.
Not when God was listening.
And God was always listening.
"john Graham of Claverhouse, fast becoming the Government's enforcer of choice, was sent into the south west, armed with the oath."
The oath could be administered on the spot and failure to take it was punishable by instant death.
These months would be remembered as the Killing Times.
It wasn't the numbers that made the Killing Times notorious.
The numbers weren't great.
It was the summary nature of the executions.
No courts.
No appeals.
Just a bullet in the head.
A little over 90 deaths in a little less than a year.
"The killings began in December and provided an unpleasant baptism for the beginning of a new and inauspicious reign, the reign of James VII and II."
"In February 7685, Charles I!"
died of a stroke.
James's succession was unopposed.
The Stuart dynasty seemed unassailable.
Now there were two powerful Catholic monarchs for Europe's Protestants to contend with.
"In France, Louis XIV."
"In Britain, James VII and II."
"For William of Orange, the Calvinist Prince of the Dutch Republic, the prospect of a Catholic alliance between Louis XIV and James was too frightening for words."
"He had been fighting the French off and on for years, and he was a Stuart, or very nearly."
He was James's nephew and son-in-law.
"In short, he had a claim to James's crowns."
James set about providing William of Orange with ammunition.
"He decreed that Catholics could not only worship, but hold office."
He was his father's son.
Parliament was not consulted.
-You want to go first?
-We going down here?
There'slargeequipment coming in.
Different types of equipment need to be staged in different areas.
There'sa lotof things to consider.

"Itisan ambitious and risky strategy, andonewhichwill cost the team inexcessof $2 million."
That angle of incline getting down into the Money Pit I think has to be addressed.
And do we have a large enough area here for you to construct a crane?
"- Like I say, you level that off a little bit. -"
Level that off there.
How far back do you think?
There's an old trail that comes in up over the hill right there.
-If we come up that hill there...
-Right.
...that'd be just wonderful for us.
We could come up here...
"But we'd-we'd have to push this bank out,"
-wouldn't we?
"-Well, take this stuff off the top, the stuff that's no good, and kind of push it to the corners."
"Well, we got to set up a 100-ton over there,"
"-and other stuff, too, so..."
-Yeah.
"Okay, wait, I just-- hang on, then."
100 tons sitting where?
That could be a problem for a 100-ton set up.

"Yes, but it's his house just as it is yours"
"No, you must understand"
"Zaki, will never enter this apartment again... as long as I live, and even after I die"
"OK, just relax and listen"
- I don't want to hear anything
"- Please, for my sake"
What?
Who do you think you are?
You're just one of his lovers
Don't think that you're something important
What?
"I'm Christine, What are you saying?"
"No, listen... instead of wasting your time with me... go see to your clients, maybe one of them needs something"
"Zaki, you win the bet"
- Didn't I tell you?
"- I thought she was only crazy but she's a vulgar bitch and God willing, she'll die before you"
Good evening

"Aftertwo trials, Hiss was convicted not ofspying but ofperjury."
"To some, Nixon was a hero and a patriot."
"But to many, he was a shameless self-promoter."
Eleanor Roosevelt angrily condemned him.
"Nixon continued to tear into Truman, Acheson and the Democratic party... for losing mainland China in 1949... and blamed the Korean War on a weak foreign policy."
I promise to expose and to continue to expose... the people that have sold this country down the river!
"His speeches, ifmore subtle than those ofhis Republican allyJoe McCarthy, were just as aggressive."
The direct result of Truman's decision is that China has gone Communist.

Mao is a monster!
Why?
Who in the State Department is watching overAmerican interests?
Who has given the Russians the atomic bomb?
The Soviet Union is an example ofa slave state in the ultimate development.
"Driven by demons thatseemed more personal than political,"
Nixon became Eisenhower's vice presidential candidate in 1952.
Then came the Checkers crisis:
Nixon was accused ofhiding a secretslush fund.
"About to be kicked offthe ticket, he went live on national television... in an unprecedented appearance."

- Everything I own.
"And lastly, in whatwas to become history, a sentimental gift from a Texas businessman."
You knowwhat itwas?
"Itwas a little cocker spaniel dog... in a crate that he'd sentall the way from Texas... black and white, spotted."

"I didn't see much in terms of the sides of the well, but the floor, to me, looked very interesting."
"Whilewaitingfor the team at Irving Equipment to begin prepping the Money Pit area for excavation,"
"RickLagina,CharlesBarkhouse andarearesearcher Doug Crowell aretraveling,onceagain, to the town of New Ross, approximately20milesnorth of Oak Island."
"I definitely saw what I thought was a-a straight line, and it almost looked like it was engraved,"
-you know what I mean?
-Yes.
"Lastweek, basedoninformation provided by Zena Halpern,"
"Rick,CharlesandDoug visited a site believedtocontainthe ruins ofanancientTemplarCastle."
"Atthesite,theyfound whatappearedto be  a weathered carving of a cross."
"On the face of the stone, you can see a very faint outline of a cross."
"No ordinary cross, but the cross of the Knights Templar."
Andwhentheyput acamera downanancientstonewell  on the property...
That look like flagstone floor?
...they found possible evidence thatcouldlinkNew Ross to the Oak Island mystery.
"Now, didn't they find flagstone"
-at the Money Pit?
"-Yeah, they did, at two feet down, they did find flagstones, yes."
Maybe it's a ceiling and there's another chamber beneath?
Mighttherebe afalsebottom?
"Might there be a carving in that flagstone, if you will."
"Very, very much looking forward to Tony's..."
Tony's dive today.
"Now,heretheyare , all set to go."
"Tofurther investigate the well,"
Rickhasenlistedthe help of professional diver
TonySampson and his support team.
"If there's information down there, this is the guy and the crew to take care of it."
"Well, we're curious if the well has something that's not visible-- just like the Money Pit had things underneath that were not visible on the surface."
"If something is indeed hidden here, the well could be one way to-to reach it."
"Okay, in my perfect world,"
I would fall into the chamber below it-- full of gold.
"Matrakçı, Bali Bey had a long trip"
I want you to host him in the best way
You'll take care of him
"With your permission, my Paşa"
Thank you for your care
My Sultana
"Come on, let's zoom in"
I'll tell you about our sculptures
"Bali Bey, let's first go to the place we will host you. have a rest."
I'll pick you up in the evening
You haven't been in the capital since a long time
Let's see what kind of clubs there are
Which women are new in town
Did the angels come from the paradise?
Got it
Get ready for the evening
I have the key to the paradise
Good
This unbeatable soldier is Heracles
Son of Zeus
"I mean, Hercules"
The most beautiful Diana
Virgin goddess of hunters
Twin sister of Apollo
They never leave each other
And Apollo
"The god that represents the fire, sun, art and music"
He's a bowman and also healer
He's a soothsayer too
He tells news from the future
They give me the creeps
I'm afraid they'll bring bad luck
"Good, your friend must be a girl"
"Yes, how did you know?"
"If not, the young man would not have fought so vigorously?"
But...
No need to struggle
This is called Qian Kun bag
You can't get rid of it who are you?
"I am Shaw Bu Di, the Monk Bo Doh one of the Five fighters from the Ming Cult"
I'll now bring you to see him
Is somebody in here?
Hello
Hello
"That's strange, how come nobody's in here?"
Says who?
Priest Tieh Kwun
"Shaw Bu Di, you are here too"
"Right, how come nobody's here?"
They are preparing themselves at the main hall for the attack from the six mighty clans
Let's go and find Yang Siu
So glad that Green Bat and the 5 fighters are here too
I beg your pardon for not personally welcoming you
The reason we are here is because of Ming Cult
If the six mighty clans were not attacking this place we'll never be at a place like this
"I know, the six mighty clans are attacking us and I am helpless"
It's really our blessing that the Green Bat and the Five fighters agree to help for the sake of old Master Ming when the enemies go what'll you do with the headship?
Are you all here to help me fight against the enemies or discuss the succession to the Chief's seat
I will pursue this question relentlessly
I don't want to argue with you at this time
If you do not care about the well being of the Ming Cult please leave now
If I survive
I'll visit you individually what boastfulness!
Mr Yang...
What audacity to interrogate me!
You've taken a copy of this book and not returned it for a whole year
David would have killed his pet cat with a pencil
I know I've read this
Where is Nitin?
Nitin or Nitin's dead body?
Don't act smart
You targeted Nitin in the pool and poisoned him but he had a lucky escape
You've killed him with a pencil
I will-
First we shall take a look at the library
Our library is the biggest in the whole of South Asia
Don't interfere in what doesn't concern you
Tell me where you've hidden Nitin
You won't understand my motive
"Tell me, Maya"
"Don't, sir"
I don't have time to play hide and seek with you
Where have you hidden Nitin?
Answer me
"Maya, stop!"
Before the Inspection ends I need Nitin's body
Tell me
You can't escape from me
(phone rings)
You can't leave this library till you tell me where his body is
Where is Nitin?
"Let go of me, sir"
"Don't, sir"
Tell me where Nitin is I will let you go
You can't escape from me
Shiva!
- Okay?
Why don't we head up there and take a look.
"Yeah, let's get started."
"Althoughproof of Knights Templar activity inNorthAmerica has never been established, there are many who believe that not only was there activity, butthatthereisevidence thattheTemplarsmighthave  visited the New World asfarbackas the 12th century,"
morethan300years before the journey ofChristopherColumbus in 1492.

Butperhaps even more astounding istheeeriesimilarity between the Mi'kmaq flag andthebattleflagof the Knights Templar.
Theyarenearlyone  and the same.
"- So, Tony, we'll probably have to remove this lid. -"
And the water level looks a little lower than it was before.
Awesome.
Can you see the cut marks on the stones on the bottom?
"My impression was there was a couple stones down there, and it almost looked like a-a milled edge that sat really tightly together, and maybe was indented along the seam."
That was my impression of what was down there.
"So, it looked like two fitted stones, with a crease quite a ways down the middle of it."
"I mean, look, there's not a lot of space down there, so..."
how are you gonna orient yourself to take a look-see?
"What we're gonna do, Rick, is we're gonna set a frame up here and we're gonna have a beam across the top, and we're gonna set up a Bosun's chair."
"So, I've pretty much got my ass on the chair, going down."
"I'm gonna video 360, going down the whole way."
"Okay, what say you?"
Let's make this happen.
Okay.
"Tosafelydescend down the stone well,"
Tonyandhisteam are constructing what is known asa Bosun'schair.
"Attachedtoapulleysystem, thechairis manually controlled to stop, raiseandlowerTony, as needed."
"Itwillalsoenablehim to rotate 360 degrees, allowingfor a complete inspection ofthewell'sinterior."
"So, Tony, what's-what's the rig set up here?"
It-it kind of looks similar to what Dan went down in-- in 10-X.
You can take lessons from her.
- She is a pro.

"I don't know, Ada After all, Richard's affairs are of more concern to me than to you or to him"
"They're of concern to us all, Ada"
Perhaps he didn't want you upset
- It is a hotel.
Do they serve chicken or mutton?

Get lost you idiot sir.
These parents will never change and.. ..those lover will never unite.
Did you really love him?
Then why did you doubt him?
I did not doubt him.
It was he who told a lie.
"Ok, he told a lie."
But why?
Because he wanted you and could not leave you.
Everyone does not get true love.
You are fortunate to get that.
"Like a pauper, even the heart has come on the street?"
Hey!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Apply the brakes!
So this trick was yours?
You are wasting my time.
"Forget the trick, think of my heart."
- Get lost!
"Or the paper heart burst today ; tomorrow, your heart will."
"You will say, how are you at fault."
This happens at this age.
One falls in love and intentions go wild.
It's all nonsense.
Know in how much tension I have come here today?
And you can only think of mischief.
You want to have fun in the garden.

I'm confident with that news.
My source is reliable.
Who is your source?
Tell us so we know.
You will have to spill it out in court anyway.
I'm lose my mind...
There's the sworn statement of the girl.
And there's the gendarme reports.
Easy now...
Save yourself to the prosecutor.
You can't fabricate news like that.
You'll publish a refutation.
- Okay...
- I'll get your newspaper shut down.
I'll sue both you and your source.
You may come in.
"Mustafa, ignore her son."
Madam.
Madam.
Your husband left these bags for you.
Can you imagine my uncle?
He got furious.
And Selim is a wreck...
That's a bummer...
Just when we thought the things were settling.
Won't you say something?
What do you want me to say?
Don't think we're safe just because only Selim's name's involved.
"If Münir Abi can't stop it, then all the newspapers will write about it."
"And when they dig deeper, they'll find out more."
We will all be screwed.
They'll find out about all of us.
We need to find the recorder and prove the murder.
The left minister and the others are planning to find the truth.
All we need is to find the proof to assist them.
Who are you fellows?
How dare you come...
They all committed a sin of treason.
Arrest all of them.
Who are you fellows?
How dare you come...
They all committed a sin of treason.
Arrest all of them.
Yes sir.
Treason?
"Yoon-jungho, you bastard!"
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?
Now that heaven has changed.
Boo-won Goon (the queen's father's title) come out!
You are under arrest.
What's the matter?
He has committed a sin of treason.
It's an order from the Queen Mother.
How dare you make a loud noise here?
Go away!
Over there.
Catch him.
Take him away.
This red color is made by dipping the cloth in a mixture of flower petals.
It takes hundreds of dippings to make such a vibrant red.

- Enough with the jokes.
No masquerade until we sanitize all the costumes.
- Won't that spoil them?
"- What's more important, clothes or the health of the children?"
- Nothing will spoil them any more.
"They've already been doused with formalin, scrubbed with pumice, and dunked into chlorine."
- I heard at another camp they also fried them with soldering irons.

For the longest day in the year and then miss it?
I do.
We ought to plan something.
All right.
What'll we plan?
What do people plan?
Look at that.
"My little finger, it's all black and blue."
"You did that, tom."
"I know you didn't mean to,"
But that's what I get for marrying a brute of a man.
A great big hulking brute of a man.
"Oh, daisy, I hate that word, ""hulking."""
Even in kidding.
Hulking.
How do you know which measure of center best describes the data?
Let's see.
"We have the mean, the median, and the mode."
But how do you choose?
"In this lesson you will learn how to summarize the center of data with a single number  by examining the mean, median, and mode."
Let's start by remembering how to find the mode and median.
Here's the graph about how many books sixth graders  at Taylor Middle School read this summer.
The mode is the number that appears most often.
"So, in this data set, the mode is two."

What sight of love did you cast on me!
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.

What sight of love did you cast on me!
What can a person do when helpless?
What can a person do when helpless?
Even after knowing I am in trouble.
You have crossed your limit.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You should control your heart.
You should control your heart.
There is twilight after every dawn.
Why did you make your plight bad?
I will come with you.
- Let us go.
You dont worry baby.
Nothing will happen to him.
He is angry with me so he did not do.. .. the job I offered.
Ego problem.
And joined in this dirty job and now arrested.
As a man he should have some ego but not this much.
As your father I have to try something.
But how?
I have to fall at their feet.
I will directly talk with the home minister.
I think it is the correct idea.
Small influences will not work.
Since it is a terrorist case.
Hello!
Is it the home minister?
"Yes, this is home minister speaking."
What is the matter?
"Its me sir, Kona Ranga Rao."
My fellow is in trouble sir.
It will not be a big problem.
If you give the surety.. ..he can be released.
No problem.
When I said that my father arranged a job for you.. ..you laughed at me.
As a result we became the laughing stock.. .. for everyone.
A man should not have so much ego Venkat.
You are crazy.
You are fortunate to be released.
Otherwise what would have happened?
"Shailu, you dont understand."
This is the drama ploted by ..your father and that Bhadram to separate us.
"Put a zero, okay?"
Yeah.
"If you have a longer vector, than your diagonal is long."
Does it just take the first?
Yes.
[inaudible] it kills the excess.
"Yeah, remember, so these things over run over here."
And they run over here.
And it just goes this way.
Everything is lined up according to here.
"Oh so, so that bottom the negative diaginol the diagnol negative what ever it was it got rid of the first section of the vector."
Yeah right here.
So thinks about putting the vector down right here.
Says well okay you put the vector start it here go down and then come up again to show that it doesn't exist.
Okay and on the other side it gets rid of the n of the vector.
Yes.
Okay.
Or it could be actually I think that's wrong.
It's the other way.
It goes this way.
So.
"These guys, here. ."
Get stuff thrown out down here.
And this stuff up here gets thrown stuff up there.
Okay?
But same concept.
"So let's put this E2 in, cuz we just, created this vector with an occasional zero."
"And that guy goes right, here."
"If I do this,"
"Come on, come on."
Look at that.
Oop.
Kuzey's case will drop when the real killer is trialled.
And then he'll be free again.
"Okay, let's hope so."
And then I'll divorce and be free as well.
"Cemre, for God's sake don't live in vain hope."
- What hope?
- I'm saying I will divorce.
"I mean, for after you got divorced don't get hopes."
Look sweetie Güney is a black thorn between you two.
Nothing will change this reality.
Put this in your mind.
"Mom, what are you doing?!"
I'm giving them proper shape.
You can't send heart shaped cookies to jail.
You want to embarrass him?
"They will mock him, girl."
If they see them heart shaped like this.
"And you know Kuzey, how easy it is to push his buttons."
"See it looks nice, when it's plain and simple as well."
He can offer it to the other jailers as well.
"Okay, it seems you thought of everything."
"Well, we need a smart person in the house."
"Then, dear mom..."
You brush some eggs over those.
While I'm writing Kuzey a note.
What note are you talking about?
You've written a novel since last night.
"Please, I expect some respect to my privacy."
I didn't read your letter.
I just saw you writing it.
- Of course you didn't read...
- Why would I read it?
That's what we've got to do.
"Now, some of you aren't in the optimal position to hit the"
lattice.
I invite you to come down and get a little closer.
That is okay.
"Now, are you roughly ready?"
Yeah.
All right.
But there is one other piece of information that is very important that I have got to tell you.
And that is that only fools aim for their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER]
"Okay, go to it."
Watch your ball.
Okay.
Have all the alpha particles been launched?
Yes.
Fantastic.
All right.
Now comes the moment of truth.
How many of you had an alpha particle that backscattered?
"Okay, so now I've got to count."
Keep your hands up because there are some lights that make it a little hard for me to see.
Anybody in this section here?
Yes.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Six.
Anymore?
Did I get everybody?
That's it?
Six alpha particles that backscattered.
"Okay, so now we have to calculate some probabilities here."
The probability of backscattering is the number that backscattered.
Have you forgotten that the whole palace is  not fond of having a half brother of the king around?
Don't do anything to give them a reason to make it an issue.
It's my rightful duty to see you twice a day.
"You still don't call me ""mother""."
It seem like you are spying on me.
You are making me very uncomfortable.
What do you mean by spying?
You still don't have a heir and have not gotten a concubine  either.
Others are saying I am making you this way.
I'm just sorry for the one who has already passed.
There isn't any other reason.
"Although I am your new mother,  you must understand that I still care for you."
"Then, please seek out for a new candidate for the queen's position."
I will start seeking a new queen.
Who's out there?
"My prince, please, come in."
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
It's very late.
Let's go inside first.
Didn't you promise me already?
"Yes, I have promised you."
But I could not go against palace instruction...
Why?
Did she say that she doesn't want me?
Please let's step inside first...
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
Chandra:
"So, do they ask you then?"
I'll make it clear.
It's before we start dating.
They'll know that I'm an asexual person.
"And I'll make it clear when we're, you know, when we're still in the friend stage."
Elisabeth:
Do they see it as a challenge?
"Do they think, ""Well, I'm gonna get him to be sexual."" ?"
[laughter]
David:
"A couple people have, but it hasn't worked out."
Star:
"So, do you not have sex?"
"I mean, do asexual people not have sex at all?"
No sexual contact?
David:
"There's a couple of aexual people who, kind of as a compromise because they're in a relationship with sexual people."
It's not like a code.
It's not like we kick you out or something.
Joy:
"Well, let me ask you something."
[laughter]
Do you ever have sex with yourself?
[laughter]
David:
It's a valid question.
[laughter]
"Perfectly, perfectly, valid question."
[applause]
Joy:
You may not be attracted to anyone else but that doesn't mean you're not attracted to yourself.
And we'll have to pay the scrap dealer.. ..to have this cleared.
Why pay?
"We'll give him one of the broken idols.. ..and say "" It appeared from the ground in Amarnath "" ."
"What are you saying, brother-in-law?"
You'll soon be bankrupt.
Do you know the losses you've incurred?
40 lakhs.
Goods worth 25 lakhs bought on credit.. ..and 15 lakhs spent on renovation last month.
40 lakhs?
Where did you get that kind of money?
We borrowed a part of the amount by mortgaging the house.
And I borrowed 10 lakhs from a friend.
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket.. ..for earning 18% interest.
"Pravin, you fool."
You didn't even ask me.
How will we arrange for such a huge sum?
There's hardly 30-40 thousand in the bank.
And we don't even have jewellery.
Sushila.
We'll manage.
- How?
Why don't you understand?
lf you hadn't spoken ill about the Lord.. ..He wouldn't have caused this earthquake.
His justice is silent.
Will you please stop preaching?
"You mean to say, that the Lord.. ..who doesn't exist, razed down my shop.. ..because I spoke ill about Him?"
"So, just to prove Himself.. ..he razed down just my shop in a fit of rage."
And if I still don't believe in Him.. ..he will make me incur more losses?
- Yes.
What yes?
I still don't believe in You?
I haven't incurred any loss.
Look not for the permanence of job but of love.
Listen to me and apologize to him.
What about our parents?
It is you who have to live together.
Not your parents.
Go quickly.
If you delay then he may not accept you.
Why are you still thinking?
Go now.
"Kiran, I did not come to say sorry to you."
But to tell you that I will live or die with you only.
Stop there.
What are you doing with my son now?
Have you gone mad?
What was the need for you to go to him?
I will bring a much better boy for you than him.
Get who ever you can.
But this marriage will never happen.
I wont agree for this marriage even if you fall at my feet.
Stop it.
Our marriage will take place.
We are not concerned with your standoff.
Our love is important for us.
She realized her mistake and.. ..apologized me.
Now if I bow to your adamancy.. .. then I will lose her forever.
Whether or not you agree we are going to marry.
Will you not shed your anger over me?
How can I bare that anger?
Stop your acting I will not surrender to you
Show some mercy on your girl who approached you
Does our paths ever combine?
Please stop your angry scolding
We will burn his house.. .. with a tank full of petrol and bring Shailaja back.
Are you out of your mind?
He is not an ordinary person.
He is a powerful man in entire Telangana.
That will be our strength.
He cannot imagine .. ..that we will dare to rescue Shailu from him.
Even then we should not be careless.
With a perfect plan.. ..we should rescue her tonight.
"Bhadra, listen to me."
She is not even taking any food.
How would she possibly marry you and lead her life with you?
Dont do it.
If you decorate your feet with Mehendi.
They look beautiful with that red color.
If you decorate your hands they too look beautiful.
But dont let blood smear your hands.
It will not be nice.
I could have done anything with you.
But my father told me in his death bed.. .. not to hurt any woman.
That is why I have caused no harm to you.
But I will definitely marry you.
I dont like you.
Then whom do you like?
That Venkat who left you and ran away?
Why do you think him so much about him?
I am the person who is standing all your abuses.
Think about me.
Change your mind.
It is not me but you who has to change your mind.
"Whatever you say, my fancy for you is only increasing."
What do you ladies have?
Even kings become your slaves.
"Ball, car, picture."
Can you repeat those back to me please?
"BALL, CAR AND PlCTURE."
Fantastic.
"I'm going to ask you that later, again, so try and remember please."
"Starting from 100, can you take away 7 and tell me what that is? then keep taking away 7 and tell me what the answer is each time and I'll tell you when to stop and you can stop."
100.

Hello.
Today we are going to use fabric to make a crane.
Inflate four balloons
leaving about six inch flat tail.
I use different color balloons for this instruction.
Twist the first yellow bubble.
We are going to twist all bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist the first gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the first gray bubble with free end of the first yellow bubble.
Now let's connect two more balloons.
Twist the first red bubble.
Twist the first pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the first pink bubble with the free end of the first red bubble.
Twist the second yellow bubble.
Twist the second red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second yellow and the second red bubbles in one lock twist.
OK.
Now twist the second pink bubble.
And twist the second gray bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second pink and second gray bubbles in one lock twist.
It is the bottom view of our sculpture.
Twist the third pink bubble.
"Just think: all the cars, tractors, trucks, ships and planes in the world added together emit fewer greenhouse gasses than livestock farming!"
Oh really?
"Wow, I thought it was mostly cars."
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Livestock?
"That's crazy, so more than the cars."
Are you serious?
"Yeah, I didn't know that."
That's insane.
"No, I did not know that, no."
That's news to me.
I haven't heard that.
"I've never heard the livestock connection, no."
"Well I knew there was some, but I had no idea that it was so extensive."
How does it come from livestock exactly?
What do you call cow farts?
What do you call that?
OK ...
"Yeah, the methane gas coming from the cows."
Yeah.
"It's cow shit, right?"
Doesn't cow poop?
"It's what the emissions, right?"
"I thought it was just fat people here in the South, here in America."
"But no, apparently it's cattle as well."
It's quite worrying.
"Well I saw an article and they say, because it is the cow, what they fart and then actually the farting they make the global warming."
And how can it be that farm animals place a heavier burden on the environment than the entire transport sector worldwide?
"Well, actually it is rather simple."
Once upon a time a farmer was someone who owned land and some animals.
"produces a zero, and in the second component I have a"
"minus one and a four, they combine to give the three."
But look at this picture.
So here's our key picture.
I combine this column and this column to get this guy.
That was the b.
That's the zero three.
Okay.
So that idea of
"linear combination is crucial, and also -- do we want to think"
about this question?
"Sure, why not."
What are all the combinations?
If I took -- can I go back to xs and ys?
This is a question for
"really -- it's going to come up over and over, but why don't we see it"
once now?
"If I took all the xs and all the ys, all the combinations,"
what would be all the results?
"And, actually,"
the result would be that I could get any right-hand side at all.
The combinations of this and this would fill the whole plane.
You can tuck that away.
"We'll, explore it further."
But this idea
of what linear combination gives b and what do all the linear
"combinations give, what are all the possible,"
achievable right-hand sides be -- that's going to be basic.
Okay.
Can I move to three equations and three unknowns?
Because it's easy to picture the two by two case.
Let me do a three by three example.
Radha likes him.
If we are getting a good son-in-law... ...what's wrong in waiting for few more years?
"By then, even Radha will pass her graduation."
And it's not easy to get her married in this circumstances.
Radha!
Come out.
Come here.
You always shared everything with me.
But today you didn't tell me about your feelings?
Father!
Kishan!
I can't come and see you in the jail.
And this letter also may be my last letter to you.
On this condition brother Damu has postponed... ...my marriage for 2 more years.
"Kishan, how will I spend these two years?"
I'll miss you every moment.
"We'll meet, Kishan."
We'll definitely meet... ...at the same place from where we had separated.
"""Even after separation, we're worried about one thing."""
"""How will I live for years in this condition?"""
"""Death didn't but your memories reached me."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""After few days love we faced a long period of separation."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""My lips murmured in prayer for you."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""After few days love we faced a long period of separation."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""I'm not with you, my love."""
"""And there's no hope of our meeting."""
"""And there's no hope of our meeting."""
"""On top of it, the spring puts us on test."""
it is one of the first column and two of the second column and let's
just see what we get.
So in the first component I'm
getting a two and a ten.
I'm getting a twelve there.
"In the second component I'm getting a one and a six, I'm"
getting a seven.
So that matrix times that vector is
twelve seven.
"Now, you could do that another way."
You could do it a row at a time.
And you would get this twelve --
and actually I pretty much did it here -- this way.
Two -- I could take that row times my vector.
This is the idea of a
dot product.
"This vector times this vector, two times one plus five"
times two is the twelve.
This vector times this vector --
one times one plus three times two is the seven.
"So I can do it by rows, and in each row times my x is what"
I'll later call a dot product.
But I also like to see it by
columns.
I see this as a linear combination of a column.
So here's my point.
A times x is a combination of the
columns of A. That's how I hope you will think of A times x when we need
it.
"Right now we've got -- with small ones, we can always do it"
"in different ways, but later, think of it that way."
Okay.
He is cautious of us as well.
We haven't been able to find his headquarters.
"After the ship has left, we will send our men as we agreed."
Please do not concern yourself any longer about that ship.
You mean there is no evidence of any trade of weapons by Yongmun?
Yes.
They have amassed great wealth by trading with China.
But they have never traded in weapons.
Alright.
But there was a small commotion involving Yongmun.
"Although they weren't directly involved, someone filed a report against the loan shark Choi Chul Joo, who borrowed a warehouse from Yongmun."
Choi Chul Joo?
What kind of man is he?
He is a loan shark rumored to have a past as a bandit.
So Yongmun has business arrangements with such a man?
It's Yongmun.
It looks like a funeral procession.
Let's stand aside and let them pass.
"The dead girl is said to have died while running away from Choi Chul Joo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh, how terrible!"
How terrible!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
They... they are one with the men that killed our daughter!
They're one with them!
- What do I do now?
- Compose yourself!
Move along!
- No!
- Will you kill my son too!
You evil men!
Sheath your swords!
Let's go!
- You evil wretches!
- Are you alright?
"So, if these things are true, than we'll say that these two pairs are equivalent."
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, that's a relation."
Is it an equivalence relation?
There's some things to check here.
Right?
"We won't do them all, but do you want you to think that..."
"So here's the important thing to do, once you have a construction, the work is not done, you should check that it is an equivalence relation."
Check tilde is an equivalence relation.
"So, for instance, is it reflexive?"
Some of you said yes right away and some of you hesitated.
How would I check if it's reflexive?
What would I have to check to check the reflexive condition for this relation?
Which is on pairs of pairs?
Right?
"You give me a pair and another pair, how would I check... what would I have to check for reflexivity?"
What do I wanna check?
What's the condition I wanna check?
What corresponds to a R a over there?
"Yeah, is p q equivalent to p q?"
"Now, does everybody agree this is what we have to check?"
"It's not the only thing, but it's one of the things."
Yeah?
"Ok, good, now, is this easy to check?"
"Well, then you go back to this definition, since this is why definitions are so important in Mathematics, because we know what we mean, we have a definition."
What does it mean to check p q tilde p q?
It means checking that... p q equal q p.
Is that true?
For integers.
Yes.
Ok?
"-What the (bleep) is happenin', forum?"
"Listen, if you have a girlfriend, don't put her  on an ATV and make her ramp things."
-(man) Here we go.
Oh-ho!
(laughing):
Oh no!
-And wouldn't it be polite to make sure she  hasn't broken her neck before you start laughing?
"I mean, look at that."
I think she may have actually kissed her own ass.
"(man in video laughing) Yeah, you hear this dumbass laughing?"
"Epic boyfriend FAlL man, really."
Are you guys ready for it?
Are you guys ready for the cutest six seconds ever!!
Ever!!
"That you'll ever!! see in your life, ever?!!"
Check it out.
So damn cute!
"That's actually a viral video back from 2007, but, I mean, look at them."
"I want that one, that one, that one, and that one."
"But not that one, 'cause he looks like an (bleep)hole."
"Seriously though, cutest furry little bastards ever!!"
"All right, this last video, it's simple, it's incredible, it's tragic..."
"You know, just watch."
(imitates crash)
"Now, this video really bothers me."
Mainly because the woman isn't doing stupid.
"She isn't playing with gasoline, she isn't drag-racing, she isn't playing with sharp objects, but yet she still gets hurt."
And I feel so bad for her... that I'm actually still gonna do the super slow-motion replay over the funny voiceover.
"-(high-pitched voiceover singing) Stack these cans, all day long"
Stack these cans While I sing this song
"Hey, I didn't know creamed corn is on sale..."
Whoa!
"My lord, this isn't small issue."
That shop means everything to me.
My means of earning.
The only way to support my family.
And I built that shop with hard work.
"Now, it's just a piece of land."
And no one's ready to buy that as well.
"These people say,  "" Donate with faith.. """
""" ..and you'll never be wronged "" ."
"And the insurance people say  "" Pay your premiums on time.. """
""" ..we're there in your troubled times "" ."
I gave donations and also paid my premiums.
But none of them are willing to help me.
I am an ordinary human.
A middle-class man.
"My family, my wife and children.. ..will be forced to live on streets."
"No, my lord."
You'll have to give me a chance.. ..to defend my case in this court.
And the constituency of lndia gives me the right.. ..to voice my plea in this court.
"So please, my lord."
One crore is a big amount for a middle-class businessman.
"And especially, when it's a question of his survival."
"So, the court accepts Kanji Lalji Mehta's case."
Silence.
"And only after carefully examining.. ..all the evidences and arguments.. ..the court will give its verdict, whether.. ..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will get his compensation or not."
"And if he does, then who will pay him?"
"The insurance company or, the temple."
The court's adjourned for the day.
Wait.
Wait.
You can perform all the veneration you want.. ..and ring those bells as many times you wish.
Your God razed down my shop.
I'm trying to do better.
"Being brillians not enough, young man."
You have to work hard.
"Intelligence is not a privilege, is a gift."
And you use it for the good of mankind.
You want to try it back there?
So is that it?
Yes.
My design to initiate and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world.
Are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction?
"Peter, what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half?"
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.
"Rosie, our new friend thinks I'm gonna blow up the city."
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
"Come to the demonstration tomorrow, and you'll see for yourself."
"And you need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto."
Did Edison sleep before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent?
"Rosie, I love this boy."
The people will find his name on the updated witness list... ...we provided to them this morning.
Very well.
I'll allow it into evidence.
Father Moore.
Will you play the tape for us now?
*This is the exorcism of Emily Rose. *
"*Those present are myself,* *Father Richard Moore... * ...Nathaniel, Emily's father... ...Jason, her friend... ...a doctor who is here to monitor Emily during the ritual... ...and Emily herself... ...who has given her permission for the ritual to be performed."
"All right, now listen."
You may say the rosary or any private prayer for her deliverance... ...when you're not responding to my words.
"Above all... ...do whatever I ask, without question."
Don't ask it any questions... ...or pay any attention to what it says.
"""It""?"
We won't be dealing with Emily tonight.
Restrain her.
"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us."
It has begun.
Let us pray.
"""Because she hopes in you, my God."""
"""Send her help from the holy place, Lord."""
"""And give her heavenly protection."""
"""May the Lord be with you."""
"""And with your spirit."""
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
My God.
Are you all right?
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
I'm fine.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation...
But deliver us from evil!
"Who are you, demon?"
Two lines.
And what do they do.
"Well, you bring in your initial guess, you bring in your data, and all you gotta do, right, is minimize that sum."
"So all you gotta tell it is, what do you want to minimize."
"Well the sum of remember i've, this x not, our initial guess of a and b."
"And I have ax+b is my guess for my line fit, minus the actual values, square it, sum it."
"Well, I don't need an absolute value here, by the way, right?"
"Because my data is real and I'm squaring it, okay?"
"So, if I had imaginary data, you have to be careful."
Okay?
"So I'm going to go and then it's going to return e, which is there, I'm just trying to minimize this."
"So you've given it a guess: one, one."
And it has an algorithm.
"Okay, so it's a utilization search algorithm."
It just goes to look and say I'm going to change a and b.
In such a way to minimize that thing. okay.
That's it!!!
"Now, if you go to the L-1 case, the only difference is what?"
You don't square it anymore.
"In the L-1 case, what you do, here it is."
"Now I do take the abso lute ? that I'm not squaring I just. ax+b-y, absolute value, sum."
'Kay?
Line fitting.
That's all we're doing.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
Line fitting today?
"So, it seems like we're taking a step backwards."
"We've been recognizing dogs and cats on our computer, and now we're just doing"
line fits?
But there will be an important point to be made.
"Okay, so let's, we got those and here is our thing."
How are things?
My dad is not back yet...
"We don't know his where about- Oh,really?"
"He sent a message, only to me."
"""I am out of the city, I have to clear my head a bit, don't worry and so on"" - he wrote.."
So much.
"- Good thing,that he informed you.."
I have a terrible headache.
"If you want we can stop in a ""Pharmacy"", before you get the forest street."
"No, i already took some medicines, i have always these migraines..."
If I have the pain I can't open my eyes.
Now of course got worse...-Then we turn off the air conditioner and open the widows..
The air comes in.
Open your side too.
"If there was a little support for Faruk, if there was a source to handle his assets for some months,"
I know he will pull himself together.
There are some things he is waiting for but...
"Don't cry my dear, don't cry.."
Everything went so wrong...
The only thing I can't endure in this life is woman's tears.
"Don't do it, please."
"For sure, there must be a way to save us from this situation.."
The only way is to pay the debts...
Unfortunately..
The wares can't compensate the debt.. then everything will be sold... whoever buys it.
"Ender also will have to wait fairly to get her debt back, I know this."
What has Ender to do with it?
You did not know?
Faruk borrowed money from Ender too.
Exactly 500.000 US dollars.
"Leave it for Gods sake, this is all humbug (palaver)..."
I wonder why are you so cruel when it comes to Faruk?
I don't want to return to the beginning again now.
Come on!
I had very difficult childhood.
there were so many things i did not have in my life.
"I didn't know about the comfort of a bed at all... a warm house, sleeping with a full stomach , to dream of beautiful things..."
But now i know..
"When one is in poverty it doesn't impose so much, because there is nothing, , nothing!"
One is subzero...
"But now is difficult,Mira."
I don't want to lose these.
At least that will not happen...
"When we met with Faruk, he loved an ignorant but beautiful girl."
"I did everything,.. so he loved me."
"From the day I walked out of that neighborhood, I didn't return there again ,never looked back."
I wanted to forget..
"And, I did forget."
"I wanted Asude to be Sude,"
And it happened like that...
"I know the value of my life better ,than any other women , who lives this kind of life.."
That i don't want to lose ..
Do you understand?
"I don't want my children to live in bad conditions , which i had as kid.."
I don't want you to worry about your future.
So you won't have to climb through life..
"Mom, please!"
"Don't write tragedy scenarios right away, for God's sake"
Nothing will be as you think.
"Above all, i trust my dad."
You trust the man who licked the dust in front of everyone.?
"Don't do it, for Gods sake."
"Okay, i mean i also will not forget what happened this evening."
"but I am not in love with this sort of life, as much as you are."
"And now, a rockabilly guitar."
Which is nice.
"But what if I want to make, say, a -- (Applause) --"
Thanks.
"What if I want to make, say, a rock organ?"
Is that possible?
"Yes, it is, by recording myself like this."
(Organ sound)
"And now I have that, I have that recorded."
Assign it to a keyboard.
(Music)
So that's cool.
(Applause)
But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
"Impossible, you say."
No.
"It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine."
It's really fantastic.
Check it out.
(Music)
So every noise you can hear there is my voice.
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that.
There's no samples.
There's no synthesizers.
"That is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point?"
Why do this?
(Laughter)
"Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd,"
"I suppose, is the easy answer."
"But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist."
I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine.
"So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see."
And then I jump up and say:
"""I won this award last year, but didn't say the most important thing."""
It should look like I just grabbed a mike.
"Then I say that... ...some people are glad that child- ren die, it saves the environment."
Others fall on their knees and say someone has to save the children.
"Some pray to a higher power, but most feel powerless and stare off into space."
They think only crazy optimists like Rosling think it's getting better.
In school we did a lot of variety shows.
I had good directors but they said that I couldn't act.
"""You're always yourself."
"You can't take direction and you can't act."""
So I became a stage manager.
-Were you disappointed?
"-Yes, but the criticism was right."
I have semi-controlled ADHD.
I can communicate and lecture but playing another person takes a different kind of skill.
You have to tape it well on my cheek.
This is totally awesome...
I've been waiting for this for five years.
- Can't you make it bigger?
- We can run it in widescreen.
The total projection was bigger a minute ago.
- We can stretch it sideways.
- Make it as big as possible.
- It's not even half the ceiling.
- That's because of the lens.
"Sure, but for the maximum effect it needs to be as big as possible."
Try widescreen.
"See that, Karin?"
"They said it worked, but it doesn't."
We're not using the whole ceiling.
You lose 90% of the effect.

Manish has developed ill intentions.
He wants to keep the 100 million worth of diamonds to himself.
Manish has turned a betrayer who we cannot trust anymore.
"I don't want Manish now, but those diamonds."
Go and search every corner of the city.
Beat him!
I don't want to hear anything.
If I don't get those diamonds. . .
I will bury you half in soil and blow up the other half with a bomb.
I want those diamonds worth 100 million.
Go and find Manish anyhow.
Is Lily home?
"- No, she has gone to Goa."
My name is Manish.
Ask her to call me when she returns.
"Look, don't forget, it is very urgent."
"Do make her call me, okay?"
He was just as light on his feet as - you couldn't imagine a guy that size could be as light on his feet in step dance.
"The Donie guys, of course, Peter and Patsy, they used to always..."
"Patsy, Peter, and..."
Patsy worked for me.
Best worker I had.
But Peter and
Lester would - They'd get up...
Friendly rivalry.
Which was good.
"Could you describe a typical party at night or something, where they'd be playing music?"
"Yeah, they'd play the music."
They had the chairs sitting around the hall.
The parish hall?
"Wouldn't have any tables set up unless it was a dinner or a wedding, you know."
"So here you are, you're trying to dance and you've got everybody in the aisle and all these old women standing there watching you."
So you're not really doing too much dancing.
"Jack [?] would set up a stable right outside there, right around the corner where they..."
They'd have a keg of beer out there.
"Because it wasn't - the bar wasn't in the - in fact, the kitchen was where the bar is now."
And where the kitchen is was the high school.
That's what they...
There at the parish hall?
Yeah.
"And then when they finally quit using that, they made that into a little library too."
In 1960.
Even when they first put the other stuff out.
They wouldn't have any alcohol in the parish hall.
They'd have the keg sitting on a table outside.
"Yeah, just a table thing there."
And then - so continue with that scene.
"Well, that'd be it."
And they'd just play the music.
It's obvious you're doing well.
It looks good on you!
"Come on, enjoy your meal...- hey. dude..."
Didn't you find any other place to take the girl for a walk?
Your head doesn't work at all!
Don't let your friend wait for you.
Enjoy...&amp;gt; Thanks.
May God never let you lose your appetite!
If you want we can leave right away.
"We will leave after you're done with your meal.- If it's for me, I am sated."
I did a cheekiness.
"When it gets colder it has no taste, come on!"
Did you really give rein for 500000 USD to Faruk?
I gave it from my personal account.
Only fools do unrequited favors.
"I didn't grant that money to Faruk, dad!"
"Cut it out, for God's sake!"
I was married four times... and I didn't give reins to so much money for anyone.
I didn't lend anyone money without getting the return until today!
Neither in my personal life nor in my business life.
"Because I know that everything which belongs to me, belongs to you, to your brother, to my grandchildren and to this holding at the same time."
I don't ever forget this either.-But you don't behave like that
You take steps which you can't take them back.
"Dad, please!"
"Really, I don't have energy to discuss with you."
I have been running here and there all day.
Please could you let me unbrace myself a bit...
Don't test my patience Ender!
"I can tolerate you to feed ""street dogs"" at your home.. but nothing else except your family is yours."
Don't ever forget this!
Call Haldun right away!
"Let him investigate about all Faruk personal possessions.. and put on my desk.-as you wish ,sir."
A and the right-hand side is also a vector that I'll always call b.
So linear equations are A x equal b and the idea now is to solve this
particular example and then step back to see the bigger picture.
"Okay, what's the picture for this example, the Row picture?"
"Okay, so here comes the Row picture."
So that means I take one row at a
time and I'm drawing here the xy plane and I'm going to plot all the
points that satisfy that first equation.
So I'm looking at all the
points that satisfy 2x-y =0.
It's often good to start with which
"point on the horizontal line -- on this horizontal line,"
y is zero.
"The x axis has y as zero and that -- in this case,"
"actually, then x is zero."
"So the point, the origin --"
"the point with coordinates (0, ) is on the line."
It solves that
equation.
"Okay, tell me in -- well, I guess I have to tell you"
another point that solves this same equation.
"Let me suppose x is one,"
so I'll take x to be one.
"Then y should be two,"
right?
So there's the point one two that also solves this equation.
And I could put in more points.
"But, but let me put in all the"
"points at once, because they all lie on a straight"
line.
This is a linear equation and that word linear got the letters for
line in it.
"Now I can see the suggested route to my destination, the length of the ride, and also the price estimate."
We've arrived.
I'm paying for the ride and I'm rating the driver.
I was very satisfied.
Done.
You can see how very easy all of this was.
"Instead of waiting, the driver got a job thanks to Liftago."
"As a passenger, I am happy with the service."
I didn't wait in vain and my order didn't depend on a single phone number or on a single transport company.
I chose the best driver around.
I was able to see his price in advance and his rating.
I knew who would pick me up and in what car.
"Actually, I didn't have any trouble at all."
"With Liftago, we're creating a free taxi market."
Hassle-free for passengers and hassle-free for taxi drivers.
"The better and more convenient service we provide, the more orders we get for Liftago drivers."
And that is our goal.
"Thanks to the skills of the whole community of marketers, we can create something truly great together."
"Just imagine that in a few years, we'll be as important for city transport as Google is right now with searching for information on the internet."
Good luck!
"Previously on ""The Vampire Diaries""..."
"You took everything from me, Klaus."
Let bygones be bygones.
Resentment gets old.
You know what never gets old?
Revenge.
No.
"What's a matter, Klaus?"
Missing something?
"Three sleeping originals, four coffins."
Who is in the locked box?
He's been sired.
How does it feel now that it's over?
CL:
"It is so wonderful, it's so incredibly wonderful that it's over, even though it was funny."
J:
It is not quite over yet.
You will get points too.
CL:
"Yes,"
J:
"Wow, wow, wow."
Right in the lead Camilla.
That was not a bad score at all.
CL:
"No, it's ok when you are here, but out there it is terrible"
J:
"Sit down and breathe a little now, since you didn't do that when you were dancing"

Well done.
"Whatever happened to — ""agree to disagree?"""
Third-year Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke has become the face of the campaign for access to birth control coverage for women.
"""Without insurance coverage, contraception can cost as much as $3,000 dollars during law school. """
Both sides have been locked in a weeks-long battle over mandated birth control coverage.
"But on his radio show — Limbaugh took a personal shot at Fluke to make his point. ""essentially says she must be paid to have sex."
What does that make her?
"It makes her a slut, right?"""
And he didn't stop there.
"Thursday he said — if taxpayers have to foot the bill , then. ""we want something in return."
"And that is the videos of all the sex posted online so we can see."""
That got Limbaugh's critics fired up.
As an anchor for WFLD somewhat tentatively puts it.
"""Wow."
"You can um, imagine um, that sparked a lot of um, reaction and not very well, negative as you can imagine."""
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And we'll count about 50 to 100 of them, and we'll place them in a glass tube..."
And then we add some hexane.
And then we grind it up.
"And what you can see is the white part here at the bottom is the pulp of the seed, and that's where the oil is."
And what that oil will do is actually migrate up into the extraction layer here.
"And then will suck that little clear part off, and place it into a GC vile."
"Now once the liquid in in here, we have a computer that can control this robot"
And it applies a sample on every 24 minutes.
"Because this is automated, we can run anywhere from 900 to 1,000 samples within a week, and runs 24 hours a day."
Beth Seaton:
"Why would you run 900 to 1,000 samples?"
Win Phippen:
"Well, if you're breeding plants, you're not quite sure which one has the components that you want."
"So when I make a cross, I've got all the these young seedling plants, and I'm not sure which one I'm interested in."
So I have to collect seeds from each individual plant.
Beth Seaton:
Every single plant?
Win Phippen:
Every single plant.
Beth Seaton:
And that's why you keep these numbers running?
Win Phippen:
And I've got to keep every single vile together.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Once we have the sample in the vile, there's a robot here that is controlled by the computer, that will inject a sample very 24 minutes."
"So, as soon as the sample goes in, it actually enters into a very long glass tube."
It's about 30 meters long.
And so if it's a very
"And by the way, if you come over here to your MATLAB code and say, what's, what's"
A?
Notice how A is saved.
"The one wants components one, two, two is one."
"It only saves what it needs to, Okay?"
"So normally when you say A it , prints out this giant matrix to your screen."
"And it's just saying look, here are the components that are nonzero Yeah."
"I want to add like 68 equals twelve, do you blow the sparseness, or [inaudible] can you say A bracket, six comma A equals twelve, do you then add that point?"
And it's still sparse?
"Yeah, yeah, you can do this, check this out, yeah."
"A six comma twelve is equal to seven, because we like seven right?"
Huh?
"It's the best number ever, and we can just say spy that and check it out."
There's Taylor's number right over there.
It's a seven.
Still sparks.
You can do anything you want now.
Okay.
We're going to keep that there.
"And then by the way, I can put down diagonals anywhere I want now."
Let's put down another row of 1's at one.
Look at that.
I put it one diagonal over.
"As I said go to one, which is the next one over."
Put down ones.
Now our matrix is a little more complicated.
"I encourage you to look at page, whatever in the notes, where I actually show you what this thing looks like.'Kay?"
"And, this thing has a complicated structure, in particular, I guess we could Actually, I have it in my notes, so let m, e let me, let me draw this what this thing looks like."
"Do we have, turn the lights up here real quick?"
And then Alright.
So let me just show you what this thing
looks like.
It was when Golgotha killed Dardane.
"And surprise surprise, the very same day you find an item that is not even referenced in the loots's list of Horizon 1.1."
"Comrades, this is a critical moment, an emergency meeting is a must."
"Come on, follow me... and you, come here."
Okay I see.
I need to contact Tenshirock as soon as possible.
What is the date...
Tenshirock.
"Tenshirock, Tenshirock !"
- I absolutely needed to see you.
"- Really, what for ?"
This.
Well !
If it isn't my favorite little noob.
"Can you tell me why you give him a cheated item while me, your old friend for ages, I get nothing."
"Ash, Ash, Ash."
We are not going to talk about this again.
"I already explained my motives to you : if I give you just one item, created by me, you're going to resale it right away to those poor souls who are enchained in their virtual world."
And you'll feed their addiction.
"Me, I'm here to set them free."
There is no such thing as a worthless trade... and you didn't answer my question.
Noob power.
What?
"Noob power, it is nothing else than my brilliant plan to decolonise the MMORPG."
I already regret asking...
And how do you plan to handle it this time ?
"Well, as usual, a small demonstration is better than a long speech, look."
"Comrades, this item is a threat to the Noob guild."
We are near the destruction.
"If one of the game master sees us with it, nobody will escape."
And our avatars will be deleted.
This staff is a gift... a gift to the foes of the Noob guild.
"I think because now, because even connected to the web uh, I do multimedia for my work too."
So if I created something in there.
There's gotta be finally in the end exported as a.
Multimedia page.
Right.
On there.
Connecting that.
Yeah.
"You know, it would be a lot of free, free videos."
And I've searched for educational page on energy so I have some fun ones that I'd really I ike to put together for kids stuff.
"And, um, there's a lot of, you know, do it, uh, to be able to watch a video and have it actually."
"Get it all together. , out there."
Yeah that's a great idea.
Okay.
"And would you, um, would you find project type courses, maybe past the beginner stage, um, helpful, where you could practice your skills in a certain, um, in a certain environment or piece of software?"
I think...
"Um, I don't usually do the downloads."
"I, I only have a subscription just to watch the videos.'Cause I really never, have never had the time to be able to do one of those full class ones."
"Uh-huh. , The files to work with ."
"Um, I don't, I just don't have that kind of time to be able to use those true detailed trainings."
Sure.
"Um, I mean, if I did I probably would have signed up for that but I only did the one with the crash course videos."
Just the three videos.
That's my subscription on the space there.
"Um, yeah, even with the subscription that you have you still, uh, you can watch all of the different videos."
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Um.
"Yeah, we're just um."
We feel that.
"What we're looking at is expanding from a, uh, a more beginner and foundational level of knowledge."
And how do we start to take deeper dives now?
Is her name Eylul too?
"They are pulling my leg, by God."
Don't worry!
"You weren't here all these years, she didn't love me (all the same)..."
Anyways I don't need her because I love her.
You will take three exams.
"The first is ""General culture"" and you will definitely make it."
"You will have to study for the second one, if it's necessary I will help you, but you already have high grades."
"Are you in ""good level"" for mathematics?"
"Wow, his favorite!"
You will rock!
"Only language is left, you will study a bit for it too.. or if you really want it you will manage it too."
"But forget about it, I think you should study,"
language is always important anyways.

Asim Sekip Kaya University won't give you that scholarship so easily...
"Let me tell you, first Asim Sekip Kaya won't give it to you..."
He won't ever in this life show favor to you.He won't ever in this life show favor to you.
Furthermore he will deal with you.
Don't think it's so easyyyy!!!
You pass this two exams like a lion... after that even if you *** in their mouths during the interview again nothing will happen!
Mert!
Are you doing it intentionally?
"Mom, don't mess with me today!"
It's like that.
I won't lose someone again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Young Master!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Did you lose something?
What are you looking for?
I thought I lost you!
Young Master!
What's wrong with you?
I...
I don't want to lose you.
Have you eliminated all of Choi Chul Joo's men?
Yes.
"When the prince said that he was going to the harbor,"
I thought he was going to attack the people holding the ship to let it sail.
But this is what happened.
Now we have no way to obtain explosives.
The prince eliminated Choi Chul Joo so that we would not be implicated.
The police have finally reached the harbor.
Now we must give the Interior Minister a sufficient explanation for this.
"Choi Chul Joo used explosives to set sail, but the ship's owner Yongmun eliminated him."
"In the ensuing fight, all of his men were killed."
All of the men involved directly are now dead.
It is now impossible to identify the origin of the explosives.
Why did Yongmun kill the men with the explosives?
We were investigating explosives traders as you instructed us.
"As a result, we found Choi Chul Joo."
He had borrowed a ship from us to go to China.
Everyone is dead!
We cannot find out the source of the explosives!
We had no choice.
They had used explosives from our ship.
"If they had escaped to China, would you not have suspected us instead?"
"In addition, we did it to save lives."
We risked our lives to save the poor girls who were going to be sold in China.
She never eats.
Never drinks.
Never goes to the toilet.
"The female polar bear is number 6 because she sleeps for over three months,"
living off her fat reserves.
She not only survives the winter-- but creates two new lives.
The young bears learn their survival skills from mother.
"How to keep warm, what to eat, where to walk."
They must learn fast-- or freeze solid-- just like the animal sliding into number 5.
Only one frog in the world is found north of the Arctic Circle.
The wood frog.
It has to survive the northern winter.
The frog is cold blooded.
"So when the ground freezes, so does the frog."
Cold's not the problem.
It's the ice.
The crystals expand like daggers.
"For most animals, freezing means certain death."
But not this frog.
The first ice crystal forming on its skin sets off a chain reaction.
The cells prepare by filling with glucose-- a natural antifreeze.
The fluid between the cells contains proteins that attract ice-- quickly forming crystals small enough to prevent injury.
Blood freezes in veins.
And the ice races towards the heart.
"In 20 hours, the frog is frozen."
70% of the water in its body is ice.
There's no breathing.
No heartbeat.
The wood frog is number 5 because it survives the winter in suspended animation.
Essentially there's no frog here at all.
"It's just a collection of individual cells, suspended in ice, struggling to stay alive."
The frog spends months locked inside its frozen time capsule.
He was a wise professor of sociology from Michigan.
"A ""Mandela"" type."
There were only eight of us at the meeting.
Afterwards he asked what we were studying and when we'd be done.
I said I would finish med school in 1975.
"""We'll probably be independent then, come work for us."" We shook on it."
Then he was killed by a letter bomb the next year.
That made the promise more serious.
In 1975 Mozambique won its independence.
"We founded the Africa Groups' Recruitment Organization and then we went, Agneta as a midwife and me as a doctor."
This is the hospital staff outside the hospital.
"White coats are professionally trained, the others were assistants."
A fair amount of them were illiterate.
Papa Enrique is wearing my glasses.
He dressed wounds.
I saw that he treated infected wounds and burns the same way.
"""Can't you see the difference?"""
I asked.
Then I gave him my glasses.
"""Now I see!"" he said."
"""There's pus in this wound."
"I can't afford glasses."""
So I gave him my spare glasses.
It gave him a whole new life.
And he provided a whole new class of care.
"When I wrote instructions, he said:"
"""Unfortunately I cannot read."""
Eventually we created two symbols.
Infections were marked with a cross and he took those last.
The hardest part was understanding the depth of poverty.
We knew we couldn't give the same kind of care as in Sweden of 1970 but we didn't realize we had to go back to 1850.
Eventually we learned to treat fractures without plaster or anesthetic.
"Recreation, get out of Dodge for 30 days."
So were they here just during the summer?
Yeah.
Nobody was here in the winter at all.
They'd leave and everything.
"Did they interact much with the townspeople, or?"
"Oh, yeah."
They were very friendly with a lot of different people.
"They got to know - like I said, I can't remember any names now, but - they had their free time."
"They had their retreat stuff and their prayer type times and their whatever they would have, but they'd be meandering around the dock or next door."
In the evening I think they might have had a prayer time in the evening because then they'd have a habit or something like that and after their meal they'd walk to the Coast Guard station and back and then disappear.
Go back probably for prayers or something like that.
I don't know what the hell they did.
Any interesting stories about some of them - incidents or anything?
Not really.
That I can think of.
"Talk to Loretta Slaters, she would know."
Because they were right at the end of the row there.
"She would know who the ones were, I think."
She was a little more religious than me.
"And, I'm trying to think who else would have been around at that time."
Donald Cole would be familiar.
So your high school graduating group - what other things did you do with that group?
Those...
I'm not going to put it on tape.
Okay.
"No, the things -"
We set some school records.
We had them cancel -
We used to get a group... we'd go over there and...
They came here so of course we thought we'd just entertain them.
So we did.
"Yep, it's all here.."

"From here,"
Mr.Sameh
"The people were asking, do we stay or do we leave?"
Their presence now isn't really important I guess...
Pay them and let them leave
What?
Nobody is gonna leave
Assume he suddenly returns
He has to return to find everything the way it was
Yeah I agree
"If he returns, treat him just like you did at first"
Got it?
Okay
"Let's go, looks like we wont find anything here"
"It's no use, we've been looking for 2 weeks"
Now what?
We're doing what we can
All this is useless
The court meeting is tomorrow
And now what?
"It's a difficult situation, if the father isn't here, we'll lose the case"
We'll be jailed for at least 5 years
"No, we can't wait that long"
"Karim, Sameh, you have to decide on something"
Can't we get another guy to pretend he's dad?
"This situation has other arrangements, we have no time"
And we can't postpone tomorrow's court session?
That was the final postponal
Can't you lend us money till we find dad?
"If I had money, do you think I would've been helping you now?"
"Listen, when it comes to the bank we all took that loan"
Which means we'd all go to prison
"Don't say that, hopefully nothing bad will happen"
Peshawar and they've got rotor conveyors from the mess hall - little dinky ones.
"And they have big heavy duty ones and they're making these guys - the cooks, because they don't have a load crew there."
It was just a spook base.
They have the U-2s and the
RB57's and stuff like that there.
All spy stuff.
So we loaded it all up and I got it ready [?] comes out and hands me a can of beer and he already knew because we joked about this before.
"He put a can of beer under the front crew door and when I just barely touched the top, the plane was perfectly balanced."
Not [?] but you can fake it.
"Anyway, I did that and then I had him jump up and down the back."
"All these guys, to get it to rock a little - see how it stabilizes, you know."
But what I didn't realize was the wheels - they put the wheels on the ramp that slopes up in the back of the plane.
"So anyway, I chained it down."
You could really chain stuff.
He's back out there and I'm ...
They're tying it down and everything.
"So he says, ""Well, what do you think?"""
"I said, ""I'll sit in front of it."""
"He said, ""If you sit in front of it, I'll fly it."" I said okay."
So we take off and it was just a little bit tail heavy.
Not bad.
So we got down to Karachi and I just moved it forward about two inches.
That's all it took.
Swinging on into Germany.
Same damn thing again.
We pulled in there and we just backed a 40-foot flatbed up to the back end they dropped the ramp out and put a wench on it so we pulled the tires and they skidded this thing off.
There's another one of these E8s from Washington.
Wants to know where my manifest is.
I didn't have one.
How do you know this is it?
He's looking at this big trailer.
He knows it's not a ...
So in the end I didn't get written up again.
Another letter from whoever it was that charges these spy planes crew get another letter from them thanking us for the job done.
And then I get promoted.
The average staff sergeant made it in somewhere between 7 and 9 years and I made it a little over 3.
"And every time I got in trouble, I got promoted."
"Because, we did stuff."
It was a special request mission and you broke the regulations but helped out...
"Yeah, well, we had to do it."
Because it was our job.
Our line pilots.
We didn't have any trouble with our
line pilots.
"These guys are up to 30, 32 years old."
"You get in to maybe a colonel or something, he's"
looking at the back a little bit.
The other guy - you wanted to load up didn't care what you were loading.
"Now load it, they'd fly it."
That was it.
"Now, did you ever speculate on what was in that trailer?"
No.
"Just electronic gear, I'm sure."
Because they were still flying the U-2s.
He'd been shot down already but they were still flying
U-2s and the RB-57s.
There was a B-57 they converted to - Now you see these big 747 jet engines.
At the time - a 707 engine was yay big.
They had those engines that were bigger than that window on the U-2 and on these RB-57s - reconnaissance.
That they had converted to fly reconnaissance missions.
And an RB-57 will do almost as high as a U-2.
They'd take off from there and they'd have to fly
South from Pakistan.
"To get up to 70,000 feet or so, and then turn over to Russia, and land over in Sweden, you know, taking pictures on the way."
Can there be enlightenment  without light?
What does the third eye see?
"Love and respect,'"
"I don't know if it says 'Tim,'"
I am not sure if it's what...
Okay.
"'Buddha,"
Kovan...'?
Am I saying something  like we know?
"'...Shiva, Jesus in [Matthew 6:21] all speaks of the light, as does Ramana Maharshi.'"
He describes it as self-effulgent.
'Can these be...
Can there be enlightenment without light?'
"If enlightenment... we're using this term,  'enlightenment'; enlightenment means to bring light  to the mind, maybe, not to the Self."
"Because even the term 'guru,' it means the remover of darkness, which, here, means ignorance, not the giver of light, even."
But let's speak  about this light.
Does the Self  need to be enlightened?
It cannot be.
"It gives light to consciousness and the mind, but It, itself,  is the source of light."
But light  is also a phenomenon;
light is also perceived.
"Space is also perceived, because it is said that amongst all the elements known to us, that space is the most subtle."
"And we are the perceivers  of space, so something subtler  also than space is here."
To the extent that we can say even the perceiving of space  is perceived.
You cannot use your mind here.
"Mind will only create images and images are gross forms, are emanating out of that."
"The image is itself seen, the image  cannot witness itself."
A cloud doesn't know  it is passing.
A flower doesn't know  it is beautiful.
To whom do they appear?
This one.
And this one sees them with the light of consciousness.
What is the planting date? planting density? planting methods? the pollination systems?
What roles to bees play in pollinating this particular crop?
"We'll look at what is the impact of pennycress on soybeans, which is a crop that would follow pennycress."
And we'll have a chance to take a look at all of that tomorrow.
We'll offer coffee and doughnuts.
Beth Seaton:
Great!
Win Phippen:
And it starts at 10 a.m. and finishes at noon.
Rain or shine.
Beth Seaton:
"Are your students going to be out here, helping you tomorrow?"
Win Phippen:
The sure will.
"The students, they play a big role in trying to do these research plots."
"They learn how to develop a plant-breeding program, and develop a crop from essentially a weed."
Beth Seaton:
Who is invited to Field Day tomorrow?
Win Phippen:
The intent is really to introduce pennycress to the general public.
"Now, we've invited fellow researchers over from Peoria, who have been working on the crop. and industry folks, who have a vested interest in pennycress in the bio-fuels area."
"They'll be over to talk about what they're up to, in terms of building a bio-diesel plant."
"And local growers, who have had to chance, sort of, play with it, nd they'll give us some feedback on how well it went and some of the challenges they are facing in growing the crop."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, well, we'll be back tomorrow to look at your Field Day."
I hope the weather holds out for us.
Win Phippen:
It sure will.
Thank you.
Win Phippen:
"So we've got some growers and sales folks, and the local support, chemistry support from the USDA."
I'd like to being the day first by introducing Terry Isbell.
"We'll give the whole class time to work with one deck of cards,"
"All 30 of you together, and see how fast you can sort it."
This will be interesting.
We'll [INDAUDlBLE] lab.
"Eh, and we'll see all these problems."
"So there are some common problems with eh, parallel programming, and I will cover three of them today."
The first one is called Race Condition.
The idea is that if two people are trying to use the same resources at the same time.
So let's look at this code.
"Let's say the balance is 100 and, the balance is 100."
The amount is 100 and two people want to withdraw 75 dollars each.
They could get a conflict in this code.
So let's actually try it.
We will set the balance to 500 and broadcast withdraw.
Each sprite with will recive withdraw and withdraw 300.
"And this is the code, the same code."
That if the balance is greater than the amount then set the balance to balance minus amount.
"And eh, so the buffalo withdraws 300 and the star withdraws 400."
So let's see what could happen.
"Eh, oops."
Edit.
Make this bigger.
Zoom in.
"Big, too big."
Maybe.
Still big.
"Okay, so what could happen, maybe the buffalo checks the balance, 500, is greater than his amount, 300, and it is."
And then he sets the balance to 500 minus 300 which is 200 and reports true.
"And then the star comes along and checks if 200 is greater than 400 and it's no, so he reports false."
And no problems right?
"But what could happen is that the star checks if the balance is greater than 400, and it is, and before it gets over here, before it gets to this set, the buffalo comes along and checks if 500 is greater than 300 and he says well, I, there's still enough money in there."
And then they both come in and set the balance to whatever they think it is.
"So while I'm fighting in the war,"
"To Devil, Wife, don't open the door."
Comrade Army Commander!
"An urgent message, Comrade Army Commander!"
Zbruyevka's been freed by some avengers.
Some avengers?
Who are they?
- Nobody knows for sure.
- And if not for sure?
Have you contacted them?
That's impossible.
- Why not?
- They are not there.
- Who is not there?
- The avengers.
"- And Zbruyevka, is it there?"
"And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour, boil them up, use the oil."
"They also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks."
This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- the finning of sharks.
"We're often frightened of sharks, thanks to ""Jaws."""
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
"There was someone recently, wasn't there?"
Just a couple weeks ago.
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.
"So I don't know what the balance is, but I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them."
It was a well-documented fishery.
"As you can see here, it peaked in the '50s, where they were killing 1,500 sharks a year."
"And it declined very fast -- a classic boom-and-bust fishery, which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates."
"They killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,"
literally just by stringing a Manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
"Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s, especially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford."
"About two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85, mainly by Norwegian vessels."
And we said well the acceleration of the pulley is just half the acceleration of the block.
The pulley's velocity and its acceleration is half whatever the block's is.
And so we substituted that in for the acceleration of the pulley.
"And now we can substitute tension, which we solved here, for the-- my mind's getting flustered-- for the tension in this equation."
So what do we get?
We get 150-- let me move back to a nice color-- minus 2 times this expression.
This is the tension in the rope.
"10 times a, b, acceleration of the block, plus 39.2 is equal to 5 times 1/2."
Well what's 5 times 1/2?
It's 2.5 acceleration of the block.
So we have 150 minus 20 times the acceleration of the block minus-- what is this-- 78.4 is equal to 2.5 times the acceleration of the block.
Well let's add 20 times the acceleration of the block to both sides.
"Well, we'll just simplify this."
150 minus 78.4 is equal to 71.6.
So 150 minus 78.4 is 71.6.
So that's just this minus this.
"And I'm going to add 20 a b to both sides, so I'm essentially moving this 20 a b over on that side."
I'm skipping a couple of steps just to save space.
So if I add 20 times the acceleration of the block.
"That's not a, b."
It's a sub b.
You get 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
"And this is a 6, not a block."
71.6 is equal to 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
We're almost done.
So we divide both sides by 22.5 and what do we get?
Let's see.
"Divided by 22.5, and we get the acceleration of the block."
So that's this block right here.
The acceleration of the block is 3.18 meters per second squared.
That's how fast this thing accelerates to the right.
And we already figured out that the pulley accelerates at half that rate.
But this is the only rivet that we found between this lentoid and the previous lentoid that was cleaned.
And you can see that the rivet is resting on top of a small silver divider and that's something that is a feature that is also present on the previous lentoid.
And I am right in thinking - you were telling me at the other side you can actually see the holes where these pins may have been?
You can.
So if I pan over the central gold foil...
You can see that there are two large rivet holes present on this side as well.
And one small rivet hole sort of tucked in the corner
looks like maybe they made a mistake!
So what are we looking at here Ellen?
You can see here the clean garnets and some of them are quite lovely and you can still see the inter play of light with the backing foils showing through.
And I'm presently working on writing up a little blog for the website about this treatment so that you can see the before and after of images.
hey guys how are y'all doing
"I was hanging out with a friend yesterday and he said something that ""REALLY"" hurt me!"
(Yesterday)
"Me:Hey man, you should go talk to her."
My friend:
No!
Me:
"You, go."
My friend:
No
Me:
"Just go, don't be scared My friend:"
Noooooo
Me:
Why not?
(A:Don't know what's going on) (B:Yeah)
My friend:
Cuz she is white
What?
Are you racist or something?
She is WHlTE.
"The light that emanates from consciousness, this is revealing the forms of the creation,  you see."
So that is also seen.
"So, the question:"
"Sri Ramana, he describes it as  self-effulgent."
Not relying  upon something else.
Not relying  upon something else.
"The moon, they say, has no light of its own."
I am told this;
I never could prove it.
"They say the moon  doesn't have a light of its own, that it is reflecting only  the light from the sun."
"This is what I'm told,  like that."
Okay?
The sun is not depending  on something else.
The moon is depending  on something; the moon is depending  on the sun's light in order to reflect  even this coolness that we enjoy.
"So, mind is like this moon and mind's light  is like this moonlight."
"It also can only reflect, also,"
"Hm? the energy that's coming  from the sun-self, it's like that."
And the light of the sun and the sun are one.
Harmony.
"Like the fragrance  of a flower and the flower, they are one, not two separate things."
They are like one.
"But the smell can come,  the flower can come."
"And this one is saying,"
'... that which is  self-effulgent.'
I don't think 'self effulgent' -
I'm not sure  about this term 'effulgent' - somebody can help me?
Effulgent means self-radiating?
Self-radiating.
"Then, if he speaks  about a light which is self-radiating, then it can only be  a metaphor for the Self, not the phenomenon  of light only."
"It must be  some metaphor for Self, because Self is beyond  light and darkness."
"In It,  light and darkness manifest, time and space manifest through  the mind and consciousness."
All of these can appear.
There is also a beautiful rainbow in between.
Everything is just as he said.
But where is he?
He is not to be seen.
"Hey rain, are you pouring down only here.. ..or even at the place where he is?"
If you do so then he will think there is no rain.. .. and will not come.
Why dont you please rain at his place too?
"My dear, my cute rain!"
Please rain at his place also.
Do you believe at least now that rain unites both of us?
I already believe that.
It seems you did not believe completely.
Because you came so close but stayed that far.
Let the distance between the hearts melt slowly
Let me slowly open the door of naughty thoughts
The sky is sending down rain threads of love
And making a garland with rain drops as flowers
At this pleasant moment when it drenched us .. .. and joined us by the rainbow of love
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me proclaim that you are mine
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me establish this bond forever.
In your twists and turns I can see the beauty of lightning
I am seeing your spectacular dance in this first rain
I can hear your voice in this thunder
And do I hear your signals through.. ..the sounds of these rain drops
I am following the track of your heart
Shall I follow your foot steps as your wife
In this wetness when your shyness went away
Can any curtain stop your eagerness
I am gifting my beauty to your eyes
Let these rain drops show me your treasures
And let me remain indebted to the god of rain
I cannot stop the anxious youth anymore
We got a couple of drops out.
So this is ready to go now.
And I can hook this up.
"Now, I'm going to put my drip chamber in here and this stretchy tubing goes below."
My tubing fits in here.
"Then this stretchy tubing, I'm going to use this little blue handle to help me loop this around, and it fits right in that little port."
Okay?
And I need to attach it to my patient.
"And again, before I have done this, before I do this, I would have checked for residual, checked for placement, I opened up my stopcock so it'll flow between the patient, into the patient from the bag."
Now I'm going to set my pump for what I need to run it at.
"So we first turn it on, and it says, ""Set dose."""
And that's the total volume you're going to give.
"So if we want to give 200 cc's, hold that down until we get to 200."
Hold that down.
There we go.
I went over a little bit.
Sorry.
Went over.
Okay.
So my dose is 200.
I need to set my rate.
"And that might be 30 cc's an hour, whatever your order says is what you would set it for."
Okay.
"So, I've set my rate, I've set my dose, and I hit run."
"Again, you want to make sure your patient is not flat, while they're receiving feedings, so they don't aspirate."
"Even though you're receiving, giving tube feedings on a pump, you still need to periodically check for residual and to give some free water per the order to give the patient some extra water."
"BYU-Idaho has additional facilities at off-campus locations such as the Outdoor Learning Center at Badger Creek with ropes courses and cross-country skiing and the Sky Mountain and Quickwater Lodges in the Teton Valley near Victor, Idaho."
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
If you said goodbye to me tonight
"No soy, no rice."
It's made actually out of tapioca and arrowroot flour.
"I know that's not making your mouth water, but man, it is good."
Here is another example of where you can get your protein from.
This is a vegan sausage.
"It's about that big, the size of this remote."
There is 4 in a package.
Each one of these has 29 grams of protein.
"Again, the healthiest food you can eat is whole foods."
I don't mean the supermarket.
"I mean the fruits, the vegetables, the rice, the beans, stuff that's fresh."
That is not processed.
And the last thing I want to show you is another video.
It is a happier video.
And this is the whole idea of change in perception.
"I know I am keeping you here, longer than you probably wanted."
But this is a really beautiful story.
And I hope you enjoy it.
"On the night of September 18, 2007 a cow was spotted on the streets of Queens."
"She was tagged for slaughter, but she escaped that fate and literally ran for her life."
Police and firefighters captured her and brought her to Animal Care &amp;amp; Control in Manhattan.
"From there, Farm Sanctuary's rescue team stepped in."
Maxine's dash for freedom.
"There she is, beautiful girl."
"She was tagged for slaughter, and it would have been her fate."
But she wanted to live and so she really ran for her life. and now she'll live out her life in the Sanctuary.
It is interesting how the public responds when one individual animal makes a run for her life.
They end up making headlines on national news.
People's hearts goes out to this one individual animal.
The cruelty that happens to farm animals is largely hidden behind factory farm walls.
And people aren't aware of that.
"When you look in her eyes, everyone wants the best for her."
You do not eat meat?
"Where do you get your protein from?"""
"Like all of a sudden, ""Holy shit, it's all of a sudden dawned on me,"
I have been without protein in the last 8 years.
"Let 's go to McDonalds and get a Big Mac!"""
"Like, I am about to fall down or something."
Or pass out.
Have you ever heard of somebody in the U.S. suffering from a lack of protein and going to the hospital?
It's unheard of.
"It's funny, even dealing with kids, I have a kid say,"
"""I tried to go vegan for a day, and I got really sick."""
What?
It's like people they know somebody who is vegan who is sick.
Really?
I know tons of meat eaters who are sick.
"Yes, you can be an unhealthy vegan."
"What I am telling you is it does not matter if you are eating meat milk, dairy and fish or you are eating a plant based diet, you should know what you putting into your body."
"You should know how many grams of protein you are getting the amount of iron, calcium that you are getting."
"By the way, people say omega-3 from fish."
"You can get that from the seeds, the nuts."
You can get that from other things.
Flax seed is a very good example.
Think about this: these are the largest and strongest land animals on Earth.
What does their diet consists of?
Plants!
"You're in good company, if you're only eating plants."
"And what is so ironic about this is that the largest and strongest land animals not only do they just eat a plant based diet, they also live the longest."
This animal can live to 70 years.
"They can live to about 50 to 60 years, the gorilla about 50 years in the wild."
And their diet consists of nothing but plants.
Are you going to tell any of them they are missing out on protein?
This animal has 10 times the upper body strength of the average male adult.
"Now, for the most important question:"
"Is Father Richard Moore guilty... ...beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide?"
"Did he, in fact, neglect Emily's needs in such a way... ...that her death is now on his hands?"
No!
That is not a fact.
It is not a fact that Emily was epileptic.
It is not a fact that she was psychotic.
Facts... ...leave no room for possibilities.
The only fact... ...the only thing I know beyond a doubt in this case... ...is that Father Moore loved Emily with his whole heart.
He did everything in his power to help her.
He has risked his very freedom so we could hear her story.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...in my job I sometimes have to defend bad men.
Father Richard Moore is not one of them.
Don't send a good man to prison.
I'm not asking that you believe everything that Father Moore believes.
I'm simply asking that you believe in Father Moore.
"Madam Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?"
"We have, Your Honor."
Please read the verdict out loud.
"""In the case of *The People* *v. Father Richard Moore*... ...we, the jury, find the defendant... ...guilty of negligent homicide."""
The court thanks the jury for its service.
Sentencing for this case will be set for April 3rd.
"Your Honor, if it pleases the court... ...Father Moore requested at the start of trial... ...that if found guilty, he would be sentenced immediately."
"Yes, I recall that."
Does the prosecution have any objection to expedited sentencing?
Very well.
"Father Richard Moore, do you understand this sentence... ...which has been found against you?"
"- Yes, Your Honor."
And do you understand the gravity of this crime?
"That you may, under the law, be sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?"
"Yes, I do."
Are there any statements you wish to make... ...before I impose this sentence?
(Laughter)
Anyway --
"When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Connecting route through the Andes.
Farewell Argentina.
San Fancisco Pass.
Did you enjoy the ride Harry?
- Yes.
"Through the Andes, did you like it?"
"- Yes, I really did."
Did anything exciting happen during the trip.
"- Yes, Steven did some stunts."
"Dust, dust and more dust."
What is your personal experience this Dakar?
- An enormous experience
"This is Steven, our reckless pilot."
He hits the gas peddle at the right moments.
Steven wants a hummer for the next Dakar.
We flew with the Dodge for a little while.
Alle the cargo is still on the truck.
"Only one fog light is broken, that's all."
and we arrived safely in the bivouac again
"Hello and welcome to Freshly Served, the healthy vegan cooking show."
Iím Heather and tonight we are going to make some maple Dijon glazed carrots and parsnips.
This is something that I love to make as part of appetizers night.
Phil and I sometimes
like we were having a celebration to just do a whole dinner of appetizers but it is also be a nice side for other dish or whatever you like.
"So for those of you who have not seen parsnips before they look like a white carrot, they usually have a very fat end as suppose to carrots which are usually fairly uniform just getting skinnier at the tip."
So you wanna have the same amount of parsnips as carrots.
"It doesnít really matter how much youíre doing but anyway with carrots I donít peel them, I just trim off either end and give them a good scrub with a potato scrubber brush."
Three hundred and sixty three...
Yes.
[Laughter].
Ok.
"These belong to some equivalence class, and we'll give that a name."
We'll call that equivalence class one third.
Are you with me?
Ok?
"Now, once you have that, then of course you can talk about fractions, right?"
"And then everybody knows how to work with fractions, which are really disguised ways of dealing with the equivalence relation that is embedded here."
What's the equivalence relation?
Everybody learns in grade school.
When are two fractions equivalent?
"I'll have you think about that, but the set of all such classes will be called Q, which is basically the set of all such equivalence classes... of pairs... of these ordered pairs."
Right?
What ordered pairs?
The ordered pairs in Z cross Z. Ok?
"We might have to be a little careful here, maybe Z cross Z minus 0... the set containing 0... period."
Ok?
Ok.
Everybody with me?
What have we just one?
I've just defined what I mean by Q. Right?
"It's an ordered pair, and... it's equivalence classes of ordered pairs."
"Now, what we haven't said is what the equivalence relation is, so..."
What is the equivalence relation?
"By the way, before we even talk about what the equivalence relation is, what's another thing you might want to be true about Q?"
"Aside from the fact that, you know,"
"I've just said that there's a set here, but somehow... how's it related to the set that I began with?"
"I might want to delineate that, I might want to tell you how is it that Q is related to Z."
"And usually, the way you think about Q, is that it somehow extends Z, right?"
"You have a bunch of points, these are whole numbers on the number line that you grew up thinking about, and now we fill them in with a bunch of points in between, right?"
"Once they get to know her, and when people are able to identify with an individual and look her in the eye and see that she is living, feeling being who has a will to live, then people care."
I have been working here with Animal Care and Control for almost nine years.
This morning was really astonishing to me.
"All of a sudden it dawned on me, this sweet, innocent cow running away from being slaughtered."
"And I never been thought about it before, that something is actually being slaughtered, and it is my ground beef, and it is my steak, and stuff like that."
"And we have been eating this for years,"
I never pictured that face on that.
And it hurt.
I can't do that anymore.
I can't.
"So, now, we are all work on not eating meat."
Me and my entire family.
Because I am realizing that this is a life we saved today.
And with my family we will be saving a couple of more.
Thank you.
She is about a year old absolutely beautiful Hereford.
And those unfortunately are cows that are used for meat.
"She was most likely at a live market and because they have a very strong will to live,"
"like any living creature, she got loose."
"She had a will to live, and she did it."
Hello!
"When she is going now, she is gonna have cows of her own breed even."
She is gonna be so happy.
"When the trailer arrives, the cows in the herd will moo."
Yeah.
They will moo in a big line.
Everybody lines up.
They will start mooing to her to comfort her and to tell her that they are there.
And she will moo back.
"Any animal, any creature has a strong will to live."
"She is an ambassador for all animals, who are still suffering in slaughterhouses and on farms, and who don't don't have such a lucky outcome."
People love a happy ending and it's happy.
"Odysseus sends back the message, not yet."
Let's wait until nighttime.
Very interesting exchange of messages there.
"They're, they're easy enough to take on the plain surface level and may well be that all that's happened is Penelope has said, yeah, sure I'd like to talk to this stranger."
I could find out about my husband.
"And this stranger says, well let's do it later on."
It's more convenient for me.
"But, there's something also, the, the, the forwardness of Penelope may, asking to make an audience with this stranger whose nothing but a beggar."
"And then the stranger coming back and saying, rather than just sort of dropping everything and saying, oh my gosh the lady of the house is willing to speak with me."
"But rather, saying, hold off, wait."
"Let's do it at nighttime, when we can do it in a different kind of setting."
"Both those things I think are, it's possible that there's a subterranean back message being sent in the message."
"So, kind of like, metadata built into the message that's being sent that says ""I want to pay some attention to you"" on both sides."
We'll see what that attention's going to be in the coming books.
"So, things start to unfold rapidly and quickly in seventeen through twenty."
"Lots of the good stuff starts to, unpack itself here."
Looks Like her .. act like her ..
Identifies with with her ..
And might go further than that ..
"Then this famous person, starts to become the center of their lives"
"Then, it controls their lives"

In lifestyle
And even in their thoughts ..
They were Affected by her

After the break ..
""" What ?"
"It has just started ? """
""" oh God hurry up -_- """
"When some is identified, with a famous character .."
"People go on hunts every day, and usually no one gets killed."
"But today, one man gets charged by an elephant."
And everybody can see that he got killed by an elephant.
Why did he happened to be in the path of the elephant?
Why did the elephant go in a different way?
Why did he hunt a slightly different way?
Why didn't the elephant here him and run away?
The man would not have been in the path of that elephant if not for witchcraft.
"To put it another way, the Zande have no concept of bad luck."
"When something bad happens, when misfortune comes along, it's due to witchcraft."
"Someone, a witch, made it happen."
Why did my crops fail when everyone else's thrived?
Why did the tornado zig in set aside so it hit my house and not my neighbor's house?
Why did the mosquito bite me and not use so I got malaria but you didn't?
To these-- the answer to these questions for the Zande is witchcraft.
In Zande Land anyone could be a witch.
Children and the very old are usually not accused of witchcraft because it's rare for them to seriously offend people.
But almost any adult you meet could have witchcraft inside him or her.
So you better be nice to everyone.
Witchcraft is never random.
It's personal.
The person who causes you harm knows you and probably lives near you.
He or she is someone you've offended.
"So when something bad happens you ask yourself, who have I offended?"
Have I insulted someone?
Have I cheated someone?
Have I slept with someone's spouse?
Did I break a promise?
Those are all the kinds of things that could make someone's witchcraft heat up.
"The Zande know-- okay, now the part for the medical students in particular about how-- what witchcraft has to do with the treatment of illness."
The Zande know that people get sick.
And they usually get better.

Thank you.
"Thank you all, and thank you very much for having me back to this, such a gorgeous city and congratulations to this show for 50 plus years of great achievements."
"In the years that this show has been going on, there's been a lot of discussion about new ages, new eras, new ideas and I am absolutely convinced that we're about to see a new age, an age of augmented humanity."
"A time when computers will work for us, and they'll make it possible for us to do the things that we really want to do, which are mostly around people and happiness and making the world a better place."
"And when I think about the compute--the consumer electronics industry in particular, what you all have built over the years, we have an opportunity now to entertain, to inform, to educate with technology that we've never been able to do before."
And that's what I want to talk about in this show.
"Today, when you look at a consumer electronics product, think about it as a music player."
"If it's not connected to the internet, it just has what's stored on it."
It can't get the music that's nearby.
It can't get the latest music.
It has to be on the net.
The same is true of everything.
That change is very subtle.
So weird.
"So just remember boys and girls,"
Photoshop is lying.
That's why I love video.
'Cuz you can see the ugly.

Where were you 3 to 5 years ago and how has your life changed?
"Your friends, your family, job, school."
What's different?

"But guys, that's really all that mattered to me this Thursday."
"My name's Philip DeFranco, and you've just been Philled in."
AUlGHAUGHUAHF!
Hello and welcome of this demonstration of Simon's new dictation mode
This is by no means a finished product ... but really just a tech demo of what is currently possible ... ... with open-source speech recognition technology
"You can see it's basically the whole, same old Simon interface ... ... just this little box on the lower left will tip you off that something is different ... ... because it says active model is ""dictation demo"""
"So, let's see how it works"
Start dictation
This is a demo of Simon
New paragraph
"In this video, I want to demonstrate the current state of open-source dictation."
"As you can see, it is nowhere near perfect."
New paragraph
"Regardless, with a little bit more work, I'm sure we could turn this into something really useful."
"If you want to get involved, please do get in touch with me."
"Select ""him off"" involved"
Go to the end of the document
"Ocean."""
And he points out there.
(Laughter)
"But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48."
It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.
"But he looked at me, and he said, ""Son"" -- he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that -- he says, ""Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat."
My responsibility is not to get you home alive.
"My responsibility is to get you home rich."""
(Laughter)
"You want to get home alive, that's on you."
"And for the rest of that day, safety first."
I was like --
"So, the idea that we create this false -- this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own, and vice versa."
"Anyhow, a whole lot of things."
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
"But, what it all comes down to is this."
"I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds."
"It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us."
It's a civil war.
"It's a cold war, really."
"We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it."
"And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood."
The way we portray working people on TV -- it's laughable.
"If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack."
Admit it.
You see him all the time.
"That's what plumbers look like, right?"
"We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines."
That's what TV does.
"We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat."
"But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue."
"I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message, what's really being said?"
"And finally, the L here stands for Last, which means we multiply the last terms in the two binomials, so b * d."
"And the answer to this multiplication is the sum of all of these, F + O + I + L. So, let's apply this method here to see that we get the same answer that we just found."
Okay.
"So, we still have this product, (x+5y) (3x-y)."
"So, what is F here?"
This is the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 3x, which is 6x^2."
And what about O?
I is a product of the outer terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * -y, which is -2xy."
And I is the product of the inner terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y and 3x, which is equal to 15yx."
And L is the product of the last terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y *, - y, which is -5y^2."
"And therefore, this product is the sum of all of these."
"So, it's 6x^2 - 2xy + 15yx - 5y^2."
"And again, -2xy and 15yx are like terms so we can combine them, which gives us the same answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"So, FOlL is a quick way to distributive multiplication of two binomials."
Let's see another example.
Let's multiply these two binomials here.
"Well, we can apply the FOlL method we just saw."
This is equal to the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 2x, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 2x * one."
"And then, plus the product of the inner terms of the two binomials, so -one * 2x."
"And then, plus the product of the last terms in the two binomials, so -one - one which gives us, 4x^2 + 2x - 2x - one."
"And notice the outer and the inner terms will cancel, which leaves us with our answer of 4x^2 - one."
"Now, it should be pointed out that these binomials are special and that we're multiplying together the difference and sum of the same two terms."
"We have 2x and 2x, and one and one."
And there's a special formula in this type of case.
"And the formula is that (A-b) (A+b) = A^2 - B^2, because the outer and inner terms will always cancel, which is what we just saw."
"That is, in our case, our A is 2x and our B is one."
"So our answer here is A^2 - B^2 or (2x)^2 - (one)^2, which is this 4x^2 - one."
"Hi i'm Samantha Atwell i'm a junior Social Science Education major from Olathe, Kansas."
The reason why
"I chose ESU is because being an education major, ESU is one of the top four schools in the country for education."
"Being empowered by E means a lot to me, I've been involved in alot of different organizations, meeting alot of friends have helped me to be empowered by E. Some of the things that i absolutely love to do are to scrap book and to take pictures, so at events on campus you'll see me with my camera at all times."
One thing I would advise new students when they come here is to get involved on campus we have a lot of organizations here and by getting involved you get to meet new people really quickly and when you graduate you'll have friends from those organizations.
.
Now here's the question.
Does it really matter.
Why am I making a big fuss about this?
"Whether use it two norm or a one norm, right?"
Because you know what's wrong with using the two norm.
"There is no problem, right?"
"There isn't, but at least from the surface, there would be any problem with using a one norm too."
"Okay,"
let me show you the difference.
"Today in class, you're gonna see it."
Okay.
So what
"I'm gonna do is take this data that I showed up here and we're gonna try to do an L two fit and an L one fit, and you're gonna see what happens."
"Alright, so there is our data we're gonna work with and we would like to put a nice line through that."
Okay.
"So, how do we do this."
"Well, what we gonna do is use what's called."
The
F means Search Command.
"Cuz, we find to do is minimize this a quantity."
Right.
"So, sorry."
We're trying to minimize this.
Right?
This is the idea.

The NHS...
"There was a survey in the NHS about dentistry, where they found that some people were removing their own teeth!"
You know...
"And they brought on some senior dentists onto Sky News, and gave out to him, and said"
"""This is terrible, People are removing their own teeth!"" And this guy stood there and went"
"""Well, obviously systems should be put in place to deal with it."""
Which is stupid!
"He should be going ""Well, these people are clearly morons of the highest line"""
[Laughter]
"""Who removes their own teeth, for Christ's sake?"
"I'm a dentist, I don't remove my own teeth, y'know what I mean?"""
But there's kind of a notion that everyones opinion is equally valid.
My arse!
Bloke who's a professor of dentistry for 40 years does not have a debate with some idiot who removes his teeth with string and a door.
Alright?
It's nonsense.
And it happens all the time with medical stuff on the television.
"They'll have a doctor on and they'll talk to the doctor, and they're all ""doctor this, and doctor that"" and"
"""what happened there"" and ""doctor, isn't it awful?"" Right?"
"And then the doctor will be talking about something, with all the benefits of research and medical evidence."
"And they'll turn away from the doctor, in the name of ""ballance"", and turn to some quak, witch doctor, homeopath horse shit peddler on the other side of the studio."

I love this game so much!
God damn it.
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, no."
(Finebros) You are going to play this game.
What?
"It's much richer and much more demanding, particularly when you get to fourth grade."
That's when it starts.
I'm not surprised in Sarah Lee's case that things began to unravel at third and fourth grade.
"If Sarah Lee is a bright child, she was probably able to fake her way through first and second grade."
You can fake your way through if you listen to your friends talk about the story they've read and then you use those answers when the teacher asks you the questions.
But around third or fourth grade is when you begin to deal with expressive language problems.
"In other words, the"
language is there.
I don't know it.
But it's almost locked away.
The language is inside the brain.
They have an inner language.
They know what they want to say.
And they just can't express it.
They can't get the words out.
We're going to make a paragraph that matches the picture.
"Like, sometimes when I'm in a class and my teacher, she asks us, like, what's the answer?"
And I'll raise my hand and I'll know the answer.
"But then when I say it, it won't come out the way I was thinking of it."
What about the way Homer used the gun in that episode?
What do you think that they were trying to say?
Sarah Lee.
He used it in-- he used instead-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
"When you think about it, you're thinking in your head, I didn't want to say that."
Did he use it for what it was really intended for?
"Sometimes it's a little embarrassing because people, they'll laugh and mumble under their breath, that's the wrong answer."
That's embarrassing.
Sara Lee masters the language of TV shows and commercials and the playground.
But she locks up when confronted by the more fully dimensional language encountered in books and in the classroom.
Experts say she has expressive
language deficiency.
She understands well but she has trouble explaining what she knows.

I realized this might be a totally new disease.
I was so scared.
I was scared to death.
Your first thought is that you might get infected yourself.
"You examine sick people, thinking only of yourself."
I had to take a deep breath and tell myself that this was my job.
I examined 30 people and it was an epidemic.
When I got home I sent Agneta and the kids away.
They went to friends' houses and those of us who had met the patients stayed in our house.
After two weeks we were sure that the disease was only in the country.
It was a combination of malnutrition and toxicity - nothing contagious.
Those were two scary weeks.
"Konzo was caused by cassava roots, the only food that survived drought."
"The root contains toxic cyanide, which takes time to remove."
But people were too hungry.
They ate it immediately and were paralyzed.

Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
NT:
"To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility."
MT:
"And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination, he would build them in his workshop."
NT:
"I needed no models, drawings or experiments."
"I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it."
Only then do I construct it.
MT:
His great idea was alternating current.
But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?
"To sell his idea, he became a showman."
NT:
"We are at the dawn of a new age, the age of electricity."
"I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether."
It is the magic of science.

"Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics."
He even photographed the bones of the human body.

But Tesla's success didn't last.

I have the dream that one  day everyone will be able... ...to walk around safely without  worrying about being bullied.
When we think about bullying... ...we typically think about one child bullying another on the playground.
But bullying is far more pervasive.
"People get bullied in  school, their workplace... ...on Facebook and  sometimes even at home."
"People get bullied because  of the clothes they wear... car they drive, music they  listen to or their profession."
The question that comes to my  mind when I think of bullying is... ...What does it achieve?
Does bullying bring inner-happiness?
Does it result in lasting power?
Does it really build self-confidence?
"On the contrary, it is simply a reflection of the bully's own lack of self-worth, ...dissatisfaction and fear."
There are many ways that we can address bullying.
Supporting others is a great preventative strategy.
"If EVERYONE were supported, it would help others be strong and proud of who... ...they are so that THEY  can pursue their dreams."
I dream of a world where EVERYONE can get the support they need to thrive.
Where they are NOT put down by others.
Where they can proud be of who they are and proud of who they want to be.

Thank you.
"Becuase of bullying, many great ideas have been lost."
"People have become depressed, inflicted pain on themselves... ...committed suicide, or turned  their hurt and anger on others."
They have been permanently scarred and... ...hurt because of the  words and actions of others.
"They question their existence, their self-worth."
All because of bullying.
I have a dream that one day all of this will be gone.
No more ideas lost.
No more hurt feelings.
No more suicides.
"No more ""let bullying be gone forever."""

We can do it if we start taking  the issue of bullying a priority.
"Now, let me first give you a"
little bit of a metaphor and then come back to how this really works in space-time.
Supposing you're just looking at an xy-coordinate system and you have two points in a two-dimensional space.
"So, here's a point and here's a point."
"Now, if you arrange for some kind of coordinate system--here's a coordinate system."
"This is x, this is y--and you ask how far apart these points are."
"Well, you can do that--let's see."
"They're separated in x by this amount here, which we'll call delta [Δ] x."
"And they're separated in y by this amount here, and that's Δ y."
"But of course, those quantities depend on the orientation of your coordinate system."
"If I now take this coordinate system and I shift it like this, now it's going to be totally different."
"Now I'm going to have x look like this and I'm going to have y, Δ y look like that."
So Δ y has gotten a whole lot smaller.
Δ x has gotten a whole lot bigger.
And all I did was twist the coordinate system.
Yeah?
Student:
[Inaudible.]
Professor Charles Bailyn:
"You still get the same distance, thank you very much, that's exactly right."
The distance is the invariant.
"The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate, those vary with the coordinate system, but the distance is the same."
That's exactly the point.
"And so, the quantity--let me summarize this."
"For points on a 2-D space, Δ x varies."
Δ y varies.
"But there is a quantity that is invariant and that is--well, let's call it (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)), which is the distance squared, (Δ D^(2))."
And this is invariant.
"It doesn't matter which way you twist things around, that will--that quantity will remain the same."
"So, now, imagine that you've got events in space-time."
So an event in space-time has three spatial coordinates and one time coordinate.
"So, it's basically a point in a four-dimensional space."

"Some people will say, ""Yes,"" but other people will say."
"""No."" A few months ago, my grandmother and I took a low-floor bus to go to the library."
Riding a low-floor bus was the first time for me.
My grandmother usually takes a low-floor bus because she has problems with her knees.
It is difficult for her to get on a bus with steps.
"When I was on the low-floor bus, some old people came onto the bus."
"There were no steps on the bus, so they could get on the bus easily."
I thought that the low-floor bus was designed very well for old people.
"Two weeks later, in class, we had a chance to think about life in our city."
"Our teacher said to us, ""In our city, there are many good projects."
These projects make our life better.
"Now I want you to talk about some of the projects."" Then we started talking about them in groups."
"In my group, we talked about the low-floor bus."
"I said, ""The low-floor bus is designed well for old people."""
Everyone in my group looked interested in the low-floor bus.
"One student said, ""I didn't notice that the low-floor bus was so useful for old people."
There are many old people in our city.
"We should have more low-floor buses for them."" Then another student said, ""I don't think the low-floor bus was designed only for old people."
We should get more information about the low-floor bus.
"Lets go to City Hall after school. """

We're imaging that we're going be able to create a function T that is going to give us the answer to that.
Let's just leave it at that for now.
"Finally, in the case where a is odd, it's going to execute the condition of this if statement, the condition of this if statement, both of which will fail."
"Then it will recursively compute the product, and then basically execute the returns."
A total of 3 statements plus however long it takes to do the recursive call-- so 3 statements plus this particular kind of recursive call.
This now is a mathematical specification of a function.
"We don't know at the moment what the relationship is between a and T(a), but at least it's fully specified."
"It turns out that you actually can solve this pretty easily by using what we already worked out about the number of times you can divide a number a in half, rounding down if it's odd, before you get down to 0."
See if you can put that together to try to answer the question what does T(a) equal from these set of choices.

We don't have to go and fulfill our commitments.
We can take a day off and just ride rollercoasters together.

That means you're gonna have to ditch class and call in sick for work.

"If you live over here, find a theme park near you and go there."
"If you live over here, your theme parks might not be open yet so you gotta do some other fun activity"
"like snowboarding or ice skating or something, I dunno."
"If you're in the rest of the world, I'm gonna be honest -"
I have no idea what your weather / theme park situation is but the point is that you have to abandon your commitments and have a day of fun wherever you are.

"A lot of private seed companies, breeding seed companies, especially for corn and soybeans, are trying to get students re-energized about the field of plant breeding."
"And so this grant allows for students to do internship projects, and that's on the entire summer, time to work with these private companies."
"And so, this year, we have four interns."
One is at Pioneer Hybrid
Another one is over at Iowa State University.
And another one is with the USDA in Peoria.
And I have another one here at Western.
"And another one that is at the University of illinois,"
learning about bio-energy crops.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Tell me about why plant breeding is important to the USDA and to the general population.
Because I don't really know too much about plant breeding.
Win Phippen:
"Well, a plant breeder is the person who takes undomesticated plants."
These are plants that haven't been considered for commercial production.
"Let's say a plant has a very strong, sort of, pharmaceutical properties to it."
And we want to a...
"Instead of trying to synthetically make in the labs, sometimes it is easier to have the plants produce these particular compunds."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And so the plant breeder is the one who would go out in the wild, collect up the wild plants of these particular species, and they'd start doing some crosses."
And they would try to make different combinations of these plants to create a plant that would be suitable for commerical production.

8 minutes on HlV
The HlV problem in Africa is not due to poverty.
"The poorer you are, the lower the risk of your having HlV."
The richer part of the continent has more HlV than the poorer.
We don't know why HlV is so common in eastern and southern Africa.
In Ghana less than 3% are infected and in Senegal less than 1%.
But sexual differences between cultures is a sensitive issue so no one does research into it.
They research other things instead.
- Is it a cultural issue?
- It's probably multiple partners.
In parts of southern and eastern Africa the majority of the adult population has 2-3 sex partners.
"It's not that it's a cultural norm or rule, but it is accepted."
There are cultural roots and it's accepted.
It's also related to the fact that sex is a bartering tool.
When you sell your maize you offer sexual favors to raise the price.
Let's see if I...
We've got a lot of information here.
This is very important...
"A yearbook photo, 7th grade class at the Domarringen school."
This is Agneta Thordeman.
We went to school together and have lived together for 40 years.
She started working in healthcare early on and that got me interested.
I decided to apply to medical school.
"In 1972, halfway through med school"
Hans and Agneta took a trip to India.
Visiting medical students in Bangalore
Hans Rosling became aware of his own prejudices about the world.
We need to start the education of children now about it.
To prevent the seeds of  bullying from ever being planted.
I realize that this is no easy task.
"But the more effort we make, the  greater our impact will be."
We can do it!
"The next time you see someone put down or picked on, don't remain silent."
Speak up.
Take action.
Help them.
"If we come together, we  can put an end to bullying."
That is my dream.
[applause]
Thank you all so very much.
Have a wonderful evening.
"I'm an ecologist, mostly a coral reef ecologist."
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years.
"I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet."
And that was what I did.
"And I ended up in Jamaica, in the West Indies, where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary, structurally, that I ever saw in my life."
"And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things:"
"First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white."
"The other thing it shows you is that, although there's this beautiful forest of coral, there are no fish in that picture."
"Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years."
We were the best and the brightest.
"People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs."
"And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be, was based on these reefs without any fish."
"Then, in 1980, there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen."
I put half the lab up in my house.
The wind blew very strong.
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high.
"And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed, and we thought, ""Well, we're real smart."

Oh wow!
It looks like she just posted a reply to my friend Ed.
I didn't know he was on Twitter!
I think i'll go ahead and follow him.
I'm going to check out who else she's following 'cause there might be some interesting people in there.
It doesn't appear that I know most of these people.

MUSlC
Welcome to the latest edition of Inside CBA.
So many great things have been happening here in the College of Business Administration that I though the best way to convey them is through video so you can literally see for yourself.
"In September, the Nebraska Board of Regents approved plans for our new 240,000 square foot building."
This 84 million dollar project will be privately funded.
"In 2016 when the building's completed, we'll have a facility that will allow us to attract students and faculty from around the world and help us with our growing enrollments."
This fall our freshmen enrollments exploded by a 25.4 percent increase over last year.
And our first time transfer students were up by almost 16 percent.
"Our goal as a college is to hit $5,000 students in accordance with the chancellors charge that UNL's total enrollment should reach 30,000 by 2017."
Size matters.
"For our undergraduate program, enhancing the size of the student body and the faculty provide greater opportunities to find their niche, to locate a mentor who can direct them to their passion, to explore a wider set of opportunities than they can imagine when they graduate from high school."
I've seen Nathan's self confidence grow in the last four or five months.
And so
I feel like even the mistakes that we've made have somehow turned toward building his character.
And he's learned a lot.
I'd say just don't worry about what other people think.
"And if you feel bad about yourself, just try to make yourself feel important and do something."
And be proud of it no matter what.
But Nathan's parents know better than to invest too much hope just yet.
They know that kids like Nathan often have good starts in new environments.
Later this spring they'll know more about whether they have finally found an answer for their boy.
Now back to Adam Dunning's story.
He's out of the psychiatric ward.
But now Adam's parents have come to this courthouse.
Their son is on trial for breaking and entering.
He's been given a court appointed lawyer.
"His parents are told that if he's found guilty, their boy will be in the custody of the state until he's an adult."
The prosecution makes its case.
I saw a glimpse of his face and I saw the outline of his face.
"And I said, oh, that's Adam."
Shouldn't he be in school and--
It doesn't take the jury long to render it's verdict.
We find the defendant guilty.
"As they say goodbye to their son, Jane Dunning comes to grips with a harsh new reality."
Adam's birthday is four days from today.
And I didn't expect to have to ask somebody else permission to bring a birthday cake.
"Four days later, it's Adam's 16th birthday, celebrated in jail."
"But as terrible as it is to visit him here, Adam's parents are in for a surprise."
When the sunset looks for the moon--
Their son is finally in an educational environment that seems to suit him.
"The classes are small and because so many of these kids have learning problems, the teachers here have found a way to get through to them."
Mercury has a rock cross made of the same kind of rock found on earth.
Beneath the crust it is thicker mantle layer of the same material.
And I would encourage you to read critically not just like a consumer.
Finally.
I hope this class motivates you to learn.
Learning is a very powerful thing in life.
"And I, I, I'll talk about it a little bit later more in depth."
"But when you learn more, learn Finance."
"And the reason is, if you know Finance, you pretty much know most of anything you want to know in life."
And I'm kind of serious about it.
"[laugh], You know that's, that's the funny part."
"So objectives, why you want to do, think about it."
And I hope you're convinced that this is something that you really need to learn.
What are the prerequisites?
"I've been receiving emails about, prerequisites."
"This is a question that we always get, here in life classes, and this is very tough for me."
"Because fundamentally, it could be everything in life, or nothing."
"Some prerequisites could be nothing, or everything."
Why am I saying that?
"It's because if you're go into the detail of development of Finance, the first thing that's the basis of Finance is Economics."
And Economics is actually called the mother discipline of Finance.
It has borrowed mostly from that discipline.
"So,"
I would encourage you to know that.
"Behavioral Science is also becoming important over time, but economics remains the basic paradigm."
Accounting.
"I must admit, Accounting, though I know some of it, is kind of boring."
"And, but it's a"
language.
"I mean, it's like, if you didn't understand me because I'm speaking"
"English, there would be a problem."
"Similarly, if you don't understand accounting, you cannot understand what's going on."
"And because it's imperfect, like every other language, you really have to know it."
"I promise you, I will give you hints of what to do when we do accounting, because we can't do all of it."
"I think this graph is the most important graph in all of health policy and I'm not lying or exaggerating, okay."
"There are at least two important lessons to be drawn from this graph, three important lessons."
So the three points of this is we're on another planet when it comes to health care spending.
"This is, the characteristic of a"
luxury good not in necessity and we could get down a considerable amount without the necessity for rationing.
That's why I think this graph is.
The most important graph in health care policy.
"I would also say for those of you who are a real nerds,"
look at these hours squares.
You don't get this kind of correlation.
In any other social science.
You just don't.
You barely got this in the biological sciences and you really have to go to Physics to get these kind of co-relations.
A perfect correlation is 1.0.
"We're spending $7,300 per person in 2007, corrected the next highest country as I mention, Norway."
"Switzerland is number three, $4,763."
Okay?
"So, compared to that, over 50 percent higher than they're spending."
"Now, some people and I won't get in this today will say, well, a large part of that is prices."
We pay more so our MRls cost more.
Our doctors have turns out have higher salaries than doctors in Europe.
Our nurses get paid more.
A day in the hospital in the United States is more expensive than a day in France.
"All true, doesn't eliminate this gap, okay."
"Might reduce it by half, doesn't eliminate it."
Plenty of rich otherwise healthy countries are down below the average.
"New Zealand, right?"
"Korea, South Korea, okay?"
"So, you don't have to, you know, even Finland is just [inaudible]."
You could be a perfectly fine country and spend a lot less than you're spending.
"I mean, these are countries spending a third of what we're"
"- I am need dropped dock tonight, respecting any ships and a boats."
I'll test you on the final to see whether you really understood that.
So now the sound is 4 times larger than when I cover one up.
I'll cover the other one up.
It's down by a factor of 4.
[tone]
I can cover this one up and then you hear nothing of course.
[tone]
"Now I will move this one [tone] to the location [tone] where there is destructive interference, [tone] which should be about half of 15.6 centimeters."
[tone]
Maybe you have good ears but I hear nothing anymore.
"Now I go through it and find the maximum, which is about 15.6 centimeters."
[tone]
Here it is.
[tone]
"And the other side, [tone] here's the maximum at center, so here should be a minimum, there it is, and I go to the other side, there should be a maximum."
[tone]
And there it is.
[tone]
"So what I have shown you today is I've shown you the interference pattern of sound, of water, of red laser light, of radar, and at the very least I hope I've convinced you as"
Young convinced the world in 1801 that light are waves.
And that means that Huygens was right and Newton was wrong.
Now that should perhaps not surprise you because Huygens was Dutch.
"But now, just to show you how complicated these learning problems can be, here's a story that is the flip side of Lauren's."
"Across the country in New York City there is a young girl whose social success has been masking a painful learning problem, a problem that because it exists in the inner city, might have been written off as something other than the neurological disconnect that it really is."
11-year-old Sara Lee Harris has always had lots of friends.
"Some of my friends are Amber, Roshida, Shana, Akima, Kimmy."
Sarah Lee is the youngest of four children.
"Her mom has one simple goal for her children, a good solid education."
My oldest daughter when she graduated from high school she went to Queensborough
College.
My son graduated from high school.
The twins graduate this year.
"Their positions in feet as a function of time in seconds,"
"T of t and H of t respectively, are plotted below."
"So T of t is the position of the tortoise as a function of time, and it's in feet."
H of t is the position of the hare.
What is the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on the interval t is greater than 0 and less than 20?
"So T of t, they were talking about the tortoise here."
"This is the function T of t right over here, this blue line."
And it looks like it's moving at a constant rate of change.
The slope of this line is constant.
So let's see what this rate of change is.
If we start-- so we could even start from the starting position.
"When 1 second goes by, each notch here in the horizontal axis is 1 second."
"You see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So every time 1 second goes by, it looks like-- and we have to be very careful here."
"At first it looks like, oh, maybe he moves 1 feet."
But we have to be careful about what these notches represent.
"It looks like these notches represent 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 feet."
"So every time 1 second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"Another second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"So it looks like the rate of the tortoise, so I'll say the tortoise rate, the rate of the change of distance with respect to time is 5 feet for every second."
So let's see which of our choices seem to match that.
And that is over the entire interval.
"The interval starts here, this is 0, and 20 is right over here."
"And it looks like we have a constant rate, we have a constant slope."
We have the same inclination of this line the entire time all the way until t is equal to 20.
"So this first choice says the tortoise walks at 5 feet per second the whole time, and this looks right."
Our tortoise has a constant rate of 5 feet per second.
This walks might be an understatement.
"5 feet per second is a pretty good speed, especially for a tortoise."
But we are going to go with that one.
"Now, let's just look at the other ones for fun to see how true they are or see if they could have somehow applied to this problem."
The hare stops moving after 5 seconds.
And so there's a couple of ways we can think about it.
"If this leg is supporting 35 Newtons and we have a total weight here of 120 Newtons, our total weight, the weight at the top of the table plus the bookshelf, that's 120 Newtons."
So the balance of this must be supported by something or someone.
So the balance of this is going to be supported by this leg.
So it's 120 minus 35 is what?
[PHONE RlNGS]
"Oh, my phone is ringing."
120 minus 35 is what?
120 minus 30 is 90.
And then 90 minus 5 is 85 Newtons.
It's so disconcerting when my phone rings.
I have trouble focusing.
"Anyway, it's probably because my phone sounds"
like a freight train.
"Anyway, so there you go."
"This type of problem is actually key to, as you can imagine, bridge builders, or furniture manufacturers, or civil engineers who are bridge builders, or architects, because you actually have to figure out, well, if I design something a certain way, I have to figure out how much weight each of the supporting structures will have to support."
"And as you can imagine, why is this one supporting more weight?"
Why is this leg supporting more weight than that leg?
"Well, because this book, which is 100 Newtons, which is a significant amount of the total weight, is much closer to this leg than it is to this leg."
"If we put it to the center, they would balance, and then if we push it further to the right, then this leg would start bearing more of the weight."
"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting, and hopefully, I didn't confuse you."
And I will see you in future videos.
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously.
"The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri."
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
"To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree."
"Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened."
(Claps)
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
"Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri."
Ah-hah.
"So, instead of, you know, looking for new sources of water, we can look for this source we already have."
"So getting into Greywater, one of the first questions is, is this legal?"
Like can I do this legally?
And the regulations around Greywater have been changing over the last couple of decades.
Greywater used to be viewed as sewage.
"It was part of just the whole water stream going down out of the house, considered sewage, dangerous, you can't reuse it."
And certainly over time it's been shifted to be seen as a resource to be able to be used for non-potable sources.
"So in California, we were the first State to have a code."
It was written in 1992.
"And it was a code, it's a plumbing code designed to allow people to reuse Greywater."
"But the way it was written, it really was more of a disposable code and so people weren't able to do that--to use"
--actually reuse it.
They were kind of asked to dispose of it deep under the ground.
"And so, between 1992 and 2009, pretty much all Greywater Systems were done without a permit, which were--they were technically illegal because the code really wasn't in line with why people want to use it, how it was practical to use."
"And so, there's millions of un-permitted systems."
"And last year, a bit--a lot of--there was drought, there was a lot pressure of reducing water."
"And so, there was a big push to rewrite the code and make it actually fit with Greywater being a resource."
"And so, the Department of Housing and Community Development wrote a new code."
And a lot of people were involved in that to really make it so we could use
Greywater as a resource.
"And so, from last year and onward to the future, Greywater is seen as a resource."
And we're going to show you some simple and legal ways that you can reuse it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Better safe than sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's the legal way [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
We'll get to that in one second.
Yeah.
Good.
It's actually right here.
"So,"
Greywater--who has heard of Greywater?
All of you.
"So, anyone have a Greywater System? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not yet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
Not yet?
"So 2,600 words and it has 23 paragraphs."
A two-paragraph preface is then added to the report.
Is the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120?
So this is interesting.
So the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120.
So if we knew the total number of words in the document we'd be set.
We would just take the total words divided by the total paragraphs they have now.
"They have the 23 original plus the 2 from the preface, you have 25 total paragraphs."
Now it told you the average words per paragrah.
"Now, we don't know the total words, because the total is going to be equal to the 2,600 words in the body of the document plus the words from the preface-- I'll call that words sub preface-- all of that divided by 25."
This is the average.
"This is what we really have to figure out, to figure out if it's less than 120."
That's what they want to know.
So statement number 1.
Each paragraph of the preface has more than 100 words.
"So I guess we could say that the preface, the words from the preface are greater than 200."
"That's another way of saying that the total is going to be greater than 2,800."
"Now if the total is greater than 2,800, what does that tell us about the total divided by-- excuse me."
"So then the total divided by 25 is going to be greater than 2,800 divided by 25."
"What's 2,800 divided by 25?"
"Let's see, 25 goes into 2,800."
"1, 25, 30, 1, 1 times 25, 25, 50, 12."
So it tells us that the average is going to be greater than 112.
So that doesn't help us.
"If it told us that the average was going to be greater than 120, we would be done."
"We would say oh, we have enough information to answer the question."
"Actually, the answer is no, that the average is going to be greater than 120."
"But here, this tells us the average is greater than 112."
It could be 113 or it could be 121.
So it doesn't answer our question of whether the average is less than 120.
So statement one alone is not that useful.
Statement number 2 tells us each paragraph of the preface has fewer than 150 words.
Any might that you might think that my city as the ideal city.
It is not.
You would be a straight jacket for future generations.
They will make all the cities.
Do you understand?
No final frontiers.
That is the message.
"Well, i got all these ideas from the human body."
"When you get an infection on your toes, there is no community."
That sends a command to the brain.
"And the brain says, oh, i am going to do a two month study."
But at that time your infection is up to your knee.
The antibody go right away.
So every organ of the body is taking care of it.
That is how the Earth is operated.
"Nature's way, not Fresco's way."
Will check.

"- Hi Fiorela, tell me what do you do and why do you blog?"
"- Well, I have two kinds of blogs."
"One has personal content, ""Bitácoras de Fiori Álvarez"" where I tell all kinds of stories, short stories that cross my mind at that moment, some of them are my own experiences, another are my friend's experiences, and things that necessarily need to be repeated, in some way."
"The other blog, has more academic content"
They are brief summaries of what I read.
I study Political Science.
"So, you will find a lot about Sociology, Political Sciences."
"International Relations, etc."
"Basically what I want in the first one is to have a place to vent in the second one, I seek to share knowledge because not to many people have access to a certain kind of books or they don't easily understand them."
"-Besides your blogs, in what other places are you in internet?"
"- Well, I follow some blogs, starting for Ivan Lazo's blogs"
I follow Lucifer Achocada ... ... well different kind of contents there are different things that I read..
"Most of them are about politics, because of my career. the second is related to short stories and simple writings, just to distract my mind for a while."
Hi there.
Look on this.
Thank you.
Saying that power plants are the number one cause of global warming is like saying that humans are the number one cause of global warming.
"Power plants don't emit energy, don't create energy for the purposes of just creating energy for the sake of it."
"They create it for industries, and one of the industries that uses the most energy is factory farming."
"In the US, the meat industry uses about one third of all the fossil fuels that we generate."
"Headquarters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, in short PETA."
They have almost 2 million members and are active worldwide.
I love this one as well.
- Oh yes. - This is a very famous one.
We've got this.
I suspect that for Al Gore and for a lot of other people it's just too inconvenient of a truth.
"Gore was a politician and is beholden to a lot of industry people, in many different industries."
Probably in the meat industry too.
"And while he certainly has done admirable work, its disheartening to say the least that he has continued to ignore the fact that the meat he's eating every night for dinner is the number one cause of global warming."
I'm Alicia Silverstone and I'm a vegetarian.
There is nothing in the world that has changed me as much as this.
I feel so much better and have so much more energy.
It's so amazing.
There is a prominent environmental group in the US called Environmental Defence.
"And they recently wrote on their website that if every American replaced chicken with vegetarian foods for just one meal per week, it would be the equivalent in carbon dioxide of taking about 500,000 cars off the US roads."
"Here in the United States, big is beautiful."
That applies to the cars and definitely to the steaks.
The average American eats 124 kilos of meat a year.
44 more kilos than the average Dutchman.
"At night, at the hotel, I watch a classic about American factory farming."

"Here you go, Leo."
"Psst, Leo!"
Who are you?
How did you know my name?
"Now, we can have it into full screen and it will show me what's happening at a 720 pixel."
Look how great that
looks on your TV screen.
This is YouTube.
It's pretty amazing.
All right.
We're going
to go pause this again.
"Now, YouTube has actually launched a new product called YouTube Leanback that's actually defaulted for the Google or for the big screen experience."
"Not specifically for Google TV, but for any large screen that you're viewing YouTube on."
"Now, YouTube Leanback automatically defaults video into full screen."
"It also has very intuitive controls so that you can search, pause, play, rewind all the videos one by one."
"So you see here I can just navigate right, play any video I want to, I can even browse down and search by category."
"And again, it controls, are large and very intuitive."
"So, with Google TV, all of these can become a reality in your television."
But this is not just about video and it's not just about YouTube.
"From here, I can go anywhere on the web."
What about FarmVille?
"Now, did you know that the last I checked, 10% of Americans are playing FarmVille every single day?"
"I don't know what the statistic is for Germans, but that boggles my mind."
Okay.
"So, online games are pretty fun."
What about music?
"Now, there's so many online music streaming sites these days, what if you could play music from your TV?"
"Your TV if often connected to the best speakers in your house, so why shouldn't your music be coming out of those speakers?"
What about photos?
A lot of people these days are uploading their photos to places like
"Picasa, Flickr, Facebook, and a lot of these sites actually have a very interesting feature called slideshow mode."
"Now, again, what's more compelling, a 10-inch digital photo viewer sitting on your coffee table or a 50-inch TV sitting in your living room?"
It's the best and brightest screen in your house.
"This is the screen that you should be displaying all of your photos on, and now you can."
Okay.
No!
They are going to know.
"Then, no!"
They are going to know.

"The lack towards the speech of Allah we can see and the Quran is right infront of us, and our FlRST language is Arabic"
"Allah says:And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? yet we still keep away from Quran, some of us read the Quran only in Ramadan, and some of us does not want to memorize the Quran and he knows that the Quran is easy to memorize."
Look at all these examples that was brought your way!
We now want from you to start with your children in helping them memorize the Quran. and you should also memorize too.
"Memorizing the Quran, Reciting the Quran and prefecting it because"
"BY ALLAH, this Quran will be with us OR against us on the Day of Judgment. especially for those who know the Arabic language, those who have been blessed with their sight, their hearing and their tongue"
By Allah we will not succeed.. and will not find blessing except by the Quran.
I ask Allah to Allow us to complete this show and through these great examples - motivate you to memorize the Quran.
You and whoever is around you.
Ameen.
"""I can't seem to get this paper right!"""
"""Having trouble with your writing, Timmy?"
"Have you tried the writing center?"""
"""The writing center?"
"What's that?"""
"""Why Timmy, the writing center is a free opportunity for you to improve your writing skills!"
You don't need an appointment and it's located right in the tunnel.
"Our excellent staff will be glad to help you at any stage of your writing."""
"""Wow!"
"And then I want to add this 2p minus 1 here, so plus 2p minus 1."
And what do I get?
These cancel out.
These cancel with that.
And these guys cancel out.
So there's a total of p squared possible A's where the determinant of A is divisible by p.
"Now, we're very close, but this isn't what they're asking."
They want the total members where the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"So all we have to do here is take our total membership, which is p to the third, and subtract from that the members whose determinants are divisible by p."
And we just figured that out.
We subtract p squared.
And now we'll get the number of A's where determinant of A not divisible by p.
"Now let's see if that's one of the choices, and it is."
"D, p cubed minus p squared."
Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein.
"If there is one monster that you know by name, you may think its Frankenstein."
"Of course, if you remember the book, Frankenstein is actually the name of the individual who brings the creature to life."
The monster is unnamed entirely.
Not every memory is 100 percent reliable.
"For example, the most common image of Mary Shelley shows her as a mature woman."
"While you read the book, it might be worth bearing in mind that she was only eighteen years old when she began writing it."
"Also, there are two introductions to the book in most of the available editions these days, one written in 1818, one written in 1831, both nominally by Mary Shelley."
"Some people feel that the first one was written by her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley."
"But since he died in 1822, the 1831 preface is certainly hers."
These are not random additions to the novel.
I ask you to read those before you read the text itself.
"Finally, as you read the book, you might be wanting to keep in mind that the book is constructed with different narrative voices, speaking to us, through each other."
Are all of those voices equally trustworthy?
Is every narrator truly reliable?
"What are their motives in saying what they say, and the way they say it?"
"They do, after all, live in a world with monsters."
"I'm the trouble starter,  punking' instigator"
"After medical care and observation,"
Maxine explores her new freedom at Farm Sanctuary.
I've seen that like a hundred times and I still get goosebumps.
"It's simple, you know."
It is unnecessary.
It doesn't have to be this way.
You change your perception.
You change the story.
"That's all it is, the changing of the story."
"And we cannot wait for other people to do it, we have to do it ourselves."
"Every animal wants to live, every animal wants to live, and no animal wants to experience pain."

"We are giving these presentations throughout the year, this is on obviously every last Sunday of the month"
I give this presentations here at Sublime 536-30
"But also, we go to juvenile detention centers, we go to high schools."
"We do other many different presentations on different subjects as well, right now I am spending most of my time in camps."
"It has been very nice not to have to say, ""If you can hear my voice, clap once"". or ""Do not put that in your mouth or your ear."""
"So yes, if you want more information about what we do, all these presentations are free."
They're all for free.
We give them free.
"So if you are interested in having a presentation at your school, if you're a teacher, at some community event that you might be running, we do everything."
It doesn't matter what it is.
"Birthday parties,"
"Bar Mitzvah, Bat Mitzvah, circumcision."
Maybe not the circumcision.
"Also I do want to say, there is a lot of information out there, we have starter kits, we have ""why vegan?""."
It's a talk about the ethical aspect of veganism.
There is also again more information on the Animal Rights Foundation
This is a card.
"This has a list of all the veg friendly restaurants in South Florida, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, definitely take one of these."
It's all out there on the table.
But what about a kid who wasn't identified early or who wasn't targeted for medication therapy or one on one attention?
"This is the story of a teenager who slipped through the cracks, an object lesson in missed signals."
"On the edges of Boston in this neighborhood known as Hyde Park, many families are scratching to make a living."
"One family, the Dunnings, is raising four kids here."
Adam is their second son.
"He was just a good little kid, very well liked."
"Always, neighbors and teachers, and CCD teachers, and coaches would always tell me, what a well mannered son you have."
His mother realized early on that Adam had a problem.
Adam and I would read together every night.
And he couldn't identify words that he should have been familiar with.
"When he started second grade, I knew that there was a building block that was kind of beginning to crumble."
"The school teachers kept saying he's just lazy, you know."
And his personality carried him through.
"Adams a good kid he's just, you know, we'll worry about him"
later.
"Finally, by the fifth grade, Adam's problems in school were obvious to his teachers."
He was given a battery of tests.
But school officials assured the
Dunnings their son was average and would do just fine.
"I think the problem with the initial testing was that when you do an IQ test, you've got 12 sub tests."
And half of them are language based and half of them or not.
So you end up getting scores that get added together.
And Adam's scores added together come up as average.
"But Adam, struggling with even the most basic reading, writing, and spelling tasks had the feeling he wasn't even average."
"I felt embarrassed at some times, like when I couldn't pronounce words and then other kids would pronounce the word for me."
"Say hurry up, you don't know how to read."
I got comments like that all the time.
By now his parents began to really worry about Adam.
They asked the school for more tests.
And by the end of seventh grade the school had a bombshell for the
Dunnings.
They told us that Adam was reading on a third grade level.
"So in the comments please tell me that you go right now, find fashion designers on Linkedln, on Facebook, and you turn them into your happy clients."
Alright?
"If you think there is still any piece of the puzzle missing, then let me know that one in the comments as well, I will answer."
"Besides that, click on +1, click on ""like"" and then stop the video and go get your assignment."
Alright.
I wish you good light!
[Wes]
"So I'm very happy to be here at Mozilla with Brendan Eich, the CTO of Mozilla, and the designer of JavaScript."
So u could tell us how that language came to be.
[Brendan]
Sure.
So I can say more about how I got ready to make JavaScript.
It was when I wrote Netscape.
"I didn't have much time to do that, and I had to have the skills already."
And I've been just seated writing programming language implementations for my entire carreer.
When I got into Computer Science it was for Physics.
First studying theory of formal languages and automata theory.
"Regular languages, regular expressions."
This was the early 80ties and I loved the cleverness of the theory and rather direct way of implementing theories as algorithms.
"So you can make a parser or a lexer , semi-automatically or automatically."
"It was strange to me, and it was useful too."
I think every practicer in programs should take some time to invent a language at some point.
"There's often a need you have that no typical language is perfect for, or you have some leasure time and you can use that."
It's educational and can often solve your problem in a better way than any other language.
"And so, I encourage that."
"I did that myself and there is something that helped me to get ready to write JavaScript because when I got into Netscape and the heat of the moment was there, with Java looming."
Questions about if we needed two languages: a scripting language versus a big language as Java.
I had to go fast.
I had to have all sort... in my muscles I had to have some practice already on the way.
[Wes]
So in this class we will learn a lot of the things he have just mentioned. in various points.
"Regular Expressions,"
Then we released the video showing the slaying of two Reuters journalists and 18 other people in Baghdad.
"And that application was canceled for what judges, two judges involved tell us is for political reasons."
So it really is important to have a diverse funding base that is built around the interests of people and not organizations that are busy in power plays.
"I'm sorry, and your first question was...?"
"If you see your example, you're setting an example that more media put more resources into investigative reporting from war zones."
You mention the example of Sy Hersh and the My Lai Massacre.
"I spoke to Sy Hersh about this last year and, while many people have heard of the My Lai Massacre as the sort of archetypical example of abuse exposed in Viet Nam, what people probably don't know is that Sy Hersh couldn't get that story out, that he wrote, submitted it to the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. and it was not accepted."
Rachel and Clare Wallmeyer are identical twins.
"They were beautiful, bright, straight A students."
"Then, when they were 14, suddenly their perfect world collapsed."
"Kilo by kilo, the twins began wasting away."
"And for the next 20 years, they'd struggled with a deadly disease."
One that affects thousands of Australian teenagers - Anorexia.
Now the twins are 34 and they are literally just skin and bones.
"They still live together, still share everything including, tragically, a death wish."
"Quite simply, they've given up on life."
"Thank goodness, not everyone has given up on them."
"Identical twins, Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer are running out of time."
Their lives have been ruined by anorexia and now they are literally starving themselves to death.
"""We are living, solely, [for] anorexia."
It's a horror.
"We live to die."""
"""It's been a constant pain to wake up everyday and not being able to get out of bed."
We're so tired.
"Everything's a struggle and there's no point."""
Rachel and Clare run to lose weight.
"This obsessive training is all part of their illness, an illness they've been fighting for 20 years."
Interviewer:
"""Rachel, how much do you weigh?"""
Rachel:
"""About 32 and a half kilos."""
Interviewer:
"It's just an ounce of prevention, worth a pound of cure."
"Especially when it comes to keeping one of these precious, lovely children alive."
Let's go through the answer together.
"We definitely want to name our procedure t_string, and now the real trick to this is just writing a good regular expression."
"Here I've written a regular expression that starts with a double quote, ends with a double quote, and can have anything that's not a double quote-- remember that super useful carat character--0 or more times."

"Presence of my body, as the breath moves through the body."
"Present moment, smiling."
(Bell)
"Dear Thay, dear friends, dear family, such a happy moment to be up here  and look down."
"Just to know that our togetherness  for the common purpose of education, this brings me a lot of happiness."
I know that so many students  will benefit from this.
"That awareness really fills my body up, my heart, I am filled."
"I think, just that, already  gives me a lot of hope, a lot of trust."
"Thank you for coming here,  freeing time to be with us."
It is very precious.
"Today, we have a few wonderful friends."
We've got together already just to know what they will share.
"I am just grateful that they agree  to come here to share their experiences in the practice,  in bringing mindfulness, bringing the practice into the areas that they are involved with."
I will sit up here just to be a time keeper.
I have the big bell here.
(Laughter)
"It is not threatening,  it is peace."
"But I will, once in a while,  remind our friends here."
Because their stories  are very inspirational.
"And of course,  we live in a ... (inaudible)"
"Our brothers and sisters, and Thay, in the Plum Village community, we took the initiative to bring  mindfulness into education, maybe 3, 4 years ago."
Thay wanted to secularize the practice and bring it into society.
"But keeping who we are,  which is monastics, we are in a spiritual tradition,  Buddhist based, and so on."
"This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it."
"And I said, ""Well, what exactly is the process?"""
"And they said, ""The band is applied to the tail, tightly."
"And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly."
Blood flow is slowly retarded; a week later the parts in question fall off.
"""Great -- got it."""
"OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it."
"I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it."
"OK, that's basically how you do it."
So the next day I go out.
"And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry."
Melanie is the wife of Albert.
Albert is the shepherd in question.
"Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left."
"Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up."
Alright.
Great.
"Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around."
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
"Being an apprentice, you know, you do that."
"Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife."
"And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know."
"And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive."
"In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding."
"A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp."
"And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip."
"Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?"
"He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder, and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward, and then his head dips down, obscuring my view, but what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding."
Can we roll the video?
No I'm kidding -- we don't -- (Laughter)
I thought it best to talk in pictures.
"So, I do something now I've never ever done on a ""Dirty Jobs"" shoot, ever."
"So, if you look at this graph."
This is how much health care is growing projected based upon the growth in the past and you can see sixteen percent in 27 going up in nearly 50 percent in 75 years.
Now we're not going to get the 50%.
We have a major crisis before we got there but you can see what impact the growth of Medicare and Medicaid are having.
Medicaid roughly and this is before healthcare reform.
But Medicare huge increase over that time and will get a wide that it is shortly 2009 and 2010.
Just one year.
"That's the year, the year for which we have the latest data that arise 300 billion, 200 billion, 100 billion, 50, billion, 25 billion."
"Now this is all health care spending, not just government."
"So, we got a tag 200 billion, 200 billion."
"You guys are a little more pessimistic, I already, I must have scared you, it's a 100 billion."
A 100 billion dollars change in one year.
"Now again, you are not used to thinking about billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars but a 100 billion dollars, that's how much it's costing us to expand health care to everyone."
Per year.
"So, if we could hold health, healthcare inflation and zero for one year, we could pay for the expansion in the healthcare system."
Think about $100 billion in almost any other context that you know of.
Right?
It's a huge amount of money.
"It's $300 for every woman, man, woman, and child in the United States."
We're talking about the payroll tax and all of that.
That's less than this level of inflation.
Benefit to a family of four of changing that payroll tax is less than just one year increased in health care cost.
"Here, you have from 1960, 147 this is for the per cap of spending so it's controlled for the growth and the population."
1968 was spending $147.
Now it is true this is nominal so.
"Up to, in 2009, $8000 per person."
"Again, a phenomenal and then if you look over the decade of the 2000s, you can see going from 5200 to 8000."
60 percent increase in spending.
This is the change in.
"Each decade comparing in the green bar, the growth in the GDP and the growth in the health care, NHE stands for National Health Expenditures, right?"
"First thing you can see is every year, every decade."
Healthcare expenditures exceed the growth and GDP.
"As the market for short stories disappeared, the market for science fiction novels began to grow and so there was this change of the short story as the"
"Epitome of science fiction, to the novel as the epitome of science fiction."
The Martian Chronicles is a hinge.
It's the first great science fiction novel.
"Although science fiction writers thought of it as fantasy, and were annoyed that Bradbury got this agilation to leap from the ghetto into the general consciousness, and it was, in fact, a book that got read as a book."
It was not just a fix up.
"It was, in fact, a composite novel."
We can see that if we take a look at the ways in which the stories changed from their original publication to the publication in the novel.
Bradbury bridges the publishing history from before the 1950's to after the 1950's.
"The Martian Chronicles is not only a wonderful work of literature, it is a milestone in the development of American culture."
The Valley of Tanayiku
"In Cou, 'Tanayiku' means ""A Place without Sorrow""."
"So, what does happiness mean in this Sans Souci?"
The happiest part for me is to work together with my people from the same tribe.
It's such a delight!
There was no way for me to co-work with my people before when I was working in other places
What are we working for?
For Tanayiku.
For all the community.
"It's such a pleasure, such a delight!"
That's it.
"Oh, I'm almost crying......"
The happiest thing for me is to get all of us together.
"Recovering from the typhoon disaster gradually,"
This is what makes me so happy.
Also I've learnt a lot from this place.
"For example, the interpersonal relationship"
"And also the working attitude, which is very important"
"Whenever I help my customers, I feel very happy."
"Although sometimes they complain to us, we still try our best to reply to their complaint nicely."

"So in this last module, since we're talking about the writing process."
"I want to make sure to just give a few last tips for the very final draft,"
I asked people to join us on the board and it slowly started to grow.
I started to advertise and it s started to grow more.
I have had many parents and community members say they learned alot and that makes me happy and excited.
"I""m exicted to see how much it has grown,but it still needs more ""sun""(attention)and more water(love)."
I want your help.
We need money-it's honest.
We need money.
"But,I""m not going to ask you for alot."
I 'm just asking you to give $10.
"If everyone would donate $10,together we can raise alot of money."
"We can raise $5,000."
What will we do with that money?Go shopping?NO:) We will be able to give 8 children 8 weeks of free therapy.

Taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs could add weeks to thier shelf life according to a Purdue University study.
The rapid cooling process uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the protein in eggs thus extending their shelf life.
You can cool eggs many different ways.
"Traditional cooling of eggs, which would be the eggs you would find in the grocery store those are typically just cooled under ambient conditions where the eggs are put into a carton, they're about 105°F. and then they cool over time."
It takes about 10-14 days for those eggs to cool to refrigeration temperature.
The egg cooling system that we've developed here based on using carbon dioxide as a liquid that we can spray and create a cold snow.
This snow is about -107°C.
(negative).
This snow can be circulated around the eggs and we're able to then rapidly cool eggs.
Instead of taking 10-14 days we can do it in the range of seconds of treatment time.
Eggs cooled under current methods lose the AA grade in about six weeks.
Keener's study shows that this rapid cooling process can significantly increase this time period.
"So typically your eggs at the grocery store, those are traditionally cooled where they are just allowed to cool under ambient conditions."
The shelf life on those eggs is usually 4-6 weeks.
Thirteenth year back at Western and I coached a couple years right out of college so it's nice to be hear in Macomb and at Western.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you were the team was picked to finish 8th in the Summit League
Pre-Season Polling.
You think the team will exceed these early expectations with such a young roster?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's kind of hard to tell you know the...the ranking system is based on the Fall results and you know we have a very young team very inexperienced team to start the year and I think that we'll play much bettter this Spring just having known who's going to be playing and a little more experience under our belts.
So I look forward to the competition
I'm not sure about exceeding expectations but were obviously are going to do our best.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now the team finished 10th tied with 11 place with Boise State in the Pat Hicks Thunderbird Invitational how do you think the team did there?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well you know it's the first...first term of the year we've been playing in February now for I think this is our 8th year and you never know what to expect there.
But we really had some bright...bright spots in that tournament.
Andrew Godfrey played very well.
Kurt Slattery who's a transfer this semester he played very well too.
And some of the young guys did fine.
Konrad Deka had 72 in the last round.
So we had some bright spots the finish wasn't as high as what we'd hoped but we try not to take those things into consideration to highly at this point in the year.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you have know returning seniors on the team.
In your coaching career have you had to deal with anything like that before with such a young roster that doesn't get to play that hasn't played that much?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I don't I think it's more than just no seniors on the team.
We lost a lot of experience too.
So a lot of the players that we have this is their first collegiate experience.
It's different to not have seniors is one thing.
But to be going into the season knowing that you really didn't have anybody that have played the golf courses.
That really wasn't us to playing at the Division One level.
Those things are you know there's no substitute for experience.
I expect us to be a lot better just because of those things.
[Nick Spinozzi]
"I have a speech prepared, but..."
I don't know if it's for the toast.
I didn't know I was gonna lead the toast.
[laughter]
Be prepared next time!

Bring your walking legs.
[laughter mixed with gasps]
Okay.
Now this is something uhh...
"I didn't know I was gonna give a speech today, but"
"I happen to type at 30,000 words per minute, so... in the time that I was up there I quickly whipped something up for you, Bayley and Megan."
"I promise you, it will be the most touching thing you've ever heard in your entire life."
[laughter]
More touching than the vows?
Yes.
[laughter]
Fornication such as this...!
Wait... [hesitant laughter]
"For an occasion such as this, it is very important to recognize the people that put their time and effort into making this a reality."
"So thank you... me, for working to make sure that this thing went off with out a hitch... power issues aside."
I wasn't a part of that.
"And thank you, me, for almost making it right on time for the rehersal."
"And thank you, me, most of all for taking time away from myself to recognize the efforts of the little people - Megan, this isn't a dig at you, don't worry, those are coming later, but instead I mean all the people that weren't me and still gave their (less important) time and energy to... decorating..."
"This means to clap, monkeys."
[applause and laughter] feeding us all... [applause]
"and finally, thanks to you for having me here, which lets face it, was  the most important thing to happen today."
"Now, as many of you already know, my name is David Sprague."
"And, as many of you have felt strangely compelled to point out, some of you doing so cruelly within ear shot of the groom, I am the best man here today."
"Don't get me wrong, I understand that I am great, but come on people; this is supposed to be Bayley's special day."
"He has had to hear just how great I am every single day since well before he even met me, so can we please just give him one day free of constant reminders that I am better than him?"
"For those of you that haven't been to a wedding, this is normally the part of the best man speech where I would point out that the groom is actually the best man here because the bride is marrying him instead of the person titled ""best man"", me."
"When x is equal to 0, why is equal to 0."
So the y intercept is 0.
So we know that this has a form y is equal to mx where m is a slope.
Let's figure out the slope.
Slope is equal to change in y for a given change in x or change in y over change in x.
"So when we increase x by 1, how much are we increase-- or decrease y by?"
Well then y increases by 2.
"So we could say that equals y changes by 2, by plus 2 when x changes by plus 1."
"So we get the slope is equal to 2, so the equation of this"
line is y is equal to 2x.
Which is choice B.
Next problem.
Which point lies on the line defined by 3x plus 6y is equal to 2?
Well the best thing to do is just probably to substitute these numbers in for x and y and see which one works.
"Changes to Rumble, Urgot, Cho'Gath, and the Tribunal, covered in this episode of the Patch Preview."
"Welcome, summoners."
"I'm Phreak and I'm here with Morello, Lead Champion Designer."
Together we'll be discussing some gameplay changes coming into the next update for League of Legends.
"While this video does not cover every single change, it will explain the thought process behind some of our decisions."
Rumble seemingly came out of nowhere and was suddenly an overpowered champion.
"In this patch, we'll be lowering the damage amplification from being in the Danger Zone as well as reducing the damage of Flamespitter."
"What's the story here, Morello?"
"We over-buffed Rumble in the Jayce patch, but no one really saw that change because we didn't do any other balance changes with that patch."
Basically we did a bug-fix that made Flamespitter more reliable so you'd get full damage out of the spell more often.
The damage on Flamespitter was extremely high and was balanced for when it was broken.
We're bringing the damage value to something that's much more reasonable for the way it behaves now.
"We really like the Danger Zone gameplay, but we had to re-evaluate the numbers on it."
"You'll still feel good for using Danger Zone effectively, but not 30% stronger good."
Last patch we gave Urgot a whole slew of nerfs aimed at his ability ranges and damages.
"This patch, we're reverting the damage change on Acid Hunter, meaning its base damage is going back up and the attack damage ratio is going back down."
Why are we reverting this change?
Our goal when balancing champions to let them shine in their own special niche.
2 - with 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 zeros to the right.
Definitely significant because there is a decimal point in the number.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.
9 total significant figures here.
"And finally, the number here."
Zeros to the left of significant digits are never significant.
"Zeros to the right - these three will be significant because of that decimal point, which means that there is a total of six significant digits in this number."
"So to quickly review our three main cases - zero sandwiched between non-zero significant digits - always significant. zeros to the left, or coming before non-zero digits - never significant. and if zeros come to the right of non-zero significant digits, they're only significant if there's a decimal place in the answer."
So - now I hope all this is crystal clear.
I hope you're really comfortable with it.
So now we'll go on to the next videos.
"We'll talk about how to multiply, divide, subtract and add numbers that have zeros and significant figures."
"Hello, my name is Ruben"
I'd like to show you the alpha compressor plugin

And the answer is no.
"But if you say, is there a way to reduce the two terms to one to a good approximation, the answer is yes."
"And the reason the answer is yes, is because to a good approximation, if you know, if you know R, and if you know this angle in between that angle."
Which we know that angle because we know all the coordinates.
You can estimate R prime with good accuracy.
"If we can find R prime, in terms of R, possibly also using that angle, Then we can reduce this expression from two terms, down to one."
Can you do that?
I'll leave it to you to see if you can figure it out.
So we'll conclude this segment with this nice picture of one of the main quads at
Duke University.
Thank you for watching this problem session.
We'll see you in the next segment.
Good evening friends.
"I am Shinzo Abe, representing the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan."
Hearty congratulations India Center on 10th Anniversary.
I am very impressed with this grand ceremony.
Mr. Vibhav is a good friend for the last ten years.
"I do not know anyone, who has passionately devoted his life to the relationship of India and Japan."
It was from Mr. Vibhav that I learned the greatness of India and the significance of strong friendship between India and Japan.
"Last year, Mr. Vibhav gave me an opportunity to visit India and there I have met many dignitaries."
"Including Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan."
India and China are the top two growing countries in Asia.
I believe that the key to the prosperous future of Japan is by learning from these countries' progress and growth.
"To strengthen relations between two countries, it is important that each countries think earnestly about the other."
This is the first step forward.
Mr. Vibhav is a very passionate man.
"Sometimes we get exhausted, because of his enthusiasm."
But I have realised that it is this passion and enthusiasm that is significantly inevitable.
"I am now in the position of the President of the LDP, and I attach importance to the friendship of India and Japan."
"With common values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and feudal society,"
let's strategically establish and develop the relationship between the two countries.
"My grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the first Prime Minister to visit India."
"Kyle, are you here?"
"So, that is my work -to try to bring  a change in the vision of education which is basically about people  getting jobs and doing skills rather than becoming a complete human being."
"Holistic education is about educating  the whole person, the body, mind and the spirit."
"Gandhi said they are an invisible whole, as soon as you try to break off one, you commit a gross fallacy."
And we have committed the gross fallacy in education.
"So, the aims of holistic education,  in my view, are the development of wisdom, and compassion and happiness."
Wisdom and compassion.
"Not intelligence, but wisdom."
That deep understanding of how things are.
"So in holistic education, what is really important, and I think in any education, is the presence of the teacher."
"And so much about teacher's education  and even in service education, is about technique, is about theory, but there is nothing about how  to enhance the presence of the teacher."
"So, how does one enhance  the presence of a teacher?"
"It is simple, it is through practice."
It is through practice.
"So, my practice has been meditation,  and so, in my courses, starting in 1988,"
"I required all my students to meditate for six weeks, every day."
Starting with five to ten minutes  and working up to about half an hour.
"And they kept a journal, they still do  keep a journal, cause I am still teaching."
"And at the end, they write  a one page reflection."
Also I introduce mindfulness activity.
"I have them eat a raisin mindfully and then for the rest of the week, do something mindfully, take some  small thing and do it mindfully."
The final thing is I start my classes  with loving kindness meditation.
"This is in a public university, University of Toronto."
"I think one of the reasons  I came to Canada,"
I do not think I could have done this in US.
"So, since 1988, I have been introducing meditation to over 2000 teachers."
"And to read those journals and  to read that one-page reflection, has just been one  of the greatest joys of my life."
(Half Bell) (Laughter)
So I taught this summer and I have one student that was in my summer class and I am really delighted  to see the students come up to me.
"But I just want to read the journal  of one of the students, just a few words."
"In the meditation,  he was counting one to four."
"So exhale, one..."
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about transforming.
"Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen."
This is happening by itself.
It transforms through the magic of lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about touch.
"Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that."
Let's see it one more time.
"Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it."
"And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before."
It's about bringing nature to the inside.
"In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --"
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
It's about stimulation.
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.
"Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall."
"And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,"
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
And I think I'll probably leave it at that.
Thank you very much.

"To set your grasslin timer, turn the dial on the front until the dial pointing to the correct time"
Slide the tabs to the outside for the period you want the timer to be on and ensure the remainder of the tabs are all pushed towards the middle.
In this example the timer will be on between midday and 6pm and off for the rest of the time.
"There is also a sliding switch on the timer, when at the bottom the timer is always off and when in the middle."
It is governed by the tabs around the dial
When this is at the top the timer is constantly on
The Power of Thought.
A person's thoughts are basically a processing of information and situations before him and we all have ideas and thoughts in our mind
"We was at the Leoncito, working for my dad, and then we started riding horses, probably when I was 5 or 6 years old -- getting on some horses by ourselves, and my brother and I would go to the corral and rope the milk cow's calves and ride them."
Put the rope on and ride them.
We wanted to be cowboys.
The skills Charlie was acquiring to manage cattle and horses would later help him to compete in rodeos.
"When we were marking lambs, he used to tell us"
"leave 10 or 12 lambs outside, and talk about fun"
"I had for Welsh horses, and they were good."
"They'd just follow a lamb like a dog, you know."
"And we had those little maguey ropes and we used to rope them, and put one lamb in front of your saddle and rope another one, and then get two and take them to the corral and then go rope some more."
Rodeo is a Spanish word that referred to the semi-annual roundup of cattle borne from the Mexican ranching tradition.
I must have been 16-17 the first time I went on the roundup.
When they started the roundup they would call to see who was going to go.
They would come to town and ask you if you wanted to go to the roundup for 40-45 days.
"If you said yes, they would tell you what day they would pick you up."
"So you had to roll your bat, and have it ready."
"And your saddle, and they would come in the truck and pick you up."
"By the time we got gathered and getting close to where the camp was going to be the cook had lunch for us, coffee."
We changed horses to start sorting.
You always kept the best horses to sort cattle because you always used the best horses for the cutting.
You ride the broncs in the morning.
My uncle says that on the 06 ranch you could ride on horseback from dawn to dusk and never see a fence.
He started working in the first grade to help support the family and had dreams of buying the perfect horse to take him to the main event.
He learned quickly that if he didn't have a good horse there was no use in showing up.
They had this rodeo in Fort Davis.
There were college boys and I'm working on ranches.
We used to rope a lot of baby calves.
"I had the rope in my hand and this guy who used to go to Sul Ross, he says what are you going to do with that rope, Charlie?"
So I told him...I says
I'm going to beat you guys in the calf roping tomorrow.
This other guy had a nice calf horse and I used him.
So I went out there and roped this brahma calf and I went out there and flanked him and tied him.
And won the calf roping... with that raggedy rope.
A morning conversation with Andrew Feldmar
"In Vancouver, from where I've just arrived, a woman was being beaten and raped on the street a few weeks ago."
"It took place in a public place in broad daylight; and they were surrounded by a lot of people, who were simply watching them."
"Worse yet, those people were taking pictures of the attack; and the pictures were posted online within 15 minutes."
But nobody!
Nobody came to the lady's aid.
"Well, this is the comparison I see:"
"Agi Gereb is in prison, and life goes on as if nothing has happened."
Control
Over Life and Death
Bio-politics is exactly that
In those situations when I feel weakest: at the time of birth and death; when I lose my sanity or turn ill
"Who, besides me, will make decisions about my life in those situations?"
"It is unregulated; it is absolutely out of control at the moment But not only here, it is that way everywhere."
Instant Fashion
"Insurance companies want a kind of psychotherapy, which would heal us in three, four, five hours at most."
"Speed and efficiency are our newest fashions, and they are often tied to things that are good."
"But, then again Is it better to make love fast than doing it slow?"
Space
Time
Control
"The ancient Greeks had two words for time, one was called 'Kronos', which is our 'clock time' and the other is 'Kairos'."
Kairos is the point in time at which apricot ripens.
"The answer to the question 'When will we harvest the apricot?' is not 'Friday at five', but rather 'When it ripens'."
"Kronos was a giant, who ate his own children."
So even the ancient Greeks knew that measuring time with a clock is cruel.
It is absolutely cruel.
"Therefore, it is utterly cruel to speed up the birth process or induce it without waiting for the moment when the 'apricot ripens'."
Love and gentleness can never be effective in such regard.
When my daughter was born - our second child - the doctor was impatient to leave on a sailing trip; and he accused my wife of having a 'lazy uterus'.
He found it much too slow.
"And of course, he gave her Oxytocin and she was made to push the baby out very quickly."
Question from Diane.
I noticed some attendees at the NASCSP conference asked how they could apply for Promise Neighborhood funds.
Are you seeing more of this happening in the CAA network?
Mark: there are a couple of agencies that are receiving/applying for Promise Neighborhood funds.
I don't know that I've seen a lot of increases in this.
Promise funds are a relatively smaller program right now and it has a very specific focus.
"I have not seen a large number of agencies that are looking at this as a source of funds, but it certainly is similar work to what a lot of agencies are doing."
Brad:
"Bob Scott, are you still with us?"
Bob:
I am.
Brad:
"Bob thanks for being patient through this very long discussion, and as we approach the end, having heard what we said earlier regarding the FY ""13, we hope to hear on the reallocation within a matter of days on FY ""14."
What are your thoughts?
Where do you see the program right now in terms of funding?
Bob:
"Well, I still think that we're at levels below what is really needed to sustain a national weatherization program, and I hope we can make that impression on Congress that $184 million minus a possible $24 million for the multi-family initiative will not keep maintaining this program."
Can we survive 2013 on $68 million plus whatever might be added by DOE?
Perhaps we can.
"I'd like to think we can, but it's only a matter of time before these types of numbers destroy the network."
"We're on very thin ice with it and I hope something can change, and we'll be working to do that."
We need to at least get to those pre-recovery act levels of $225 million.
So I hope we can get by.
"I think most states can hang on for another year, but I think the term, ""we could get starved to death"" is a good way of putting it."
It's certainly something that I fear and hope we can change.
Brad:
Certainly our strategy is to get the funding back to the pre-recovery act levels.
We're talking with
"Senators Reed and Collins right now about an ask in the range of $225 million for FY ""14."
"Elyse was with us Earlier, Senator Reed's Legislative Director, and when she referred to the member request letter, that's where we're having the conversations right now."
And we're looking at the figure right in the range of $225 million.
That's where strategy is.

"[yelling, indistinct]"
Everyone has something at their core that they're really upset about.
And here at least it seems that it's all molding together to be like a structural change.
That's what people have been working on.
That's what the general assemblies are here.
"That's why the working groups are forming, so that people can go into a specific corner like sanitation or environmental, or whatever, and start forming their own demands."
Right now we're just practicing first aid on people.
"You know, some people are hurting their feet, or, you know, hurting their ankles, we give out ice packs and stuff, but that's really all we're allowed to do."
"And if we feel someone needs to go the the hospital, we'll call for them and send them there."
"These medical supplies came from all over the country, people donated them."
We got a big shipment in on Tuesday.
"You know, they really sent a lot of stuff, which was, like, heartwarming."
This is the comfort station.
"Essentially we provide warm, dry cloththing, tents, blankets, we have men's socks, women's socks, men's shirts, women's shirts, men's pants, women's pants, umbrellas, tarp, everything to keep everyone comfortable while they're camping out here."
"Makes no sense that one percent of the population owns sixty percent of the wealth,"
"It makes no sense that people are trying to live the American dream and they go to college, and kids are knee-deep in debt, and they can't find jobs, so that's why I'm here."
We're basically feeding everyone.
"Several core members of the TED community, during what was a 2-year transition process, really got behind it, Jeff Bezos, John Doerr, Sunny Bates,"
"Linda Stone, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and -- actually some people in this room who I won't embarrass, but thank you -- really swung the community around to believing that TED could go on."
"And so, the first event did pretty much sell out well ahead of time."
"As a junior at 2003, there was one of the things that I felt like really needed to happen."
"I felt like this sense of inspiration and possibility that always hit people at TED, we just needed to do something with that."
There was so much potential there to make a difference in the real world.
What could we do?
"So, at the end of TED 2003,"
"I urged the audience to consider getting behind some of these big, wild causes"
"like AlDS, fresh water, you know,  the ocean's crisis."
"And, some people loved it."
"And, some really didn't."
"I mean, the truth is, one person's cause is another person's ""Dear God, please shoot me now""."
"And, it is!"
"In a conference filled on how people re-discover wonder, a sense of possibility, curiosity, you have to be really careful what you kind of do that might be perceived as cramming something down someone's throat."
"So, a few longstanding members of the TED community were thorouly pissed off, and actually left. and I thought I might have blown it."
"However, that little kerfuffle led to something very special."
"A group of us went away for a weekend, and we brain-stormed about, look, there's got to be a way to do this."
This stuff really matters.
"It's actually, inherently, quite interesting"
How do we bring to it to TED in a more TED-like way?
"And, what that led to was this."
"So, every year, we bring 3 remarkable people to TED and give them this unique proposition."
Come and make a wish.
Tell us your dream.
You can make one wish without restriction.
"This process has, first of all, allowed us to bring people to TED we could never have brought."
"Second, it brought to the conference, the world biggest issues in a way that seemed different, magical, exciting, and in a way which led to an extraordinary range of collaborative projects that frankly wouldn't have happened in any other way."
"One is ""One.org."""
"Cameron Sinclair is in the room actually, TED prize winner, Cameron."
Where are you?
Here you go.
"""I think everyone at some point in their life has felt like they don't belong to something."
"They're not being set apart, they are included in what every other kid they see gets to do."""
"There are more than 80 Sparkle teams all across the country, but those are only in middle school and high school."
"Here at UW Platteville, this is the first Sparkle squad at the collegiate level."
"""It's actually really fulfilling."""
Nate Stikes is a cheerleader and a mentor for one of the Sparkles.
"He's never worked with special needs kids before, and he was nervous at first, but that feeling quickly went away."
"""There's really nothing like it"
"I just see in their eyes that this is the most fun that they've had and they love every minute of it, and that's what makes doing it worth it, is seeing the smiles on their faces."""
"""Kids with disabilities are just like everybody else, and don't be afraid of them."""
Mitch says the program has had a profound impact on her life as well.
"""The first couple practices I'll admit I left and I was just so overwhelmed, I was in tears, and now I leave and I'm just smiling."
"The joy and excitement and the pleasure they get out of this, and their parents..."
"I still tear up a little bit because it's amazing."""
This team is special because each and every member makes it sparkle.
"""To know them and meet them is to love them."
"And you meet these kids for ten minutes, you're going to fall in love with every one of them."""
Stéphane (ST):
"Juanlu, thank you for coming"
First I'd like to ask you to give a brief presentation; who you are and what you do.
Juanlu (JL):
"My name is Juan Luis Sánchez, I'm a journalist and I'm one of the people who started periodismohumano.com"
"And, well, we were in the Puerta del Sol from beginning to end"
And we try to follow what has been happening around the 15-M phenomena before it was called that.
ST:
"Yes, afterwards we will ask you in detail about the coverage you gave to that."
"The first question is ""THE question""."
"I'd like you to tell us, from your point of view, what is the 15-M movement?"
JL:
"I think the 15-M was, for many weeks, a physical space where people could share ideas, that came from a non-physical space, a virtual space, from the net, from indignation."
"And all that soon spilled out from internet onto the street, and people started talking about politics, and that it should be OK to talk about politics, and come up with a common diagnosis to society's problems."
"Global problems, not just local."
He studied business and I studied economics and Sinology.
"When he finished his studies, he asked himself, what to do?"
Then he had the following idea:
"This is myrrh, a natural resin from the myrrh-tree."
And this myrrh-tree finds extremely well climate conditions in Somalia.
Therefor this is the resource - here you can smell it - please give it to your neighbors -
- for which the world still needs Somalia.
Then Ahmed had the idea to import myrrh from Somalia to Germany.
"This is used in shampoos, in many cometics, medicine as well. - the back rows will be happy if you pass it on."
"Ahmed founded a firm for this export business, here Mercatus GmbH, in Hobrecht Street 28, Berlin."
This firm is also the kitchen of his flat.
"The business works well, but sometimes he looses control."
Which is mainly due to Somalia and the civil war there.
And now actually comes the main punchline of this evening.
"Mister Liu Xenfang from Hongkong, who built the National Theatre in Somalia, who now runs a shop in Nairobi, found Ahmed's firm on the internet."
"He had the idea to invest in this myrrh-business, buy myrrh from ahmed, sell it to the far east."
But he heard that the myrrh from Somalia is often shit.
"There's goat-shit in it, or splints of shell or other shit."
"He didn't want this, therefor he wanted to check the situation on the ground himself."
"In summer 2011 Ahmed and Liu planned a journey to the Horn of Africa, in order to sort things out with the farmers there."
"And Ahmed asked me to join this journey, to make research there, and develop a theatre play out of it."
And then I searched in Germnay for people to participate in this.
"Hello, my name is Chang Bee, I come from Taiwan."
"I studied classical singing in Taiwan, this means, learning to sing in the way that the european opera needs."
Therefore I wanted to go to Europe when I finshed my studies in Taiwan.
"In order to learn it even better, where this aesthetic comes from."
And I went to Berlin for an entrance examination.
Somalia is not the kind of country where one can travel spontaneously.
I wandered about security concerns in advance of our journey.
"I wanted to plan it well, wanted to know which places are really dangerous, then we could figure out a route which is not critical, or do I have to cancel it all, because it's to dangerous everywhere?"
"When you make a good plan in Taiwan, you ask an authority which can tell you."
I asked my teacher when I wanted to go to Europe.
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
I try to write the letters  hundreds of times
But at the end  I rip it apart
Why is love  so heavy for me
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
Give me love That's enough
...but it's actually Michigan where this is maybe the most stark and the most amazing.
"In Michigan, the new Republican governor is a man named Rick Snyder."
"Rick Snyder does not get a lot of national attention, but boy howdy he ought to."
"What Governor Snyder is doing, I think, tells you, in particular, how clueless the beltway press has been about what is actually happening in the states right now, in Republican politics."
"If you listen to the beltway press, even those who are willing to be critical of the Republicans, they say things like, ""Well real fiscal conservatives would consider raising taxes, as well as cutting spending, to address their state's budget shortfalls""."
That is actually happening in some of these places.
Look what they are trying to do in Michigan.
Rick Snyder has proposed an actual tax increase.
"Michigan has a budget problem, so he's gonna do the,[bell dings] responsible thing. right?"
He's going to raise taxes.
"He's gonna raise taxes on - seniors, and on poor people."
"1.7 billion dollars in tax hikes for Michigan seniors, and Michigan's poor people, and for people who want to make a tax deductible donation to public universities."
"Sorry, you know, Michigan has a budget problem."
We're gonna hafta raise a whole lotta money from you -
"- poor people, old people, people supporting public schooling - you have to take the hit because the state needs to save that money."
Is the state saving that money?
"No, the state is not."
"Governor Snyder is taking all of that money that the state will gain, and he is not using to close the budget gap."
He is giving it away - in the form of 1.8 billion dollars in corporate tax cuts.
"He's taking in 1.7 billion dollars in higher taxes from poor people and old people, and giving it away."
1.8 billion dollars to businesses.
"We informed about what was happening in Malaga, Gijon..."
We have been in many cities.
"And I can tell you in Madrid, for example, the work was mainly developed thanks to"
"Jessica Romero, Lidia Molina, also my own work where other people like Leila Nachawati and Olga Roríguez collaborated..."
"The family of Periodismo Humano is large and more or less intensely, depending on each person, we have all collaborated a lot."
With the coordination of Javier and Patricia who made it possible for everything to fit in and make sense.
"But, a normal day of coverage during the 15M, during those first weeks,"
"I would get up late, because the night before"
"I had gone to bed very late, go to the Puerta del Sol, and start talking to people and ask them what they were doing there, who they were, if it was true that they were hippies or radicals or violent... or if it was true that they weren't going to vote, or if they had fleas."
"I don't know, ask them who they were."
And from there lots of interesting things came to light.
"And you spend your day talking to people, listening in on the assemblies to understand what it was all about."
I remember telling one of my co-workers:
"""Get a computer and write down everything we've heard, these are the 15M political proposals""."
"Because someone had decided to read a list of things that they had talked about in an assembly, areas of work."
Areas of work where they would form commissions.
"So at that moment, in my short-minded journalist's brain, I thought that was the headline."
And I asked my co-worker to write it down.
"From that moment until it was published everything calmed down a lot, and fortunately we weren't wrong and we didn't slip up."
But we could have.
Because at that moment you didn't know what we were looking at.
"But our job was to be there 12 or 15 hours with the people, uploading photos and video."
"Not just for the sake of uploading them, but looking for humane details that defined what was happening."
To escape from the freakshow idea.
To escape from the freakshow idea and the exception.
NOT to go up to the wierdest looking man in the square.
Because that didn't define what was going on.
NOT to find the biggest Mohawk haircut.
Because Mohawk haircuts are fine but they didn't define what was going on.
"NOT to go up to someone with a bottle of beer in his hand, that didn't define what was happening in the square."
Just talk to people.
12 hours.
The limit as delta t approaches 0 of r of s t plus delta t minus r of s and t.
"In this situation we're holding the s, you can imagine, in constant."
"We're finding its change in t, all of that over delta t."
And the same thing falls out.
"This is equal to the partial of x with respect to ti plus y with respect to tj, plus z with respect to tk."
"Same exact thing, you just kind of swap the s's and the t's."
"And by that same logic, you'd have the same result but in terms of t."
"If you do this pseudo mathy thing that I did up here, then you would get the partial of r with respect to t times a super small change in t. dt, our t differential, you could imagine, is equal to r of st plus dt minus r of s and t."
So let's box these two guys away.
"And in the next video, we're going to actually visualize what these mean."
"And sometimes, when you kind of do a bunch of like, silly math"
"like this, you're always like, all right, what is this all about?"
"Remember, all I did is I said, what does it mean to take the derivative of this with respect to s or t?"
"Played around with it a little bit, I got this result."
"These 2 are going to be very valuable for us, I think, in getting the intuition for why surface integrals"
look the way they do.
"So in problem 44, once again we have the exact same setup that we had in problems 42 and 43."
But now they're asking us the number of A in T sub p such that the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"Well, we've already done some work in problem 43 in figuring out some set of the members that are divisible by p."
"So why don't we just figure out the total number of members of T sub p, and then subtract the total members whose determinants are divisible by p, and then we'll get this answer right over here."
So what's the total members in T sub p?
"Well, for a, I have p possible choices, right?"
"If I'm picking between-- up to p minus 1, but I'm including 0, there's actually p possible choices."
"So I have p possible choices for a, p possible choices for b by the same logic, and p possible choices for c."
So I have p to the third possibilities.
So there are a total of p to the third members in T sub p.
"Now, what did the last problem tell us?"
This was number 43.
It told us the members-- maybe I should write it this way.
"The number of members, numbers of A's, such that the trace of A-- this was the language I used in the last video or the last problem-- such that the trace of A not divisible by p, but the determinant of A is."
And we got the answer as p minus 1 squared.
The two connect.
"This year here at the Mechina is a very, very significant year."
It creates a real revolution among these young men.
"And slowly but gradually, through all the experiences and laughs, you see how these kids stabilize, kids who walked around with a kipa, but with spikes underneath with all the gel in their hair etc.."
"The hair slowly but gradually gets shorter, they begin to dress differently"
like a Talmid Chacham.
Something stabilizes within them.
Two words the Mechina gave me:
Torah and Life.
"As far as I'm concerned, they are both the exact same thing."
The Mechina brought Torah into my life.
It totally changed my life.
I understood this at the Mechina itself which was one of the most significant things I've ever done.
I think that only after looking at the long-term will I be able to see just how significant and essential it impacted my life.
"After a year-and-a-half at the Mechina,"
"I received not only direction, but also serious momentum to begin life in the best way possible."
"Our spiritual situation when we came here wasn't exactly ""up there"", and had we enlisted directly into the army, we would have absolutely experienced [spiritual] burnout."
The Mechina saved us.
"Thank G-d, we see amazing success at the end of the year when we see the same student who, was began the year with an earring, and at the end of the year before enlisting in the IDF, the student makes a Siyum Masechet/concludes a book of Talmud and with this Siyum he enlists in the IDF in a combat unit, nonetheless!"
Amazing!
"""Magic"", perhaps, but I call it ""Divine Assistance""..."
"I became so attached to this place that the decision to get married happened right over here, on the steps."
"I came here with my wife, even after the Mechina had already moved elsewhere."
I took her to these steps and we talked and I felt my best in this place
I felt here the most confident to tell her that I want to marry her that I love her and want to build a Jewish home at the very place which helped me know what a Jewish home is...
I'm carrying around the centre of Europe. i like the idea very much.
"Lisboa, it's the centre of good food, good nightlife."
"- Open to the world, to multiple cultures."
"- Its' kind of becoming the centre of cultural evolution, in its own way."
"- And I think it can be the centre of Europe, because it captures the European culture."
- This is Lisbon: ... open-hearted.
- The centre of Europe?
"I think first and foremost that you can explain to people the only thing that counts in life is to develop yourself in the good sence, being a good person ... and then learn that being with other people also means imply giving up things"
"We owe it to others to take care of them, and it is a very but that is very difficult for people to learn even if it, in fact is pure logic"
Martin:
But isn't that very greek?
Ole:
"It is very Greek and very Christian, and the Christianity is good"
Martin:
Then it is very Greek beeing so very good ..
Ole:
"You could say so, yes ... and not only Greek / Catholic"
We must help to build a society that is not just about claiming a lot of stuff for ourselves but a society where we help and support others and not because we thereby help and support ourselves
One becomes wiser beeing a decent person
I try as good as I can to explain that to people although I wonder why it should be necessary
"One also have to try to take your own medicine which is the worst of it all, but I'm working on it"
Martin:
"But perhaps the paradox of this project is that if you have to be really really good to yourself, there is some who interprets it as ""not caring about others"""
Ole:
"No, I do not think that, that is the way to take care of yourself..."
The Greeks had a slogan saying
"""εαυτό τους"" meaning ""look after themselves"""
"In latin it is ""cura de se"".. um.. but does not involve any form of selfishness"
Martin:
But there ought not be a difference in taking care of yourself and take care of other
It should be able to go well together
Ole:
"It should be, because we are the others hostage and we only exist because the others have been there to begin with"
Martin:
"But then, why does it not work?"
Ole:
I think this has much to do with not prioritizing the right way in our upbringing and our education
Take private schools..
Earlyer they were there for those students who didn't do so well in the public schools
"After the summit with Nehru Prime Minister then, introduced my grandfather to the citizens who gathered."
"He introduced,"
"""We have a special guest form great country called Japan."
Japan once fought with and defeated Russia.
"And that gave India inspiration and hope to strive for independence."""
"At the time, Japan was still recovering from the defeat of the World War Il."
And so I was told from my grandfather that Nehru Prime Minister's speech deeply encouraged Japan and my grandfather.
"I, as a leader, would like to strengthen and develop this long relationship with India."
"I wish India Center further success in the future; with wonderful leaders like Mr. Vibhav and Mr. Yoshimi Ishikawa, I am very confident."
I call upon your support for the cause and I would like to send my best regard to the India Center.
It was a coincident that the MC of today's ceremony gave a campaign speech for me during the election.
It gives me a sense of fate with India Center.
I would like to end my greetings with graces to India Center.
Thank you very much and congratulations once again.
ALEX FAABORG:
"All right, good afternoon."
Thank you coming.
"This is Advanced Design for Engineers, and really glad to have you here."
"Design's often broken into two components, form and function, and this talk is no different."
"We're going to have Christian Robinson presenting on form, and he designed the Roboto typeface."
"And I'm going to present on function, on interactive design."
"And I got to work on Google Now, which launched yesterday."
"So as you can imagine, I'm incredibly tired."
"Being engineers, you guys know how launching software isn't making sure everything's perfect in the end."
"But while I am physically incredibly tired, I am extremely excited to be able to give this talk."
"The thing I love more than actually doing interactive design is teaching it, so it's really exciting to get a room of incredibly smart people and to provide all of this information to you So let's dive into interactive."
"Now this is a room of engineers, I'm assuming?"
Raise your hand if you're an engineer.
"Yep, OK."
"So often engineers don't have a tremendous amount of respect for design, and it's not that they don't think design's important."
"They realize it's critical to the success of their application, but the reason they disrespect it is it's not controllable in the way that software is normally controllable, and hardware, because you're dealing with people, and people can be kind of random."
And last but not the
"least, in order to give you the chance to get a question to Mr. Schmidt, please raise your hand."
We have ladies on each side of the stage with a microphone in their hands and we will guide the microphones to you.
"Once you have the microphone, please get up, state your name and your outlet and start shooting the question."
I think that's basically all.
The Q&amp;amp;A section will probably be limited to about 10 minutes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, so please give a warm welcome to the COO of the Messe Berlin, Dr. Christian Goke."
Welcome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOKE:
"Thank you, Steven."
"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon."
"Usually, when I'm standing"
"here in front of you trying to kick off the keynote, I'm either trying to present the speaker, or the company, or I'm trying to give a short summary of what have happened so far at our show."
"Today, there's obviously no need at all either to introduce the speaker or the company."
"And on the other hand, our show is running so smoothly, we are hitting new record numbers that there is time--very little time for a very brief observation."
Most of you--as you do know by now that our show started in 1924.
"1924, that was only six years after the end of the First World War; and in 1929, after some years of Europe again blossoming and a period that was later on called the Golden 20s, in 1929, the party abruptly stopped; Wall Street crashed."
"And one year later in 1930, almost to the day 80 years ago, Albert Einstein himself delivered his first keynote to our show here in Berlin; another radio talk."
"And then again only three years later in 1933, Hitler's Nazi regime came into power."
"So, what I'm going to say is, this was a very special moment in time when he delivered his first keynote here in 1930, 80 years ago."
"And what he said in essence was, ""Technology enables communication and communication enables democracy."" And I think"
that this statement is more valid today than ever before.
And it should really remind us that every new means of communication has a direct impact on our political system.
"So,"
"ladies and gentlemen, I'm reasonably sure that Albert Einstein somewhere up there is watching us and he is looking forward as much as we are to the closing keynote of IFA 2010 given by the chairman of the board and the CEO of Google."
"But before we start; film up, roll on the movie please. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, our lives are changing fast."
"Now, our lives are changing fast."
Hope that something pure can last.
Hope that something pure can
last.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
Two of the victims were former members of the Auburn University football team.
Auburn police chief Tommy Dawson announced the deaths.
"""It's sickening that these young lives were cut short, and, and also the shooter is such a young man."
"As a society, we've got to learn the value of life again."
"If I could bring them back today to their parents, I would."
"Fortunately, I can't do that."
"And to the parents and families of these victims, I am very sorry."
"Please let it be known, we are grieving with you"
"In other gun violence nationwide, four people were killed in an apparent gang-related shooting in Sacramento on Sunday and four people died when a father in California's Fresno County killed his wife and two children before taking his own life"
And a group of Latin musicians has won a campaign for the Grammy Awards to reinstate the category of Best Latin jazz album following its elimination last year.
Latin jazz was among dozens of ethnic music award categories cut from the annual event by the Recording Academy in a controversial move.
"Last August, four Latin jazz artists filed a lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court claiming that the dropping of such categories had adversely affected their careers."
"The suit was dismissed in April, but after continued campaigning the Recording Academy announced the award's reinstatement on Friday."
"Hello, my name is Karen Peltz Strauss."
I grew up in NY
I have a family of three boys and one husband.
"The ""Dirty Jobs"" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig."
It's only a couple dozen square miles.
It's in the Rockies.
And the job in question was sheep rancher.
"My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple."
"I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question."
"And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people, for one day in their life."
The job in question: herding sheep.
Great.
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.
"So, normally, I never do any research at all."
"But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do, and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals."
"So I called the Humane Society and I say, ""Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs,"
"Can you tell me the deal?"""
"And they're like, ""Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."""
"They use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller."
"So we've chosen the things that sort of solved the most complexity like being able to send an SMS with one click, being able to navigate some of it with one click."
"There's one that I didn't demonstrate, which I use, like, ten times a day, which is to say, ""Note to self,"" and then, you know, ""Buy milk on the way home,"" or whatever reminder you want to send yourself."
"I'm sure many of you geeks here send yourself emails all the time, trying a reminder."
So we're trying to solve the biggest problems before we try to voice-enable everything.
"The next step, by the way, is to actually open the voice actions platform with a public API so that third party developers can then start adding different actions to do anything, right?"
"So, Spotify, for example, could say, ""Well, it's great that a user can launch Spotify and play a song or a playlist, but what about controlling the playback?"" You know, ""What about being able to say 'pause' and other thing like that?"""
"So we're going to open up the voice actions API for that stuff, and all of these actually are doable today because there's an open API on Android itself for speech."
Hopefully that answered that question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:
I'm looking forward to that.
"And the second question is to--I'm sorry, the second question is to Eric."
"Now, Google TV is one of the best of product from Google, right?"
Okay?
What's your strategy to get Google
"TV into China market, because I'm a Chinese, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Well, our current strategy is to try to get it."
"Because of the partnership you saw, it has to be integrated with the content provider."
"We're trying to get it launched in the next couple of months in United States, and then we'll do a worldwide launch later or basically in 2011."
"And I won't go through the details on a per-country basis, but it's pretty obvious what we need to do."
"We need to talk to the broadcasters and make sure we have the content, get the thing certified."
"Televisions are, in fact, offered by the local manufacturers."
They have to actually install the software in their televisions.
"Go ahead. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Dr. Schmidt, I'm really sorry, but I've Googled your schedule, you only have time for one more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
One more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And please try and keep it to one question.
"So, anymore?"
I think the gentleman all the way in the back.
If you could stand up and just announce yourself.
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; POPl:
"Hello, my name is Luppa Popi from Symantec Eds and my question is, what's your view about Apps?"
Everybody is talking in Apps and Apple has taken this phenomenon to the
last stage.
"And when we talk about Apps in two or three year's time, what will be the mash up use cases from the Apps. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
First is I think the iPad Apps have really shown a very good model.
"But in fact, this man has a wonderful  relationship with the young people because he is completely comfortable with  who he is and he is completely authentic."
"And these young people  feel his authenticity and his authenticity allows them to be their true selves."""
"And that is the most important, not the differences, but the authenticity."
"(Woman in the audience) Hello,"
I work in French and American schools.
"I do intervention, teaching meditation and yoga but I usually talk to the children, not so much to the teachers or bosses of the schools."
"And basically, I am looking for help and maybe resources to know to speech, to talk to teachers of big school."
"People give you some money, basically, to come in to the school."
I am also looking for resources  to translate all the mindfulness that we learn in English in French.
(Inaudible)
(J. Bell) I wonder if anybody in the hall could answer her.
"Raise your hand  if you have some resources and then you could speak to her afterwards, okay?"
(Inaudible)
Someone back there too.
(M. Srinivasan) I also wanted to mention that collaborative academic social  emotional learning has a great resource.
"They have five competencies that  are specific taught sequentially of self awareness, self management,  social awareness, relationship skills and  helping decision making."
"If you just go to www.casel.org, there is a lot of information there including research about improved attention and focus, and students who have social  emotional learning interventions."
The latest report had an increase of 11% top points on testings.
This is all language and information that will be really effective for the administrators too.
"(K. Weare) And also to add, I actually imagine it is very typical."
"The dot-be program in the UK, if you go to it, has a paper  on the evidence based and the curriculum has been translated into French."
"I would imagine if you went  to the Garrison website and looked the various programs there, you would find quite a lot of resources."
There are 37 programs.
"If you start clicking, you will find stuff, I'm sure."
"(M. Srinivasan) Richard suggests that I spell 'casel', it is C-A-S-E-L dot org."
And they also have the evidence based  programs up there and research as well.
"(K. Weare) It is in the UK, it is called the Mindfulness in Schools Program."
There is free download of a paper only evidence-based from mindfulness in school.
"It is just called Mindfulness in Schools, if you put UK, you'll find it, and it's called .b which  is a full-stop with the small 'b'."
"It means basically stop and breathe or stop and be, that's its logo."
But I think the Garrison will also  have some evidence-based papers.
"So, there are quite a lot around  if you start google-ing."

"In 1919, ""My Antonia"" had been out for a year."
And Cather was getting a lot of attention.
People loved this book.
She wrote her mother in December of 1919 and you can just feel on the page how excited she is to share with her parents how famous she's beginning to become.
MUSlC
CATHER'S VOlCE:
"In addition to painting the bathroom and doing the house work and trying to write a novel,"
"I have been becoming rather famous lately, and that is an added care."
"In other years, when I was living like a lady, with an impressive French maid, I could have been famous quite conveniently, but then I had only to receive a few high brows."
Now the man in the street seems to have got onto me and it's very inconvenient.
Reporters come running to the house all the time and keep finding me doing housework.
They demand new photographs and I have no new clothes and no time to get any.
"Yesterday, when I was washing dishes at the sink with one of Mother's long gingham aprons tied around my neck, I've never had time to shorten it,"
I heard a knock at the front door and didn't stir.
Then a knock at the kitchen door; such a dapper young man asked if Miss Cather the Author lived here that I hesitated.
"He said, ""Tell her I'm from the New York Sun and want to see her on very important business."""
I told him that miss Cather had gone to Atlantic city for a rest.
I simply couldn't live up to the part you see.
He left saying there was to be a big article about her on Sunday.
That was just the beginning for Cather.
She's still popular to this day.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan says he's ordered new restrictions on airstrikes targeting Taliban militants hiding in residential homes.
The directive from General John Allen prompted the Afghan government to claim the U.S.-led NATO occupation force has agreed to stop bombing residential areas and homes altogether.
"But U.S. officials say the attacks will continue but now under stricter guidelines for airstrikes, not ground operations."
"The new policy was unveiled amidst widespread anger over the latest NATO attack that killed 18 civilians, including nine children, last week."
"On Friday, Allen emt directly with some of the victims"" families and apologized to the Afghan people."
"This was a joint Afghan and U.S. force, they were taken under fire, a hand grenade was thrown, three of our people were wounded."
We called for the people who were shooting to come out and then the situation became more grave and innocent people were killed.
"On those occasions when our forces accidently kill or harm Afghan people, we are very sad."
You had to get back in touch.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Can we get back to the question?
MAN 1:
Yeah how do you see that type of thing growing up in a network connected society changing?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
It's a very good question.
"I think for a lot of people it's an entirely good thing to be able to stay in touch but there are certain people who, as you said, have always throughout history had a possibility to make a clean break and reinvent themselves."
And I head Jaron Lanier recently talk about Bob Dylan when he went from being
"Robert Zimmerman in the town in Minnesota, left, totally reinvented himself and became"
"Bob Dylan in New York City, great artist."
"You know what would happen today, if Facebook was around and there is Robert Zimmerman goofing off in Minnesota and everybody when he goes to Greenwhich Village and says your that guy, you're not Bob Dylan."
"And so for a certain segment of people, it does lock us into an identity, I think, much earlier than we're ever locked in before."
"And, for those people, which might be just, you know, the great majority of people might not mind being locked into an identity and might like having perpetual contact with their co-kindergarteners or whatever, but I think there is a segment of society which is going to find it much much tougher and these might be great artists as well, since they tend to go through this will find it much tougher to reinvent themselves."
PETER NORVlG:
"Okay as a reminder to our audience, this program has been provided by the"
Commonwealth Club's Inforum Division.
"Tonight we are hosting Nicholas Carr, author of the Shallows:"

"And I'm Peter Norvig, director of research."
Lets go to a question on this side.
MAN 2:
Okay I know from my personal experience that I tend to agree with you.
"My ability to read a book is diminishing every year, whereas I could read one a week, now I'm about one a year."
So I know that its happening.
One thing that I would be interested in is your feelings about the future affect of this.
I think you are underestimating the affect.
"I think that it is actually worse because we have an accelerating rate of change in society so the number of channels that we have to deal with, the number of modes of communications that we have to deal with continue to accelerate and change."
"So I'm wondering if it'll actually become a worse affect over the next 5 years, ten years and so forth?"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I'm already kind of pigeonholed as a commergent, so I'm a little nervous about answering that question truthfully, but I think that's right."
I mean I think that we're facing a continuation of this trend.
I recall the fish biting several hours later.
"But those times alone with him in a boat, on a lake, sharing thoughts, memories and laughter... no Christmas morning could top them."
I'm grateful for my Dad instilling within me the recognition of the value of a family.
"Upon marring my wonderful wife Katie and raising our three children,"
I gravitated to spending as much time as possible with them.
That meant perhaps sacrificing time with my Dad.
"None the less, I know he understood because he did the same with my mom, sisters and I."
He helped build a bond with a strength that was no more evident than our presence during the final days of his life.
"Finally, I'm grateful for my Dad for instilling within me the love of the Chicago Bears."
"As my friends who in attendance today will attest,"
I chose during my adolescent years to spend fall Sundays beside my dad agonizing the Bears losses and celebrating their wins.
"As I grew older, the phone would be our connection to chastise a poor play or simply yell into the phone to each other following a Bears touchdown."
"During my sport writing days I summarized the Bears Superbowl victory with a column confessing simply, that my love of the Chicago Bears was hereditary."
"I wrote at the time, ""As I think about the emotion that swells within me as I watch"
"'Brian's Song' for the umpteenth time,"
I see my father sitting in his easy chair.
Heredity is a difficult facet of life to ignore.
"My love for the Bears, I have come to realize, is all in the genes."
Chicago Bears - Superbowl Champions.
It has the ring of a Christmas wish.
"Well, Dad, here's to our wish finally coming true."""
"Dad, my wish today is that you have a heart-to-heart with the good lord."
To ensure a certain team from Chicago performs to the level that provides us and you with the satisfaction of another Superbowl victory in 2013 in your honor.
"And dad that you also find your peaceful lake, accompanied by Uncle Bob and Kevin, enjoying in the laughter and your limitless catch."
"And that you look down upon us in peace, knowing that your success on this earth has been measured by the love you family shares."
"And from that regard, no one in this room could be considered richer."
"My friends, the information you are about to witness from all of my years of research is the most important."
Its been hidden in plain view the entire time.
This is the ultimate secret and its about to be exposed.
THE ULTlMATE SECRET EXPOSED.
FOOD.
"I have hundred of government document, text books, white papers where for over 80 years the Elite of the western world have talked about adulterating food and water to sicken and sterilize the population for the purpose of eugenics its all covered in the book "" Ecoscience "" written by the White house science czar John.P.Holdren."

"I'm looking at the prices here on Paltalk and Ghost, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you have the premium plan, which cost you $250 a month, or $249 a month."
"That means over four years Ghost spent over $12,000 giving us this time of his life and I didn't get a nap until today but that is a lot of money, man and we really appreciate you doing that for us."
"Well, yeah, $12,000 even for a rich man, that is not a small chunk of change."
That's not somethign you sneeze at.
"No, I really appreciate it man, thank you."
"Well, yeah, he can afford it, that's not the point."
It's still--
Ghost:
"Hey, this is what I""m talking about, man."
"Unappreciative, man."
You can give everything to everybody for free but they don't appreciate a goddamn thing.
"I mean, this is pretty much the synopsis of what people can get from this little Internet exercise here."
All right?
"I mean, this is much like the po' in America."
"You can give them a free house, a free car, a free job, free healthcare, free everything, but you know what?"
"They're still gonna bitch and they're still gonna be like,"
"""Yeah, man."""
GuitarNinja:
"It's a sad fact, but a lot of people are really unappreciative about everything."
"But, you know, I gotta agree with Mike Thomas, a lot of us here are very appreciative of everything you've done and the time, effort, and capital you have put into this."
"I mean, I was a bleeding heart liberal until about January of 2011,"
"I was like, had Occupy started earlier,"
I probably would've been in there and a big part of what kind of changed me into the
"I guess, call me a capitalist, you know, into the capitalist conservative, not conservative, but the kind of person I am now."
"A big part of it was listening to your show and getting the information from someone who wasn't you know, liberally slanting it and you knwo,"
"I definitely appreciate everything and don't ever think that the past couple years have been for no-- you know, there are those of us who are appreciative of it, but it is unfortunate there are a lot of people who aren't."
Never think that you wasted your time or money.
YOu have created a lot of capitalists out of this.
Ghost:
"I appreciate all the kind words in the chatroom, man but I don't see this as a --- you know, I feel bad for the people that really appreciated the show and appreciate what we were trying to do here that , you know, it's a little disappointing for them but it's good for me man, 'cause believe it or not man, my wife always told me taht this was a combination of it, man."
"Cassatt has so much in common with her impressionist colleagues and is really picking up on some of the most advanced problems that they were confronting in their art, an interest in artificial light, for example."
The informality of loose brushwork of an attempt to capture a moment in time.
These are all concerns that were important to her impressionist colleagues.
Steven:
One of the areas that I found most interesting is the place where her shoulders meet.
"The representation of her shoulders and the representation of the reflection of her shoulders, and all of that comes together just at the top of the upholstered chair that she sits on, and if you work out from that point, the arc of the balcony that we see reflected in the mirror becomes a reference to her vision, as she looks out at the audience, even as it looks back to her."

Wond'ring in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in you smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
And ever since that night
We've been together
"Lovers at first sight, in love forever"
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
[Instrumental]
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Or even just walking and taking for granted the walking that we do.
"I feel like, maybe it is contradictory  but I feel like bringing my work into my mindfulness practice actually invites me to do a lot of unlearning."
A lot of moving against the habit energy of how school functions.
"So I don't know if that is helpful, but I that's one of the things that I am finding out."
"One of my main motivations  for doing this is,"
I guess I feel like there is a lot  of things that are difficult about being a teacher.
There is a lot of things that  are difficult about working with students in terms of where they are.
I think one of the things that Thay shared in the very beginning of the retreat was about the mindfulness of suffering.
"And I know we all know somethings are complicated but I feel that there is a way to look into the students and to ask ourselves or to ask myself, what has really happened?"
"So, in California, or maybe other parts where you teach, things have gone to the point  where we are doing a lot of teaching work, but I am not really quite sure what is actually being received by the students."
"I feel here is a lot of busyness that teaching and learning can look like we are very busy working, giving this, doing that,computers are out, but what are actually students getting?"
What are we actually cultivating  in young people?
"I feel that is a hard question, but I think in my mind, but I feel that is a thing  that I've been asked to look at."
"To look at that,  so young people are only test scores."
"But that's the things that  the conversations at my school are, that's the kind of conversation that we are welded to."
"I feel the mindfulness practice gives me opportunity not to feel overwhelmed by that,  but to look at it very clearly, so that I can understand  how to respond."
I can understand how to respond.
For instance - this might be  a small example- one of my students was sometimes  hanging out at lunch.
One time he said:
"""Why do you always say Good afternoon to your fifth period class?"""
"I guess I didn't really think much of it,  I guess I just want to say that."
"He was saying, ""I don't ever hear that in my classrooms."""
"I guess I just feel like - to me that's  a moment for me to listen, to listen to what are the experiences that young people are having in the classrooms."
"Sometimes - once again, hopefully your  work environments are much more healthy-"
I think sometimes schools are very  transactional for young people.
"You do your part,  I do my part."
"Don't get into my business, I won't get in your business,"
"Time passes, turn something in, then bye-bye, bell rang."
(Laughter)
"So we are in this thing,  more like tennis, it rolls that way,  'doing the schooling thing'."
But what is really going on?
"What kind of young people  are we really preparing for the planet that we live in,  for the communities that they live in?"
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
"Oh, yeah"
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

"Hello, our final lecture on, Alzheimer's disease, is going to talk about animal models, and bio-markers, and therapeutic approaches, to Alzheimer's disease."
"Experimenters, in modern neuro science, have a series of, animal models, for"
Alzheimer's disease.
"Especially mice, especially mice that over produce, a p, p, amyloid, precursor protein."
And other mice that have mutations in pre-senilens.
Again especially with Alzheimer's disease associated mutations.
So there is some progress.
"And the, challenge, is to make, data from mice, relevant to those with people."
"Now, in general, what does one want to do, for Alzheimer's disease."
"Well, as for Parkinson's disease, which we'll discuss in the, next series, you would"
"like, to do two things, for Alzheimer's."
You would like to find a person with early stage Alzheimer's.
And stop that early stage Alzheimer's from progressing any further.
"But Berlioz trolled Paganini by wrote him a symphony  ""Harold in Italy"" instead of a concerto"
Paganini was so mad that he didn't play the  piece and not even attend the premiere.
The viola has missed the opportunity to rise again.
After many springs and winters until the 20th century in England has appeared our father of viola Tertis
He fully understand that the problem that the  viola doesn't have any good pieces he can counted as the first person who asked and  paid many composers to write songs for the viola
"Therefore, formally speaking, the viola starts it's development from the 20th century"
Talking about 20th century
It's hard to not mention Primrose
He is like the viola version of Paganini
He had already play all Paganini's Caprices with his viola
He started playing as violist before playing the viola but he then never touches the violin anymore
He had say something gold
I personally can't agree more with his words (and that's what I think)
"You are more then welcome to jealous us, violists."
The viola seemed like being ignored for ages but after watching this video now you know what viola is what difficulties it was facing
Viola has a fast development especially it has just started from the 20th century
"Like vegetables, they were just sides in many dishes now they are treat on their own like salad and more!"
Dear fellow violists
If there are people asking you what instrument do you play
"You shall say ""the viola"" very firmly"
Like a boss
If he then ask what's the differences between the violin and the viola? then you can act like a boss and say
"The viola has a nice sound, it is just  different from (or better then) the violin"
"Now, the 1st episode of the E-symphony has now come to an end"
"If you have additional info about viola or want to know  more about other musical knowledges (eg. instruments, composes, music genres)"

We are on problem number 10 on page 489.
Stacy noted that she is both the 12th tallest and the 12th shortest student in her class.
"I was teaching in Oakland, most recently, Oakland California, for the past three years at progressive school where the organization Mindful Schools started."
So I was in a really wonderful space  to be sharing the practice.
"And before that, I taught  at an international school in India where we had actually a group of educators that met weekly to share the practice."
"And in India I had this unique experience  of being an expat but obviously looking very Indian,  having an Indian name, and having Indian heritage but being the only teacher in the school that was of Indian heritage  but that was an American."
"And I had one student,  who was an adorable, sweet little boy."
I was running an academic program  and in the process of hiring an assistant.
"When I shared with this student  that I was hiring an assistant, this boy said, ""Is it going to be an Indian person?"""
"At that moment, I could just feel so much pain inside myself and really touching the face of having  felt discriminated against growing up and feeling like an outsider."
"Before the practice,  I probably would have said to him,"
"""That is unacceptable,  you can't say that""."
I would have reacted.
"But because of the practice,"
"I went to my breath,  I recognised what was coming up, and I was able to respond, not react."
"And asked him, ""Why would you not want to hire someone who's Indian?"
"Talk to me about that."""
I realized he didn't want to come to India but was there because of his father's job and he had difficulty  understanding the accents and it was nothing about me  being Indian.
"But here I am, immediately  going to that place."
I share that story because  it was really powerful moment for me where the practice made me realize... it helped me really develop compassion and understanding in myself  and not react.
Really look at my student  as another human being and not sort of teacher-student  relationship.
"I think sometimes mindfulness can be sold  like a gimmick, as stress reduction, increasing focus, increasing attention."
"But this path that we are on,  when you are practicing mindfulness it is about awakening,  it is about liberation, it is about dissolving those identities of teacher and student, really developing authentic relationship."
"At that moment, when I had  that interaction with this boy in my class"
I realized the power of the practice.
"When I share the practice with my students I do a lot of things with them, most recently teaching middle school,  I start every class by inviting the bell."
"Two things I can offer from what I learned with sharing the practice is to always frame it as an invitation, especially with young people."
I've never been dogmatic about it  but always frame it as an invitation.
Authenticity is so key.
"When you are being authentic, the kids are more up to really be present, to being engaged and be available."
"So, I'll start the class saying,"
"""Okay, our bodies are here  but where are our minds?"
"Our minds could still be at Math,  our minds could still be at lunch."
"Let's take a moment, invite the bell and come back to ourselves so we can be here."""
"As always, if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at washelp@ucop.edu"
"Hello, good day."
I don't want to pay.
These highways have already been paid for.
"If you get to a toll station and you say, ""I don't want to pay"" they have to let you pass."
"On May 1st, at 12 PM, get to a toll booth and say:"
#IDontWantToPay
- Not paying a toll is NOT a crime.
- Highway personelle do NOT have the right to ask for ID.
- A red or green toll booth light is NOT an official transit symbol.
- Holding you at the toll booth for not wanting to pay is illegal holding and you can report it to the police.
NO MORE TOLLS

Ulnar collateral ligament testing of the thumb is performed to evaluate for instability found on a gamekeeper's or skier's thumb.
"After stabilizing the first metacarpal, a valgus stress is applied to the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint."
Laxity indicates a partial or complete ulnar collateral ligament tear.
This is the cutter section of the panel.
The top button labeledÂ CutterÂ opens up the cutter dialog.
"This dialog lets you choose which cutter manufacturer you are using, and which model your cutter is."
"The lower button â gives information about the vinyl size of the cutter, if the machine and the communication method support it."
Here you can find the maximum vinyl-size.
"Consequently, in order to set a larger tile-size, you set a larger vinyl-size."
"My name is Marvin Meyer, I am the Chair of the Department of Religious studies and the Griset Professor of Religious Studies at Chapman University."
"I came to Chapman a long time ago, as a matter of fact, just over 25 years ago so it must have been then, 1985 that I came here as a younger assistant professor of Religious Studies."
"Well, I came here to Chapman because there was a job, and to be honest about it, sometimes it's difficult to find a job in this profession."
There aren't a lot of jobs available.
"And I've never been unemployed, I've always had a job, but there was a job here, but I also came to this particular job, I did have some other possibilities, but I came to this job because I knew something about Chapman."
"I had been on the campus before, I had known some of the professors here."
"In fact, my predecessor was a friend of mine and Fred Francis was his name."
"I came to visit him here, and then I also am a singer and I sang with Bill Hall in the William Hall Corral for a number of years we would rehearse upon occasion on the campus and so I came to campus to the music building and I thought it was a pretty nice campus and when there was an opening I decided to go for it and I went for it, and here I am."
"Well, when I came here back in the 1980s the entire campus of Chapman College at that time, it was smaller and it was quieter, and the department of religion, as it was called at that time, was a much smaller department."
"Hi guys, this is another video from LifeSlGNS."
"Just a quick one this time, erm it's May so May the Fourth be with you guys."
I hope your all well.
Erm this is just going to be a quick one saying that I am sure you are all aware that LifeSlGNS is a user led organisation.
And by that I mean that we rely solely on donations from you guys and we are extremely lucky to have such generous people who are willing to give us all these donations to help us carry on our work.
"And during this month we are going to thank every single person who donates £5 or more within the UK, sorry guys it can't be further."
"By sending them, one of our shiny new magnets."
Yeah!
"This is what they are, this is what they look like."
Little magnet.
"They've been designed by our Wedge, and they have the brand new images and motto on them."
So it's a little Lighthouse.
"To get your hands on them, basically you just have to donate £5 or more during May and when your donation is received we will email you within 24 hours of your request to get your postal address, which is only going to be used for sending you your gift and then it will be deleted, so we won't spam you to death."
"So if you can possibly spare a fiver this month please consider just donating five pounds to us, it will do a really good deed for us guys and really help us out."
So pretty please?
(laughs) And it will be a lovely decoration for your fridge so who wouldn't want this?
"That's it guys, thank you."
"And I hope you are all having a wonderful May, bye."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Secretary Salazar:
"Thank you very much, Neal Muholland, and thank you to all of the members of the National Parks"
Foundation for your outstanding work and for making this day possible.
Thank you for the work you do to protect America's natural heritage and its culture.
On behalf of the Department of the Interior and the National
"Parks Service and my colleagues on President Obama's cabinet, we are honored that you are all here with us tonight to celebrate this great American holiday tradition."
"Seventy years ago this month, just weeks after the bombing of"
"Pearl Harbor, in those dark days,"
President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined here together in the White House to light the national Christmas tree.
"During those dark days, President Roosevelt called on the nation to view the lighting of the tree as a reminder that we set our faith in human love and in God's care for us."
"Tonight let this tree remind us that in all times, the light of love and good will shines brightly across America and around the world."
"This occasion is also special for all of us, because we are gathered here in Presidents Park, one of the 397 national parks under the care of the service, and here we light our nation's spirit of peace, hope and joy for the holidays."
"Now on this remarkable night in these remarkable times, it is with great honor that I introduce someone who never rests, someone who never tires, someone who never quits, someone who is a champion for American peace and prosperity for all of its citizens, the 44th President of the the United"
"States of America, Barack Obama!"
"And how not only did I arrive to mindfulness but how certain passion  would develop my circumstances, to create some social impact and  bring mindfulness out into the world."
"In 1985, I was diagnosed with Lupus."
"For those who don't know what lupus is, it is an autoimmune deficiency disorder."
I can only say that  it is horrendous physical pain.
"Every aspect of who I was, was gone  like the water going down the drain."
I just didn't know who I was any longer.
"I had been working and living in Israel, I had very little family support."
"And coming from Toronto, Canada,"
"I had very little experience as if almost none, on living in a country of conflict, that was fragmented by war and violence."
"I was quite suspect that a lot  of the stress that came right of that, was really the catalyst  to my lupus."
"I couldn't get any western doctor to agree with that, that is besides the point."
"So, I was in tremendous pain  and it was very debilitating."
"And at the risk of getting dramatic,  had it not been a girlfriend who walked into my living room with this little white book by Thich Nhat Hanh, called 'Peace is Every Step',  I am not so sure I will be here today."
It changed my life.
"I went that summer to Toronto,"
"I bought another book  called 'The Miracle of Mindfulness', and it set me free."
"I came back to Israel because I was living there at that time, I had two children."
"And I went to my doctor and I said,  ""No more medicine,I think I have the key."""
"I started meditation, tai-chi,  a micro-biotic diet, and I practiced breathing,  breathing, breathing, staying centered in the present moment as  supposed to, resonating into my own story, my challenges, and so on and so forth."
Mindfulness really helped me  navigate the obstacles in my life.
"So, as time unfolded,  I started to feel better."
"And in fact, my greatest obstacle  became my greatest gift, how about that?"
"I am sure you all experience that,"
"I am sure my story is similar to many of your stories but it ended up that this obstacle,  this loop was the gift that allowed me to open up and bring mindfulness to others."
"So it wasn't that I wanted my experience to be heard by others but what I did want to do is to discover and explore what is the role and relationship of mindfulness,  not just in every day living and healing but in countries of conflict  where societies are fragmented, where the people are growing up  in conditions that are horrific."
And so I went to Rwanda and  did a mapping report.
I found out that actually these societies generally fragmented by war really want to build community and  what better to all than using mindfulness as a way to bring people back to the present moment.
"After being encouraged to bring  mindfulness into health-care in Rwanda and actually in Kigali and only  in a selected number of NGOs... just to give the proportion, one small step at a time..."
"After our workshops there,  we then went to Nigeria and to Uganda, and we found out that everywhere we went, what mindfulness was doing, was unlocking the human potential of people unable to look at their life as they are in the present moment, because they are so stuck and  horrified by their pasts."
"So when we were in Rwanda,  one of our teachers said,"
"""Why don't you do this for youth,  especially youth in Rwanda."""
"Because when they transition  at the high school, it is not like a lot of them go to higher education, as they do in Canada and the States and another developed countries."
"Hopefully, it won't die, but I'm going to aim for a grand slam, and we'll try."
"But one way or another, what I am going to do today is get across some of the ideas in a concrete way that I had been thinking I was going to approach in an abstract way and that just didn't get me excited this morning, so it's a little experiment for me."
"And what I'm going to do, my little experimental thing, is I'm actually going to be talking about citizenship and"
leadership and the American Revolution by focusing on Yale and New Haven.
This was my brilliant thought for the morning.
"Ah ha, I could focus right here."
"I could talk about us here now, and look at-- throughout the 1770s--some of the ways in which people were actually experiencing the Revolution, some of the ways in which the Revolution was getting them to take action, what it is they were doing, why they were doing it, who was doing it, who was taking action."
So again we're not just going to be looking at three elite guys in a room sort of writing proclamations but we're actually going to be talking about students and the people of New
Haven.
"So that's my experimental lecture for this morning and, as you're going to see, average New Haven residents took strong action at an early point in the growing conflict between the colonies and Great Britain."
"So really, in a main and a sort of major way what we're going to be looking at is their story today, the story of average people in New Haven."
Students are kind of above average because they would have been from more elevated families.
"We're going to be looking at students too, but we're going to be looking at a lot of what's happening just in the town of New Haven, which in a way is the best way to look at the Revolution, which is really how it's unfolding on the ground."
Plus this means I get to talk about the British invasion of
"New Haven, which--I've been waiting for my moment."
I've never actually talked about it in this class before.
"I discovered it when I was writing the introductory lecture and then having discovered it it was like: 'okay, well, now I have to find a way to talk about the invasion of"
New Haven.'
"So after I had my brilliant idea I realized ha,"
[laughs] this means I get to talk about the attack on New Haven in today's lecture-- so that will be there today too.
Okay.
So let's actually turn now to Yale and New Haven at the opening of the Revolution.
"And most of the lecture today is going to focus on the 1770s, but I will mention in starting that Yale students were certainly caught up in all of the fervor that I've been talking about in past lectures."
"And I know I mentioned once before that Yale students decided in protest at one point to give up importing fine wines,"
[laughs]--the sacrifice--on the part of Yale students.
"In the 1760s, Yale students,"
"like many other people throughout the colonies, were engaged in acts of sort of personal protest like that, giving something up."
Okay.
"Maybe on the part of Yale students it was just fine wines, but still-- Or on another occasion in 1769 in response to the Townshend Acts and then the idea of non-importation, the senior class of Yale came up with the following proclamation, which they made publicly:"
"""The Senior Class of Yale"
"College have unanimously agreed to make their Appearance at the next public Commencement, when they are to take their first Degree, wholly dressed in the"

"That's according to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe CEO Jim Ryan, who tells Gamereactor that more games would be unveiled at Gamescom in August.\par \par He explains:"
"""At the event in New York on"
"February 20 of this year, we showed a lot of software."
We showed a lot of first-party software.

"The first-party exclusives we know of at the moment for the PS4 are DriveClub, Knack, Killzone:"

Then I found a little bit more about him and I felt a little
less sorry for him because he took action.
"Apparently, he was from New Haven, this particular Loyalist student, so learning that he had been ostracized by all of the Yale student body, he went home and got some of his townie friends to go back to"
Yale and beat up some Yale students [laughter]-- which they did.
"And then the Yale students got really mad at this apparently, and armed themselves with clubs and were going to go attack these townies when the Yale president,"
"Naphtali Daggett, intervened."
"It was like: 'okay, we're done with the war now'--[laughter] like, 'nice idea, done with the war.'"
"So the fighting stopped and eventually--I don't know when--the Loyalist withdrew from Yale--so, you can't blame him at this point."
Okay.
So we have people in New Haven forming military units and marching off to fight.
We have students ostracizing that one lone Loyalist student.
"Not long after this, Yale students organized their own military company and actually began training, and not long after that the New Haven town meeting voted, and here's what they declared:"
"Quote,"
"""That the Governor be desired to permit one hundred stands of arms to be lodged in the library for the use of a company in Yale College ..."
"That should a company in college be formed and accoutred, they draw half a pound of powder to each man."""
Okay.
Yale students have just started militarily drilling and the New
"Haven town meeting has voted to store arms in the Yale library; in case the students actually get it together and form an organized unit, they'll have arms stored in the"
Yale library ready in case fighting has to happen.
Which again is a really dramatic kind of a decision to make.
"It's stated in a very plain way in the document that I found, but that's a dramatic kind of a decision."
"So again, you can see even just in that example how some of these really general ideas I've been talking about over the course of many, many lectures--building resentments, shared fears, continued loyalty to the King-- are playing out here on a small scale in New Haven in real life."
"Now the Yale military unit apparently had its main moment of glory that same year in 1775, when George Washington, who was now the newly named Commander-in-Chief of the"
"Continental Army, actually passed through New"
Haven on his way to join the Continental Army outside of
Boston.
And I'll be talking about George Washington in the next
lecture so I'm feeling very fancy once again that I have magically somehow seemed as though this lecture was really planned all along.
"But apparently, Connecticut newspapers noted that people from New Haven went out; they wanted to see Washington; they wanted to see what was going on; they wanted to watch the Yale students do a drill, which they did apparently--a formal drill in front of Washington and his escort."
"Noah Webster, dictionary Webster, was a Yale freshman that year, and in later years he told people that he remembered that event; he remembered Washington watching the drilling students; he remembered that the body of the--the military body of students, escorted Washington out of town."
And Webster said that he himself played some kind of music to accompany the marching of the Yale students with
Washington out of town-- but he remembered that a long time later as sort of a memorable moment from the war.

Unless you're faced with a disability you don't think about the needs of people with disabilities.
People are not scroungers who are on disability especially people with MS.
"I would prefer to be earning a living wage, rather than on disability but unfortunately"
I've got MS and there's nothing I can do about it.
Hello I'm Danni
I'm the Senior Public Affairs Officer at the MS Society and we're here today to hand in a letter to the Minister for Disabled People regarding our concerns about Personal Independence Payment.
"46,000 people with MS will be shifted from Disability Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payment and at the moment the government are getting that wrong, the criteria they're using are too narrow, so too many people with MS will lose out if we can't get the government to change the criteria."
"We've had over 4,000 signatures, 96% of all MPs have seen our letter and over 25 MPs have signed the letter."
"There's a few of us here today, representing the 4,000 people."
It's a chance for us to be heard.
We feel so strongly about it; we've got to make a stand.
There's one particular issue where I and the MS Society have a real problem;
"If you can't walk in a safely, timely or regular manner above 20 metres then you should get the higher rate mobility ."
Currently that's only a guideline; that's not good enough.
Well I'm concerned about losing my freedom because I've got a Motability vehicle which is at risk.
"What I'm lobbying the government, very, very strongly with -"
- with the MS Society - is to move that to a regulation.
"If it's a regulation; the assessors have to follow it and that will mean our anxiety, our real anxiety, that many people with MS would lose higher rate of mobility, which would mean they lose their Motability car will not be an issue."
"If I lose the DLA; I lose my car, and then I lose my independence."
No car; I'm pretty much stuck in the house.
"But I think he--Oh, and also I should say they stole his shoes, his knee buckles, his pocket handkerchief, and a little, old tobacco box, so they also just stripped him of whatever he had, but he actually I think was kind of badly hurt and he's sick for a while."
"And then a couple years later he died, and people later said that maybe he died because of injuries sustained at that moment after the crazy charge of one guy, the noble professor going off to fight the British."
Okay.
So troops entered New Haven proper a little after noon after one last skirmish where Whaley and Dixwell meet.
This was the last little skirmish and then the British entered.
They entered New Haven and immediately began to plunder
"Loyalist and Rebel houses alike, breaking windows and doors, carrying off valuables."
"As Stiles described it, ""Plunder,"
"Rape, Murder, Bayoneting, Indelicacies toward the Sex""-- okay, women were not being treated respectfully -- ""Insolence and Abuse and"
"Insult toward the Inhabitants in general."""
"One woman later recalled that a British soldier in town cut off her necklace to keep, and stole her shoe buckles."
"Someone who lived on State Street said he was sitting in his door on State Street as the British came, and he saw a British officer come riding down Elm Street and turn up State Street towards Grove, and then he saw someone he knew from East Haven ride over, holding a musket which he leveled and fired at the British officer, who fell off his horse and sort of crawled into someone's garden at which point the East Haven guy grabbed the officer's horse and rode away."
'So [laughter]
I shot me someone from the
"British Army, and I got a horse too.'"
Some people fled town.
"One man who was stuck in town with his wife because she was too ill to run, saw British officers enter town and apparently went up to one and asked for protection and the officer asked, 'Are you a friend to King"
"George?,' and the man said, 'I am,'--so his house was not attacked, but apparently he was not a friend to King George, he was not a Tory, so for there, after in the town he was someone who was highly unpopular because he had--"
I suppose in a sense--sold himself out to protect his house; again a sort of decision of the moment that makes sense but that then had implications.
Some New Haven Loyalists actually fled with the British
"Army, which as they left, actually, they left a lot of destruction in their wake."
Okay.
So what have we seen today?
"We've definitely seen how ideas and events happening in places pretty far removed from New Haven are distilling their way down, right here--Yale College,"
"New Haven, Connecticut--and really driving people to take action, sometimes pretty dramatic action."
"We've seen average citizens, average people from New Haven, stirred to act: merchants, lawyers, sailors, shoemakers, students."
"We've seen how the coming of war revealed all kinds of divisions among local people, as well as unity, because people did have to make choices of all kinds."
"So basically, we've seen in this one little real-life example how the coming of the Revolution and then the carrying out of the Revolution drove average people to become politically active and also militarily active, to think through their options, to decide what they really believed, and then in many cases to take a stand."
"So Professor Daggett--The student says,"
"'We know he'd been thinking about it and he had been thinking about what he wanted to do and he had decided that if pushed, he would fight.'"
"The student is kind of surprised he's actually heading out with a gun, but again--the student knows that Daggett was thinking through what his actions were going to be, and then he watches him take action, like the Loyalists who left New"
Haven with the British; again a really dramatic action.
"The title of the album comes from the phrase ""I lost my heart. I buried it too deep under the iron sea,"" of the eighth (8th) song, ""Crystal Ball""."
"In its first week sold 222,297 copies. It was #1 in UK and #4 in US."

William Bradford (Mayflower passenger)
"William Bradford (15901657) was a passenger on the ""Mayflower"" in 1620. He travelled to the New World to live in religious freedom. He became the second Governor of Plymouth Colony and served for over 30 years. Bradford kept a journal of the history of the early life in Plymouth Colony. It is called ""Of Plymouth Plantation""."
Childhood.
"Bradford was born to William and Alice Bradford in Austerfield, Yorkshire, England. His family were farmers. The Bradford family owned a large farm and were considered rich."
"Bradford's father died was he was one year old. When he was four years old he was sent to live with his grandfather. Two years later, his grandfather died and he returned to live with his mother and stepfather. A year later, in 1597, his mother died. Bradford became an orphan at age 7. He was sent to live with two uncles."
His uncles wanted Bradford to help on the farm but Bradford was ill and was not able to work. Bradford started to read many books. One of the books was the Bible. This may be where he started learning of a religion that was different from the church of England.
When Bradford was 12 years old he went with a friend to hear the pastor Richard Clyfton. Clyfton was a minister who did not believe in the Church of England. Bradford believed in Clyfton’s words. His uncles told him not to go to that church but he went anyway.
During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.

Black-legged dart frog
"The black-legged dart frog (""Phyllobates bicolor""), also known as the bicolored dart frog or Neari in Choco, is the second most toxic of the wild poison dart frogs. It lives in Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 1500 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
"The adult male frog is 32.1-39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.7-42.7 mm. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Young frogs have stripes on their sides. In some groups of this frog, the stripes go away when the frog is an adult. In other places, the adult frogs keep their stripes."
Poison.
Human beings who live where the frog lives have used the frog to poison arrows. The human can touch the arrow to the frog's back without killing it. Or the human can kill and heat the frog's body.
The poison in the frog's skin is a chemical called batrachotoxin. The frog gets the poison from the ants and other insects that it eats. So frogs kept as pets do not have poison.
Threats.
There are fewer of these frogs than there were. Scientisis think this could be because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans turn the forests into forms and take the trees for lumber. Human beings also catch these frogs to sell as pets.
Junglefowl
"Junglefowl are the four living species of bird from the genus Gallus in the pheasant family. They occur in India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia."

"One of the species in this genus, the Red Junglefowl, is of historical importance as the likely ancestor of the domesticated chicken."
Red junglefowl
"The red junglefowl (""Gallus gallus"") is a tropical member of the family Phasianidae. They are the ancestors of all our domestic chickens. They were first domesticated in Asia, where they are native. Some of the less specialized domestics, such as the brown leghorns, keep color patterns similar to that of their wild ancestors.

Ring species.
"The ""Ensatina"" salamander is a ring species in the mountains around the Californian Central Valley. The complex forms a horseshoe shape around the mountains.

It is named after the French folk hero Louis Mandrin.
Location.

"In 2013, a fence was built on the space in front of the case. In 2016, video surveillance was installed."
History.
"When he found traces Bronze Age settlements there in 1960, Gaston Etienne (1923-2010) recognized that the case was important for archaeology. Etienne was a councillor in Malaverne. Since 1993, there have been excavations each year. Since 2006, Ludovic Slimak - a research associate from the University of Toulouse and the CNRS is overseeing these excavations. There are twelve cultural layers at the site, In 2014, seven layers had been excavated. The layers date from 42.000 BP (called early Aurigacien) to 56,000 BP (La Quina-Mousterian)."
"The oldest known evidence that anatomically-modern humans (homo sapiens) were present in Europe was found in the Batcho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria; this evidence is 45,820 to 43,650 years (Cal BP) old. In February 2022, it was announced that part of a tooth was found at the Mandrin Cave. It came from a layer of the Mandrin Cave under and over which Neanderthal remains have been recovered, but this ""baby tooth"" has been attributed to a child of Homo sapiens. Articles in the Journals Science, as well as in Nature, said that the tooth was too badly damaged to be able to tell with certainty if it was from a Neanderthal, or a human."
Superabundant number
A superabundant number is a type of natural number. They were defined by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős in 1944.
Definition.
"Any natural number ""n"" is called superabundant when a certain equation is true."
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
"An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. (""σ""(""m""))/""m"" is 16/9. (""σ""(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number"
"The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... ."

Fixed-gear bicycle
"A fixed-gear bicycle (also called a ""fixie"") is a bicycle that has no freewheel mechanism (allowing pedals to stay still while moving)."
It is a dangerous bike to use in towns. This type of bicycle is becoming more and more popular around the world.
"Fixed-gear bicycles are very light. They are built without any unnecessary gadgets, such as chain rings or freewheel hub. When a person rides a fixed-gear bicycle, he/she/they need not put a lot of energy into it as with a geared bike."
"Most bicycles have a freewheel so the pedals will stay stationary while the bicycle is moving and so that the rider can ride without pedaling going forward or down a hill. Fixed-gear bicycles have even simpler mechanisms with pedals fixed to the back wheel. That means that the rider cannot stop pedaling. When the rear wheel turns, the pedals turn in the same direction. This allows a cyclist to use a brake by putting a pressure in opposite directions to pedals, so that the mechanism will not rotate."
"It also makes it possible to ride backwards, although learning to do so is much more difficult than riding forwards."

Pollinator
"A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the ""pollenizer""."
"To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use."
"Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads."
"Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments."
"The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents."
"Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species."
"Area code 308 is an area code for Nebraska. It was created as a split to area code 402 in 1954. It covers the western portion of the state, while 308 covers the eastern portion. As of now, it is projected to not exhaust until at least 2050."

Antiphon (music)
"In Christian liturgy, an antiphon is the name of a short section, between the cleric, and usually the crowd. These sections are either spoken (the priest asks something, and the crowd gives a predefined answer, also spoken), or they are sung. When they are sung, the often use simple melodies. Antiphons are very old: In the 4th century they were used in what is called Ambrosian chant today. In liturgy, antiphons are not used on their own: the priest or person of the clergy says or chants these, while performing a ritual. In many pieces of church music, the choir (who replaces the crowd) starts singing as a response to an antiphon."
"In more modern forms of church music (such as Gospels, but also traditional African music), there's a tradition of call and response. A lead singer calls something, and the choir responds."

He wrote 39 plays (with about half of them considered comedies) and two long poems in his lifetime. He lived in Stratford-upon-Avon, in Warwickshire, England. His plays are still performed today. He is often quoted in modern writing."
"Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613. His plays are among the best known in English literature and are studied in schools around the world. Along with writing, Shakespeare also acted in The Chamberlain's Men acting company, starting in 1594."
"Shakespeare wrote plays of different kinds, or genres. There are histories, tragedies and comedies. Shakespeare was the first person ever to write a tragicomedy. (A tragicomedy is a play that mixes comedy and tragedy, with a happy ending.)"
"Shakespeare's plays are written in poetic language. Many of the plays are set in strange, distant places and times. The stories are often exciting, very funny (in the comedies), or very sad (in the tragedies). These stories make people want to know what will happen to the characters. The plays talk about things that are still important today, like love, sadness, hope, pride, hatred, jealousy, and foolishness."
"Shakespeare added new words and phrases to the English language. He created over 1,700 English words. He also made some words more popular."

Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford. Latin was popular in grammar schools during the Elizabethan era, so Shakespeare learned Latin very intensively."

They had three children: Susanna (who married John Hall); Hamnet (who died at the age of 11 from unknown causes); and Judith (who married Thomas Quiney). By 1592, Shakespeare had become an actor and was becoming well known as a writer of plays."
"Miller formed a large marching band. He tried to modernize military music. Some officers didn't like it, but he continued because other leaders supported him.

In the summer of 1944, he took it to England, where he gave 800 performances and recorded a series of records.

"""America means freedom and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music."""

"The Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller ""ghost band"" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It was similar to the Army Air Force Band because it had a large string section. At first called the ""Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke"", it later became ""The Tex Beneke Orchestra""."
"A film about Miller's life, ""The Glenn Miller Story"", was released in 1953. Because of this, the Miller estate asked Ray McKinley to lead a new ghost band in 1956. This band still tours the United States."

The Ghan
"The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs."
The name.
"The train's name is a short version of its nickname ""The Afghan Express"". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior."
"Another view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage."

Thrace
"Thrace (: ""Thráke""; ; ""Trakiya"", ) is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe. It was bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey. The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people. They lived in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe."
Ancient history.
The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians. They were divided into many tribal groups. Thracian troops were known to be used in the Persian army. Many of them went with neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which is next to Thrace) during his invasion of the Persian Empire.
"The Thracians were divided into separate tribes. They did not form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition. The tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity."
"Thrace was conquered by Alexander. It later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 AD, in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of conflict and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence."
"The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and ""Thrace"" and ""Thracians"" are simply the names given them by the Greeks."

Studies continue at the site; the monumental buildings and long tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was important.
Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. They imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that let the city take part in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador.
"Takalik Abaj was a large city with the main buildings in four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural, others were man-made, needing a lot of work and materials. The site had a clever water drainage system and many stone sculptures."

Fight against the chase of witches.
Praetorius fought against torture and against the hunting of witches. Some women were accused of being witches. People thought that witches can do harm to others. So these women were arrested and put in prison.
In 1597 Anton Praetorius protested against the torture of women accused of witchcraft.
Praetorius was so shocked about the torture of the accused woman that he demanded a stop. His protest was successful.
"In 1598 he wrote a book to protest against torture and the prosecution of witches. The book was published again in 1602, 1613 and in 1629. Praetorius described the terrible situation of the prisoners and protested against torture."
Theological argument against witchcraft.
"Praetorius was a Protestant minister. He believed that man can do either good or bad things. However, God chooses certain people to do certain things. Those things can be good or bad. According to Praetorius, witchcraft can only be a fall from the favour of God, and a pact with the devil. But, neither the devil nor sorcerers can do more than is in their nature (and predestination). God will punish those who are witches or sorcerers. This however, does not give human courts a right to put those to death, they believe are guilty of the crime of witchcraft. For Praetorius, witchcraft cannot exist, because it is beyond the faculties of either man or the devil. It is also against Nature."

Ossicles
The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body. They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles. They are in the auditory system of all mammals.
They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness.
Anatomy.
"The ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The terms mean hammer, anvil, and stirrup."
Development.
"Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified (turned into bone) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the quadrate, prearticular, articular, and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates."

"Several years later, Byerley has been elected World Coordinator. He discovers that The Machines, very powerful robots that are supposed to help humans to live in peace on Earth, have taken over the control of the planet and the reason that they did that is because the Three Laws of Robotics don’t let them allow humans to get hurt and they Machines realized that they were better at keeping people safe than people are."

"East Coast was a government-owned British train operating company. It ran high-speed passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line between London, Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, being forced to take over after National Express East Coast defaulted on their franchise. It started operations on 14 November 2009. It ended operations on 28 February 2015. They had 45 locomotives and served 53 stations whilst operating 12 of them. The franchise was re-let to Virgin Trains East Coast, ending the period of government ownership, despite contributing a lot of money to the Treasury and calls for the government to retain the franchise."
Profitability.
"East Coast paid back over £1 billion to the government over the course of its franchise, more than twice as much as rival Virgin Trains did in the same time period on the West Coast Main Line. However, it used relatively old trains and therefore had much lower leasing costs, as in 2012/13 Virgin paid £302 million for its fleet of trains, while East Coast paid £53 million."
"East Coast’s successor, Virgin Trains East Coast pays much more money back to the government than East Coast did: £3.3 billion over 8 years, compared to East Coast’s £1 billion."

Schulze method
"The Schulze method is a way of voting that is used to fill a single vacant position in an election. It was developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze. It is also known as Schwartz Sequential Dropping (SSD), Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping (CSSD), Beatpath Method, Beatpath Winner, Path Voting, and Path Winner. It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, BerryTube, and the KDE."
How it works.
"Voters rank the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much the voters want the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst)."
"Next, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted."
"More calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength ""t"" if ""t"" voters prefer A to B, ""t"" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and ""t"" voters prefer J to K. The winner W is the candidate which beats any other candidate X with strength ""t"", but X does not beat W with strength ""t""."

After a bit of conversation, the group of friends moves into John Oldman’s house. John’s friends keep asking why he decided to “run off” so quickly. John Oldman does not answer clearly at first, but gradually becomes drawn to telling his friends what is really on his mind. He begins to tell his friends about who he really is, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon caveman who has survived until the present. His friends aren’t convinced, but rather constantly question John Oldman in order to prove him wrong. The talk goes on as John Oldman’s friends try to prove him wrong, in biological, historical, and religious terms."

"The history of the British Empire has added to the spread of English. English is an important language in many places today. In Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States, among others (like those in the Commonwealth of Nations), English is the main language. Because the United Kingdom (the country where England is) and the United States have historically been powerful in commerce and government, many people find it helpful to learn English to communicate in science, business, and diplomacy. This is called learning English as an additional language, English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL)."
"English literature has many famous stories and plays. William Shakespeare was a famous English writer of poems and plays. His English is Early Modern English, and not quite like what people speak or write today. Early Modern English sounded different, partly because the language was beginning a ""great vowel shift"". Later, many short stories and novels also used English. The novel as we know it is first seen in 18th century English. Therefore, today, many famous songs and movies (cinema films) use the English language."

Adjectives.
"Adjectives are words that describe a noun. In English they always come before a noun to give you more information about that noun. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Spelling.
"Written English uses a range of historical spelling patterns that changed over time due to political and cultural changes. As a result, different words can use the same letters and combinations for very different sounds. For example, ""-ough"" was once a guttural but has become different in ""through"" (threw), ""rough"" (ruff), ""dough"" (doe) or ""cough"" (coff)."
Many English-speaking countries spell words differently. Some words that are spelled one way in the United Kingdom and many other countries in the British Commonwealth are spelled differently in the United States.

Black operation
"A black operation (black op for short) is a covert operation which is done by a government or military. Black operations are secret and whoever does them does not admit that they ever happened.

It is known that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, Mossad, MI6 and other intelligence services have done operations like these."

Hoverfly
"Hoverflies, sometimes called 'flower flies' or 'syrphid flies', are the insect family Syrphidae. Hoverflies mimic wasp stripes, and are usually smaller than wasps. Thus to a bird they may look scarcely worth eating, and dangerous."
"As their common name suggests, they are often seen hovering or sucking nectar at flowers. The adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen, while the larvae (maggots) eat a wide range of foods."
"In some species, the larvae are saprotrophs, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects."
"Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year. Hoverflies are important natural enemies of these pests, and can be used in biological control. Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators. Some orchids mimic aphid alarm scent (pheromones), which attracts hoverflies. The hoverflies then pollinate the orchids."
"About 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continent except Antarctica."
"Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of the black and yellow stripes of wasps. They are a classic example of Batesian mimicry. The Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing: it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. Hover flies look roughly like little wasps, and their warning colouration is well-known to birds."
"Unlike adults, the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods. Predatory species benefit farmers and gardeners, because aphids destroy crops. Hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control."
Atomkraft
"Atomkraft are an English heavy metal band who were part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. They formed in 1979 and disbanded 1988.

Co-factor
Ice candle is a kind of candle made from water. It is fantastical and looks like a lamp-shade. It has been made in cold areas in winter. It melts in a few days so we can enjoy it for a moment.
History.
"The Ice candle was first made in Shimokawa, Hokkaido. In Shimokawa, there are few days in a year when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees below freezing. So this town is known as extreme cold. The members of “Egg of Columbus”, which is a Town Development Idea Semester in Shimokawa, had thought about some ideas on how people enjoy a cold winter with snow. In 1985, they found a sentence, “...the flame moves in the ice block, it changes to the natural lamp-shade quickly, the flame in the natural and pale clear glass lights up in the garden fantastically...” This is from “Live in north literary calendar, Northern area column (Kita no kurashi saiziki, Hoppo-ken column)” written by Ryuichi Ito who was a professor of Hokkaido university of education. He wrote about the candle which is made by Scandinavian Finland children. The Egg of Columbus got some hints to create the Ice candle from that sentence. In 1986, the Ice candle was created. They put a wish for people to be able to spend winter happily in it. In 1987, the Ice candle was introduced on TV. From around that time, townspeople have made it at their own home. Now, the Ice candle is known by Japanese nationwide and loved by people living in cold areas."
How to make.
"To make the Ice candle, you need a bucket, water and a cold environment to freeze water."
"At night the temperature is under -16 degrees, put water into the bucket, then get it outside and through the night. Next morning, turn it upside down and take out the ice if the water has almost frozen. Flow outside the water which couldn’t freeze. Put a candle into the hole of the ice. Not to break it, treat it carefully."
"We can make it with our own original ideas. For example, the colors and the shapes. If you want to color it, you can use a food coloring or paints. If you want to make it differently, you can use a milk carton or a balloon instead of a bucket."
Ice candle festival.
"The Ice Candle Festival is one of the festivals which is held in winter. In this festival, the venue is illuminated by many Ice candles. The place of origin is also Shimokawa in Hokkaido. Two years later after the Ice candle appeared, the name of Shimokawa Winter Festival, which was already there, was changed to Ice Candle Festival. In this festival, the Ice candle was put not only at the venue but also at each house in the town. In total, about 7000 Ice candles were put in the town. In addition, people who go to the festival enjoy eating food outside while seeing the Ice candles. Now, the Ice Candle Festival is held in various places in Japan. Lake-Yamanakako Ice Candle Festival in Yamanashi prefecture and Mt. Nobeyama Plateau Ice Candle Festival in Nagano prefecture are also famous festivals."

Analysis.
"This animation was created for children, but a wide age of people pay attention to it because of Twitter. The reason for increasing popularity is in every episode. Every story is not only cute, but also deep. The view of the world is pop, but people appear to have an ugly attitude. Also it has a parody of a movie. For example, Back to the future.

Webster-Hayne debate
"The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's ""Second Reply to Hayne"" (1830) was widely seen as ""the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."""
"Webster described the US government as ""made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people"". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" in his Gettysburg Address."
Point Hicks
"Point Hicks, once called Cape Everard, is a coastal headland on the east coast of Victoria, Australia. It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park."
Name.
"Point Hicks is where, on 19 April 1770, the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cook's ""Endeavour"" voyage. Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an ""e"", Cook wrote both ""Hicks"" and ""Hickes"" in different places. The spelling ""Hicks"" is now in use for the point."
"When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse."
"The point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the ""Beagle"" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name."
"The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands."
The name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.
"Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, i.e. not adjusted for the International Date Line)."
Lighthouse.
"A lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level."
Hobo spider
"A Hobo Spider is a spider like funnel-web spiders. Their bite is very bad and could send you to the hospital. It can be found in North America, Europe and Central Asia."
Fethullah Gülen
"Muhammed Fethullah Gülen (born 27 April 1941), better known as Fethullah Gülen, is a Turkish preacher, author, educator and Muslim scholar. He lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania (USA)."
"Gülen teaches a moderate version of Sunni / Hanafi Islam, deriving from that of Said Nursi's teachings and modernizing them. Gülen condemns terrorism, supports communication between people of different religions, and has initiated such dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organisations. Until 2013 he was an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who later blamed him for the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. He operates a worldwide organisation called the Gülen Movement also known as FETÖ."
Teachings.
"Fethullah Gülen's attitude towards hijab has changed over time. In the past, Gülen, who regarded the unwinding of even a strand of women's hair as a great sin, suggested that women should cover their whole body by using veils and gloves. In his last speeches, Gülen evaluated the headscarf as a füruat (minor details)."
"For Fethullah Gülen, to allow views opposed to belief in creation is a devastating delusion and evolution, a Darwin fallacy."
"According to Gülene, the creation of Adam as the first human and Eve from Adam's file bone are miracle creations that should not be addressed in the context of cause-effect relationship."

Akiba Rubinstein
"Akiba Rubinstein (Stawiski, Poland, 12 December 1882 – 15 March 1961, Antwerp, Belgium) was a Polish chess Grandmaster in the first part of the 20th century. Around 1910 he was one of the three best players in the world.p346"
Biography.
"Rubinstein was Jewish, and his family planned for him to become a rabbi. However, he did not finish his studies, and chose to devote himself to chess entirely. The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev. He learned to play chess when he was 16,&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford Companion to Chess"". Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź."
"Rubinstein's best period was from 1907 to 1912. It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907, and a shared win at St. Petersburg in the same year. It closed in a string of wins in 1912. He won five consecutive major tournaments that year: San Sebastian, Piešťany, Breslau (the German championship), Warsaw and Vilnius (although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca).p79 Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from ""Chessmetrics"" support this conclusion, placing him as world #1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914. Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker, and was eclipsed by José Raúl Capablanca after 1911."
"Rubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship: he was unable to raise enough money to meet Lasker's financial demands. In the 1909 St. Petersburg tournament, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor result at St. Petersburg tournament 1914, not reaching the final pool of five players. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I."
"After the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster, but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency. Nevertheless, he won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws. A year later he won an Olympic silver."
Mental health.
"After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play, mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life. He suffered from a fear of people and society. He lived then in a sanitorium, and later rejoined his family."
"Rubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards. He left behind no literary works (perhaps because of his mental problems), but a great heritage in his games. During World War II he was placed in an asylum. One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps, he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt."
Chess heritage.
"He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground. Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames."
"He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (Rubinstein - Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation, which stems from the Slav defence."
"Today, he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian defence."
"The Rubinstein Trap, a trap in the Queen's Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice. One version of the trap runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead."
"The Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honor has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdroj, with a glittering list of top-flight winners."

He was the leading portrait photographer in the Andean city of Cusco. Chambi also took many landscape photographs, and he sold these photographs as postcards. He was one of the first to use the postcard format in Peru."
"In 1979, MOMA in New York had a Chambi exhibition. The exhibition later moved to various locations. It inspired other international exhibitions of his work."

Panam Ningthou
"Panam Ningthou () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the protector of crops, especially paddy from hailstorm and thunder. According to legends, He ignited fire for the first time by rubbing flints. He is one of the Umang Lai deities."
History.
"God Panam Ningthou has his major cult center in Andro village. The Andro village in Imphal East district of present day Manipur is an ancient village. People of this village worship fire that is kept burning from the time of Poireiton Khunthokpa (34 BC-18 BC). The fire is kept in the Chakpa Panam Ningthou Meihoupirol (lit. ""Panam Ningthou sacred burning fireplace"")."
"According to R. Constantine, the fire burning in Andro is the oldest man-made fire in India. It has been burning without break for centuries."
Description.
"According to Thomas Callan Hodson (T.C. Hodson), Panam Ningthou is a rain and weather God of the Meitei people of Manipur. He recorded his description in his monograph The Meitheis published in 1908."
Mythology.
"When it was one or two days before the Lai Haraoba festival of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou begins, the God came to his temple in the form of a ball of light. He came flying from the east. He landed at a part of the Nongmaiching Hill. Sometimes, some people of Andro claimed to see that ball of light, even at other times of the year."
"God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou has a wife named Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi. Some people believed that she might be of Burmese origin. So, the God went to Burma () to meet her from time to time."
Festival and worship.
God Panam Ningthou is mainly worshipped by the people of Loi caste of Meitei ethnicity in Manipur. He has his major cult center in Andro village of Imphal East district of Manipur.
"Shakespeare noted that the Loi people regarded God Panam Ningthou as a special deity of the Meitei king. He further noted that the King himself provided sacrificial animals to the God. Buffalo was one among the sacrificial animals used to be sacrificed during the Lai Haraoba festival. Pigs were sacrificed when there was no Lai Haraoba festival. Whenever there was any suspicion of danger to the Meitei king, the King would send a pig and a cock to be sacrificed to God Panam Ningthou of Andro."
"The Chakpa Haraoba (one of the 4 types of Lai Haraoba festival) is annually celebrated in honor of God Panam Ningthou. The festive occasion falls in the Meitei lunar month of Lamta (""March-April interface month""). The festival starts from the first Sunday of the ""Lamta"" month."
"During the 9 day long festival, no outsiders of Andro are allowed to stay at the village. In modern times, notice is issued one month before the festival begins through mass media like television, newspaper and radio. The notice informs outsiders to leave the place as it is about to begin the festival. Natives of Andro may come to Andro before the festival starts. Once the festival begins, no one is allowed to either leave from or come to the village. People who have converted into another religion are not allowed to participate in the religious festival even if they are native of Andro. There are some Christian converts and Hindu converts in Andro."
"During the festival, people of ""Andro village"" wear black clothes as a custom. Besides Panam Ningthou, there are twelve other deities worshipped in Andro. During the Lai Haraoba festivals of these deities, outsiders of Andro can witness the event. The festivals in their honor are done separately from that of Panam Ningthou. But the festival of Pureiromba can be done together with that of Panam Ningthou. At this too, outsiders can witness the event but the place of worship is different from the exclusive one of Panam Ningthou."
"During the Haraoba of Panam Ningthou, there is no shortage of meat and wine. Boys and girls play important role in the festival."
Temple.
"The Temple of Panam Ningthou is in Andro, Manipur. It is also the Loishang (English: Office) to the representatives of the ""pana""s (English: State Divisions). Sacred items are kept inside the temple. One house each for two ""Pana""s was constructed near the Loishang. Two dormitories for boys and girls are also built."
The sanctum of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou and Goddess Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi are located in the right side corner and the left side corner respectively as one enters the room.
Association with other gods.
"According to the Thalon text, Panam Ningthou was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill. The cults of these five gods were integrated into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the aliases or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people evolved into a chiefdom. This chiefdom later rose to the Angom clan."
Namesake.
Panam Ningthou Semba.
"There is a real servant class named ""Panam Ningthou Semba"". It takes care of the articles (things) related to polo () for the Meitei royalty. There are seven grades of officers in this group.

When the flag came, the group found out that the coat of arms on the flag was in full color instead of white, and the manufacturer had added a gold ring around the shield. Rather than have the flag remade, the Utah legislature changed the law to match the battleship flag, and the flag was showed off to the USS Utah."

2 Girls 1 Cup
"2 Girls 1 Cup is the title of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a scat-pornographic viral video produced by MFX Media. The trailer features two women defecating into a cup, taking turns eating feces, and vomiting into each other's mouths. ""Lovers Theme"" from Hervé Roy's Romantic Themes album released by Tele Music in 1992 plays throughout the video."
"This one-minute video is a viral video that became a well-known Internet meme among bloggers and message boards for its viewers reaction to the content. Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos that show others' reactions to watching the video for the first time."
Origin.
"The video came from a Brazilian, Marco Fiorito, who talks of himself as a ""compulsive fetishist"". Fiorito first produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia. The movie was made by MFX-Video, one of several businesses owned by Fiorito. Fiorito says his movies are legal in Brazil, but authorities in the United States have branded some of his movies as dirty and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company shipping Fiorito's movies in the United States. Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 3 years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $98,000. Fiorito said he did not know his movies were illegal in the United States and that his movies often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat movies but not actually eat fecal matter."
"The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text ""MFX 1209"" (the product code for ""Hungry Bitches"") and the URL mfxvideos.com. The website is Fiorito's MFX-Video. This causes some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process."
Reactions.
"2 Girls 1 Cup's spread because of the reactions it causes. Hundreds of videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video to their friends and recording their reactions. Even Joe Rogan, host of ""Fear Factor"", a show known for the nasty things its players eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog. A reaction video starring Kermit the Frog proved very popular on the Digg. In January 2008, ""Slate"" magazine wrote about the reaction video with a slideshow about the reactions."
"Violet Blue, an author, stated this website as becoming ""the new 'tubgirl' and goatse all in one nasty moment of choco-poo-love"" in a ""San Francisco Chronicle"" article."

1944 United States presidential election
"The 1944 United States presidential election happened on November 7, 1944. Incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the general election. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt won 432 votes while Dewey won 99. Roosevelt, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as president."
"The election was held during the latter part of World War II. By this time the war was going well for the United States and its Allies. Roosevelt had already served longer than any other president, but remained popular. Unlike in 1940, there was little doubt that he would run for another term as the Democratic candidate, as his health was failing. Dewey, the Governor of New York, campaigned against the New Deal and for a smaller government. But he could not convince the country to change course. Roosevelt's aides covered up the fact the president was in poor health. Roosevelt would die in office three months after starting his fourth term. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, would serve out the remainder of his term of office."
The campaign.
"The Republicans campaigned against the New Deal. They wanted a smaller government and less-regulated economy. Roosevelt's continuing popularity was the main theme of his campaign. To quiet rumors of his poor health, Roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign trip in October and rode in an open car through city streets. A high point of the campaign occurred when Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio where he ridiculed Republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money. He particularly ridiculed a Republican claim that he had sent a US Navy warship to pick up his Scottish Terrier Fala in Alaska. He added that ""Fala was furious"" at such rumors. The speech was met with loud laughter and applause. In response, Dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a few days later on national radio. He accused Roosevelt of being ""indispensable"" to corrupt big-city Democratic organizations and American Communists. Dewey also referred to members of Roosevelt's cabinet as a ""motley crew"". However, the allies had several battlefield successes in Europe and the Pacific during the campaign. These included the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the successful Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944. These were Roosevelt's greatest assets in his campaign."
Results.
The 1944 presidential election was a milestone in American politics for two reasons. It was the first time a candidate for president was born in the 20th century. It was the last time Democrats carried every state in the southern United States. The election had at least one other long-reaching effect. It led to the 1951 passing of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president of the United States.
Junagadh State
Junagadh was a princely state in Gujarat ruled by Muslim rulers in British India until it became part of India in 1948.
Coast
The coast is where land meets the sea.
"The coast also means the land next to the sea, which can also be called the shore, or sea-shore. However, coast is not used to describe where rivers or lakes meet the land - it is only used to describe the sea meeting the land."
"If a house is near to the coast we say it is ""on the coast"". When we talk about a long part of the coast we call it ""the coast-line""."
"Sometimes, 'coast' can be part of a place name or the description of a large area. For instance, the East Coast of the United States describes the all of the Eastern side of the United States that is next to the Atlantic Ocean."
In some countries like England or Australia the people sometimes use the word sea-side for the coast.
Coasts often have many living things living there and provide habitat for many animals and plants.
An example of a coast in Great Britain is the Holderness Coast near Bridlington. This is one of Europe's fast eroding coasts.
George Harrison
"George Harold Harrison, MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. After the group broke up in 1970, he had a solo career. He made many albums and worked with other musicians including Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Ravi Shankar. He was also interested in Eastern mysticism and charitable causes."
Early life.
"Harrison was born in 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, He was youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison and Louise Harrison, He had one sister and two brothers."
Solo music.
"George's best-known album was ""All Things Must Pass,"" which he made just after the Beatles broke up. Harrison owned a mansion in England called Friar Park, where he lived from 1970 until he died. He built his own recording studio inside the mansion, which for a time was better than Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles had made their records. Having a private studio meant Harrison could work on songs and recordings anytime he wanted."
"Ravi Shankar came to Harrison during 1971 with news about a war in Bangladesh, where thousands of people had died and millions more were refugees and starving. Shankar asked for Harrison's help to give a benefit show to buy food for them. Harrison called on many of his musician friends, who put together a charity concert with famous people to help the refugees. The ""Concert for Bangla Desh"", a live recording, became a best-selling album, raised money for the refugees, and brought worldwide attention to the problems in their country. It also inspired later benefits, including Live Aid in the 1980s."
"Harrison found a new musical partner in the 1980s, when Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra began to write and record songs with him. The two men worked well together and became close friends. Harrison and Lynne formed another band, the Traveling Wilburys, with fellow musicians Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. The Traveling Wilburys recorded two albums, which became hits."
Personal life.
"In 1966, Harrison married a model, Pattie Boyd, but they were divorced in 1971, and had no children. Boyd left Harrison to be with his friend, guitarist Eric Clapton, but all three remained friends. Harrison married again in 1978, to American-born Olivia Trinidad Arias, who had worked for his record company. Arias became the mother of Harrison's son Dhani, whose name is comprised of the names of two notes in the Indian music scale. Dhani grew up to be a musician like his father, fronting the band thenewno2. He went to Brown University in the United States."
"In the late 1970s Harrison formed a movie production company, Handmade Films, which produced movies including Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" and Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits""."
"The grounds of Harrison's home, Friar Park, had been more or less open to the public, until the murder of his former bandmate John Lennon late in 1980. Harrison was very hurt and shocked by Lennon's death, and was afraid someone might try to harm him or his family. Afterwards, the gates were locked, and no-entry notices were posted. In December, 1999, an intruder broke into his home, stabbing him with a knife. Harrison and his wife Olivia stopped the intruder and called the police. Harrison recovered. The man who attacked him is schizophrenic and was acquitted of attempted murder by reason of insanity in November 2000 at Oxford Crown Court. He was sent to a mental hospital and released in 2002."
Death.
"In the 1990s, decades of smoking cigarettes caused Harrison to develop throat cancer. He later developed lung cancer, which caused his death in 2001. His family issued a last statement from him: ""Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another."" Even music was not as important to Harrison as his wanting people to learn to get along with each other, and to make the world a better place."
"A year after Harrison's death, Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, the two remaining Beatles (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr), and other musicians held the ""Concert for George"", which remembered Harrison's music, his life, and his gifts to humanity. All the profits from the concert were given to charity."

Crocodylomorph
The Crocodylomorphs are an important group of archosaurs. It includes the crocodilians and their extinct relatives. They were the only members of Pseudosuchia to survive the end-Triassic extinction.
During Mesozoic and early Tertiary times the Crocodylomorphs were much more diverse than they are now.
"They were originally small, lightly built, active land animals. These were replaced during the early Jurassic by various aquatic and marine forms. The later Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi-aquatic lines."
Modern crocodilians do not appear until the Upper Cretaceous.
Evolutionary history.
"The crocodylian lineage (clade Crurotarsi) were a very diverse group of reptiles. Not only are they an ancient group of animals, at least as old as the dinosaurs, they also evolved into a great variety of forms."
"The earliest forms, the sphenosuchians, evolved during the Upper Triassic. They were slim land animals built like greyhounds. During the Jurassic and the Cretaceous, marine forms evolved forelimbs that were paddle-like and had a tail similar to modern fish."
"The group had a wider range of habitats and behaviours than it does at present. ""Dakosaurus andiniensis"", a species closely related to ""Metriorhynchus"", had a skull adapted for eating large marine reptiles. Several terrestrial species during the Cretaceous evolved herbivory. A number of lines during the Tertiary and Pleistocene became wholly land predators."
Lepidosauromorph
The Lepidosauromorphs are a large group of reptiles. It includes all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs.
"The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: lizards, snakes, and the tuatara."

John McDouall Stuart
"John McDouall Stuart (7 September 18155 June 1866) is regarded as one of Australia's greatest explorers. He went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of Australia. He was leader of six of these expeditions. He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer. On each trip, he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey. In 1862, he crossed Australia from Adelaide, South Australia, to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory. He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again."
"Exploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi. He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance. Each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back. Stuart's discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle. His route was used to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin which joined an undersea line from Java. This meant that for the first time, Australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world. But his personal rewards were small. He was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers. Stuart died poor in England at the age of 50."
Early life.
"Stuart was born on 7 September 1815, at Dysart, Fife, Scotland. His father, William Stuart, had been a captain in the British Army. His mother was Mary McDouall. They had nine children, John McDouall was the sixth. His parents died when he was ten years old. The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives. Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh. He studied to be an engineer and surveyor."
Australia.
"In 1839, Stuart moved to Adelaide, South Australia, and began work as a surveyor. Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city. The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased. Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas, measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks. He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush. He was known as a heavy drinker, often spending days at a time drunk. When a recession hit the South Australian economy, Stuart found himself without a job."
Central Australian Expedition 1844.
"Stuart joined Charles Sturt's Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844. Sturt was so sure that there was an inland sea in the centre of Australia, that he took a large boat as part of his equipment. Stuart joined the group as a draftsman, who would draw up the maps. He was paid one pound a week, and provided with food. Stuart and James Poole, the second in command, were sent out ahead of the main group to find water. The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk. Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen, near the current site of Milparinka."
"In the hot dry climate of summer, the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven months. Stuart took a small group to find water to the north, west, and east, but found none. Stuart was left behind in charge of the main group at Depot Glen. It was very hot so they dug an underground room to keep cool. All the men became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. This caused their gums to become soft and their teeth to fall out. They had headaches, their noses bled, and their skin began to turn black. When Poole died, Stuart was made second in command. He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly. When it finally rained the group tried to keep going north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert. They turned south and went back to the Darling River. Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the group. They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard travelling. Sturt had to be carried in a cart, and Stuart, crippled with scurvy and beriberi, looked like a skeleton."
"It took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the expedition. He wrote in a letter: ""I lost the power of my limbs for ... six months, and was quite unable to do anything for myself for ... twelve months."" For the next few years he was unable to work. The money he had made was spent on doctors and living expenses. In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm. He soon found work surveying in the area, and met William Finke and James Chambers. Finke and Chambers were rich men and they paid Stuart to explore for them. They wanted him to find them new farm lands and water, as well as minerals like gold and copper."

"Barrow A.F.C. are an English football team. The club was founded in 1901. It is based in the town of Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, England. After they were promoted at the end of the 2007–08 season, they began playing in the Conference National. The club spent over fifty years in the Football League between 1921 and 1972, and have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football. Barrow have twice won non-league football's highest cup competition, the FA Trophy - in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only non-league club to have won the trophy at both old and new Wembley stadia."
"The club colours are blue and white. The combination of these has varied over time. It has led to their nickname ""The Bluebirds"". Attendances at the club's Holker Street field vary - the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea City in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954. But during the 1990s and 2000s, the average remained between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 1,590 during the 2008-09 season."
The club won their second FA Trophy title on the 8th May 2010 after beating Stevenage Borough 2-1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.

Notes
Eyre Coote (British Army officer)
Eyre Coote (20 May 1762 – 10 December 1823) was a British soldier and politician who was born in Ireland.
He was known as General Sir Eyre Coote until 1816; GCB 1815 - 1816.
Background.
"He was the second son of the Very Rev. Charles Coote (1713 - 12 February 1776), DD, Dean of Kilfenora. After studying at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, Coote bought a commission in the 34th Regiment of Foot - of which his uncle was colonel - in 1774."
"He was soon sent to North America to fight in the Revolutionary War. He fought in the Brooklyn in August 1776, as well as at Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth Court House before finally being taken prisoner at the final Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Between 1790 and 1798, he represented Ballynakill in the Irish House of Commons. Then he sat for Maryborough until 1800."
"He served in England and Ireland when they were threatened by French invasion and against the French on the Continent. He went on to serve in Holland, Egypt and eventually became Governor-General of Jamaica (1806–1808) where he possibly sired an ancestor of Colin Powell."
Scandal and death.
"Sir Eyre was removed from the service on the 21 May 1816 because of the scandal he caused in the Christ's Hospital school for boys. On 25 November 1815 he entered the school and offered some boys money for an opportunity to flog them. After that he asked them to flog him and gave them money. He was caught by the school nurse, and charged with indecent conduct before the Lord Mayor of London. He was acquitted after giving £1000 to the school: after that there was a military inquiry in April 1816 which stripped him of his rank and honours. He was appointed GCB 1815 and stripped of it 1816."
Pilum
A pilum was a type of spear. It was used by the Roman army. Pila were generally 2 metres long. They were made up of a wooden shaft and an soft iron point.
Tree frog
Tree frogs are frogs that spend most of their life in trees.
"There are several lines of Neobatrachia which have evolved into tree frogs. These groups are only distantly related, but they have evolved for a long time in similar conditions. The result is that now there are species from different groups which look very much like each other. This is convergent evolution. It goes so far that in almost all cases, where one group occurs, another does not. Their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of the groups lived before the dinosaurs disappeared."
"The frogs do not normally come down to the ground, except to mate and spawn. Some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees as adults. In some species the eggs develop directly into adults; in others the tadpole stage is spent in the water pool of a large tropical tree leaf."
"Many tree frogs can change their colour for better camouflage. Others are poisonous (poison dart frog), and display warning colouration."
Religion.
"There are a large number of Christian churches in the city for its size. Most are Protestant, due to British colonization, but the cathedral in Basseterre is Roman Catholic. The Anglican, or ""Church of England"" has the most members, followed by the Methodist.

"The city is also a major Eastern Caribbean industrial centre, its main exports being bass, electronics, beverages, clothing, and salt. The sugar industry closed in 2005. This was due to overwhelming debts and further predicted hardships from major price cuts planned by the EU. There are specified industrial estates which carry out sub-sonic technology, food processing, light engineering, bass (instrument) engineering and rum distilling."

Shenton Way
"Shenton Way is a major road in Singapore. It is part of the Central Business District (CBD) area that is found at the south of Singapore. Together with Raffles Place, it forms part of Singapore's first CBD area. This road is a one way street that starts at the junction of Cross Street, Central Boulevard and Raffles Quay and ends at Keppel Road. The road was named after Sir Shenton Thomas, the Governor of Singapore in 1934–1946, to commemorate his decision to stay in the city during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore."

Her parents, carnival workers, had left Likens and her sister Jenny in the care of the Baniszewski family three months before her death in exchange for $20 a week. Baniszewski, two of her children, Paula and John, and two neighborhood youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were charged and convicted of the crime. Her torture and murder were described by the prosecutor in Baniszewski's trial as ""the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of Indiana""."

They were:
&lt;br&gt;Convicts who were sentenced to more than 8 years and survived and served their terms could not return to France but were required to stay on as involunatary settlers for the rest of their lives.&lt;br&gt;
Famous Inmates:
"It also has been known as both a classic and a masterpiece, and has received a Special Edition 60th Anniversary Disney DVD on October 23, 2001, exatly 60 years after its first release. That release featured a sneak peek of a direct-to-video sequel called Dumbo II. The preview showed a lot of sketches and storyboard ideas. The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wonder into the big city. Dumbo's new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go, Dot the curious zebra, Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself, and Penny the adventurous ostrich. Timothy returns as well. The story was supposed to be as if the first Dumbo ended and this one started the next day. The project seems to have been canceled,as no further announcements have been made since, plus the fact that The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, Tinker Bell, and its sequels, were to be the last projests for DisneyToon Studios."
The crow characters in the movie are often seen as African-American stereotypes.
"The leader crow voiced by Cliff Edwards was originally named ""Jim Crow"" for script purposes. The other crows are all voiced by African-American actors and singers, all members of the Hall Johnson Choir: Nick Stewart, James Baskett, Jim Carmichael and Hall Johnson. The late famous duo of African-American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson were invited and hired by Disney to work as live-action reference and models for the animators of the characters, like the chief-animator and Disney Legend Ward Kimball, improvising dances and movements then used in the iconic musical sequence ""When I See An Elephant Fly"". Despite suggestions of racism by writers like Richard Schickel, many historians, critics, writers, pundits and personalities such as John Grant, Leonard Maltin, John Canemaker, Floyd Norman, Eric Goldberg, Alex Wainer, Michael Wilmington, Whoopi Goldberg and Neal Gabler reject these claims. For instance, the crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie who are empathetic and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight (the others are Timothy Q. Mouse and Mrs Jumbo), they are free spirits who serve nobody, and intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence and of what means being ostracized and marginalized, unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common at that time and in the previous decade. Furthermore, their song ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is more orientated to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears."
Media and marketing.
Dumbo's Circus.
"""Dumbo's Circus"" was a live-action puppet television programme for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s. Unlike in the movie, Dumbo spoke on the show. Each character would perform a special act, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes."
Theme parks.
"Dumbo the Flying Elephant is a popular ride that appears in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris), and Hong Kong Disneyland."
Video games.
"Dumbo appears as a hero in the game Kingdom Hearts. Sora, the main character, flies on him and Dumbo splashes enemies with water from his trunk."
Bertolt Brecht
(born ;* 10. February 1898 in Augsburg; † 14. August 1956 in Berlin) was a German poet and dramatist.
Life.
"Brecht went to school in Augsburg, where his father was the director of a paper factory."
He completed his degree in 1917.
"Afterwards he studied sciences, medicine and literature at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. He had to take a break in his studies because he had to join the army."
"In the 1920s, Brecht went to Berlin and became a part of the cultural scene. He met his second wife Helene Weigel in Berlin and married her, after divorcing his first wife. It was with his second wife that Brecht had another son."
In Berlin he met a lot of artists and intellectuals of the Weimar Republic.
"His works became very critical about the capitalistic society (e.g. ""Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny"" (1930)). Many of his friends were communists, but he never joined the KPD."
"His most famous work was from that time, the ""Dreigroschenoper""."
In 1933 the Nazis prohibited playing some of his works and arrested some of his friends.
"After the Reichstag fire, he travelled from Germany to Prague, Vienna, Switzerland and Denmark."
"For the next five years he lived in Denmark. In 1938 he wrote ""Das Leben des Galilei"" (The Life of Galilei) about Galileo Galilei, who was hunted by the Holy Inquisition because he wanted to tell the scientific truth."
When Germany occupied Denmark he had to flee once again.
"He went to Sweden, then to Finland and finally to Moscow in the Soviet Union."
Even under Stalin he was not safe. He therefore flew through China to the United States.
He lived and worked in California and translated a lot of text.
"In 1947, in the McCarthy era, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated him, because they suspected him of being a communist."
He gave a statement and said that he had never been a member of the communist party.
He then flew back to Switzerland - the only place he could go to at the time.
"In 1948 he was allowed to return to Berlin, East Berlin."
Chromolithography and the poster.
"Chromolithography (color lithography) was invented by Engelmann &amp; Son, who were granted a patent in 1837. After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development."
"Because of its low production costs, over the 50 years after the American Civil War, millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $10. Louis Prang, a Bostonian, produced fine-art subjects, such as still lifes, landscapes, and classical subjects. Nevertheless, it was only after 1847 that the Jules Chéret posters showed their real potential."
Posters in the first half of the 20th century.
"Posters were used for war propaganda, to encourage young people to enlist in the army, and to sell government war bonds. From a strictly artistic view, the posters were unimaginative and far from the masterpieces of the late 19th century posters. The posters almost all came with a caption to bang the message home."
Gretchen Wilson
"Gretchen Wilson (born June 26, 1973) is a country music singer."
In 2004 she had her first number one album on Billboard's Hot Country Songs music chart. As late as 2013 she had a song on Billboard's Country Airplay music chart.
Career.
Wilson got a contract with Epic Records in 2003.
Blue Balliett
"Elizabeth ""Blue"" Balliett Klein (born in 1955) is an American writer. Her first book is ""Chasing Vermeer"". ""Chasing Vermeer"" made the Children's bestseller list in 2004. In the story, two sixth graders help solve a mystery involving a Vermeer painting. The story has to do with pentominoes, patterns, and coincidences. The sequel to ""Chasing Vermeer"" is ""The Wright 3,"" a mystery centered around the Robie House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and his talisman- a superstitious good luck object- that is a jade Japanese fish. This time, the two main characters, Petra and Calder, are joined by Calder's old friend, Tommy Segovia. The sequel, called The Wright 3, was published in April 2006."

Prague
Prague (Praha in Czech) is the capital and the largest city of the Czech Republic. 1.4 million people live there.
"Prague has been known as one of the most beautiful European cities since the Middle Ages. It is often called the ""City of 100 Towers"", the ""Rooftop of Europe"" or the ""Heart of Europe."" Prague was a place where many merchants, artists and inventors met."
"Prague is full of historical monuments in all major artistic styles. The historic center of Prague is on both banks of the Vltava river. This historical center has six districts, which were once independent cities that joined together in the 18th century. These districts are Staré Město (Old Town), Pražský hrad (Prague castle), Josefov (Old Jewish Town), Nové Město (New Town), Malá Strana (Lesser Town), Hradčany (Prague Castle Quarter) and Vyšehrad. It was Prince Bořivoj who established Prague Castle. There are also lots of museums, galleries, theaters, concert halls, and other historic buildings."
History.
"The earliest inhabitants of the area lived in the valley of the Vltava river around 500 BC. Slavonic tribes came to Bohemia in about 500 AD. There is a legend about how the town of Prague started. Princess Libuše, the leader of a Slavonic tribe, chose a simple peasant Přemysl to be her husband. She told him to go and find a village on the banks of the Vltava and to start a town there. The town became Prague, ruled by the Přemyslid family.In the second half of the 9th century the castle’s original fortifications were built. During the reign of Wenceslas I (Václav in Czech) in the 10th century the church of St Vitus was built at Prague castle. Wenceslas was murdered by his brother when he was going to church. He was later made a saint. In the early 11th century the Přemyslid family got power in Moravia, too. Vratislav II was the first monarch to be called King of Bohemia."
"Another ruler, also called Wenceslas I, ruled as King of Bohemia from 1230. He encouraged the arts. Many Germans came to live in Prague. In 1257 King Otakar II founded the area of Prague called the Lesser Quarter for the Germans to live in. The last of the Přemyslid kings was King Wenceslas III. He was murdered in Moravia."
"During the Middle Ages Prague became very important as the capital of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by Charles IV (1316-1378) who was the most powerful ruler in Europe at the time. Charles made Prague a great city, building St Vitus Cathedral, a university, and a famous bridge called Charles Bridge which still exists."
"After Charles IV there were many arguments and fights in Prague. A priest called Jan Hus said that the Catholic Church had become too powerful. He was arrested and burned at the stake in 1415. A lot of people agreed with what Hus had been saying. These people were called Hussites. They threw a lot of important Catholic people out of the window (called ""defenestration""). A lot more fighting followed, and for many years Bohemia was ruled by kings who lived in other countries."
"From 1526 the Habsburg family ruled Bohemia. They were Catholics and ruled the Holy Roman Empire. In 1576 the Emperor Rudolph II moved the capital from Vienna to Prague. Prague became a rich town again, and people were free to worship as Catholics or Protestants. After Rudolph II there were a lot of religious fighting and more people were thrown out of windows. Eventually the fighting became part of the Thirty Years’ War. When Ferdinand II won the fighting a lot of Protestants left the country. New buildings in Prague were built in the Baroque style. The German language, not Czech, was spoken at court. Maria Theresa was the only queen to reign over Prague. One of her 16 children was Marie Antoinette who became queen of France. When her son Joseph II ruled, people stopped fighting about religion. The people were free to speak what they thought, and there was no more serfdom. Prague now had three parts: the Old Town, the Lesser Quarter and the New Town. Famous people such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart visited the town often."
"In the 19th century industry came to Prague. Factories were built, a railway was built between Prague and Vienna. The Czech nationalist movement became very strong after 1848. They wanted to use their own language instead of German. The composers Smetana and Dvořák wrote music about their country, often using Czech folksongs. The National Theatre was opened in 1881."
"In June 1914 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne, was murdered. This led to World War I. After the war an independent republic called Czechoslovakia was formed with Prague as its capital. Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia were part of it. In 1938 Hitler invaded the country. It was liberated by Soviet troops in May 1945. However, the communists soon seized power and the country was ruled by communists who had to obey the Soviet Union. The prime minister Alexander Dubček gradually tried to make reforms. This period of time is called the ""Prague Spring"". In 1968 the Soviet Union sent tanks into Prague to Wenceslas Square to restore their power."
Democracy gradually came to Prague in 1989 when the Velvet Revolution happened. In 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia split into two countries. Today both these countries are part of the European Union.
Cultural sights.
Bristle
"A bristle is a stiff hair or feather. Also used are synthetic materials such as nylon in items such as brooms and sweepers. Bristles are often used to make brushes for cleaning uses: common examples are the toothbrush and toilet brush. The bristle brush is a common household cleaning tool, often used to remove dirt or grease from pots and pans."
Le Roy le veult
"""Le Roy le veult"" (""The King wills it"") or ""La Reyne le veult"" (""The Queen wills it"") is a Norman French line used in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to show that a public or private bill has received Royal Assent from the Monarch."
History.
"The practice of giving Royal Assent came from William the Conqueror to show that the King intended for something to be made law. Norman French came to be used as the normal language of the educated classes and of the law, though Latin continued to be used with it. The work of the Parliament of England was conducted entirely in French until the latter part of Edward III's reign (1327–1377) and English was only rarely used before the reign of Henry VI (1422–61, 1470–71). Royal Assent was sometimes given in English, though more often in French. The practice of recording Parliamentary statutes in French or Latin stopped by 1488 and statutes have been published in English ever since."
"During the period of the Protectorate, when the Lord Protector (Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard) governed the country, assent was given in English. The old practice of giving assent in Norman French was resumed following the Restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since. There has only been one attempt to remove it, when the House of Lords passed a bill in 1706 ""for abolishing the use of the French tongue in all proceedings in Parliament and courts of justice."" The bill failed to pass the House of Commons. Although the use of French in courts was later abolished in 1731, Parliament's practice was not affected."
Usage.
"The line is used to show that the Monarch has granted their Royal Assent to a bill in order to make it become law. It is used by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the House of Lords. It is only used after the Lord Chancellor with the Lords Commissioners, has read out the Letters patent for the bill. The Clerk of the Crown then reads out the short title of the bill and the Clerk of the Parliament responds by saying the line 19 times towards the House of Commons at the bar of the House. The line is also written on the paper of the bill to show that the Monarch granted Royal Assent to the bill."
"The line has been used wrongly on other bills, same as the wrong line has also been used for government bills. There are a few occasions where this has happened, most notably on the Act of Supremacy 1558 where """"Soit fait comme il est désiré"", the line used for personal bills, was used instead of ""La Reyne le veult""."
"If the Royal Assent is refused, the line ""Le Roy / La Reyne s'avisera"""" would be used, though in practice no British monarch since Queen Anne has not given royal assent since a dispute over militia in Scotland in 1707."
George Herriman
"George Joseph Herriman (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist. He is best known for his comic strip ""Krazy Kat"" (1913–1944)."
Sam Champion
"Samuel James ""Sam"" Champion (born August 13, 1961) is the weather anchor of ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and weather editor of ABC News. Champion was born in Paducah, Kentucky. He has a B.A. in broadcast journalism from Eastern Kentucky University. He worked on ""Good Morning America"" as a weatherman, making reportedly $1.5 million per year. On April 7, 2012, he debuted as host of ""Sea Rescue"", an educational and informational television program that focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of animals back into the wild."
"Champion is active in many charitable organizations in the New York City area including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, March of Dimes, and ""Stopping AIDS Together"". He co-hosted the New York City Project's 2002 ""Courage Awards"". On 20 February 2013 ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported that a former Mets teammate of baseball player Mike Piazza's said in 2000 that Piazza and Champion were involved in a homosexual relationship. Piazza denied this in 2002. Champion and his longtime partner Rubem Robierb were married on December 21, 2012."
"Champion left ""Good Morning America"" in December 2013, and later moved to The Weather Channel hosting ""AMHQ"" from March 2014 until October 2015."

Isaac Newton was the first person to solve to the general two-body problem.
Three or more bodies.
"Looking at the generalizations, there are two other problems which are related:"
Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution was proposed in Congress on December 9, 1803. It was ratified by the state legislatures on June 15, 1804. It provided new procedures for electing the President and Vice President. Before the amendment, each member of the Electoral College cast a single vote. The candidate who received the largest number of votes became the President. The candidate receiving the next highest number of votes became the Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment changed the process to the current system whereby one vote is cast for the President and one for the Vice President."
Background.
"The Constitutional Convention of 1787 went over several different proposals for electing the President. Some wanted Congress to choose the President. Other suggestions included selection by the state legislatures, by the state governors or by a congressional committee. Near the end of the convention the question was turned over to a committee called the Committee of Eleven for leftover business. They devised a system called the Electoral College. The plan was accepted and was added to the Constitution."
"In 1789 the Electoral College unanimously elected George Washington as the first president. He was reelected in 1792. In both cases he was the only president to receive all of the electoral votes. In the 1796 election, Washington declined to run. His Vice President, John Adams, and his running mate Thomas Pinckney ran for President and Vice President respectively. Alexander Hamilton tried to use his influence to get Pinckney more votes, making Adams the Vice President again. But the scheme backfired when Thomas Jefferson got more votes than Pinckney, but Adams won more of the electoral votes. This made Adams the President and Jefferson the Vice President."
"The 1800 Presidential election showed the deep problems in the electoral college system. Jefferson ran against Adams again. Both had running mates. Pinckney was again the running mate of Adams for the Federalist Party. Aaron Burr was Jefferson's running mate for the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes creating a tie between two candidates from the same political party. Under the Constitution, the matter was to be decided by the House of Representatives. In the House, the two tied again in 35 votes. Only on the 36th ballot was the deadlock broken and Jefferson was elected president."
"The solution to the problem became the Twelfth Amendment. It was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803. Three days later it was submitted to the states for ratification. Fourteen of the seventeen states (at the time) ratified it and the amendment was added to the Constitution on September 25, 1804."
Provisions.
"The Electoral College remained much the same under the Twelfth Amendment. But the process for choosing a president and vice president changed. Under the Twelfth Amendment an elector must cast separate votes for the President and Vice President. If nobody gets the majority of the votes, the process remains the same as before; the House of Representatives decides."
South by Southwest
"South by Southwest (SXSW) is a set of festivals and conferences. They are about movies, interactive media, and music. It takes place every year in March in Austin, Texas, United States. It began in 1987. It has continued to grow in both scope and size every year."
"South by Southwest is run by the company SXSW, Inc."

TNA King of the Mountain Championship
"The TNA King of the Mountain Championship is a professional wrestling championship in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). The championship was debuted on the October 23, 2008 episode of ""TNA Impact!"" and was originally called the ""TNA Legends Championship"". It was considered the second highest-ranking title in TNA. It was declared defunct by the (storyline) TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle on July 3, 2014. The title was reactivated under the new name ""TNA King of the Mountain Championship"" on June 25, 2015."
History.
"Booker T revealed the championship after he took it out of a steel briefcase that he had been carrying around in the weeks leading up to the reveal. He named it the ""TNA Legends Championship"" and declared himself as the first champion. A.J. Styles defeated Booker T at Destination X on March 15, 2009 to win the championship."
"Winning the title made Styles the first-ever TNA Grand Slam Champion after he had won the World Heavyweight (NWA or TNA), the World Tag Team (NWA or TNA), and the TNA X Division Championship along with the Legends Championship. The Management Director of TNA Jim Cornette announced that the Championship became an official TNA sanctioned championship because Styles defeated Booker T for it legally by the contract the two had signed to make the match official."
"When Eric Young held the championship, he renamed it the ""TNA Global Championship"" on the October 29, 2009 episode of ""Impact!"" and said that he was not going to defend it against any American wrestlers or on American soil. Young was defeated by Rob Terry during a live event in Cardiff, Wales on January 27, 2010."
"Terry lost the championship to A.J. Styles on the July 22 episode of ""Impact!"". Styles renamed it the ""TNA Television Championship"" on the July 29 episode."
"On July 3, 2014, the TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle declared that the Television Championship would become inactive."
"On June 25, 2015, the championship was reactivated under the new name ""TNA King of the Mountain Championship."" It was announced by TNA that there would be a new champion crowned in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. At Slammiversary, Jeff Jarrett defeated Matt Hardy, Eric Young, Drew Galloway, and Bobby Roode to win the championship. Since Jarrett was the founder and running GFW, there were suspicions of Jarrett defending the championship in GFW. The championship did appear at a GFW live event on July 9 where Young attacked Jarrett and stole the championship."
Reigns.
"The current champion is Bobby Roode. Roode is in his first reign as champion. He won the championship after defeating PJ Black during ""Impact Wrestling"" tapings on July 28, 2015."
"The first champion was Booker T. He awarded himself the championship on the October 23, 2008 episode of ""Impact!"". The longest reigns in the championship's history was Abyss' second reign which lasted 396 days. The shortest reign was PJ Black's first reign which lasted only 1 day."
Amy Ryan
"Amy Ryan (born May 3, 1968) is an American actress. In ""Gone Baby Gone"" she played Helene. She was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She did not win; however, she received other awards for her performance. Ryan played Beadie Russell in ""The Wire""."
"Ryan was born in Queens, New York."
Escape Plan
"Escape Plan is an action, melodrama and thriller movie of 2013. The movie is about an engineer who is kept in a secret prison. The engineer is a former prosecutor. Sylvester Stallone plays Ray (the engineer), Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Emil Rottmayer and Victor Mannheim, and 50 Cent plays Hush. This movie was rated R by MPAA officials."
"This movie was released in October 2013 with mixed critical reviews. The box office sales were somewhat low in the United States. Overseas, however, the movie performed quite well. It made over US$137 million."
Long and Foster

Services.
"Long and Foster provides sales and purchases of homes, land, and commercial properties; mortgage, title, and insurance assistance; insurance offerings; and relocation and settlement services."
Fight or flight response
"The fight-or-flight response (or acute stress response) is a set of physiological changes that occur when an animal is threatened. The changes include increased heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure."
This response was first described by W.B Cannon. He found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to changes such as those mentioned above. The changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing. This response is the first stage of a general adaptation that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.
Evolutionary perspective.
"Shakur's friend and labelmate from Death Row Records, Marion ""Suge"" Knight, was in the car with Shakur. Knight survived the shooting."
"In 1998, a prime suspect in Shakur’s murder, Orlando Anderson (aka Baby Lane) was killed in another drive-by shooting. Shakur once attacked Anderson."
"In 2002, reporter Chuck Phillips wrote in the ""Los Angeles Times"" that another rapper called Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.) could have paid members of the Crips street gang to kill Shakur and that he could have given them the gun."
Legacy.
"Many murals of Shakur are found in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, and Bulgaria, among many other places. There are also statues of him in Atlanta and Germany."
Skagerrak
Skagerrak is a sea in the northern part of Europe between Norway and Denmark. Skagerrak is a part of the North Sea. To the east is Kattegat.
"Close to the Norwegian coast is a deep trench (700 m), the rest of the sea is shallow. Oil and gas are produced from rigs in the Skagerrak."
Kattegat
"Kattegat is a sea in the northern part of Europe between the Danish peninsula Jutland, the Danish island Zealand, and the western coast of Sweden."
To the north-west is Skagerrak. Kattegat is connected to the Baltic Sea through the Danish Straits and Belts.
"The sea is shallow, and life conditions are threatened by loss of oxygen in the water. The oxygen loss is caused by pollution. The pollution originates from farming. A century ago, the sea was very rich in cod, herring, and salmon, which were important sources of food in the countries around the sea."
Baltic Sea
"The Baltic Sea is a sea in northern Europe between Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries, Poland, and Germany."
"Many big rivers in the surrounding countries drain into the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is connected to the ocean through the narrow and shallow Danish straits and belts. For this reason, the water has a low amount of salt, so the northern parts of the sea freeze over in the winter. The ice can carry cars, and roads are established every winter between the islands in the archipelagos between Sweden and Finland."
"For several thousand years, the Baltic Sea has connected the countries at her shores. For that reason there are many cultural similarities in these countries. Since all of these countries are European, this sea is also considered European."
Scandinavia
"Scandinavia is a group of countries in northern Europe. Scandinavia is also the smallest region in Europe. Scandinavia has Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Some people also think Finland is part of Scandinavia. Others also say Iceland and the Faroe Islands should count. Most of the time, ""Scandinavia"" is used to mean places where people speak Scandinavian languages, also called North Germanic languages or Nordic. The Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and Faroese) are very similar to each other, and many Scandinavians understand parts of the other languages because they are alike in some ways. Finnish is not part of the North Germanic language group."
"What people mean when they say ""Scandinavia"" depends on what they think is important at the time. When people want to talk about about maps, natural land formations and how the economy works, they may say Finland is part of Scandinavia but Iceland is not. When people want to talk about history and what languages people speak, they say Iceland is part of Scandinavia but Finland is not."
"The Scandinavian Peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the Baltic Sea. Norway, Sweden and some of Finland are on this peninsula. However, Denmark is considered part of Scandinavia in the ethnic sense more often than Finland is. This is because Danish is a Scandinavian language but Finnish is not."
"Some people like to say ""Nordic countries"" instead of ""Scandinavia"" because they think it is more correct about geography. The Nordic countries include Norway, Sweden, Denmark (including the Faroe Islands), Finland, and Iceland. These five countries use the Nordic Council to work together on political and cultural activities. Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are also members of the European Union, but only Finland is part of the eurozone, meaning that it uses the Euro as its money. The other Nordic countries still use their own money, called ""krone"" or ""krona"" (from the word ""crowns""). Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU, are members of NATO and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Only Denmark is a member of both the EU and NATO."
Geography.
"Most of the Scandinavian Peninsula has only a few people in it. It has large forests of pine, birch, and spruce trees. The western and northern parts are mountainous; the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world. The tallest mountain is Galdhøpiggen in Norway. Denmark (43,098 km2) is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. It is more densely populated, and most of the land is farmland. Sweden (449,964 km2) is the largest of the Scandinavian countries. It has the most lakes, and the landscape ranges from plains in the south to mountains in the west (along the border with Norway) to tundra in the north. The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called Lapland, where the Sami people live. Some of them still herd reindeer, but most Sami live in modern houses and have modern jobs, like other Scandinavians."
Vikings.
"The most famous group of Scandinavians is the Vikings of the Middle Ages. The Vikings attacked and raided but they were also traders, traveling to the Ukraine and starting trade routes to the Middle East."
"Vikings from Norway were explorers, crossing the North Atlantic in their longships. They came to Iceland and Greenland and built towns and farms there. The Norwegian explorers also came to the east coast of Canada, where they set up at least one settlement, but it did not last into modern times."
"The Vikings from Denmark came to England, where they affected the history and politics and even the English language. Danish raiders attacked England many times with great violence. Sometimes the Danes would ask that the English pay them to go away. These payments were called ""Danegeld"" (Danish gold). The priests and bishops of churches on the east coast of England wrote a famous prayer: ""deliver us, O Lord, from the wrath of the Norsemen!"" ""Norsemen"" is another way to say ""men from the north,"" or the Danes."
Scandinavians in fiction and theater.
"The United States has a history in intelligence services dating back to its origins. During the American Revolution, George Washington and other Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, and Patrick Henry used espionage networks."
"The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency has been Gina Haspel since April 26, 2018."
"The CIA is made up of four groups, which do different things. Its goal is to protect the US people. Many people feel that the CIA does more bad than good. Others people that the CIA does good by finding out secret information about enemies of the United States. Others think those secrets should remain secret. American law makes it illegal for the CIA and other agencies to kill foreign leaders."
"In 1992, Saddam Hussein tried to kill US President George H.W. Bush, who used to be director of the CIA, during a visit to Kuwait. The assassination plot failed. In revenge, President Bill Clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired at the building of the Iraqi equivalent to the CIA. That occurred at night and so only the cleaners were killed, not those who had planned the assassination."
"CIA has many clandestine, or secret, operations. Some CIA employees have been killed during their work. Their names are on a CIA memorial with a star for them, but some of the names are still secret. The number of stars is deliberately inaccurate."
"The CIA also uses open sources to gather information. Analysts read foreign newspapers and watch foreign news broadcasts to learn information, which can be pieced together to make a conclusion."
"The CIA used to report to the President. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, a reorganization made the CIA and other intelligence agencies report to a Director of National Intelligence."
"The CIA has been featured in many television and film productions, including the American television show ""The Agency,"" the American television mini-series ""The Company,"" the film ""Spy Game"" that stars Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, ""Night Flight to Moscow"" that stars Yul Brenner, ""Scorpio"" that stars Burt Lancaster, ""Clear and Present Danger"" that stars Harrison Ford; ""Ice Station Zebra,"" and several James Bond films that featured the CIA agent Felix Leiter."

Company (disambiguation)
The word company has several meanings:
Rio de Janeiro
"Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil. It is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Until April 21, 1960 it was the capital city of Brazil. According to the 2000 Census, the city had 5,473,909 people, and an area of over 1,000 km2. In 2008 Eduardo Paes became Mayor. The city was started in 1565."
"Copacabana Beach, Ipanema Beach, Sugar Loaf Mountain (in Portuguese, ""Pão de Açúcar""), the statue of Christ the Redeemer (in Portuguese, ""Cristo Redentor""), a harbor on Guanabara Bay, and Tom Jobim Airport are in Rio de Janeiro. It has much commerce and many industries, especially textiles, food, chemicals, and metallurgy. Most of these industries are in the northern and western suburbs of the city. Rio de Janeiro also has a small rural area, near the suburb of Campo Grande, where fruits and vegetables are grown."
"Other cities near Rio de Janeiro, like Duque de Caxias, Nova Iguaçu, Queimados and São Gonçalo, that form the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, also have a lot of industries and population."
"The city is 420 kilometers (about 261 miles) away from São Paulo, the biggest city in South America. The cities of Rio and São Paulo are linked by the Presidente Dutra Highway (also known as ""Via Dutra""). The region crossed by the Presidente Dutra Highway has been an important industrial zone since the 1950s."
"In the city of Rio de Janeiro lies Tijuca National Park, created in 1961. This park contains some 33 km2, between the northern and the southern parts of the city. The district (in Portuguese, ""bairro"") of Santa Tereza can be reached by taking an electric tram (in Portuguese, ""bonde"") from central Rio de Janeiro (near ""Largo da Carioca"" subway station), crossing over the ""Arcos da Lapa"", an aqueduct built during the colonial period to provide water to the city."
The city hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 2016.
Płońsk
"Płońsk is a city in Central Poland in the Masovian Voivodeship. It has a population of 23,000 and has an area of 12 km². It is the birthplace of the Zionist leader and first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion."
Frances Burney
"Frances Burney (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840) was an English novelist, diarist and playwright. She was also known as Fanny Burney. After her marriage, she was known as Madame d’Arblay. She was born in King's Lynn, England. She was born to musician Dr Charles Burney (1726 – 1814) and Mrs Esther Sleepe Burney (1725 – 62). She mostly taught herself. She began writing what she called her ""scribblings"" when she was ten. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was published in 1778. This novel made her very famous. ""Cecilia"" came out in 1782. It was an even greater critical success. Her major novels, ""Evelina"", ""Cecilia"", and ""Camilla"" are about a young girl. The girls are clever and beautiful, but does not have a lot of experience. The girl goes out into the world and grows in character. Her books were liked by Jane Austen. In 1786, she became Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte. She wrote many journals and letters. Her journals and letters have interested historians. In 1793, she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. They had a son in 1794. His name was Alexander. He was their only son. While living in France from 1802 to 1812, Burney wrote ""The Wanderer"". It was a novel about the French Revolution. It was published in 1814. Her last published work was the ""Memoirs of Doctor Burney"" (1832). She died in London in 6 January 1840. She was buried in Bath near her husband and son."
Family life.
"On 13 June 1752, Frances Burney was born in King's Lynn. She was baptized on the 7th of July. Her older brothers and sisters were Ester (Hetty) (1749 – 1832) and James (1750 – 1821). Her younger brothers and sisters were Susanna Elizabeth (1755-1800), Charles (1757-1817) and Charlotte Ann (1761 – 1838). Susanna Elizabeth became Frances Burney's close friend. James Burney became an admiral. He sailed with Captain James Cook on his second and third trips. The younger Charles Burney was a scholar. Her younger half-sister, Sarah Burney (1772 – 1844), also became a novelist. She published five works that she wrote herself. Esther Sleepe Burney also had two boys who died at birth."
First mother.
"Esther Sleepe Burney was three years older than Charles Burney. She had her oldest daughter, Esther, with Charles before they married. Frances Burney kept this as a ""family secret"". She even said nothing about the date of her father's marriage. Also, she did not say when his children were born in the ""Memoirs"". Some people have thought that she hid the dates to make everyone believe she published ""Evelina"" when 17."
"Her mother suddenly became sick. She took a trip to Bath and Bristol Hot Wells. This is where main character in ""Evelina"" go to try to become healthy again. However, she did not get better. The sickness was thought to be tuberculosis. It is also possible that it was cancer. In 1760, her mother, Esther Sleepe Burney, died. She was described by historians as a gentle woman of ""warmth and intelligence"". It is possible that Esther Burney's French birth influenced Burney's writing. One example is the conflicts between Madame Duval and Captain Mirvan in ""Evelina"". It may also have been one reason for her love of and marriage to Alexandre D'Arblay. Fanny was very shocked and sad when she heard that her mother was dead. Her neighbor, Mrs. Pringle, commented. She later said, ""...she never saw such affliction"" and that Fanny would ""take no comfort--&amp; was almost killed with [""sic""] Crying"". Her father, Charles Burney, was also very unhappy. He comforted himself with writing sad poems about his wife."
Father.
"Her father was respected by many people as a musician. He was also well-educated. He wished to show that a musician could be a gentleman. Frances Burney often saw many opera singers, dancers, musicians, and actors (like actors Garrick or Christopher Smart), that spoke in many kinds of languages. She mentioned him in ""Evelina"": ""Well may Mr. Garrick be so celebrated, so universally (everywhere) admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer...every look ""speaks""!...I am afraid you will think me mad (crazy), so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him."" She also saw more of the world than most ""young ladies"" could. She wrote down many rude things people said in her diaries. Traveller Richard Twiss once embarrassed the family by talking about improper things. He said that an immodest book, ""The Dictionary of Love"", was very good. After Twiss left, Burney wrote in her Diary, 'Even my gentle &amp; candid (truthful) Father says that ""he has quite mistaken the Thing,"" &amp; that he will never see a ""Table Cloth"" in his House again'."
"Some people have said that Burney may have been shy because of her father. People said that Mr. Burney's only fault was ""obsequiousness"" (too much serving to men). Frances never openly criticized her father. She even carefully destroyed everything bad about him. In her ""Memoirs"", she wrote that her father had no faults. However, she wrote explanations and excuses for things her father thought were right."
Second mother.
"In October 1767, her father married a rich widow. Her name was Elizabeth Allen. She already had three sons. The Burney children did not like their stepmother. Hester, Frances's older sister, married her cousin. His name was Charles Rosseau Burney. He was a musician. She married him in September 1770. She probably did this to leave her home. Because of this, Frances lost a sister who was like another mother. The Burney children did a ""secret war"" with Mrs. Allen. They called her ""Mrs. Precious"", ""Madam"", and ""the Lady"". A letter from Frances Burney to her sister Hester said, ""The excuse to be ""fudged"" up (made up, lied) for the purpose, I leave to your own ingenuity."" Although at this time Frances was 25 years old, she had to find an excuse to visit her married sister. Even their old friend, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp, joined in with mocking Mrs. Elizabeth Allen."
Education.
"Her father educated her sisters Esther and Susanna much more than Frances Burney. When she was eight, she still had not learned the alphabet. She was also so shy that visitors at her father's house called her the ""old lady"". Some scholars think she might have had a kind of dyslexia. Her brother used to play tricks on her by pretending to teach her to read and giving her a book upside-down. She did not find out that it was actually upside down and tried to read it. People said that ""the little dunce"" should be whipped. However, Esther Sleepe Burney always replied that ""she had no fears about Fanny"". Her sister Susanna said that Fanny has ""sense, sensibility, and bashfulness (shyness)"". She also added, ""I am afraid...that my sister Fanny is too reserved""."
"In 1763 or 1764, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp became close to the Burney family. He helped Frances write by asking for many journal-letters from her about her family and her life. He influenced her writing very much."
Works.
"Frances Burney d'Arblay made a new kind of English novel, recording things that happened from George III's madness to what happened after the Battle of Waterloo. She also wrote comedies that had a great influence on many writers to come. For example, Jane Austen found both the theme and the title for ""Pride and Prejudice"" in the last chapter of Frances Burney's novel ""Cecilia"". William Makepeace Thackeray, the writer of Vanity Fair, was also influenced by Burney. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was a new kind of fiction in English. It was a fiction where women in society were shown in realistic, modern ways - the novel of manners. ""She showed the manners and morals of polite society with a relish (liking) for the ridiculous (funny) and a respect for the conventional (traditional)"".(""Norton Anthology of Literature by Women"", p. 242) Burney was the first woman to make the writing of novels ""respectable"". Her second novel, ""Cecilia"", published in 1782, was an even greater critical success. Her third novel, ""Camilla"", was very popular; the sale was ""4 times that of ""Evelina"", &amp; nearly double that of ""Cecilia""""."

"Lake Placid, New York"
"Lake Placid is a village in northern New York State. It has a population of 2,638. It was founded in the early 1880s to look for iron. Today it is a ski resort. It has hosted the Winter Olympics twice, in 1932 and 1980."
Grebe
A grebe is a medium sized bird. They are in the family Podicipedidae. There are 22 species of grebe.
"Description, color and shape."
"Most grebes are a medium or large size. Some grebes, such as the Little Grebe are smaller. All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes. This means that each toe is separate on the foot (the opposite of this is webbed feet which is seen in ducks and geese). Some grebes find it difficult to walk on land because their feet are so big. They are much better at swimming and diving in water."
"Hare Krishna is a mantra. It is also known as Maha Mantra. The mantra was made well known even outside Hinduism by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The mantra can be found in many Hinduist traditions in India. Those who believe in it think that when the mantra is heard, spoken, used for meditation or sung this can lead to a higher state of consciousness. According to Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, this higher consciousness takes the form of pure love of God (Krishna). The mantra is contained in the texts of Hinduism known as the Upanishads, which are considered by some scholars to have roots in the Vedic past."

"Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer and actress. Referred to as “The Voice”, she is regarded as one of the most influential vocalists in popular music. Houston is noted for her powerful and soulful vocals, as well as her charismatic stage presence. She is the most awarded female artist of all time. Houston is also one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, with sales of over 200 million records worldwide."
"Her first two studio albums, Whitney Houston (1985) and Whitney (1987), both peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and are among the best-selling albums of all time. She is the only artist to have seven consecutive number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, from ""Saving All My Love for You"" in 1985 to ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"" in 1988."
"Houston made her acting debut with the romantic thriller film The Bodyguard (1992). She recorded six songs for the film's soundtrack, including ""I Will Always Love You"", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became the best-selling physical single by a female in music history. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time. Houston starred and recorded soundtracks for two other high-profile films, Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996), with the latter's soundtrack being the best-selling gospel album of all time."
"On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards and was featured prominently in international media. Houston was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020."
Early years.
"Whitney Elizabeth Houston was born at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark, New Jersey. She was the second child of Army serviceman and entertainment executive John Russell Houston, Jr. and gospel singer Cissy Houston. Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick are her cousins."
"Whitney began singing at a young age in gospel music at church, being influenced by her mother. She was described as having an impressive ranging spinto soprano voice. In 1983, she was discovered by an Arista Records representative and signed to the label."
Career.
"Houston released her first album, ""Whitney Houston"", in 1985. It featured the number-one singles ""Saving All My Love for You"", ""Greatest Love of All"", and ""How Will I Know"". Her second album, ""Whitney"", was released in 1987 and featured the number-one hits ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody"" and ""So Emotional"". In 1990, her album ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" was released, and the song of the same name also reached number one on the US ""Billboard"" Hot 100, as did the single ""All the Man That I Need"". She sang the National Anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl and earned widespread praise for the performance. She starred in the film ""The Bodyguard"" in 1992 and performed several songs on its soundtrack, one of which was a cover of country singer-songwriter Dolly Parton's song, ""I Will Always Love You"". The song became Houston's biggest hit of her career and reached number one in countries around the world. Houston sat throughout much of the music video for ""I Will Always Love You"" because she was pregnant with her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. ""I Will Always Love You"" became the bestselling song by a female artist, with the soundtrack for ""The Bodyguard"" becoming the bestselling film soundtrack ever. She performed with singer-songwriter Mariah Carey on the song ""When You Believe"" for the film ""The Prince of Egypt""."
"Houston released albums ""My Love Is Your Love"", ""Just Whitney..."", and ""I Look to You"" in 1998, 2002, and 2009, respectively. She also appeared in the film ""Sparkle"" alongside singer Jordin Sparks."
"Whitney Houston has earned six Grammy Awards and seven number-one songs in a row on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. She had a total of 11 ""Billboard"" Hot 100 number-ones, placing her in fourth place for women behind Mariah Carey (18 number-ones), Rihanna (14), and Madonna and The Supremes (12 each). She is the most-awarded female artist of all time."
Whitney Houston has also been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.
Marriage.
"Houston married Bobby Brown in 1992. In 1993, they had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. In a 2009 interview, Houston indicated the marriage was both passionate and turbulent. Their marital relationship was marred by drug use and by Brown's professional jealousy, psychological abuse, and physical confrontations. The couple divorced in 2007."
Death.
"On the night of February 11, 2012, at the age of 48, Houston was found dead in her guest room at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The official coroner's report stated that she had accidentally drowned in the bath. Atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use were listed as contributing factors. Her funeral was televised."
"On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the suggested Constitution. All 30 of the members of its Convention voted for the Constitution."
"On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution. Now that nine states had ratified the Constitution, it became the highest and most important law of the United States. The United States would have a new form of government, based on the ideas set out in the Constitution."
Four states are still left.
"However, four states still had not approved the Constitution. These states were Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island. If they did not approve the Constitution, they would not be a part of the new government of the United States."
"The Congress of the Confederation decided that the United States would start using the new Constitution on March 4, 1789. Before that day, Virginia and New York ratified the Constitution. However, when the first United States Congress gathered on March 4 to form the new government, North Carolina and Rhode Island still had not approved the Constitution. After the new Congress added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, though, North Carolina and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution."
Order of approval.
The Constitution was ratified by the states in this order:
Roberto Perfumo
"Roberto Alfredo Perfumo (3 October 1942 – 10 March 2016) was an Argentine footballer and sports commentator. He was nicknamed ""El Mariscal"". He was thought as one of the best Argentine defenders ever. Perfumo played for Racing, River Plate and Brazilian team Cruzeiro. With the national team, he played the 1966 and 1974 World Cups."
Perfumo died at 73 from a skull injury after falling from a stairway in Buenos Aires on 10 March 2016.
Aldo Ferrer
"Aldo Ferrer (April 15, 1927 – March 8, 2016) was an Argentine economist and policy maker. Ferrer was one of the leading figures of economic nationalism in Argentina. He served as Minister of Economy from 1970 through 1971. He later served as an ambassador to France from Argentine. He served as ambassador from 2011 through 2013. He was born in Buenos Aires."
"Ferrer died in Buenos Aires on March 8, 2016. He was aged 88."
Article Six of the United States Constitution
"Article Six of the United States Constitution says that the Constitution, and any laws or treaties the United States might make, will be the most important laws in the United States. It also says that the United States will pay debts from before the Constitution was written. Finally, it says that members of the United States government have to swear that they will obey the Constitution. However, they will never have to swear that they follow a certain religion."
Debts.
"Before the United States Constitution was written, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. The Articles made the states into a Confederation."
"The first part of Article Six says that the United States will still honor and pay all of its debts from before the Constitution was written. The Article says that ""these debts are as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as [they were] under the Confederation [governed by the Articles of Confederation]."""
Supremacy.
"The second clause of Article Six is often called the ""Supremacy Clause."" It says that these things are the ""supreme"" laws in the United States the most powerful and most important laws in the country:"
Because these laws are supreme:
"For example, part of the Constitution called the Bill of Rights gives people the right to freedom of religion. Because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land:"
Later in history.
A few Supreme Court decisions helped make the Supremacy Clause clearer.
"The first important case was ""Marbury v. Madison"" (1803). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that it had the power to review state courts' decisions, if those decisions seemed like they did not follow the supreme law. This power is called judicial review."
"In ""Martin v. Hunter's Lessee"" (1816), the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was more powerful than the state Supreme Courts. In the case, the Virginia Supreme Court said that a United States Supreme Court decision was unconstitutional, and told all of the Virginia state courts not to obey it. The United States Supreme Court ruled that it had the final say in legal issues that had to do with federal laws not the state courts. If a state court and the United States Supreme Court disagree, the Supreme Court is the supreme law of the land."
"Three years later, in ""McCulloch v. Maryland"" (1819), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot control federal institutions. The state of Maryland had tried to tax a federal bank. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot tax government property. This was another example of a case where the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the ""supreme laws of the land"" were more powerful than state laws or court decisions."
"In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled on ""Gibbons v. Ogden"" (1824). The state of New York had given Aaron Ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. However, Thomas Gibbons got the same power from a federal government permit. The Supreme Court decided that the federal permit was more powerful than the state monopoly. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote:"
"Finally, in ""Reid v. Covert"" (1957), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that no branch of the United States government can be given extra powers by a treaty, if those powers were not given to it by the Constitution. This case showed that the Constitution could even limit the power of treaties, and was truly the supreme law of the land."

He died on 18 October 707 and was buried in Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was succeeded by Pope Sisinnius.
World Trade Center site
"The World Trade Center site refers to the area of land in Lower Manhattan in New York City, that hosted both the original and new World Trade Centers. The land was originally underwater. The first World Trade Center complex of buildings stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The new World Trade Center complex is mostly complete and is built on the site. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns most of the land. The site is overseen by Studio Daniel Libeskind, Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation."
September 11 attacks.
"On the morning of September 11, 2001, two airplanes were captured by terrorists close to al-Qaeda and crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The towers fell within two hours after the crashes. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks. After the attacks, hospital workers and police offers began calling the site ""Ground Zero""."
Debris and clean-up.
"When the towers fell, they caused dust to spread in New York City, and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site. The New York City Fire Department separated the site into four areas to make cleanup of the site and the search for people who survived the attack easier. Early on, it was said that the debris at the site would take a year to get rid of, but cleanup ended in May 2002. Building materials and debris from Ground Zero were sent to the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island."
"In December 2001, a viewing area at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public."
"On March 11, 2002, six months after the attacks, the Tribute in Light, a memorial with two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky, began. It was lit up every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, it was lit up for the second anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2003. It has been lit up every September 11 since then."
New buildings.
The new World Trade Center complex will have the following buildings:
"Soon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush said that they would rebuild the World Trade Center. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani said, ""We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again."" During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of workers through a megaphone. A person in the crowd shouted, ""I can't hear you,"" to which Bush replied, ""I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."""
"In an address to Congress, the president said, ""As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City."" However, 20 years after the attacks, only four buildings, One World Trade Center, 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center and 7 World Trade Center, have been rebuilt. One building, One World Trade Center, is currently under construction."
"In November 2001, Governor Pataki started the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to oversee the rebuilding of the World Trade Center. The LMDC leads federal help in the rebuilding, and works with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind. It also communicates with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and the families of the people who were killed in the September 11 attacks."
National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.
"A memorial, ""Reflecting Absence"", honors the people killed in the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad. It has a field of trees with the footprints of the original towers. The footprints are filled with pools of water. It opened on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2011."
"On October 12, 2004, the LMDC announced that Gehry Partners LLP and Snøhetta, an architectural company from Norway, would design a performing arts center and museum at the site. It is a museum and a visitors' center for the site. The museum opened in 2014."
Criticism.
"An episode of CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in 2010 was about the lack of work done at Ground Zero. It focused on how most of the buildings did not have a date for completion, the main building, One World Trade Center (originally called the Freedom Tower), having gone through three different designs, and the delays and high amount of money that went into the rebuilding. Larry Silverstein said that the entire site would be completed in 2037, and that billions of dollars have been spent on rebuilding the site, even though Ground Zero ""is still a hole in the ground."" During an interview for the episode, Silverstein said, ""I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime."" However, it was said in early 2011 that a lot of work has been done on the site, with all five buildings under construction. All of the buildings will be completed between 2012 and 2016. Criticism of the work being done at Ground Zero was made in 2008 and 2009, when there was no work being done at the site."
River Humber
"The River Humber is a large deep water estuary on the east coast of Northern England. It is formed by the River Ouse and the River Trent coming together. From here to the North Sea (about 40 miles) it forms part of the border between the East Riding of Yorkshire on the north side and Lincolnshire on the south side. The Humber's only modern crossing is the Humber Bridge. At one time it the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. Now it is the fifth longest. Before the bridge was built in 1981, paddle steamers were used to cross the mile long span."
History.
"In the middle ages the tides of the Humber kept armies from crossing. At that time it was thought to be an arm of the ocean. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the Humber was a major boundary, separating Northumbria from the southern kingdoms. The name Northumbria came from Old English ""Northanhymbre"" meaning ""the people north of the Humber"". The Vikings used the Humber and its two tributaries, the Ouse and Trent, with their shallow-draft Longships to raid all over northeastern England."
Fortresses.
Fort Paull was a Napoleonic era fort built in 1542 to protect the port there. The site dates back to 910 when it was a lookout for Viking raiders. The current fort is designed as a pentagon and was built from 1861–1864. It was disarmed at the beginning of the First World War and replaced by two nearby forts. One was on Sunk Island; the other was at Stallingborough. In 1960 the fort was finally closed down. But in 1964 a group of volunteers took over the fort and made it into a Museum.
France Roche
"France Roche (2 April 1921 – 14 December 2013) was a French actress and screenwriter. She appeared in 17 movies between 1951 and 1979. She died on 14 December 2013 from natural causes, aged 92."
Suzerainty (American accent: soo-zer-en-tee) happens when a country X has its own government but cannot act independently because of a more powerful country Y. This more powerful country Y is called the suzerain and can usually control the foreign relations of X (how X interacts with other countries).
It differs from sovereignty in that the tributary still has limited control of its own stuff and internal country affairs.
A suzerain can also mean a feudal lord. Vassals must pay tribute to the feudal lord.
Some examples.
The term suzerainty originally described the relationship between the Ottoman Empire and its surrounding regions including:
"China historically had suzerainty over Mongolia, Korea."
British Rail Class 487
"The British Rail Class 487 electric multiple units were built by English Electric in 1940, for use on the Waterloo &amp; City Line."
British Rail Class 488
"The British Rail Class 488 are unpowered trailer sets, converted from Mark 2F coaches for the Gatwick Express service from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport."
British Rail Class 489
"The British Rail Class 489 (or GLV) is a type of electrical multiple unit, specially converted for use on Gatwick Express trains, from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport."
Second-class citizen
"A second-class citizen is a person who is discriminated by their country, even though they are a citizen or legal resident."
"Second-class citizenry is usually seen as a violation of human rights. African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way. Other groups of people that have been or still are being treated as second class citizens are the Dalit of India, and Arab Christians."
British Rail Class 499
British Rail allocated Class 499 to a fleet of six luggage vans used in electric multiple unit formations on boat train services between London and Dover. They were allocated Southern Region class TLV (meaning Trailer Luggage Van).
British Rail Class 501
The British Rail Class 501 electric multiple units were built in 1957/58 for use on the former LNWR/LMS suburban electric network of the London Midland Region. A total of 57 three-car units were built.
British Rail Class 502
"The British Rail Class 502 was a type of electric multiple unit originally built by the London Midland and Scottish Railway at their Derby Works workshop. Introduced in 1940 and withdrawn by 1980, they spent the whole of their working lives on the electrified railway lines of north Liverpool."
British Rail Class 503
"British Rail Class 503 trains were 70mph (110km/h) electric multiple units. They were introduced in two batches — in 1938 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with a further batch (built to a similar design) in 1956 by the then nationalised British Railways (BR)."
Political parties.
"Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism."
"The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last ""status voting"" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades."
Demographics.
"Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world."
The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is:
Culture.
Literature.
"Puerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are René Marqués (author of ""The Oxcart"") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical ""Hamilton""). The most famous poets are Julia de Burgos (""Yo fui mi ruta"") and Giannina Braschi (author the poetry epic ""Empire of Dreams""). Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican). Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets."
Art.
"José Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter. He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rodón who paints portraits of celebrities. In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico."
Music.
"Puerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and R""eggaeton"". One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13. World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for ""Best Latin Pop Performance"" for Living La Vida Loca."
Philosophy.
"Puerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio María de Hostos. He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco José Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism. Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice. Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz. Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers."
Jonathan Ke Quan
"Jonathan Ke Quan (born August 20, 1971 as Ke Huy Quan) is a Vietnamese-American former child actor."
"In the 1980s, he appeared in several movies. His best known roles were as Short Round in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984) and Data in ""The Goonies"" (1985). He now works as a stunt coordinator on many movies, for example ""X-Men""."
"In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, he was an orphan in the streets of Shanghai when he becomes Indy's(Harrison Ford) friend. They end up in India where Indy, Short Round and night club singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) fight Indians, save children, and participate in a mine car chase."
"After their adventures in India, Short Round disappeared temporarily. He later grew up to become an archeologist. He went on an adventure in search of the Peacock Stone, the same diamond lost at the beginning of ""Temple of Doom""."
Pilgrimage
A pilgrimage is when people travel to a place of worship that is usually far away. They may have to go to a different city or country. Usually a pilgrimage is done for spiritual or religious reasons. The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by Pope Benedict XVI this way:
There are also non-religious pilgrimages; they include for example:
1703
"The year 1703 (MDCCIII) started on a Monday, (or a Thursday by the 11-day slower Julian calendar)."
Watermelon
"A watermelon (""Citrullus lanatus"") is a plant which was first domesticated in Africa. It is a cultivated edible fruit. It is grown worldwide, there are more than 1000 varieties."
"About 6% of a watermelon is sugar, which makes it very sweet. There are many different types of watermelon. Some have a green rind on the outside and a red-pink flesh on the inside, with brown seeds. Some can have yellow flesh, and some can be seedless. The green rind on the outside is not usually eaten, though it can be used as a vegetable. It can also be stewed or pickled. Most watermelons are oblong or spherical. In Japan, watermelons are grown in different shapes, such as hearts and squares."
Kim Jong-nam
"Kim Jong-nam (May 10, 1971 - February 13, 2017) was the eldest son of Kim Jong-il, the former leader of North Korea."
He tried to enter Japan using a fake passport in May 2001. This was to visit Disneyland. This caused his father to not approve of him. Kim Jong-nam's younger half-brother Kim Jong-un was made the heir in September 2010.
"In June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the ""Associated Press"" in Macau. He told the reporter that he had ""no plans"" to defect to Europe. The press had recently said this. Kim Jong-nam lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau's Coloane Island until 2007. An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for ""months"", and now goes between China and ""another country."""
"When his father died, Kim Jong-nam did not attend the funeral. This was to avoid rumours on the succession."
"He was assassinated in Malaysia on February 13, 2017, which is believed to be ordered by his half-brother Kim Jong-un."
Personal life.
"The South Korean newspaper ""The Chosun Ilbo"" said that Kim Jong-nam has two wives, at least one mistress, and several children. His first wife Shin Jong-hui (born c. 1980) and their son Kum-sol (born c. 1996) live at a home called Dragon Villa on the northern outskirts of Beijing. His second wife Lee Hye-kyong (born c. 1970), their son Han-sol (born c. 1995) and their daughter Sol-hui (born c. 1998) live in an apartment building in Macau. Jong-nam's mistress, former Air Koryo flight attendant So Yong-la (born c. 1980), also lives in Macau."
Jong-nam is often given attention by the media for his gambling and extravagant spending.
Western Sahara
"Western Sahara (Arabic: الصحراء الغربية; Amazigh: Tanẓṛuft Tutrimt; ) is a territory in Africa. To the north is Morocco, to the east is Algeria, to the south is Mauritania, and to the west is the Atlantic Ocean. Its surface is . It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world. Most of the territory is made of desert flatlands. The largest city is Laâyoune. More than half the population live there. The territory has a population estimated at just more than 500,000."
"Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since the 1960s when it was a Spanish colony. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, with its Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) government, both claim control over the territory."
"Since 1975, most of the territory has been part of Morocco. In 1973, some Sahrawis claimed the Moroccans and Mauritanians were occupying their land and started a movement. The movement turned violent, and the United Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1991. Many Polisario members and their families became refugees in camps in Algeria. The rest of Western Sahara is controlled by the Polisario/SADR, backed by Algeria. Many important countries have pressed both parties to agree to a peaceful solution. Both Morocco and Polisario have tried to get recognition from other countries. Polisario has won formal recognition for SADR from 81 states, and was extended membership in the African Union, while Morocco has won recognition for its position from the Arab League. In both instances, recognitions have over the past two decades been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends."
"Some countries (such as the United States) recognizes Morocco's sovereignty on Western Sahara, others claim that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are the legitimate government in Western Sahara. Most nations remain neutral on the subject. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was made by the Polisario Front an armed militia fighting under Sahrawi nationalism."
Tunis
"Tunis (, ""Tūnis"") is the capital city of Tunisia. As of 2004, 728,463 people lived in the city. About 1.6 million live in the metropolitan area."
Mozambique
"Mozambique, officially the Republic of Mozambique, is a country in southeastern Africa. Its capital is Maputo. There are about 31 million people. In 1975, Mozambique became independent from Portugal. (National Day on 25th June, 1975) The country was named Moçambique by the Portuguese after the Island of Mozambique which was the capital of Portuguese Africa. After independence from Portugal it became the People's Republic of Mozambique. There was a big civil war from 1977 to 1992."
"Mozambique has many natural resources. Portugal, Spain, and Belgium are among the country's most important partners. It is the second poorest country in the world. They have the world's lowest life expectancy. In 2012, large natural gas reserves were found in Mozambique. The revenues from the reserves might dramatically change the economy."
"The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese. About half the people speak it as a second language and very few as a first language. Languages widely spoken natively include Swahili, Makhuwa, and Sena. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity. There are also Muslim and African traditional religious minorities."
"Mozambique is a member of the African Union, Commonwealth of Nations, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, the Latin Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Southern African Development Community."
Geography and climate.
"At , Mozambique is the world's 35th-largest country. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest."
"The country is divided into two regions by the Zambezi River. To the north of the Zambezi River, the narrow coastline moves inland to hills and low plateaus. Further west are rugged highlands, which include the Niassa highlands, Namuli or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, Tete highlands and the Makonde plateau, covered with miombo woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and Lebombo mountains in the deep south."
"The country has five main rivers and several smaller ones. The largest and most important is the Zambezi. The country has four notable lakes: Lake Niassa (or Malawi), Lake Chiuta, Lake Cahora Bassa and Lake Shirwa, all in the north."
Climate.
Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons. The wet season is from October to March and the dry season from April to September. Conditions vary depending on altitude.

Theories as to the origin of the name include:
"A map (""Leyland map"") dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name ""Casus Rupes"" (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above, but which may be a folk etymology."
History.
Wrecks.
"There have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6-7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS ""Stella"", wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker ""Constantia S""."
"It was believed for centuries that HMS ""Victory"" was wrecked in 1744 on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss. However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nautical miles (110 km) from the Casquets."
Casquets lighthouses.
"The first lighthouses started operation on 30 October 1724, and were three towers lit by coal fires called St Peter, St Thomas and the Dungeon. Three stone towers were built so the lights would not look like those in nearby France."
"They were built by Thomas Le Cocq, owner of the rocks, under licence from Trinity House and who was paid a halfpenny per ton of ship when vessels passed the rocks and in turn he paid Trinity House 50 pounds per year for the right to run the lighthouses. The lighthouses reverted to Trinity House in 1785."
They were converted to oil lamps with metal reflectors which were first used on 25 November 1790; and upgraded again with apparatus to rotate a beam of light in 1818. This had a clockwork mechanism which was wound up every hour and a half and gave one flash every 15 seconds.
"The lighthouses were badly damaged and the lanterns smashed in a severe storm on 31 October 1823. The towers were raised by a further 10 yards (9.1 m) in 1854, and 184 kilocandela lamps were added which gave three slow flashes every half minute. In 1877 the North West Tower was raised again and the lights in the other two towers turned off."
"British commandos of the Small Scale Raiding Force made two raids during the Second World War on the lighthouse, following the German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940. The first raid, Operation Dryad, took place on 2/3 September 1942 and the seven keepers were taken back to England as prisoners of war."
"In 1954 the lighthouse was coverted to electricity and a 2,830 kilocandela lamp was put in. The lamp is unusual because it rotates anti-clockwise. At the same time, the other two towers were reduced in height."
"The current light in the 23 metres (75 ft) North West Tower is 37 metres (121 ft) above mean sea level and flashes five times every 30 seconds and with flashes 3.7 seconds apart. It can be seen for around 24 nautical miles (44 km) in clear weather. The East Tower contains the foghorn, which produces two blasts every 60 seconds and this has a nominal range of 3 nautical miles (5.6 km). The South West Tower is topped with a helipad and there is another helipad on a flat section of the rock. The rocks are also marked using racon with a Morse letter T on radar displays. The lighthouse complex was automated in 1990 and is monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre in Harwich."

Order of the Indian Empire
The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire is an order of chivalry founded by Queen Victoria in 1878. The Order includes members of three classes:
"No appointments have been made since 1947, the year of Indian independence and the Partition of India. In 2010 the last surviving knight, The Maharaja of Dhrangadhra, died and the order became dormant ."
"The motto of the Order is """", (Under the auspices of the Empress), a reference to Queen Victoria, the first Empress of India. The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the Empire of India; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India."
History.
"The British founded the Order in 1878 to reward British and ""native"" officials who served in India. The Order originally had only one class (Companion), but a second class, Knights Commander, was added in 1887. The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India (founded in 1861); consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter."
"On 15 February 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire formally became ""The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire"" and was divided into two classes: Knights Commander and Companions, with the following first Knights Commander:"
"However, on 5 January 1888, a further proclamation regarding the Order was made; the Order was expanded from two classes to three - Knight Grand Commander, Knight Commander and Companion. Seven Knights Grand Commander were created; they were:"
"Normally the highest grade in British orders is Knight Grand Cross, but Knight Grand Commander was chosen for the two Indian awards because of the Christian symbolism of the cross."
"Appointments to both Orders stopped after 14 August 1947. The Orders have never been formally abolished, and Queen Elizabeth II remains the Sovereign of the Orders to this day. Today, there are no living members of the order."
"The fictional characters Purun Dass (invented by Rudyard Kipling) and Harry Paget Flashman (invented by George MacDonald Fraser) each held a KCIE; Kipling's engineer Findlayson in ""The Day's Work"" (1908) wants the CIE."
Composition.
"The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order. The Grand Master held the next-most senior rank; the position was held, ""ex officio"", by the Viceroy of India. Members of the first class were known as ""Knights Grand Commanders"" rather than ""Knights Grand Cross"" so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order."
"At the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class, that of Companion. There could be any number of members. In 1887, the Order was divided into the two classes of Knights Commander (50 at any given time) and Companions (no quota). The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; the composition of the other two classes remained the same."
"British officials and soldiers were eligible for appointment, as were rulers of Indian Princely States. Generally, the rulers of the more important states were appointed Knights Grand Commanders of the Order of the Star of India, rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire. Women, except the princely rulers, could not be members the Order. Female princely rulers were admitted as ""Knights"" rather than as ""Dames"" or ""Ladies""."
"As well, other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed."

Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey
"Monkwearmouth–Jarrow was a combination of two English monasteries run as a single community. Both were founded by Benedict Biscop. Monkwearmouth, built first, was a magnificent example of the Roman style of architecture. It housed one of the first stained glass works in England. Jarrow became the center of Anglo-Saxon learning in the north of England and contained the largest library in Anglo-Saxon England. Bede, the great Anglo-Saxon scholar, studied, taught and wrote there. The sister Anglo-Saxon monasteries were the UK nomination for World Heritage Site status in 2011."
History.
"In 674 Benedict Biscop, a Northumbrian nobleman, built a monastery known as Monkwearmouth. Egfrith, King of Northumbria gave him fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. This monastery would be dedicated to Saint Peter and came to be called St. Peter's at Monkwearmouth. Benedict wanted his monastery to be a center of both learning and religion. Benedict used Frankish stonemasons who he brought over to England to construct the monastery. Monkwearmouth was the first (and Jarrow the second) church structures to be built of stone in England. Benedict them brought over glassmakers from Frankia to fit the windows of the church and chapels with fine stained glass. They established a workshop there at Monkwearwolf. Within a year the monastery was completed. In 678 a letter from Pope Agatho exempted the monastery from external control. Benedict got all the , sacred vessels, decorations and . Some he found locally while others he bought in Francia and Rome. In 682 King Egfrith gave another forty hides of land to Benedict for a second monastery. It was to be at the mouth of the River Trent at Jarrow. The dedication ceremony for Jarrow abbey was held on 23 April 685. Named for Saint Paul when the sister monastery was completed Benedict assigned Ceolfrith to the abbot. Bede, who was about ten years old at the time, was one of the monks who went with him. King Egfrid, who was at the dedication, died in battle against the Picts less than a month later. The two sister abbeys, only seven miles apart, were thought of as one."
"The library that Benedict started made it possible for Bede to write his works including his famous ""Ecclesiastical History of the English People"".information from. There wasn't another library like it in England. By the time of his death in 689 Benedict had completed four trips to Rome and the south and brought back large collections of books each time. The full extent of Bede's work would still not be possible if not for Ceolfrid, the fourth abbot. He doubled the size of the library left by Benedict Biscop."
"The at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow was kept very busy. There was a growing demand for copies of bibles, books, documents and especially the works of Bede. Requests came in from other parts of England and the . Works from the scriptorium would be found in Leningrad, Rome, and other parts of Europe. Under increasing requests for its products, the Monkwearmouth-Jarrow scriptorium adopted a faster script style used in later works."
"In 794, just a year after the Vikings sacked Lindisfarne, the Vikings attacked Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. The flames were so hot the glass was melted. Both sites were abandoned for a time. Their location on the coast of Northumbria made them easy targets for Viking raids. The twin monasteries were rebuilt. Unlike many old ruins that disappear over time, the old walls of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow can still be seen. They are next to or part of the modern buildings that replaced the original buildings built in 674 and 682."

"Garret Desmond FitzGerald (9 February 1926 – 19 May 2011) was an Irish politician who served twice as Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland, from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1982 to 1987. Elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965, and in 1969 to Dáil Éireann as a Teachta Dála (TD), he served as Ireland's foreign minister from 1973 to 1977 and as leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987."
Early life.
"FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, His mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent."
"He was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD). A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer), a fellow student whom FitzGerald would marry in 1947."
He later qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.
Early political life.
"FitzGerald was eager to enter politics and, although it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fáil (including Charles Haughey) that he should join them, he made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South-East constituency."
Minister for Foreign Affairs.
"After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party, with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, however the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, with his innovative views, energy and fluency in the French language, won Ireland a status in European affairs far beyond the country's size and ensured that the first Irish presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success."

"In 1977, the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen by acclamation to succeed him."
"Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas than Fianna Fáil, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years."

"Garry Kasparov (born 13 April 1963 in Baku, Azerbaijan) is a Russian chess grandmaster and political activist. He was born with the name ""Garry Weinstein"", and is partly of Jewish descent. He was the World Chess Champion from 1985 to 2000. In 1993 he broke away from FIDE to make a rival organisation (the PCA), because he felt FIDE had failed to raise enough money for world title matches. There is controversy about that period. By any measure, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time, and was the highest-rated player even after his retirement, It was till much later when Magnus Carlsen took him over."
"Kasparov became the youngest non-disputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when an argument with FIDE led him to set up a rival company, the Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kasparov lost a match (a series of chess games) against ""Deep Blue"", a computer made by IBM, in 1997.

"After retiring from chess, Kasparov became involved in Russian politics. In 2005, he traveled around Russia, speaking against Vladimir Putin, who was President of Russia at that time. The same year he created the United Civil Front, a political movement whose main goal is to dismantle Putin's regime and restore democracy in Russia."
"Kasparov was also one of the founders of The Other Russia, an opposition coalition which unites many left and nationalist politicians. He helped organize marches of dissenters involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and governors of Moscow and Saint Petersburg."
"In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency. In November 2007, he was detained by police at a rally in Moscow and given a jail sentence of five days. On 12 December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a hall where at least 500 of his supporters could meet to endorse his candidacy, as is legally required. Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to discourage anyone from renting a hall for the gathering.

The choir was not particularly good when he started there, but he soon made them into an excellent choir. They made many recordings. In 1971 he was given a Lambeth doctorate by the Archbishop of Canterbury for his services to music."
"When he retired he first moved to Wansford in Cambridgeshire so that he was half way between his son (in Yorkshire) and his daughter (in Berkshire). He continued to work there, training the church choir, giving singing lessons, and composing. Later he moved to Yorkshire to be nearer to family. He died aged 100 after falling down and breaking his hip."

"When the RCO started in 1864 by Richard Limpus it was called the ""College of Organists"". It was given a Royal Charter in 1893. In 1903 it was offered an extremely cheap 99-year lease on a beautiful building in Kensington, West London. The college was there until 1991 when it moved to a church in the City of London.

"Under Section 2, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Vice President, the President nominates someone to replace the Vice President. If a majority of both Houses of Congress agree, that person becomes the Vice President."
Section 3: Presidential declaration.
"Section 3 says that a President can declare themselves ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of their office"" (unable to do their job). He or she must say this in a written letter to both the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Once the President does this, the Vice President becomes Acting President. The President can take back the Presidency at any time by sending letters to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House, saying he or she is able to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency again."
Section 4 is the only part of the Amendment that has never been used. It allows other executive officials to declare the President unable to do his job. The Vice President must agree to do this. So must:
"To declare the President unable to do his job, these people would have to sign and give a letter to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. As with Section 3, the Vice President would then become the Acting President."
"The President may take back the Presidency by sending a letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet think the President is still disabled and still cannot do his job, they can challenge his return. They have four days to write another declaration saying the President is still unable to do his job. The Vice President is still Acting President during these four days. Congress then has to get together within 48 hours, if they are not already in session. Then Congress has 21 days to make a decision. In the meantime, the Vice President is still Acting President."
"If two-thirds of each House of Congress votes that the President still cannot do his job, the Vice President would continue to be Acting President. If Congress does not vote this way, or if they do not vote at all within 21 days, the President takes over the Presidency again."
Uses.
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment has been invoked (used) six times since it was added to the Constitution. Section 1 has been used once; Section 2 has been used twice; and Section 3 has been used three times. Only Section 4 has never been used, though it was considered twice."
Use of Section 1.
"President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, before the House could vote on whether to impeach him for crimes related to the Watergate scandal. Vice President Gerald Ford became President as soon as Nixon resigned."
Use of Section 2.
"On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Two days later, President Richard Nixon nominated United States Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan to be the new Vice President. According to Section 2, more than 50% of each House of Congress had to approve Ford as Vice President. By December 6, 97% of the Senate and 92% of the House had approved Ford. Ford was sworn in to the Vice Presidency later on December 6 before both Houses of Congress. Ford is the only person in United States history ever to be Vice President, and later President, without being elected to either office."
"When Gerald Ford became President after Richard Nixon resigned, the Vice Presidency became vacant. On August 20, 1974, the new President Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to be the new Vice President. On December 10, 1974, the Senate confirmed Rockefeller with a vote of 90–7. Nine days later, the House voted 287-128 to confirm Rockefeller. He was sworn into office later on December 19, 1974, before the Senate."
Use of Section 3.
"Presidents have used Section 3 of the 25th Amendment three times. Each time, they have given power to their Vice Presidents for a short time because they needed to get anesthesia for medical tests or surgery. The three Acting Presidents in United States history are listed below."
George H. W. Bush (1985).
"On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan found out that he had a small growth in his colon that could turn into colon cancer. His doctor told him he needed surgery. Reagan decided to have surgery right away."
"However, Reagan did not want to invoke Section 3 of the 25th Amendment. He was worried that giving Presidential power away would set a bad precedent. The White House's head lawyer and Reagan's Chief of Staff suggested that he use Section 3 and give power to Vice President George H.W. Bush."
"Two letters were created. The first invoked Section 3 and said Reagan would be unable to discharge his duties. The second said that Reagan knew about Section 3, and did not think it applied to his situation, but still wanted Bush to take over during his surgery. On July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and had it delivered to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House."
"Reagan's autobiography, and other books, argue that Reagan clearly meant to give power to Vice President Bush.pp. 197–200 The White House lawyer, Fred Fielding, said:"
"However, since Reagan did not specifically mention Section 3 and say he could not do his job as President, he did not officially invoke the 25th Amendment."
Dick Cheney (2002; 2007).
"On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush became the first President to officially invoke Section 3. He needed a colonoscopy, a test of the colon, and would be getting anesthesia. He formally gave power to his Vice President, Dick Cheney, using the rules that the 25th Amendment set out. Unlike Reagan, he specifically said he was using Section 3 of the 25th Amendment in his letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. After about two hours, Bush was awake and took back the Presidency."
"On July 21, 2007, President Bush again invoked Section 3 so he could have another colonoscopy. Again, Cheney was Acting President for about two hours, until Bush was ready to take back the Presidency."
Considered use of Section 4.
"As of 2021, Section 4 has never been invoked, however there were at least two occasions where the use of Section 4 was considered and another where its non-use came under substantial criticism. These occurred during the presidency of Ronald Reagan."
1981: Reagan assassination attempt.
"On March 30, 1981, a man named John Hinckley tried to kill President Ronald Reagan. Reagan was shot and needed immediate surgery, so he could not invoke Section 3 to give power to his Vice President. His Vice President, George H.W. Bush, did not invoke Section 4, because he was on an airplane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush got to Washington, D.C.pp. 195–6, 253-5"
"In 1995, Birch Bayh, who had written the Senate version of the 25th Amendment, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked."
1987: Reagan accused of not doing his job.
"In 1987, Reagan's Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, resigned.p. 218 Howard Baker replaced him.p. 83 Reagan's staff told Baker that Reagan seemed lazy and unable to do his job. They told him to be ready for Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to be invoked."
"Tradition tells that he was a member of the Sanguini family. Before being elected, he was the cardinal-priest of the church of Santa Susanna in Rome."

"The complex is in the thylakoid membrane of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria."
"In the photosystem, enzymes capture photons of light to energize electrons. The electrons are then transferred by coenzymes and cofactors. The energized electrons are replaced by oxidizing water to form hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen."
"By replenishing lost electrons with electrons from the splitting of water, photosystem II provides the electrons for photosynthesis to occur."

Criticisms.
"There was a documentary called ""Outfoxed"" that criticized the channel because they say it is biased towards conservatives and the US Republican Party in its reporting. Fox says its opinion shows are conservative but its regular news programs are not. President Barack Obama, through a spokesperson, accused Fox News of working for the Republican Party. Fox has also been accused of having a right-wing bias, racism, discrimination, race baiting and gender inequality.

"The symbol is thought to come from the Latin quæstio, meaning ""question"", which was shortened to Qo. The uppercase Q was written above the lowercase o, and this mark was turned into the symbol that we use today."
"Another guess about where question mark comes from says that it comes from the 9th century, when it was a point followed by the curved part written slanted."
"Some writers put a space between the end of their sentence and the question mark. This is thought to come from a French practice and is called French spacing. In French a space is always put before question marks, exclamation marks, colons, and semicolons. In English, however, using this space is thought of as bad form. Some English books do have these spaces, but are often a very thin space, which are not full spaces but an attempt to make the words easier to read."

They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They were the first to have the idea of Vikings wearing helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera ""Ring des Nibelungen"" so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings."
History.
"During the 10th through 13th centuries, when the Christian religion spread through Scandiavia, modern countries started to form there. They came together into three kingdoms:"
"These three Scandinavian kingdoms made the Kalmar Union in 1387 under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. However, in 1523, Sweden left the union. Because of this, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway. Then, the Protestant Reformation happened, and Catholic and Protestant Christians fought each other. After things settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished: it assembled for the last time in 1537. Denmark and Norway formed another union in 1536, and it lasted until 1814. It turned into the three modern countries Denmark, Norway and Iceland."
"The borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway came to the shape they have today in the middle of the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway gave some territory to Sweden: the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre &amp; Särna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia). The 1658 Treaty of Roskilde forced Denmark–Norway to give the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm, and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. In 1660, the Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to give Bornholm and Trøndelag back to Denmark–Norway."
"Finland used to be part of Sweden in medieval times. During the wars fought by Napoleon, it became part of Russia."
Minerva (automobile)
"In 1883 a young Belgian called Sylvain de Jong settled in Antwerp, Belgium. He started a bicycle factory there. By the end of that century he started producing motorbikes, and after a while automobiles as well. In 1903 he grounded the NV Minerva Motors' in Berchem (Antwerp)."
"A certain Charles S Rolls was Minerva dealer in England. The small 1 cylinder ""Minervette"" was there with its 105 Pound, the cheapest automobile."
"In the years after the fame of the automobile was rising enormous. Most important market for the constructor remained however England that took the biggest part of the production, followed by the Netherlands and France."
"From 1908 Minerva got a worldwide Knight licence. The Knight motor was a motor without valves, developed by Charles Y Knight in the United States. These motors were extremely silent. The company did well in several automobile racing competitions in Europe."
"After worldwar I, during which Sylvain de Jong and his engineers headed to Amsterdam, where they kept on developing parts, they returned to start up the production of luxury automobiles. The constructors star rose in the United States as well, American filmstars, politicians and industrials liked them cars as well (even Henry Ford had before the WW already one!). The car had the same qualities as the Rolls Royce, but was a little cheaper. With the economical crisis in the 30's, the company went bankrupt in 1936. The remains were taken over by another Belgian constructor named Imperia. Imperia putted the name Minerva on their automobiles for export to England and France and for the trucks (which Minerva had made before too)."
After worldwar II the company produced Land Rovers under licence for the Belgian army. Production of these 4Wheel Drives stopped in 1953. The company struggled for survival and made some Land Rover-like cars till 1956. But than the constructor diappeared completely.

Archipelago
"An archipelago () is a chain or group of islands. The word ""archipelago"" means ""chief sea"", from Greek ""arkhon"" (""arkhi""-) (""leader"") and ""pelagos"" (""sea"")."
"Archipelagos are usually found in the open sea; less commonly, a big landmass may neighbor them, an example being Scotland which has more than 700 islands surrounding the mainland. Many archipelagos are volcanic, forming along mid-ocean ridges or hotspots. Others are island arcs neighboring an oceanic trench. Many other processes create archipelagos, including erosion, deposition, and land elevation."
"The four biggest countries that are mainly archipelagos are Japan, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Indonesia (the world's biggest country that is an archipelago, according to the CIA World Factbook). The biggest archipelago in the world by size is in Northern Canada, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which is in the Arctic Ocean."

Dobruja is an area between Bulgaria and Romania. It can be found between the Danube and the Black Sea.
"The Romanian part of Dobruja, Dobrogea, is made up of the counties of Constanţa and Tulcea. The Bulgarian part of Dobruja, Dobrudzha, is made up of the regions of Dobrich Province and Silistra Province."
"This historical region however, sees today, little but significant nationalistic conflict, for who, out of the coastal Balkan countries should control the western coastal lying areas of the Black Sea."
"The areas of interest are seen to varying amounts of tourism amongst the Black Sea and its huge saline content, which brings in a leveled amount of income in the tourism sectors of the Dobruja region, i.e. Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine."

"Basseterre , is the capital city of the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis, also called St Kitts and Nevis, in the West Indies. ""Basseterre"" port is at , on the south western coast of Saint Kitts Island. It is one of the chief commercial depots of the Leeward Islands. The city is in the parish of Saint George Basseterre and the southern part of the parish of Saint Peter Basseterre. In 2000 about 15,500 people lived in the city."
Basseterre is one of the oldest towns in the Eastern Caribbean.
History.
"Basseterre was founded in 1627 by the French, under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. It was the capital of the French colony of Saint-Christophe. The colony was the most northern and most southern parts of the island of St. Kitts. The middle part was held by Britain. When Phillipe de Longviliers de Poincy was made the French governor of St. Kitts in 1639, the town turned into a large, successful port, commanding Eastern Caribbean trade and colonisation. De Poincy then quickly made Basseterre capital of the entire French West Indies colony, which included the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. It was the capital until his death in 1660. The city was made capital of the entire island of St. Kitts in 1727. This is when the French were pushed off the island and the British took full control."
"The city of Basseterre has one of the most tragic histories of any Caribbean capital, destroyed many times by colonial wars, fire, earthquakes, floods, riots and hurricanes. Despite all of this, a large number of well-restored buildings still exist in downtown Basseterre."
Geographical Setting and Climate.
Geography.
"The city of Basseterre is on a bay on the southwestern shore of St. Kitts, Basseterre Bay. The city is in the large Basseterre Valley, almost completely surrounded by lush green hills and mountains. It is mostly low-lying, which is one explanation for the name which the French gave it, Basseterre . However, the name Basseterre is also due to the fact that the island is on the lee of winds of the island, and is thus a safe anchorage. The name Capesterre, given to the region to the North, was dubbed so as it was facing the wind. Basseterre is surrounded by the Olivees Mountains to the north and the Conaree-Morne peaks to the east. The city is drained by the College River and the Westbourne River, which are locally known as ""ghauts"" and are dry most of the year. They even form streets in downtown Basseterre. This engineering folly has proven quite disastrous though, as College River has been the scene of many disastrous in Basseterre history. Port Zante, in the centre of the bay, is on of land reclaimed from the sea in 1995."
Climate.
"Under the Köppen climate classification, Basseterre features a tropical rainforest climate. Temperatures remain constant throughout the course of the year, 27 °C year-round. Basseterre has no dry season; all 12 months on average sees more than of precipitation. On average, of rain falls on the city annually."
Around town.
"Basseterre is a very small town which is laid out in a grid pattern. It has four main streets running east-west: Bay Road, Liverpool Row, Central Street and Cayon Street. The main street running north to south is Fort Street/Bank Street, which is home to the bulk of the island's main shops and banks. The city has 2 centres, at The Circus, which is geared towards tourism purposes, and the Independence Square, which contains the cathedral, courthouse and most of the older buildings."
"Basseterre is the main commercial and industrial centre of St. Kitts. It is also the country's main port of entry, for both sea and air travel, as well as the road and rail transport hub. It houses the administration buildings for the federal government (those for the island of Nevis are in Charlestown). It also houses the headquarters of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, as well as the headquarters for many other regional financial institutions."
"Despite its small size, Basseterre played host to Carifesta VII (the Caribbean Festival of Arts) in 2000, outbidding rivals many times its size. The city was able to outbid the United States of America, to host matches for the 2007 World Cricket Cup. The Warner Park Sporting Complex was the site of the allocated first round matches of the tournament. This made St. Kitts and Nevis the smallest country in the world ever to host a World Cup event."
"Basseterre and its environs are home to many small, American-owned medical schools such as Windsor University, and also two prestigious medical institutions founded by Robert Ross: the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine and the International University of Nursing. The city has four secondary schools, two of which are government owned, and two are private schools."
"It also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which means ""fun"" (""lollig"" means ""funny""). In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say ""utter nonsense"" in Welsh, they would say ""rwtsh lol"". LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging."
Toronto
Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario in Canada. It is also the largest city in both Ontario and Canada. It is found on the north-west side of Lake Ontario.
"The City of Toronto itself has a population of almost 3 million people. Even more people live in the regions around it. All together, the Greater Toronto Area is home to over 6 million people. This makes it the biggest metropolitan area in Canada."
History.
"Toronto was created in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe as the capital of what was then called ""Upper Canada"". At the time it was called the ""Town of York"" after the Duke of York. The name was changed to Toronto in 1834. With the Canadian Confederation in 1867, it became the capital of the newly created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with Montreal in Quebec) that wanted to be the capital of Canada. Queen Victoria decided that Ottawa should be the national capital because it was located between the two."
"As the 19th century moved on, the city began to grow. This was mainly because of immigration, where people from all over the world left their home and moved to Canada. Many of the immigrants were Irish people. They brought their Catholic faith with them when they left Ireland because of the Irish Potato Famine."
"During World War I and World War II, Toronto was used to train members of the Canadian Army. After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the Government of Ontario decided to create Metropolitan Toronto in 1954, combining a number of local municipalities. These were Old Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke, and Scarborough."
"By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. Because of that, the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a ""megacity"" in 1998. The first mayor of Toronto was Mel Lastman. As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events. These included World Youth Day in 2002, WorldPride in 2014, and the 2015 Pan American Games."
"On April 23, 2018 a white van collided with numerous pedestrians killing nine and injuring sixteen others at Yonge Street."
Climate.
"Toronto has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: ""Dfa"")."
Things to see and do.
"Toronto has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the lake is not big enough to keep its temperature mild."
"As the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of North America, Toronto is a popular destination for tourists. It is where you can find the CN Tower, which is the tallest free-standing (not supported) structure in the Americas and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. There are some other buildings, including the City Hall and the Rogers Centre, that are well known for their design style. There are many skyscrapers, because many large banks of Canada and other companies have their main offices in Toronto, and the Toronto Stock Exchange which is the biggest stock market in Canada."
"Because Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where the provincial government meets. Visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the legislature in Queen's Park. There are museums, including the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Ontario Science Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the suburbs of the city is the Toronto Zoo and Canada's Wonderland. Many visitors also like to go to Niagara Falls, just an hour's drive away from Toronto."
"Toronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the downtown area are shopping centres, including the Eaton Centre, St. Lawrence Market, and the Distillery District. There are several theatres, many which are run by the Mirvish family. The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, opened in June 2006, is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Across the harbor are the Toronto Islands, the best known of which is Centre Island."
"Toronto has many sports teams. Some of them belong to the most commonly-followed leagues in North America. They include the Toronto Maple Leafs in ice hockey (NHL) and the Toronto Raptors in basketball (NBA), both of which play in the Air Canada Centre. The nearby Rogers Centre is where the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team plays. BMO Field in Exhibition Place is home to the Toronto Argonauts in Canadian football and Toronto F.C., a soccer club."
"Toronto is a very multicultural city. Different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Little Tokyo, Greektown, Little Portugal, and other places where different cultures are kept alive. These people hold festivals where they share their culture with others. Among the most popular is the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), which happens every year in August."
Transport.
"Like many cities around the world, Toronto has an airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport. There are flights to many places in Canada and the rest of the world. The airport is just northwest of the city centre. Since 2015, there has been a train service, the Union Pearson Express. It goes from the airport to Downtown in less than half an hour."
"Toronto's main public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The main part of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system. That system includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped Line 1 and east–west Line 2. A light metro line also exists, exclusively serving the eastern district of Scarborough. A discussion is underway to replace it with a heavy-rail line. The TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars. The streetcars serve the downtown core. The buses provide service to many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network."
"The Government of Ontario also operates a commuter rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57 million annually. Most of them travel to or from Union Station. GO Transit is implementing RER (Regional Express Rail) into its system."
Housing.
Housing in Toronto was ranked as 10th-least affordable in the world. The study compared Toronto with ninety other metropolitan areas in different countries. Hong Kong came in as the least affordable place to live in.
English numerals
Here are some words for small numbers. Words in bold are irregular.
"When writing other numbers between 21 and 99, you must use a hyphen, like a minus sign (-)."
"The number 100 is written as ""one hundred"", but in general, sometimes people can say ""a hundred""."
"The way numbers are written and spoken differs between American English and other forms of English, such as British English and Australian English, as follows."
"In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency. During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal. Carter said that many places like ""Love Canals"" existed across the country. He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was ""one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era""."
"In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia."
Economy.
"Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president. He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession. His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth. In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs."
"The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose. Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down. There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis."
"Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed. The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety."
"In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States. This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s."
Healthcare.
"During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country."
"Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal, and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage. Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid. The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate, and later was not approved in the House."
"During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House. Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress."
Education.
"Carter worked with Congress to create an education department. In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments. On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department. On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education."
"Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families. In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas."
Foreign policies.
Peace treaties.
"In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty. The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999. This would remove United States control of the canal. The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal. The treaty was not popular with conservatives."
"In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David. The two agreements were signed at the White House. The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty."
Africa.
"Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries. Carter later said his plans for wanting ""to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe"" and to end racial issues like apartheid."
"Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country. He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria. Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia."
"On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia."
Iran hostage crisis.
"In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran."
"In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran. The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution. 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981. They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president. During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days. In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence. On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely. On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people."
Soviet Union.
"On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing. During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues. These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979."
"Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978. Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September. By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country. This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan. Carter was surprised by the invasion. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous. Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union. He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union. Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union. In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen. The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989."
South Korea.
"In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea. He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea. Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials. In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops. From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House."
1980 presidential election.
Democratic primary challenge.
"Korean uses two different writing systems. One is Hangul, the main alphabet. In North Korea, only Hangeul (Known as Choseongeul in North Korea) is used by law. In South Korea, only Hangeul should be used in most public areas like education, but the other system, Hanja, is still used in some newspapers and professional areas. Hanja is the system of Chinese characters that are used in Korean. It was the only way to write Korean before the creation of Hangeul in the 15th century, and it was common in novels before the 19th century."
"Although King Sejong the Great led the development of Hangeul to allow literacy to spread among common people and to create a writing system that represented the language more accurately than Hanja, it was not adopted by the upper classes of Koreans. Hanja would continue to be the official writing system until the late 19th century. Although it was rejected by the elite classes, Hangeul was used often by lower classes as a way to write down Korean literature and for lower classes to communicate."
Kansas
"Kansas () is a state in the Midwestern United States of America. The name of the state comes from the Kansa Native Americans, whose name comes from a Siouan-language phrase meaning ""people of the south wind"". The land that would become Kansas was bought in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Kansas's capital is Topeka, and its biggest city is Wichita."
"Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 when Fort Leavenworth was built. In the 1850s, many more people came to live in Kansas. This was also when people were fighting about slavery. People were allowed to move to Kansas in 1854 because of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. When this happened, anti-slavery Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery people from Missouri quickly came to Kansas. They wanted to decide whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Because of this, a lot of fighting happened, and it was known as Bleeding Kansas. The anti-slavery people won. On January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state."
"Kansas is in a region known as ""America's Breadbasket"". Like other states in this area, Kansas makes a lot of corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat; they make one-fifth of all wheat grown in the United States. Kansas has other industries too, including aviation and communications. Kansas has an area of , which is the 15th-biggest state by area. Kansas is also 34th most-populous of the 50 states because 2,913,314 people live there. People who live in Kansas are called ""Kansans"". Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest place at ."
The terrain of Kansas consists of prairies and forests. All of Kansas is in the Great Plains.
Etymology.
"The name ""Kansas"" comes from the Algonquian term, ""Akansa"", for the Quapaw people. These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who moved to Arkansas around the 13th century. The stem -""kansa"" is named after the Kaw people. They are also known as the ""Kansa"", a federally recognized Native American tribe."
History.
Early history.
"In 1539, Marcos de Niza, a friar, reported rumors of Cíbola, a city of gold, to Spanish colonial officials in Mexico City. Niza said the city was in modern-day New Mexico. In response to the rumors, two years later, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, with an army of 3000 Spaniards and 8001 Mexicans, marched northward from Culiacán in hopes of finding the city. When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico, he continued northeast into the Mississippi Valley, crossing the present area of Kansas diagonally. This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the Great Plains, including Kansas. Later, Juan de Oñate also traveled to Kansas in 1601."
"In 1682, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, Louis Hennepin and other French leaders took formal control of the Mississippi Valley, including the land that would become Kansas. This land, known as the Louisiana territory, was used to organize trade with Native Americans. In 1763, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain."
"Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into the Spanish Louisiana. The governor Luis de Unzaga 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the indians tribes, among the explorers were Antoine de Marigny and others who continued trading across the Kansas River, especially at its confluence with the Missouri River, tributaries of the Mississippi River."
"However, in 1803, Spain receded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. On April 30, 1803, Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. In the early 1800s, Kansas was used to hold Native Americans that were removed from their native lands."
Statehood.
"On May 30, 1854, the Congress signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Kansas-Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and Nebraska were both territories of the United States. It also stated that Kansans would vote on the legality of slavery."
"Upon hearing this, about 1,200 armed New Englanders came to Kansas to vote against slavery. However, thousands of southerners, mostly from Missouri, came to vote for slavery. The final vote was to make slavery legal, and Kansas adopted most of Missouri's slave laws. There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas. In one fight, John Brown and his men killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre. Later, Southerners destroyed Lawrence, Kansas. Kansas was called ""Bleeding Kansas""."
"Between 1854 and 1861, Kansas proposed four state constitutions. Out of the four proposed constitutions, three did not allow slavery. Finally, in July 1859, Kansas passed the Wyandotte Constitution, which was anti-slavery. The constitution for statehood was sent to the U.S. government in April 1860 to be voted on. The constitution was passed by the House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate. This is because southern voters in the Senate did not like that Kansas would become a state without slavery. In 1861, after the Confederate states formed, the constitution gained approval from the Union, and Kansas became a state."
Kansas in the Civil War.
"Four months after Kansas became a state, the Civil War started. Out of the 381 battles in the Civil War, four were fought in Kansas. Throughout the war, Kansas remained a Union state."
"On August 21, 1863, William Clarke Quantrill led a force of 300 to 400 Confederates into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill and his troops burned, looted, and destroyed the anti-slavery town. This battle became known as the Lawrence Massacre. In total, 164 Union soldiers and 40 Confederate soldiers died in the Lawrence Massacre. In the Battle of Mine Creek, on October 25, 1864, Union soldiers attacked Confederates as they were crossing the Mine Creek. The Union surrounded the Confederates, and captured 600 men and two generals. 1,000 Confederate soldiers and 100 Union soldiers died in the battle. In total, 8,500 people from Kansas died or were wounded in the Civil War."
Post Civil War.
"After the Civil War, many free slaves came to Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, between the years of 1879 and 1881, about 60,000 African Americans came to this region. This is because the slaves wanted economic opportunities, which they believed awaited them in Kansas. African Americans also came to Kansas for better political rights and to escape sharecropping. These people were called ""Exodusters."""
Recent history.
Dust Bowl.
"From 1930 to 1936, Kansas went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. During this time, Kansas had little rainfall and high temperatures. Thousands of farmers became very poor and had to move to other parts of the United States. In total, 400,000 people left the Great Plains area. The years from 1930 to 1940 was the only time the population of Kansas went down. The number of people living in Kansas decreased 4.3 percent."
"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas."
"During the 1950s, school segregation was required in fifteen U.S states. However, Kansas was not one of these states. Instead, school segregation was permitted by local option, but only in elementary schools. In 1896, the ruling from ""Plessy v. Ferguson"" stated that segregation was allowed, but equal facilities should be made available for blacks and whites. Often, however, black schools received less funding and had fewer textbooks than white schools."
"For these reasons, Linda Brown and her family sued the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Brown won the case, and the ruling was to overturn the ""Plessy v. Ferguson"" decision. This was considered by many a landmark case in the civil rights movement."
Geography.
"Angel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart."
Forced disappearance of Stuart Angel.
"Stuart Angel was an undergraduate student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's School of Economics when he joined the left-wing urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Movement 8th October (""Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro"" – MR-8). His fellow guerrillas gave him the codenames ""Paulo"" and ""Henrique"". He married fellow militant Sônia Maria Morais Angel Jones. His wife died in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police."
"Officers of the Air Force Information Center (""Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica"" – CISA arrested Stuart in the neighborhood of Grajaú, Rio de Janeiro on June 14, 1971. He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's exhaust pipe and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base. This caused him to die from rasphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. His body was never found."
Aftermath.
"Alex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death. Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to Ted Kennedy, who revealed the case during a speech at the United States Senate. Angel also handed a letter to Henry Kissinger, who was Secretary of State of the United States at the time. This letter was a translation of Polari's letter. She also gave Kissinger a copy of the twentieth volume of the book ""History of the Brazilian Republic"" by Hélio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed. According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier João Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death. The Minister of the Air Force, Márcio de Sousa Melo was also dismissed."
Death.
"Zuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976. The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of government involvement; the case was investigated by the Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96. This commission found many reasons to doubt the official version of events."
"In 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named"
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra, wrote the book Memories of a Dirty War. In this boo he details several crimes in which he took part and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the Riocentro May Day Attack, the death of Zuzu Angel and others."
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra was the director of the Department of Political and Social Order, known as DOPS at the time. This department was well-known, because it was often involved in torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearance. Guerra said that army Colonel Freddie Perdigão had been present at the scene when the accident happened. Perdigau was a known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdigão is seen standing close to the car. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published on the day of disaster but Perdigão had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the commission."
Homages and cultural references.
"Stuart Angel is the patron of Juventude Revolucionária 8 de Outubro, MR-8's youth branch. MR-8 is now a faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement."
"The lyrics of the song ""Cálice"", written by Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil make reference tp Stuart's probable death by asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In homage to Zuzu Angel, and other mothers who were unable to bury their children, Buarque wrote the song ""Angélica"" in 1977."
"In 2006, the events surrounding Stuart's death were dramatised in the ""movie Zuzu Angel"", directed by Sérgio Rezende. The movie, in which Daniel de Oliveira plays Stuart, is about Zuzu's struggle to find out the truth of her son's death."
"The Tunnel Dois Irmãos, which connects Gávea to São Conrado, the same place where Zuzu's car crashed, was renamed after her."

Gunpowder Plot
"The Gunpowder Conspiracy of 1605 was a plan to assassinate King James I of England and VI of Scotland. Other names for the plot are The Powder Treason or The Gunpowder Plot. A group of Catholics wanted to blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. This would have killed the king, and most of the Protestant aristocracy."
"The conspirators also planned to kidnap the royal children, and lead a popular revolt in the Midlands."
Origins.
"Robert Catesby led the planning of the conspiracy, which started in May 1604. The people who helped him were either rich Catholics, or gentry families who had a lot of influence. Catesby may have come up with the plot when he saw that there was little hope that Great Britain would become more tolerant to Roman Catholics, under King James I. Many Catholics were disappointed about the situation. It is more likely though that Catesby simply wanted to give the Catholics in England a chance: The plot was to be the first step of a rebellion. Afterwards, James' nine-year-old daughter (Princess Elizabeth) could be put in as a Catholic head of state."
"Other plotters were Thomas Winter (also spelled Wintour), Robert Winter, John Wright, Christopher Wright, Robert Keyes, Thomas Percy (also spelled Percye), John Grant, Ambrose Rokewood, Sir Everard Digby, Francis Tresham and Thomas Bates (Catesby's servant). The explosives were prepared by Guy ""Guido"" Fawkes, a man with 10 years military experience. Fawkes had fought with the Spanish against the Dutch in the Spanish Netherlands."
"The main Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet was said to know the details of the plot. Oswald Tesimond, a fellow Jesuit had told him. Robert Catesby confessed them to Tesimond, and gave him the permission to tell Garnet. Although he was convicted, there has since been some debate over how much Garnet really knew. As the details of the plot were known through confession, Garnet was not allowed to reveal them to the authorities. He did not think it was a good idea. Nevertheless, the plot went ahead. Garnet's opposition to it did not save him from being hanged, drawn and quartered for treason in 1606, though."
Planning.
"In the 17th century, the Palace of Westminster was made of many buildings, spread over a large area. They were grouped around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the old royal palace. This palace housed both Parliament and the various law courts. The palace was also easier to access than it is today. Merchants, lawyers, and other people lived and worked on the palace grounds."
"As a member of the King's Bodyguard, Percy was able to lease rooms next to the House of Lords, in May 1604. The plotters' original idea was to dig their way under the foundations of the Lords chamber to put the gunpowder there. The main idea was to kill James, but many other important targets would be present, including most of the Protestant nobility and senior bishops of the Church of England. Guy Fawkes, as ""John Johnson"", was put in charge of this building, where he posed as Percy's servant. Catesby's house in Lambeth was used to store the gunpowder with the tools for digging."
"However, the Black Plague came back to London in the summer of 1604 and proved to be particularly severe. For this reason, the opening of Parliament was changed to 1605. By Christmas Eve, the miners had still not reached the buildings of Parliament, and just as they restarted work early in 1605, they learned that the opening of Parliament had been further postponed to 3 October. The plotters then took the opportunity to row the gunpowder up the Thames from Catesby's house in Lambeth, to hide it in their new rented house: they had learned (by chance) that a coal merchant named Ellen Bright had vacated a ground-floor undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords chamber. Presented with this golden opportunity, Percy immediately took pains to secure the lease. He created the story that his wife would join him in London and that he would need the extra storage space."
"Fawkes assisted in filling the room with gunpowder, which was hidden beneath a wood store under the House of Lords building, in a cellar leased from John Whynniard. By March 1605, they had filled the undercroft underneath the House of Lords with 36 barrels of gunpowder, hidden under a store of winter fuel. Had all 36 barrels been successfully ignited, the explosion could easily have reduced many of the buildings in the Old Palace of Westminster complex to rubble, and would have blown out windows in the surrounding area of about a one kilometre radius."
"The conspirators left London in May, and went to their homes or to different areas of the country, because being seen together would arouse suspicion. They arranged to meet again in September; however, the opening of Parliament was again postponed."
"The disease is named after Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs who first described the disease in the late 19th century. After the discovery, he noticed a red spot on the retina of a one year old child. The child was experiencing the same symptoms of the disease. Bernard Sachs was a neurologist from the United States. He was the first person to describe the cellular changes from the disease. In 1969, researchers discovered that Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A."
Joseph Swan
"Sir Joseph Wilson Swan (31 October 1828–27 May 1914) was an English physicist and chemist who was well known because he created the incandescent light bulb, about a year before Thomas Edison. His house was the first in the world to be lit by electric light bulbs."
"In 1904, Swan was knighted, awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. He had already received the highest award in France, the Légion d'honneur, when he visited an international exhibition in Paris in 1881. The exhibition included exhibits of his inventions, and the city was lit with electric light, thanks to Swan's invention."
Atom Egoyan
"Atom Egoyan, OC () (born July 19, 1960) is a Canadian-Armenian movie maker. His work often explores themes of alienation and isolation.

Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office. Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business. His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going. He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business. Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful."
"Georgia State Senator, 1963–1967."
"Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country. By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board. At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools."
"In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate. At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County. Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won."
"Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused. Carter did not say anything about this at first. He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution. When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it ""the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died""."
"Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission."
"When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election. The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college. Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus."
"Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term. For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term. Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program. The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives."
1966 and 1970 campaigns for governor.
"Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway. However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia. Callaway became a Republican in 1964. Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway. In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox."
Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970. Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.
Teuku Iskandar
"Teuku Iskandar is an Indonesian scholar, literary critic, and lexicographer. Teuku Iskandar is one of the native Indonesians (Acehnese) who are eager to explore the books that record the Sumatra's civilizations (mainly Acehnese and Malay)."
Biography.
Background.
"Teuku Iskandar was born at Trienggadeng, Pidie, Aceh (part of modern-day Indonesia). He is a native Acehnese who was born to a father who are an ""uleebalang"" ( 'district chief' in Acehnese) in Aceh."
Early life.
"In 1947, a day after Queen Juliana appointed as regent, the 18-year-old Teuku Iskandar was able to continue his study at Leiden University in Leiden (part of Netherlands."
"In 1955, he earned his doctorate from Leiden University with a dissertation which was later published as a book, ""De Hikajat Atjeh"" ( 'Acehnese Annals'). Topics related to Aceh has became his personal interest, which also became his dissertation. His insterest is mainly driven by his personal background because at that time he was part of the first generation of Acehnese who studied at Leiden University. Moreover, at that time there were not as many Acehnese books written by native Indonesians. In addition, Teuku Iskandar adore the Acehnese culture so much, as he told to his children."
1960s.
"In the 1960s, Teuku Iskandar asked by Sukarno (the first president of Indonesia) to be part of the founders of a state university in Aceh which later known as Syiah Kuala University and briefly served as the dean for the Faculty of Economics for several years."
Studies.
"His diligence in studying Malay literature and culture in Sumatra attracted another countries interest, such as Malaysia who had no capable scholars at that time as newly created country, he is offered to work at the ""Dewan Pustaka dan Bahasa"" ( 'Language and Library Council') of Malaysia. During his tenure, Teuku Iskandar asked by Malaysia's linguistic council to copied the ""Bahasa Indonesia dan Pembakuannya"" ( 'Indonesian Language and its Standardization') and ""Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia"" ( 'Great Dictionary of Indonesian Language') who are developed by Raja Ali Haji (an Indonesian scholar) since 19th century and Anton Moeliono in 1969 to re-branded and claimed it as the ""Kamus Dewan"" ( 'Dictionary of Malay Language') that published in 1970 to became the main linguistic reference for Malay language. At the same time, he was also asked by the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam to become a lecture at the University of Brunei Darussalam and he received a professorship from the university. His works are still used as the main linguistic source for Standard Malay until nowadays."
Return to Leiden.
"Teuku Iskandar later returned to Leiden to give lecture. At his alma mater (Leiden University), he became a professor for Acehnese and Malay literature, and also gave special classes in the Acehnese language. As a Acehnese lover, he also continues to produce his works related to Aceh including the Catalog of Acehnese Manuscripts compiled with Voorhoeve, two large volumes of the Catalog of Malay, Minangkabau and South Sumatra, and Manuscripts in the Netherlands."
Perspectives from his daughters.
"Studying classical literary manuscripts is a job that not many people can do. It takes passion, perseverance, thoroughness and high concentration. But indeed, such qualities seem to be attached to Teuku Iskandar. ""Dad really likes history and art"", said Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar who are the second daughter of Teuku Iskandar. Teuku Iskandar is very thorough even in reading the books he referenced."
"As a close daughter, Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar often found his father's handwritten notes in reference books, which indicated that the information in the books could be referenced or questioned. Ubit also said that his father is the type of person who reads and contemplates a lot. Despite his abundant knowledge, he is not an 'outsider' or talkative person. Not all of his interlocutors can also make him interested in talking. But if he meets someone he thinks is sharp-minded, this father of three will be an extraordinary storyteller. “When there is a moment like that, my mother usually asks me to bring a recording device to save the interesting conversation,” recalls Ubit."
"Teuku Iskandar is also a scholar and person who holds principles. He's not the kind of person who wants to please others but rather be himself. In Ubit's eyes, his father was not interested in politics even though he loved Sumatran (especially Acehnese and Malay) culture very much, he was an intellectual who carried himself as a citizen of the world. Also not many people know that Teuku Iskandar is very fond of architectural history. According to Ubit, it can be said that his father's first love was precisely in architecture. However, because his chemistry skills were not sufficient to become a scholar of architecture, he then chose to study literature."
Architecture.
"Teuku Iskandar's passion for architecture can be found in his residence in Jakarta which he designed himself. He also built a rest house with an English garden-style garden in Bogor, which he also designed his own architecture. At his home in the Netherlands, Teuku Iskandar designed a fireplace made of wood from a bridge from the 17th century with Acehnese decorations. One of his other hobbies is sketching. Teuku also once conveyed his dream to his sons and daughters, he wanted to build a farmhouse in Aceh. ""I have a dream (to develop) in Aceh"", Ubit remembers his father."
Translations.
"In one of his works, a book that discusses ""Bustanas-Salatin"" by Nuruddin ar-Ranniry, Teuku Iskandar asked Ubit to translate it into English. For years, father and daughter studied books by 17th century clerics who were read by scholars and sultans in the Kingdom of Aceh. For Ubit, it was a wonderful experience that was unforgettable."
Reputation.
"As a respected scholar (mainly in Indonesia), Teuku Iskandar is a very down-to-earth person. Cut Rosmanida, his first daughter who lived in Medan, said, “Father is a humble and simple person. His demeanor is mediocre. When you go home to Aceh, you always ask for Acehnese food to be cooked. He likes all Acehnese dishes.” A valuable lesson from his father that he always reminded him to be proud to be Acehnese and proud to speak Acehnese language."
Awards.
"Teuku Iskandar awarded with the ‘""Satyalancana Budaya""’ award by the national government of the Republic Indonesia due to his revolutionary and persistent works especially in terms of Sumatra's linguistic and culture (mainly Acehnese and Malay). Responding to the award given by the government to his father, Cut Rosmanida expressed his gratitude. “I am happy and excited that my dad are one of the recipients of the award. I thank God and thank the government (for these honour)"", said Cut Rosmanida beaming."

Sally Yates
"Sally Caroline Quillian Yates (born August 20, 1960 in Atlanta) is an American lawyer. She studied at the University of Georgia and was the acting Attorney General of the United States from January 20, 2017 through January 30, 2017. She was also serving as Deputy Attorney General from March 2015 until her dismissal on January 30, 2017."
Early life and education.
"Yates was born in Atlanta to John Kelley Quillian (1930–1986), an attorney and judge who was a judge on the Georgia Court of Appeals between 1966 and 1984, and his wife, Xara ""Mickey"" DeBeaugrine Quillian (née Terrell; 1931–2012), an interior designer. Her grandmother had been one of the first women admitted to the Georgia Bar; however, she was not hired as an attorney, instead working as a legal secretary for Yates's grandfather."
"Yates attended the University of Georgia, receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1982. In 1986, she earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Georgia School of Law, graduating magna cum laude. While in law school, Yates was the executive editor of the ""Georgia Law Review""."
Dismissal as Acting Attorney General.
"On January 30, 2017, President Donald Trump fired her after saying she won't defend his executive order on the immigration ban."
Sally Yates explained her decision not to defend the executive order in the following letter to the DOJ employees:
"""On January 27, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order regarding immigrants and refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries. The order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions. As the Acting Attorney General, it is my ultimate responsibility to determine the position of the Department of Justice in these actions."""
"""My role is different from that of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which, through administrations of both parties, has reviewed Executive Orders for form and legality before they are issued. OLC’s review is limited to the narrow question of whether, in OLC’s view, a proposed Executive Order is lawful on its face and properly drafted. Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order’s purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just."""
"""Similarly, in litigation, DOJ Civil Division lawyers are charged with advancing reasonable legal arguments that can be made supporting an Executive Order. But my role as leader of this institution is different and broader. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful."""
"""Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so."""
2015 Confirmation Hearing.
"A career prosecutor in Atlanta who has served under both Republican and Democrat administrations, Sally Yates has been hailed as a hero by both parties. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, introduced her at her confirmation hearing in 2015."
"“She will be a hero of the American people, a hero of what’s right,” Mr. Isakson said at the time. “She’ll call them like she sees them, and she will be fair, and she will be just.”"
"At those hearings, Republicans were furious about former President Barack Obama's order liberalizing immigration policy and questioned Ms. Yates about whether she would be willing to stand up to the president. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, was particularly pointed in his questioning."
"“If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say 'No?’” Mr. Sessions asked."
"""I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,” Ms. Yates replied."
Sylvia Mathews Burwell
"Sylvia Mathews Burwell was born June 23, 1965 and served as the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2014 to 2017. Previously she was the Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2013 to 2014."
"She was nominated by President Barack Obama on April 11, 2014, to the position of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services after Kathleen Sebelius resigned. Burwell's nomination was confirmed by the Senate on June 5, 2014 by a vote of 78-17."

"Veil died in Paris on 30 June 2017, aged 89."
United States Deputy Attorney General
The United States Deputy Attorney General is the second highest ranking official in the United States Department of Justice. The Deputy Attorney General manages the day-to-day activities of the Department of Justice. It may act as Attorney General during the absence of the Attorney General. President of the United States appoints the Deputy Attorney General with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The Office of the Deputy Attorney General was created in 1950.
"In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice."
"Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce."
"In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020."
"In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021."
Hydroxychloroquine.
"Some people think hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients."
"United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In early April, the ""New York Times"" reported that President Trump has ""a small personal financial interest"" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth."
"In early April, Fauci said, ""The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect."" Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems. Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis. Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk."
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine. They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment. Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects. Both studies were published in May 2020.
Remdesivir.
"Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against some viruses. Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away."
"In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works."
"The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies."
"In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive."
Clayton Christensen
"Clayton Magleby Christensen (April 6, 1952January 23, 2020) was an American academic, businessman, and religious leader. He was the Kim B. Clark Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School of Harvard University. He was best known for his theory of ""disruptive innovation"". His best known work is the 1997 book ""The Innovator's Dilemma""."
Christensen was also a co-founder of Rose Park Advisors.
"Christensen died on January 23, 2020 from leukemia treatment-related problems in Boston at the age of 67."

"By marrying Hafsa, Muhammad strengthened the ties between two of his closest Companions, the two who would become the first two rightly guided khalifs after his death. He was now married to the daughter of Abu Bakr, A'isha, and to the daughter of Umar, Hafsa."
Zaynab bint Khuzayma.
"She offered herself in marriage to Muhammad who accepted her proposal and married her. Zaynab bint Khuzayma was seen by the community as very generous to orphans and the poor, later becoming known as the 'Mother of the Poor'. She died only eight months after."
Umm Salama.
"She was not the only wife to have been widowed as a result of the battle of Uhud, and because of this marriage, many of the Companions followed Muhammad's example, marrying widows and bringing them and their children into the circle of their families, instead of leaving them to struggle on their own."
Zaynab bint Jahsh.
"As with all the marriages of Muhammad, there was much for all the Muslims to learn from it. This one was to show that Zayed ibn Haretha was not Muhammad's son and to demonstrate that the social level matters when it comes to marriage. She bragged about the fact that her marriage had been arranged by Allah. It was at this point that Muhammad changed her name from Barra to Zaynab."
Juwayriyya bint al-Harith.
"Muhammad was thinking of how to save her and all her tribe from danger. By marrying Juwayriyya, the Banu Mustaliq would be able to enter Islam with honor, and with the humiliation of their recent defeat removed, so that it would no longer be felt necessary by them to embark on a war of vengeance that would have continued until one of the two parties had been annihilated."
Ramla bint Abi Sufyan.
"She said that once Muhammad said to her, ""A house will be built in Heaven for anyone who, in the space of a day and a night, prays twelve voluntary prayers;"" and she added, ""I have never stopped doing this since"""
Safiyya bint Huyayy.
"The only person who could save her from becoming a slave after having enjoyed such a high position was Muhammad. Although her father had planned to assassinate Muhammad after the battle of Uhud and had conspired with the Banu Qurayza to exterminate all the Muslims during the battle of al-Khandaq. Muslims believe that this was characteristic of Muhammad, as he is believed to not have any grudges."
Maymunah bint al-Harith.
"Muhammad gave her the name, Maymuna, meaning ""blessed"", and Maymuna lived with Muhammad for just over three years, until his death. She was said to be very good-natured and is said to have got on well with everyone and no quarrel or disagreement with any of Muhammad's other wives has been related to her. Aisha said, ""Among us, she had the most fear of Allah and did the most to maintain ties of kinship."""
Maria al-Qibtiyya.
"Maria is said to have been honored and respected by Muhammad and his family and Companions. She spent three years of her life with Muhammad, until his death, and died five years later. For the last five years of her life, she remained a recluse and almost never went out except to visit the grave of Muhammad or her son's grave. After her death, Umar ibn al Khattab led the prayer over her and she was buried in al Baqi."

Notes
Ford Mustang
"The Ford Mustang is a very popular American sports car built by the Ford Motor Company beginning in 1964. The first cars were built in Ford's Dearborn, Michigan factory on March 9 of that year and the car was first shown to the public on April 17 at the New York World's Fair. It did not cost a lot of money, but it was still very fancy and looked like a much more expensive car. People could order their Mustang with many options and body styles, such as a convertible, 2+2 (fastback), or coupe. Many different engines were available, from the 170 CID six-cylinder to some of Ford's biggest and most powerful V-8 engines in later years. This meant car buyers could have a Mustang that saved gas or a more powerful and fast car. More than one million Mustangs were sold in only two years. The Mustang is still being sold today and is still very popular. It was so popular and so different when it was introduced that the Mustang and other cars from other makers which looked like the Mustang were given the name ""ponycar."""
"The so-called ""1964 1/2"" Mustang was designed by Joe Oros and Dave Ash of Ford's Mercury division, was based on another Ford car, the Falcon and was proposed by Ford's president, Lee Iacocca. The Falcon was not expensive to build and that helped Iacocca get the Mustang the approval it needed to be built. The people who ran the Ford company did not want to take a chance on a car like that because they lost a lot of money on another car, the Edsel, just a few years back. It set sales records and became one of the best selling cars of all time. It would remain mostly the same until 1966. So popular was the Mustang that three Ford assembly plants worked to build it. Not only was the Mustang built in Dearborn, but in Metuchen, New Jersey and San Jose, California as well."
"The very first Mustang built to be sold to the public was a white convertible with a black interior and a V-8 engine. It was purchased by a pilot from Newfoundland. Ford offered the one millionth Mustang to the owner in exchange for the first one. That first Mustang, serial number 5F08F100001, is still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn."
"Its second bodystyle came out in 1967, its third in 1969 and its fourth in 1971. Bigger, more powerful engines were offered starting in 1967, making some Mustangs into musclecars. Some of those special Mustangs had special names such as Mustang GT, Mach 1, Boss 302, Boss 351, Boss 429 and 429 SCJ, or ""Super Cobra Jet."" By 1971, the Mustang had become a much larger car. The car grew in size so that Ford could put its biggest engines in it, but insurance companies were charging very high prices to insure powerful cars and sales began to drop. Many people missed the original, smaller Mustang."
"A new second generation Mustang came out in 1974 called Mustang II and was based on the Ford Pinto, although far less than the original car had been based on the Falcon. This new car was almost the same size as the original car, but emissions controls and the Arab oil embargo meant that the Mustang II was not a very powerful car. 1974 was not only the first time Ford had built a car which looked like an older model, it was also the first American car to be built on the metric system. The short, low hood meant that neither the inline six-cylinder engine nor V-8 would fit, so engine choices were changed to a 2.3 liter four-cylinder engine built by Ford in Brazil and a more expensive V-6 engine built by Ford in Germany. A 5.0 liter V-8 engine was offered in 1975 which meant that Ford engineers had to redesign much of the car to make it fit. No matter which engine was used, the Mustang II was a heavier car than the 1964-66 model."
"The Mustang II helped keep the ponycar alive between 1974 and 1978. General Motors almost stopped building their popular Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird; Chrysler Corporation stopped building the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda during that time. General Motors stopped building the Camaro in 2002, but they brought back a new version in 2009. Chrysler brought back a new Challenger in 2008 as well; they, like today's Mustang, are made to look like older models."
"The new third generation Mustang that came out in 1979 may have been the most important Mustang ever. One reason was the return of a powerful V-8 in 1982 which was developed in later years into an even more powerful engine. The basic design continued all the way through the 1993 model year, with a fourth generation launching for the 1994 model year but still using the platform of the old car, but with hundreds of thousands of improvements over the years, very few parts except for some minor chassis parts stayed unchanged."
"The 2005 model was the first all-new Mustang since 1979. Because the original Mustang was and is one of the most popular cars ever, Ford made the new Mustang coupe and convertible look very much like the first Mustangs, especially the 1967 and 1968 models. The engines of the 2005 Mustang were based on the older engines, but had more power. The 4.0-liter V6 engine made 210 hp and the 4.6-liter V8 300 hp, which rose to 315 hp on the 2008 Bullitt. All models were available with manual and automatic transmissions."
"Both Ford and Carroll Shelby recently brought back the a new version of the very fast Shelby GT-500 Mustang in 2007. Mr. Shelby helped create the special Shelby GT-350 and GT-500 versions of the Mustang beginning in 1965. The 2007 Shelby GT500 had a 5.4-liter V8, which produced 500 hp. In 2008 a KR version with 540 hp was added."
"The 2010 Mustang in turn looks much like the 2005-09 model, but all the body parts except for the roof are different. The rear turn signals of the 2005-2010 cars blink in a one-two-three sequence like the 1967-68 Mercury Cougar and 1964-66 Ford Thunderbird. Power for the V8 rose to 315 hp. In 2011, the Mustang received new engines, a 3.7-liter V6 base engine with 305 hp and a new 5.0-liter engine with 412 hp. Power on the Shelby GT500 rose to 550 hp and later to 662 hp in 2013. A Boss 302 performance version powered by a 444 hp V8 was introduced for 2012."
"For 2015, a completely new Ford Mustang was introduced. This included a 5.0 V8 engine which produced 435hp, and was really a stylish and morden look."
"Oh, I think, I don't think so."
"I, I think that, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it,"
"because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know."
It's a hundred meter.
"Oh, absolutely."
"And, uh, uh, but automobile races"
"if it,"
"I don't think they'd ever,"
it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.
They're not going to ...
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
They're not going to change that to meters.
It will always be.
Yeah.
"And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh,"
"you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold."
"How many ounces of gold, you know."
Twelve.
"I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something."
"It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header."
"And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce."
Yeah.
There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.
Yeah.
"Now that makes, you know."
Yeah.
"And, and is that going to change too?"
"Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton"
and then there's a ton.
But what's a metric ton?
"Uh,"
I don't know.
I don't remember.
"I, I read it."
And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?
Yeah.
"And, and then, but then the medicine."
"And, and some of these other things"
"and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas,"
milliliter.
It's all metric all ready.
Yeah.
"And, and so, um, but, but when you go to order a drink, um, you know. say, they, they, I don't know, it's uh ..."
And what will a shot be?
Will a shot be an ounce?
I don't know.
"And, and, but, you know, when you go to the store and, and you're trying to figure, you know, well this box is, is, uh, is, is twelve ounces"
"and, and this one's, uh, uh, three pounds, um,"
and you ...
"And the other one's two point one kis,"
"and, and you're, you're lost."
That's right.
"And, and I don't know."
"I, I think that, I, I think, I think the Federal government is going to, more or less, leave it alone."
"I think they've got, I think there are more pressing problems."
"Oh, yeah."
The economy.
Yes.
"Uh, what I was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it. Uh,"
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling.
Personal tools to be able to do his job.
Yeah.
"But, but are, are the tools that, uh,"
Yes.
it is a mental thing.
It is a conversion thing.
"It's like a mill, you know."
"We, we do, uh, um, well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on on semiconductor devices."
Right.
"And well, what's a mill"
and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric."
We have a eighty-nine Chevy Blazer.
"And before that we had a Horizon. Uh, you know, Plymouth Horizon?"
Yeah.
And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.
"Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field,"
"for why, why, why pieces,"
"could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't."
"Uh, okay."
The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.
"Oh, okay."
"And the starter was Bosch American,"
so.
"The bolts were, were were, were English then."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"It was, it was annoying."
"One, one half of the starter you know, three bolts on the starter"
and two of them were American
and one of them was metric.
Now that's strange.
"And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator"
"Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream."
That's pretty tough
What area do you live in?
I live in Houston.
"Oh, okay."
I see.
Is that pretty typical for your area?
"Well, for the neighborhood I'm in,"
"yeah,"
Yeah.
"This is one of the more established neighborhoods,"
Huh-uh.
That sounds real interesting.
I live in a suburb of Dallas
"and, uh, I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home."
"So, at least, I have two bathrooms."
"That's not so bad,"
"but, uh, it's pretty typical for the area, as well."
"Uh, I've always been interested in older homes, personally."
"So, I think you can end up doing more with them, it seems like."
What about yard space?
"Do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that?"
The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.
"Oh, I see."
"About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden."
Huh-uh.
"Oh, that's nice."
"Because I have just like a very small, you know, those basic tract houses, like that."
We have a very small yard
"and, um, I do have garden,"
"but it's extremely small,"
"but, uh, it seems like, though, for your area that, that is sort of different."
"I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,"
"but before that, I really, there's not much time."
Right.
Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.
"Right,"
"well, our,"
"yeah,"
"if our if our grandchildren are with us, that's, they have to watch that."
We don't watch it unless they're here
Uh-huh.
"No,"
I like that.
"No,"
"I'll watch, game show kind of stuff"
"But they, uh,"
"but, Yeah."
"It's, it's, um, oh,"
"and, you know, the, the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS."
We've wound up sending in one.
That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do
Did you send one?
Yeah.
My oldest grandson pulling his tooth.
"He's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,"
How funny.
"and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,"
"and he bit into it,"
and it was just hanging by a thread.
"And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,"
"and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would because he wouldn't let anybody pull it."
"And he he wound up pull,"
So do you have P C
I mean they were so rude about it.
Right.
And so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said well it's not guaranteed.
"And I said, well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed"
so do it anyway.
Uh-huh.
So we got the kind we wanted
and I was really disappointed with that.
I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
Uh-huh.
and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
and I called there to see if they had it
and the lady was very nice.
"And I said my goodness,"
"I said you've been very nice, what's your name."
And she told me
and I said well I really appreciate it.
"I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that, store"
and it turned out she was the assistant manager
"so,"
Right.
"So I felt kind of good about that, you know."
I didn't  even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
Uh-huh.
Right.
"but I just felt like, well at least I did something."
Maybe they'll fix it.
"They might work on that, you know."
"Right,"
right.
But I find attitudes are more of a problem.
"My husband is a counselor,"
"and he works, mostly with adolescents."
"Oh, you know a lot about that."
"So yeah,"
I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.
Uh-huh.
"But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,"
and then they start a drug problem.
Yeah.
"It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
"I know,"
I'm glad of that.
"And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters on so far,"
"that's my conference call,"
I have one daughter still at home.
One's at U T
"and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night."
"Oh, well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that,"
"No,"
"no,"
"I don't care about that,"
she'll be on the phone all night.
"Yeah,"
"it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather."
Right.
Do you have children?
No
"not yet,"
"we're expecting a baby in July,"
"Oh, great,"
so we're starting.
I guess you would consider that a home repair.
Huh-uh.
"Certainly, uh, uh,"
"and interesting enough, this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition."
"What is your most recent,"
"We just did that, too."
"You did that recently too, uh,?"
Yes.
Does it make a big difference?
"Oh, yes"
we have brick on the outside
"and, uh, the colors that were there changed the, and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house."
Huh-uh.
Completely.
That's neat isn't it.
Yeah.
That was really exciting.
It was fun.
"I was really, really tired of the color."
"That it's, it's helping."
"We're not quite through,"
"but it's, it really is looking good."
"Uh, we went through a process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had,"
"probably the most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do."
"Um, we didn't have very much money"
"and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process,"
"but we learned how to do, uh, retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual."
Huh-uh.
So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house.
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, we did that a different color also."
Yeah.
"the I've got my beans, peas,"
Yeah.
"I've got some onions out,  tomatoes,"
Yeah.
I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year.
I never have much luck with tomatoes.
"I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, uh, bugs get on them so easily"
"and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,"
"so, the only thing that I use is soap."
"I water, you know, spray the plants, because they say, supposedly, that will keep the bugs off them."
"But, uh, I don't have luck with that tomato plant,"
so I hate to spray them with anything.
"Um, what do you do?"
Do you have any tips you could give me?
"Um, my favorite one is putting on the, um, tomato plant is to put, uh, dust,"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,"
That's true.
That's true.
My dad is a farmer
"so, I've heard him talk about that forever."
"I guess it works,"
"but, um, you have to really wash your vegetables after that"
so it won't make you sick.
Let's see what else do you do to your house?
"Well, I've done some rewiring on it."
Yeah.
"Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house."
"Oh, really."
"Do you plan on like adding any rooms or,"
you have enough space
They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.
They like to play.
Um.
Especially with the kids.
They love to play with kids.
"Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?"
"No,"
he's pretty much an inside dog.
Um.
He stays in.
"We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much"
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.
"Oh, really?"
He's really a wimp.
"And when it comes to being alone,"
"uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,"
but he does not like to be tied outside.
"He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark."
"Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?"
"No,"
"he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well"
"and, uh, he knows where our yard is"
"and we have a pretty small yard,"
but he seems to know the boundaries.
Um.
"And he usually is good about staying within them,"
"although our next door neighbors have a dog, too"
"and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog."
"Oh, yeah?"
And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
"but, he's pretty good."
He stays out of the street
"this, this town was like less than ten thousand people"
and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas.
"And, you know, I didn't move out of there until I was, you know, twenty-seven"
"and that was just, you know,"
so I love the big city
"You know, I had lived in a rural area for, for so long"
"so I've enjoyed it,"
"but, uh, it can, it can get kind of tough."
Its like a rat race sometimes.
That's just something I'll never adapt to.
"I don't, I don't want to be a part of the rat race."
I want to be basically just kind of left alone.
Yeah
"If I want to sit around and mess with my garden, I'll mess with my garden,"
Yeah.
"if I want to work in the flower beds,"
Yeah.
It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.
"I, I,"
Very much.
yeah.
I really do enjoy that.
But I haven't planted anything yet
"or, you know, I usually have gotten flowers coming out the"
"but I, I haven't done that, yet."
I've had finals this week.
"So, uh,  you know, I'm just kind of trying to, trying to stick in with that,"
Huh-uh.
"but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe I can, I can get this yard in shape."
Do you do a lot of gardening?
"Uh, landscaping is more, than the gardening,"
Yeah.
"I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas,"
"and you know, all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, you know,"
"it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I was up there last weekend,"
"and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on,"
"and they're green,"
but they're dead
"You know, the, the freeze just got them."
"They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,"
"and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all."
"Not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all."
Really weird this year.
"I'm not sure what that, what that means."
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now."
I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
"So you, you all actually had some color, huh?"
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
It kind of crept in
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"we, we did, for a time."
"Yeah,"
it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Gorgeous.
"That's, you know,"
"I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not,"
"and you could, you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same."
"and that's the other issue. Uh,"
the pitch and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well and thread,"
"Uh, I don't go to the movies a whole lot,"
"but, uh, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie."
I haven't seen that yet.
"I, I, I hear,"
"we, a whole bunch of us were going to go see it."
"It's playing at school actually in about two weeks, I guess."
So we're going to go see that.
But you enjoyed that?
"Yeah,"
"it's, it's something that, uh,"
"my brother lives over in Fort Worth,"
"and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,"
"and he said, Well I'll wait until it comes out on, uh, tape and rent, rent the video."
"And I said, no,"
this is not one that you want to do that with.
"That's what I heard,"
yeah.
"It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen."
"It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,"
"it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing picture."
"Yeah,"
"I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos."
"No,"
"it's one I think,"
"but, you know, every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,"
this is my favorite movie.
"Well, this is the one for me this time."
"and on the water pump, it was all metric."
"And, and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, uh  screw lock uh, uh, radiator hose clamps."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Essentially they do that though
"because if, if you look at General Motors, the size"
"and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler."
"If they all went, if they all went metric,"
"but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, when you're milling something, uh  you simply set your, uh, equipment,"
Yeah.
"or, or you or you got your calipers there"
"and, and you measure, you know,"
you mic it to see if it's accurate
and.
Right.
It's it's not a problem either way.
No.
"Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car."
Yeah.
And you go to look at it
"and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric."
Yeah.
"and, and, you're never quite sure,"
"well, is that a metric bolt."
"You get you a pair of metric pliers, right"
"Right,"
right.
And you beat on it
and a metric hammer
"It, it can be annoying"
"and my other concern is, is the American government going to force us to go."
"Do you hear, the, the beep in the background."
Yes.
"Oh, that's a, an ambulance or something going on here, I think."
Okay.
"Where, Where are you,"
I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.
"and, uh,"
In Manhattan.
Are you at home now?
"Yeah,"
I'm at home.
So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
Uh-huh.
"So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear."
So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.
"Um, yeah,"
"and often times that,"
"I can't talk on can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call."
What time is it now where you are?
"Uh, about twenty after four."
So you're an hour ahead of where I am.
I'm in Central Central time zone.
"Okay,"
yeah
we're Eastern.
"And, um, what did, did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems?"
"No,"
I haven't done that.
"Uh, I know someone who has,"
"and, and she's, uh, very, uh, pleased with it."
"She told me some of the things you can do,"
"and it's just a, a very handy tool to have."
Uh-huh.
"And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,"
"but telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I know when I do telemarketing, um, I'm a soft person,"
"if, if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out."
Uh-huh.
"And I make very good sales,"
"but I'm not, uh, as I said, I'm not half as pushy as these people because, I don't really care."
"I mean, if, if they're not interested fine."
You know that's it.
You can't force them to be.
Right.
No.
"And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, uh, I don't think is a good item anyway."
Uh-huh.
That I don't think I could do anyway.
"But I feel like, oh, movie stars, or"
"sure, it's part of their, I guess they're portray being a movie star"
they get themselves in these rag sheets
"but, uh, I think they go too far."
"Oh, yeah"
I think that's invasion of privacy.
because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day.
Yeah
And you know they do Ted Kennedy.
"Oh, yeah."
"Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,"
so it's a different story then.
"You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon."
"He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air, you know."
And he has a chauffeur.
"I'm, I'm fairly newly married."
I've only been married less than two years
Uh-huh.
"and before that, I never owned a home or anything,"
so I never had any deductions.
"Right,"
right.
"So, really, it was always just money thrown away."
Thrown away.
"Yeah,"
jeez.
"And I never really thought about it because,"
You were good at it
"Yeah,"
"I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um, became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I suspect that, you know, thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, you know, the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, you know, just don't talk about it."
Yeah.
"Most, most people don't like to talk about money."
"They feel uncomfortable, I think."
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"You know, for a lot of people it is very personal."
very personal.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and especially if you, if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,"
Yeah.
"But I think the, the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. Not, not including like a mortgage."
"A mortgage is an understandable debt because that's, you have, you have to have a roof over your head."
Uh-huh.
"I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either."
Uh-huh.
"I just don't, I don't see,"
"and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about this before"
"but if you do that, if they would, uh, uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for them."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
right.
"And so, you know, they, they would just,"
"all the profits would go to, you know,"
"Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for,"
Yeah.
"they  can be, you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun."
"Oh,  Oh , yeah,"
the owner's responsibility?
"You know, now  when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up"
Yeah.
"or, you know."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, that's, that's true."
"Uh, you know, I, I had a friend who was a, uh, a policeman in a, in a local borough just a small, uh, one of the little neighborhoods, you know, one of the small towns, uh near Pittsburgh."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she said that, that, uh, you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that"
"but, I mean, you know, you're, you know,"
"people make, you know,"
"they forget or, you know, you know,"
"kids get in,"
"the way kids, the way kids are, you know, I mean, they can, you know."
Well they can get into almost anything anymore
Right.
"Okay Uh, let me see."
"I'm, I'm a free-lance writer right now."
Oh.
"And then, um, what I'm doing is working at, um, a an electronics company,  for their company newspaper,  right now on the side,"
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"and then I'm also,"
"actually, I'm excited, tomorrow I have a, uh, luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do,  uh, marketing communications for them."
Huh.
"Huh, okay,"
"I'm a, I'm a news reporter, now,"
Oh you are?
"and what I'm looking for is something in, I really don't want to stay in news,"
"but I would like to stay in journalism,"
and I've been looking for something exactly like that
Here's what you
"this is off the topic,"
"Yeah,"
"well, you know,"
"That's, that's the part that,"
"t-, whether my dentist or"
"That's the part that scares me, you know."
"I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,"
"well no,"
"it's for homosexuals and gays,"
"well no,"
"actually, it's,"
"I mean, you know."
Did they know that all along?
"and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes."
"And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not."
Can't get it from mosquitoes.
"And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,"
"and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease"
Uh-huh.
so she doesn't remember anybody
Right.
"and, uh, she remembers things,"
but they are things back whenever she was real young
Right.
"and so, with,"
she was living by herself
"but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her"
Uh-huh.
and it's creating a lot of problems.
"Right,"
especially for your uncle I bet.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.
Do they have anything like that in Dallas.
"In Dallas,"
"uh, yeah."
"I've, I've heard of several things"
"and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,"
"but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up."
Right.
So they are pretty limited.
Right.
"Oh, another interesting thing,"
"another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities."

"Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all."
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something"
"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything."
"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something"
"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs,"
"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else."
"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,"
and he'll do it.
"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,"
"but he has changed, um, the brakes"
and he has done all of the tune-ups
and the like that
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.
I was really impressed with that
"We had to have it to get the car inspected,"
it wouldn't pass inspection
"and, and so, he priced around"
and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did"
"and then, he did it"
"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,"
"what, uh, what's your experience been like?"
"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars."
"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette"

Yeah.
And I was glad it was over by then.
Right.
I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there.
"Just because, you know, we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like."
Yeah.
"You know, we, uh,"
"those people that I know,"
"I work with several that were over there,"
"and for some of them it was just kind of, I don't know, not so much a holiday,"
I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods
"and ever now and then, they'd go and shoot their rifles"
"and then they'd, come back"
and you know.
But that they weren't really allowed to do anything.
"I, uh,"
to me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway.
"Yeah,"
it's funny.
"Tonight I was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, Stalin."
"And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war"
"and actually when you think back on the big events of the war, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three, uh,"
I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they're certainly all leaders"
"and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them."
Yeah.
"And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had to draw a line and, and defend it."
"I know that,"
"Uh-huh,"
"I know that, uh, in, in the early seventies, uh, I think women were the first people to, to make a move as far as individuals."
Uh-huh.
"Um, uh, before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like, uh, black people, or, you know, just large, large groups of people,"
"but, but the,"
Right
"it was more, it was more civil rights oriented, or race oriented rather than gender based,"
"Right,"
yeah.
"and I think, I think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements"
"and you had gay movements,  and just the smaller groups of people."
Uh-huh.
It did.
"And I think since then is, is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change."
It did
"and some of the other stuff that, um, I think that changed it, you, uh, when I first got out of college fifteen years ago, they were always saying well, if you, if you were assertive you were a libber,"
or you were aggressive not assertive and independent.
Uh-huh.
"And in terms of the corporate community, I've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote, unquote, used to women,  who are in, uh, controlling positions,  as higher, you know, corporate, in the corporate hierarchy."
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
Uh-huh
So I think that's good.
"I think that, uh, you know, you can just look at home life and see, I've been talking to a lot of people about education and things,  and, and what, what, what affects the school system"
Uh-huh.

"and I've done everything from build the motor from the, uh, you know, the bare block on up."
"And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, you know,"
I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself.
Uh-huh.
"It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that."
Right.
"In fact, I, um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, uh, my car an my wife's car."
Uh-huh.
"And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself"
"but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, um, you know, I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore"
That makes sense.
"I mean it's, um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, you know,"
"it's, it's real rough in the winter time."
"Huh, yes."
"And, uh, so, I try to make sure that, uh, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um, that, uh, I have, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter"
Right
"and, uh, then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, uh, a tune-up and make sure that they're running well,"
"and, uh, you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go,"
"in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests."
Uh-huh.
"And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test,"
"well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test,"
"so. You know, I had to do that job,"
"and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside"
"Yes,"
I'm sure it was.
"But the thing was that I could do the job myself,"
"I mean, the parts cost me, oh, roughly a hundred dollars."
Uh-huh.

= = = Denizen (video game) = = =
Denizen is an action computer game published by Players Software in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum.
"""Denizen"" is a science-fiction action flip-screen maze game, with a top-down perspective. The player controls a marine, with the aim of detonating twenty explosive bolts on each of three levels. The marine is armed with a rifle and is initially supplied with 99 bullets. The player can only move orthogonally, in half-tile steps. Each screen may contain one or more enemies, who move toward the marine in a straight line until they reach an obstacle. The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"". The gameplay itself was described as a ""dull maze plod"" with unresponsive and repetitive action."
"However, all the reviewers highlighted the colourful, detailed graphics, with presentation comparable with Players' previous titles."

"where formula_5 is the largest prime factor of ""k"". So if ""k"" is a ""d"" digit integer, then formula_6 is the asymptotic average number of digits of the largest prime factor of ""k""."
The Golomb–Dickman constant appears in number theory in a different way. What is the
"probability that second largest prime factor of ""n"" is smaller than the square root of the largest prime factor of ""n""? Asymptotically, this probability is formula_7."
"More precisely,"
"where formula_9 is the second largest prime factor ""n""."
"The Golomb-Dickman constant also arises when we consider the average length of the largest cycle of any function from a finite set to itself. If ""X"" is a finite set, if we repeatedly apply a function ""f"": ""X"" → ""X"" to any element ""x"" of this set, it eventually enters a cycle, meaning that for some ""k"" we have formula_10 for sufficiently large ""n""; the smallest ""k"" with this property is the length of the cycle. Let ""b"" be the average, taken over all functions from a set of size ""n"" to itself, of the length of the largest cycle. Then Purdom and Williams proved that"

They came from the Shamezdin region, located within Hakkari, Turkey and are of the Nochiya tribe. In 1938, fifteen families totaling 108 people lived in the village. As a result of forced migration in the late 20th century, today no Assyrians remain in the village of Darbandokeh. The Assyrian quarter of the village was resettled by pro-government Kurds after the entire village's population fled in 1963 due to fighting."

"As an extension to the problem, consider the case where the player is allowed to look in Envelope A before deciding whether to switch. In this ""conditional switching"" problem, it is often possible to generate a gain over the ""never switching"" strategy"", depending on the probability distribution of the envelopes."
"The envelope paradox dates back at least to 1953, when Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik proposed a puzzle in his book ""Recreational Mathematics"""
"concerning two equally rich men who meet and compare their beautiful neckties, presents from their wives, wondering which tie actually cost more money. He also introduces a variant in which the two men compare the contents of their purses. He assumes that each purse is equally likely to contain 1 up to some large number ""x"" of pennies, the total number of pennies minted to date. The men do not look in their purses but each reasons that they should switch. He does not explain what is the error in their reasoning. It is not clear whether the puzzle already appeared in an earlier 1942 edition of his book. It is also mentioned in a 1953 book on elementary mathematics and mathematical puzzles by the mathematician John Edensor Littlewood, who credited it to the physicist Erwin Schroedinger, where it concerns a pack of cards, each card has two numbers written on it, the player gets to see a random side of a random card, and the question is whether one should turn over the card. Littlewood's pack of cards is infinitely large and his paradox is a paradox of improper prior distributions."
"Martin Gardner popularized Kraitchik's puzzle in his 1982 book ""Aha! Gotcha"", in the form of a wallet game:"
"Gardner confessed that though, like Kraitchik, he could give a sound analysis leading to the right answer (there is no point in switching), he could not clearly put his finger on what was wrong with the reasoning for switching, and Kraitchik did not give any help in this"
"direction, either."
"In 1988 and 1989, Barry Nalebuff presented two different two-envelope problems, each with one envelope containing twice what is in the other, and each with computation of the expectation value 5""A""/4. The first paper just presents the two problems. The second discusses many solutions to both of them. The second of his two problems is nowadays the more common, and is presented in this article. According to this version, the two envelopes are filled first, then one is chosen at random and called Envelope A. Martin Gardner independently mentioned this same version in his 1989 book ""Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers and the Return of Dr Matrix"". Barry Nalebuff's asymmetric variant, often known as the Ali Baba problem, has one envelope filled first, called Envelope A, and given to Ali. Then a fair coin is tossed to decide whether Envelope B should contain half or twice that amount, and only then given to Baba."

From the battle the guelfes emerge victorious at the portcullis of the Saracini palace. Orso demands that Cordelia appear at the balcony and open the gates to the town. Cordelia replies to him: « … now is not the time to open the gates, when thieves are in the town! » Orso give orders for an assault, the gate rises and he enters the Saracini palace bent on vengeance. Rather than throw Cordelia from the window as the screaming crowd demands, he drags her half-strangled back into the palace."
"Premier tableau – a great hall in the Seigniory palace. Despite their apparent victory, the Guelphs only control but half of the city. Among the dead on the Ghibelline side is Andreino, the fifteen-year-old son of Uberta, Cordelia's old nurse. The Guelphs request a truce in order to tend to the injured and bury the dead : plague is feared. The Saracini palace is on fire. Cordelia comes back, alive, but tells her brothers Ercole and Giugurta, as well as her nurse, that she has been raped by a man of whom all she can remember is the voice."
"Deuxième tableau – the cathedral square. Guelphs and Ghibellines attend the solemn mass for the Virgin in the cathedral. At the point of coming to blows, the Bishop Azzolino steps forward and upbraids them : « Siennois, is this what you call a truce for the Virgin ? Church is God's house alone ! – Faithless and unworthy Christians put your weapons down or I will close these doors and will open them only to admit your coffins! » They defer in the face of the threat; Orso only speaking a word but it is enough for Cordelia to recognize as she follows the men into the church."
"Premier tableau – a cloister. While Cordelia recognizes Orso as her torturer, Uberta learns by chance that the killer of her son is also Orso ! The two women argue over which should kill him. Cordelia decides with her plea : « You only mourn a death; I, I mourn myself, alive! ». Cordelia strikes Orso, and he falls to the ground, his throat cut with a dagger thrust. As a fight ensues, his men carry him, still breathing, to the shade of a church porch. When Cordelia and Uberta retrace steps to finish their vengeance, they cannot find the body and wonder if he was only injured. Cordelia cries out : « God of vengeance ! let him be dead ! I will not finish the task ! »."
"Deuxième tableau – the square. Cordelia discovers Orso in agony and pleading for a drink. Faced with this suffering, she pities him and pours fresh water on his lips."
"Premier tableau – a room in the Saracini palace. Cordelia has concealed Orso in the burnt palace. Giugurta, beaten, must flee the town. He wants to leave the palace by the gardens but to do that must pass through the room where Orso is hiding, convalescent. Cordelia puts him off with such insistence that Uberta becomes suspicious. A horrific explanation finally reveals the truth to Uberta, but Cordelia asks for mercy in the name of Andreino who would have condemned this bloody sacrifice. Cordelia and Orso find themselves alone. Two images alternate in the mind of Orso : the woman who stabbed him and the woman who saved him. The two make one victim of him; his repentance bursts forth and to restore her honour he asks to marry her. Cordelia replies that he is also guilty to his country riven by war. Orso promises her : « You will see me again when I have triumphed over discord and vanquished hatred! » He leaves the palace and it is announced that Giugurta has been arrested by the Guelphs, masters of the city."
"Deuxième tableau – ruins of the old Seigniory palace. The captured Ghibelline prisoners including Giurgurta are about to be executed. Orso enters and proposes to the people that the prisoners be freed, in order to march against the Emperor laying siege to the city and demanding 50,000 florins to lift the siege. The people accept. As they set off for battle Giugurta catches a glance and words from Cordelia to Orso, and says that he will return and question her after the battle."
"Sienna cathedral. The Siennese return victorious. Cordelia, frightened by her brother's threats has taken refuge in the cathedral. Giugurta find her there having extracted the information before killing Uberta. After proud protests, Cordelia faints on the altar steps, and he takes advantage to make her swallow poison. The victors come in with Orso at their head. Cordelia has convulsions which are mistaken for the plague. The crowd disperses in horror, and Orso takes Cordelia in his arms. So doing, he condemns himself to be trapped with her in the place tainted by the plague. At their pleas, Azollino joins them in marriage. Alone, they exchange parting words : Orso's wound has re-opened, and the two lovers die side by side."

"""Without You"" was the first duet recorded by Bryson and Belle, who recorded four songs together, and was also the first successful duet of the two. Another success the duo came in 1992 with ""A Whole New World"", the theme of the animated feature film ""Aladdin""."
"In addition to its original English version by Bryson and Belle, ""Without You"" also received two adaptations in different languages. The first was in Portuguese and the second was in Spanish, in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Both adaptations received the title ""Amor Dividido"", and were recorded by the same Brazilian singer.

"So we could get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On one side of the central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young painters organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other."
"In the Room 41 we were grouped together – Le Fauconnier, Léger, Delaunay, Metzinger and myself, joined, at the insistence of Guillaume Apollinaire, who was following this organisation with the greatest interest, by Marie Laurencin"
"Le Fauconnier showed his great ""Abondance"". Léger his nudes in a landscape in which volumes were treated following the method of differently shaded areas [zones dégradées] used in architecture or in mechanical models. Delaunay ""Le Tour Eiffel"" and ""La Ville"". Metzinger [Landscape, Nude, Woman's Head and Still Life], Marie Laurencin some canvasses with people in them. Myself – two landscapes and two canvasses with people: ""La Femme au phlox"" and ""Homme nu sortant du bain""."
"That, very precisely, was how Room 41 in the 1911 Indépendants was made up. In the neighbouring room were to be found, if my memory is right, Lhote, Segonzac, Moreau. [...]"
"During the few days it took for the hanging commission to do its work, there was nothing that could have enabled us to foresee the effect our pictures were about to produce on the public at large. The painters and critics who walked around the canvasses were clearly very interested, whether they were for or against. But no-one could have thought there was material there for a scandal. And we the first, who certainly never would have wanted it."
"So we were greatly surprised when, at the preview, the explosion took place. (Albert Gleizes)"
"""The great complaint that was made against us was of being unreadable; people claimed they could 'see' nothing in our pictures"". Gleizes continues:"
"Everyone was crushed into our room, people were shouting or laughing, expressing indignation, protesting, getting up to all sorts of antics, they were pushing each other out of the way to get in, those who approved and defended our position and those who condemned it argued with each other... Room 41 was always full."
"In ""Intransigeant"" Guillaume Apollinaire emphasized the importance of what the Cubists were doing and defended them with passion. Louis Vauxcelles in ""Gil Blas"" attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in ""Comoedia, Excelsior, Action"", and ""L'Oeuvre"" were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in ""Paris-Journal"", the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism."
"It was from that preview in 1911 that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. Prior to the Salon des Indépendants of 1911 no one had ever been called a Cubist, not even Braque or Picasso."
"What, by contrast, can be established is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined as it was to the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the ""Indépendants"", during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born in the same way as the word 'Impressionism' in 1872."
"Overnight, Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger and Delaunay had become famous. Virtually unknown the previous evening, their names and profiles were spread not only throughout Paris but throughout France and other countries as well. Gleizes writes:"
"Painting which, until then, had been the concern of only a small handful of amateurs, passed into the public domain and everyone wanted to be informed, to be let into the secret of those paintings which, it seemed, represented nothing, and whose meaning had to be deciphered like a puzzle."
"The International Exhibition of Modern Art of 1913, known today as the Armory Show, was a landmark event in the history of art. This monumental series of exhibitions showcased the works of the most radical European artists of their time alongside those of progressive American contemporaries. This massive exhibition was presented in varying forms at three venues—New York (69th Regiment Armory, February 17 – March 15), Chicago (Art Institute of Chicago, March 24 – April 16), and Boston (Copley Society, April 23 – May 14). The exhibition introduced the visual language of European modernism to a wide spectrum of the American public, changing the aesthetic outlook for American artists, collectors, critics, galleries and museums."
"In 1913, Gleizes, along with Archipenko, Picabia, Picasso, the Duchamp brothers and others, introduced Cubism to an American audience at the Armory Show in three major cities, New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to ""La Femme aux Phlox"" Gleizes exhibited his 1912 painting ""Man on a balcony"" (no. 196 of the catalogue)."
"Gleizes entries—both of particular importance, had already produced a considerable effect in Paris—practically eclipsed six paintings and a drawing by Picasso, and three paintings by Braque exhibited at the Armory Show."

"The Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL, engl.: ""German Train Drivers' Union"") is a German trade union that represents workers in train companies. It has a membership of 34,000."
"In August 2007 the GDL planned to strike after talks failed with Deutsche Bahn, the main German railway operator, over a range of demands from the union. A key disagreement was GDL's wish to represent its members in collective bargaining processes, independently of other unions representing staff in that job category."
"On 8 August 2007, the labour court in Nuremberg declared that a strike of affected long-distance and goods services would be illegal if carried out before 30 September, claiming it would affect the national economy too severely."
"On 2 November 2007, the labour court in Chemnitz overturned a previous judgement limiting strike action to short-haul routes. After the decision the GDL declared a three-day strike. It was the first national rail strike since 1992 and of unprecedented duration. The strike ended as the union had planned, at 2:00 a.m. CET on the morning of Saturday, November 17, 2007, but without a new contract."
"On 19 November 2007 the labour court in Nuremberg admonished Deutsche Bahn for its practice of contacting multiple labour courts around the country to try and obtain an injunction against strike action, which it regarded as misuse of the legal system."
"In 2014 the GDL started a series of strikes of the German railway system as a result of Deutsche Bahn declining its demands for a shorter working week (reduced from 39 hours to 37 hours), for a 5% pay increase and for the right to independently represent 17,000 railway workers not working as engine drivers in collective bargaining processes. Deutsche Bahn maintained that it would only enter collective bargaining with a single trade union per job grouping, as was the case until June 2014 when GDL had an agreement with the much larger EVG union."
"The strikes continued in 2015 with a three-day railway strike starting on 21 April 2015, the GDL's seventh strike in 10 months. This was followed by a strike from 4–10 May, the longest strike in Deutsche Bahn's history.

"Born in Sapporo, he took up skiing as a young boy, as he came from an area famous for its ski slopes. He also played basketball at school. However his father was an amateur sumo enthusiast and encouraged his son to try the sport. In his third year of junior high he took part in the National Junior High School Sumo Championships, held in Tokyo, and was put up in Tatsunami stable during the championships. Daishoho was an amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, and after graduation he returned to Tatsunami stable. He entered professional sumo in January 1990 at the ""makushita"" level, and quickly reached the top ""makuuchi"" division in July 1991. His best performance in a tournament was in September 1992 when he was runner-up to Takahanada with 11 wins. He reached his highest rank of ""komusubi"" in January 1993, but after that he was plagued by a number of injuries to his knees, back and triceps. He fell back to the ""jūryō"" division after pulling out of the January 1997 tournament on the 4th day."
"In 1999 Daishoho was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He wanted to receive treatment whilst still remaining active on the ""dohyo"", but in June he was persuaded by his doctors to enter hospital full-time and so retired from sumo. Since it was clear that he would be unlikely to live long enough to have a formal retirement ceremony (""danpatsu-shiki"") at the Ryogoku Kokugikan, which normally takes place up to a year after retiring, in October 1999 his fellow wrestler and graduate of Nihon University Mainoumi organised a private function for him which was attended by around 400 people including wrestlers such as Konishiki and Musashimaru and his former stablemaster Haguroyama, although senior members of the Sumo Association and his former coach at Nihon University Hidetoshi Tanaka did not attend as it was an unsanctioned event. Daishoho's weight had dropped from 150 kg to below 90 kg. He died on December 4, 1999 at the age of 32 due to pancreatic cancer."
"Daishoho liked pushing techniques, particularly ""tsuppari"", a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. However, he was also good at fighting on the ""mawashi"" or belt, where he preferred a ""migi-yotsu"" grip, a left hand outside and right hand inside position.

"Shriek: An Afterword is a fantasy novel by American writer Jeff VanderMeer. Published in 2006, ""Shriek"" is set in the fictional city of Ambergris, a recurring setting in VanderMeer's work. The novel was written over a period of eight years, owing in part to what the author said, ""[some scenes that are] very personal."""
"Ambergris, named for ""the most secret and valued part of the whale"", is a fantastical urban milieu, explicitly modern and apparently pre-industrial (despite the presence of guns, bombs, and motor vehicles). Ambergris is characterized by grocery stores, post offices, cafés, and vendors (The ""Borges Bookstore"" bears note). The city was built over the land (and quiet protests) of the fungally-adept ""graycaps"", humanoids of uncertain disposition. The inhabitants of Ambergris enjoy a fascination with squid, and celebrate an anarchic annual Festival of the Freshwater Squid."
"""Shriek: An Afterword"" deals principally with two eponymous siblings, Janice and Duncan Shriek. Janice, an ex-society figure and art critic, narrates with great and sometimes dark flamboyance. Duncan, a historian of note, entertains twin obsessions: rival historian Mary Sabon and the mysterious graycaps. The Shrieks figure rather prominently in VanderMeer's collection of Ambergris novellas and short stories ""City of Saints and Madmen"": Duncan narrates the novella ""The Early History of Ambergris"", while Janice's art criticism figures into the World Fantasy Award-winning novella ""The Transformation of Martin Lake""."
"Reviewer of ""The Believer"" noted ""It's not clear what obsesses Jeff VanderMeer more, mushrooms or books. Both appear on almost every page of his new novel Shriek: An Afterword, in which disgraced historian Duncan Shriek seeks to uncover the mystery of a race of mushroom people with mysterious fungal plans, who lurk below the surface of the moss-covered city of Ambergris. VanderMeer's previous novels are part of a fantasy subgenre, often categorized as the New Weird. While Shriek certainly contains fantasy elements, it doesn’t fit into any strictly delineated genre. There are more ideas here than flights of fancy; VanderMeer owes more to Borges than Tolkien."""

"Jeral Jamal Stokes (born October 6, 1972) is a retired American football wide receiver. Stokes played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. A first-round selection in the 1995 NFL Draft,drafted by the San Francisco 49ers ,he played professionally for the San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars and New England Patriots of the NFL."
"Stokes was born in San Diego, California. He attended Point Loma High School in San Diego, where he was part of a talented high school football team that included quarterback Dan White and lineman La'Roi Glover. The team was coached throughout Stokes' four years by local legend Bennie Edens."
"While attending University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Stokes played for the Bruins football team from 1991 to 1994. His breakout season came in his junior year when he was named the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year. Stokes' junior season was rewarded with a top ten finish in the balloting for that year's Heisman Trophy, being the only junior recognized. Stokes' junior season ended with unanimous All-American recognition by The Sporting News, AP, UPI, and Kodak. Stokes' senior year began as the nation's leading Heisman contender but was quickly sidetracked by a severe upper thigh contusion suffered in the season's first game. Stokes still holds UCLA school records for receiving touchdowns in a season (17 in 1993), receiving touchdowns in a career (28), receiving yards in a game (263 vs. USC in 1992) and receptions in a game (14 vs. Wisconsin, 1994 Rose Bowl), among others."
"On October 9, 2009, Stokes was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame."
"Stokes was selected with the first round (tenth overall pick) of the 1995 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, and he played for the 49ers from to . The 49ers traded up 20 spots to the No. 10 pick in the first round of the draft to select Stokes. After a slow start to his rookie season, the former Bruin ultimately netted 38 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was tossed by Jerry Rice."
"During the 1996 season, Stokes suffered a broken hand and missed most of the season, leading to the emergence of the 49ers' third round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, wide receiver Terrell Owens."
"In 1997, with Rice sidelined with a torn ACL, Stokes and Owens formed a formidable duo for quarterback Steve Young, with Stokes hauling in 58 passes for 733 yards and four touchdowns. Once Rice returned, Stokes' production did not falter as he would achieve career highs in receptions (63), yards (770) and touchdowns (eight). Stokes was also the recipient of Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski spitting in his face during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in December 1997."
"Along with the rest of the team, Stokes' production dropped in 1999 as a result of Young's career-ending concussion in a Monday night game in Arizona. Football Outsiders called Stokes ""the league's least valuable receiver"" in 1999."
"The 49ers released him in 2003 and he was initially signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars before going to New England. Stokes was rarely used in the Patriots offense, only contributing 15 catches for 154 yards during the 2003 campaign. New England released him and activated fullback Larry Centers near the end of the season. However, he was re-signed by the Patriots prior to the AFC Championship Game."

= = = Bishop Chatard High School = = =
"Bishop Chatard High School is a Catholic co-educational preparatory high school located in the Broad Ripple district of Indianapolis, Indiana in the United States. It is named after Bishop Silas Chatard, who was the first Bishop of Indianapolis, and oversaw the movement of the diocese from Vincennes to Indianapolis in 1898."
"The increase in Indiana's Catholic population that triggered the splitting of the Indianapolis diocese in 1944 also caused an increase in the need for Catholic schools. It was clear that one high school would not be sufficient to provide for Indianapolis' massively expanding Catholic population. To this end, the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Clarence Schulte, ordered the construction of three new Catholic high schools in the city. The first of these, Bishop Chatard, would serve the north side of Indianapolis. The two other new schools, Roncalli High School and Cardinal Ritter High School, would serve the south and west sides of Indianapolis respectively. Scecina would continue to serve the east side of the city."
"Ground was broken for the first of the schools, Bishop Chatard, in the fall of 1960 on diocese property at the corner of Crittenden and Kessler Avenues. Construction of the school and an adjacent convent was completed in less than a year, and the first students were admitted in September 1961. Each year a class of students was added to the school, and the first graduating class was the class of 1964-65. Over the years, many improvements were made to the school facility as the number of students rose."
"Initially, classes were taught almost entirely by priests from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and Benedictine Sisters of Beech Grove. Many sisters were housed in the convent on-site, but their numbers declined to the point that in the 1970s, their convent was converted to an annex of the school. The annex has served as classroom, office and storage space for thirty years, and was recently rededicated to the Sisters as the St. Benedict Center."
"By 1997, the school was showing its age. Paint was peeling, windows and roofs were leaky, and facilities sorely needed an upgrade. To remedy the situation and remodel the 35-year-old building, school administrators embarked on a $2 million capital campaign to pay for new windows, a new roof, electrical improvements, and other needed renovations. These were undertaken over the summer, and when students arrived to begin the 1997-1998 school year, they were in what was virtually a whole new building."
"In 1999, improvements continued with the opening of the new fine arts addition. A new band room, art studio, and library were added, as were six new classrooms and an elevator to make the building handicap-accessible. This was paid for by a $1.5 million building drive made possible by alumni donations."
"In the summer of 2005, and completed over the 2007-08 school year, a campaign involved the construction of an additional elevator to allow better access to classrooms for handicapped students and a remodeling of the cafeteria and several hallways. A new auxiliary gymnasium was paid for by alumni donations and a slight tuition increase. In 2011, President Bill Sahm announced the “Golden Opportunities Campaign,” to address several issues including the creation of a tuition assistance endowment and a teacher compensation endowment. The Campaign also addressed improvements to the academic environment including the addition of robust wireless network throughout the two buildings, new servers and expanded student and teacher access to 21st century computers in the classrooms and labs. The Campaign also addressed the needs of the athletic community with the addition of a competition track and fields including a new turf field and all-weather track with bleacher seating for 900, stadium lighting and a concession/restroom facility, as well as a turf baseball field and a one-mile walk/run trail."
Bishop Chatard has been accredited by AdvancED or its predecessors since April 2004.

"Ridley Creek State Park is a Pennsylvania state park in Edgmont, Middletown and Upper Providence Townships, Delaware County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park, about north of the county seat of Media, offers many recreational activities, such as hiking, biking, fishing, and picnicking. Ridley Creek passes through the park. Highlights include a paved multi-use trail, a formal garden designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, which recreates daily life on a pre-Revolutionary farm. The park is adjacent to the John J. Tyler Arboretum. Ridley Creek State Park is just over from downtown, Philadelphia between Pennsylvania Route 352 and Pennsylvania Route 252 on Gradyville Road."
"The bulk of the property was acquired in the late 1960s from the estate of well known horse breeder Walter M. Jeffords, Sr. and his wife Sarah, a niece of Samuel D. Riddle. The Jeffords had acquired the land starting about 1912 in small parcels, until they had over , which was the largest private undeveloped property in the Philadelphia area by the 1960s. By 1918 they had built a large mansion, now the park office, around a stone colonial farmhouse. Twenty-four other historic properties were located on the grounds, many farmsteads that had retained family ownership since the seventeenth century. In 1976 these properties were registered on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district."
"The area was originally settled by English Quakers and remained agrarian into the twentieth century. The oldest property is the 1683 Worrel House. In 1718 a water mill, then known as Providence Mill, began to grind corn. In the late 18th century a plaster mill was established next to the grist mill. A rolling and slitting mill replaced the plaster mill by 1812, and became known as Bishop's Mills. Workers cottages, a dam, and several outbuildings complete the mill complex, now known as Sycamore Mills. The mills operated until 1901, when they were damaged by fire."
The Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation is a living museum on the farm where the Pratt family lived from 1720 to 1820. Admission is charged and it is open to the general public on weekends from April through November.
"The location of Ridley Creek State Park, just from downtown Philadelphia, has led to its popularity. Ridley Creek is very popular with fishermen. It is stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. A portion of the creek is a designated catch and release area for fly fishing only. There is a wheelchair accessible fishing platform on a multi-use trail. The of hiking trails at Ridley Creek State Park are popular with dog owners. These trails pass through a variety of habitats. A multi use trail is open to jogging, bicycling and walking. The park also features a equestrian trail."

= = = Life Got Cold = = =
"""Life Got Cold"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Noel Gallagher of Oasis received a writing credit due to similarities with Oasis' ""Wonderwall""."
"Released as their third single in August 2003, ""Life Got Cold"" became Girls Aloud's third consecutive top three hit on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked at number two in Ireland and Scotland, and peaked at number 14 in Belgium."
"Set in an abandoned city, the music video suggests coldness and darkness with its blue hue. It portrays Girls Aloud moving in stunted movement. ""Life Got Cold"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on three of Girls Aloud's concert tours. Described as a ""surprisingly poignant"", the melancholic ballad received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics; however, it was criticised for its similarities with Oasis."
"""Life Got Cold"" is a ballad written in D minor. The chord progressions vary throughout the song but the different chords include B, C, Dm, Gm, and Am. Following typical verse-chorus form, the song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. The verses are ""talk-sung"", while the bridge and chorus are song over guitar strumming. The middle 8 is a slower version of the bridge. The song tells the tale of young love that ended ""when summer slipped away."" ""Life Got Cold"" was a late addition to ""Sound of the Underground"", completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. Producer Brian Higgins did not take the idea of a Girls Aloud version of the song seriously until he heard the group sing it, because a track working ""has always got to be based on an artist's performance, not the music itself. But they sang it, and they really nailed the melancholic aspect of it, and it sounded beautiful."" The lyrics focus on ""the directionlessness of modern life."""
"The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of ""Life Got Cold"" and that of the 1995 Oasis hit ""Wonderwall"". A BBC review stated ""part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into Wonderwall by Oasis."" A source told ""The Sun"" that Girls Aloud ""are all big Oasis fans so I'm sure they won't mind comparisons with their classic love song."" Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. Girls Aloud later made a cameo appearance in Oasis' 2007 rockumentary ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down""."
"""Life Got Cold"" was not originally the choice for Girls Aloud's third single. Polydor Records had originally chosen ""Some Kind of Miracle"" to be released, but the plan was dropped after an overwhelming fan response to ""Life Got Cold"". The single was released on 18 August 2003 in the UK. It was available on two different CD single formats and as a cassette tape. The first CD featured a cover of the Duran Duran song ""Girls on Film"" as the b-side, which would later become the title for a Girls Aloud DVD, as well as a remix of ""No Good Advice"". The disc's enhanced section features the ""Life Got Cold"" music video and a photo gallery. The second disc included both the radio edit and album version of ""Life Got Cold"", as well as the 29 Palms Remix Edit and the Stella Browne Edit. It also came with a free fold-out poster. The cassette also featured an exclusive b-side, an original track entitled ""Lights, Music, Camera, Action"". The photos featured on the single's artwork were reshot at the last minute, following the group's request."
"""Life Got Cold"" received positive reviews from music critics, although it did receive criticism due to the similarities with the song Wonderwall by Oasis. BBC called the song a ""charming ballad"" that was ""a sweet but slightly sad pop song."" RTÉ.ie thought ""Life Got Cold"" was ""surprisingly poignant."""
"However, some noted that the chorus held many similarities to that of the Oasis song ""Wonderwall"". The songwriters dismissed claims of plagiarising Oasis. Allmusic referred to it as ""a solid ballad, suggesting a less intellectual Dido."""
"The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, behind Blu Cantrell's ""Breathe"" and Lemar's ""Dance (With U)"". It spent a second week in the top ten, slipping to number eight. The song spent a total of nine weeks in the top 75 overall, a far cry from the fourteen weeks ""No Good Advice"" or the twenty-one weeks that ""Sound of the Underground"" spent in the chart. ""Life Got Cold"" also debuted at number three on the Irish Singles Chart, but managed to rise to number two the following week. It spent two further weeks in the top ten, then two weeks in the top twenty. The single barely missed the top ten of the Netherlands Top 40, instead peaking at number eleven. It has since become the group's 16th best selling single domestically."
"The music video for ""Life Got Cold"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed the videos for ""Sound of the Underground"" and ""No Good Advice"". The band members are seen in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. Both group and individual shots are shown in various scenes. Nadine Coyle is seen in front of an abandoned building, while Sarah Harding is next to a car and a phone booth. Nicola Roberts is alone in a kitchen as pouring rain can be seen on the window. Cheryl Cole is shown in an alleyway, while Kimberley Walsh is alone on a street curb. The group are shown together on an abandoned bus, in an alley at night, and sat in front of the abandoned building. The video has a slightly blue hue to it, suggesting coldness and darkness. It also makes use of lens flares."
"The video can be found on two of Girls Aloud's official DVD releases, ""Girls on Film"" (2005) and ""Style"" (2007)."
"""Life Got Cold"" was first performed live by Girls Aloud at two summer festivals in 2003, Pop Beach and Live & Loud. The first televised performance occurred on """" on 19 July 2003. The group performed in black-and-white business casual attire, as seen in the music video and on the single's artwork. They performed on ""CD:UK"" once more the following month, although Cheryl was absent due to illness. Girls Aloud also appeared on ""Diggin' It"", ""Popworld"", ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" (twice)."
"Girls Aloud performed ""Life Got Cold"" on three of their concert tours. For 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say? Live, Girls Aloud were positioned at the top of a staircase as they sang the song in colourful, simple evening gowns. The song was given a reggae reworking for 2007's The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits Tour. The song was also included on the bands reunion tour, Ten - The Hits Tour 2013."

"Amit finds Shishika irritating. At a party in a bathroom, Amit gives Samara toilet paper when she accidentally sneaks into Men's bathroom. But they both doesn't meet each other."
"During a family interrogation with Shishika's parents, Amit gets his guitar and sings in front of them wearing a vest and short, thus embarrassing in a discontented mood. With the help of his dance partner, Samara choreographs a dance album. It gets instant views and liking. Unknowingly its on the song made by Amit.

"Abhay Deol had a falling out with music company T-Series after the composers from his film Shankar Ehsaan Loy were asked to sign, what they believed to be illegal clauses which would hand over their [the author's] rights to royalty over to the music company. Abhay Deol took to social media and blamed T-Series for delaying the music launch of his film as well as not promoting the movie due to him and the composers not agreeing to sign the documents. This allegation was denied by T-Series who claimed that they had uploaded 3 songs from the movie on its YouTube page and claimed ""In the absence thereof [of appropriate agreements], we cannot be expected to release music when there is no clarity with respect to the rights granted to the producer"" In another statement, T-Series expressed the fact that they had been assured by the company Viacom 18 that they owned all the rights (including the music rights) and that they did not understand why they were being dragged into this dispute which should be between Mr. Deol and Viacom 18. T-Series eventually relinquished their hold on the music rights after a campaign was run by the composers and artists against the music company. Eventually the music for the film was launched after music companies Crecendo and Unisys who took over, with the former releasing the physical copies and the latter releasing the digital copies of the music online.

"George Emil Eminsang (ca. 1833 – May 1898) was a prominent Euro-African merchant and political leader on the Gold Coast, who played a prominent role in the last years of Dutch colonial rule on the Gold Coast. After the Dutch Gold Coast was transferred to the United Kingdom, Eminsang became a diplomat for the Netherlands and later for the United States and the Congo Free State. Together with James Bannerman Hyde and James Hutton Brew, Eminsang was one of the first so-called ""country lawyers"" on the Gold Coast."
"Eminsang was an important leader of the No. 10 Akrampafo ""asafo"" ward of Elmina and owner of the most famous hotel of Elmina, St. George's Hotel. Besides his native Twi, he spoke and wrote Dutch, English, Portuguese and German."
"Eminsang was born in Elmina to Joseph Emil Eminsang, a merchant and innkeeper, and an unknown lady from a prominent Dutch/Fanti Euro-African family. He was educated in the Netherlands and Germany, before returning to teach for several years at the Elmina Castle School, where he had completed his primary education."
"In the 1850s, Eminsang established himself as a merchant on the Gold Coast. In 1859, while doing business in Kumasi, Eminsang had a conflict with the Asante chief Kwasi Brantuo, whose porters lost five textiles from a shipment Eminsang had ordered from Anomabu. Asantehene Kwaku Dua I Panyin ruled in favour of Eminsang and ordered that Brantuo pay 15 Engels compensation to Eminsang. Eminsang still refused to pay the wages of the porters, however, leading Brantuo to complain to Asante chief Akyempon Yaw, who regulated Elmina affairs in Kumasi. The conflict became so heated that the Dutch agent in Kumasi, Pieter de Heer, offered to pay Eminsang's debt from his own pocket, but Eminsang flatly refused and swore a Coromantee oath that no payment would take place. After Eminsang started to insult the Asantehene, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Pieter de Heer managed to persuade Asantehene Kwaku Dua to release Eminsang to send him for trial by the Dutch governor in Elmina."
"Eminsang played a prominent role in colonial affairs in the last years of Dutch rule on the Gold Coast. When in 1868 the Fante Confederacy tried to take Elmina in the aftermath of the redistribution of Dutch and British forts on the Gold Coast, Eminsang was sent by the Elmina government to the Netherlands to plead the case for Elmina with Minister of the Colonies Engelbertus de Waal. After meeting with Eminsang, De Waal proceeded in replacing governor George Pieter Willem Boers with the experienced former governor Cornelis Nagtglas, who as a government commissioner was tasked with finding a solution for the conflict with the Fante."

"Fucked Up is a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario, formed in 2001. The band consists of Damian Abraham (vocals), Mike Haliechuk (guitar, vocals), Josh Zucker (guitar), Ben Cook (guitar, vocals), Sandy Miranda (bass) and Jonah Falco (drums, vocals)."
"To date the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for their second studio album, ""The Chemistry of Common Life"". In 2018, the band released its fifth studio album, ""Dose Your Dreams"", after a hiatus. Driven by Haliechuk, it is a concept album focusing on the band's recurring character David, and featuring several guest lead vocalists, alongside Abraham, Falco, and Haliechuk."
"The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for Cursed). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco)."
"Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7"" records. The band released the """"No Pasaran"""" 7"" in May 2002. The ""Police"" 7"" was released on March 2003, quickly followed the ""Baiting the Public"" 7"" in May 2003. Two more 7""'s followed in 2004, the ""Dance of Death"" single, and the ""Litany"" 4-song ep. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s ""Epics in Minutes"" CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16 mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show."
"The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of Sigils) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12""s, the ""Looking for Gold"" 12"", and the live ""Let Likes be Cured by Likes"" 12"". The ""Looking for Gold"" 12"" contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute drum solo and contained 5 minutes of whistling."
"In the summer of 2004 the band released the ""Generation"" 7"" and 12"" eps. After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned ""Hidden World"" album to labels, ending with the band signing to Jade Tree Records for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to Deranged Records, which released it as a double album in November 2006."
"Several other records, such as ""Year of the Dog"" 12"" were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007 marked the band's live television debut on ""MTV Live"", where they were introduced as ""Effed Up"". During their performance of their song ""Baiting the Public"", the majority of the audience were moshing and causing damage to the set (also visible was a cut on Damian's forehead), resulting in a sum of $2,000 in damages. This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future ""MTV Live"" performances."
"On October 9, 2008 the band returned to MTV Live, this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs, but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew."
"On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was ""f**king out of control terrifying."""
"In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie ""Burn"", directed by Richard Roepnack. The performance was positively reviewed in the ""New York Times"", although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks."
"The band signed to Matador Records in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the ""Year Of The Pig"" 12"" single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7""es, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast."
"On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, ""The Chemistry Of Common Life."" It has received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine and many more. The band toured the Eastern US in October, including a much-covered 12-hour long show on the Bowery in New York on October 14.

"Fucked Up were confirmed to play the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010. The band also confirmed they will play their annual Halloween gig in Toronto, October 31, 2010. The band had initially cancelled the event due to scheduled tour with Against Me!. ""We were going to go on this tour in the UK with this band Against Me!, but then they cancelled all their shows for some reason (they never told us) so the tour isn't happening so we'll be in Toronto so we figure what the hell."" They were joined by The Sadies at The Garrison, Toronto."
"In February 2011, the band toured Australia for the first time as a part of the Soundwave Festival. Additionally, the band played some select side-shows from the festival with artists as diverse as The Bronx, Terror, H20, Trash Talk and Polar Bear Club."
"On June 7, 2011, Fucked Up released their third studio album, ""David Comes to Life"". A self-professed ""rock opera"" set in Thatcherite Britain, it tells a story of love, loss and redemption. The story is complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators. The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It has received wide critical acclaim."
"In November 2011 it was announced that the band would be going on hiatus, as Abraham is not able to handle raising a family and tour the same time."
"In December 2011, Spin magazine named ""David Comes to Life"" its No. 1 Album of 2011, and put the band on the cover, writing ""Fucked Up have synthesized 40 years of rock into what's ostensibly a hardcore record, and in doing so created its own logic."""
"On February 7, 2012, the band was listed as one of the acts to be featured during the Orion Music + More Festival. The event took place June 23–24, 2012 in Atlantic City, New Jersey and was curated by Metallica. The band was also listed to play Fun Fun Fun Fest in November, 2012, in Austin, Texas."

"Oteyboydak Tleukabyluly (1388–1478), was a Kazakh scientist, healer and author of solid medical-ethnographic works Shipagerlik Bayan. He was familiar with such historical personalities as Zhanibek khan, Zhirenshe sheshen. O. Tleukabyluly was a well-known public figure, involved in dealing with the plight of the people. The dates of his birth are taken from his book Shipagerlik Bayan. He writes that he started writing this book at the age of 70 at the request of Zhanibek khan and finished it at the age of 85; after Zhanibek khan’s death. There is also evidence that Oteyboydak died at the age of 90. He inherited his medical and healer gift from his ancestors. O.Tleukabyluly devoted his life to treatment and brought traditional (folk) medicine in the academic system. Thus, he was able to raise the medicine of his time at a high level. In this respect, he, like al-Farabi, despised thirst for fame, wealth, and devoted his life to the study of the peculiarities of healing. The book Shipagerlik Bayan has survived until today, thanks to his relatives. But only fourth part of the rich heritage, having gone through the test of time, has reached our days. The rest part was burnt by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in China. This book gives a lot of information on traditional Kazakh medicine. The fact that he used a variety of compounds (mixture), offered over 4000 recipes, convinces us that Oteyboydak was an experienced healer and an outstanding scientist. His book mentions medical properties of 728 kinds of drugs of plant origin, 318 kind of medicine of animal origin, 52 types of medicines derived from metals and metalloids, 8 kinds of rare and precious drugs, as well as references to some 500 anatomical terms. It witnesses that the book has the historical-ethnographic importance as well as the depth and richness of the Kazakh language. The book was published in 1994 in Kazakh Cyrillic script in Urumgi, In 1996 - in the Kazakh Cyrillic script in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In 1997 the book was awarded China’s National Book award. Two public medical centers for studying O.Tleukabyluly’s heritage were created in China. The monument to O.Tleukabyluly has been erected on Shalkode Zhailau in Almaty area and one street was named after him in Almaty. O.Tleukabyluly was not only a scientist-healer but also the visionary thinker, who well knew the life, customs, the world, the spiritual culture of his people."

Some women in North Macedonia hold positions of authority. Women receive ""inheritance"" through the dowry system, because inheritance is traditionally transferred to male heirs. Some modern-day women receive inheritance that is divided among siblings by their parents. The traditional way women greet each other involves exchanging kisses.

= = = Competitive Tax Plan = = =
"The Competitive Tax Plan is an approach to taxation, suggested in the United States, that would impose a 10–15% value added tax (VAT) and reduce personal and corporate income taxes. The plan was created by Michael J. Graetz, professor at Columbia Law School and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. Graetz states that the plan would generate enough revenue so that families with $100,000 of annual income or less — almost 90% of all current filers — would not have to pay income taxes or file tax returns. The Competitive Tax Plan would provide a new payroll tax offset to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit and to protect low and moderate income workers from any tax increase under the new system. Under the initial proposal, households with an annual income of more than $100,000 would be taxed at a flat 25% rate and the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 25%. Graetz argues that reducing the corporate tax rate ""would make the United States an extremely attractive nation for corporate investments for both U.S. citizens and foreign investors"". In 2013, Graetz presented an updated version of his plan for 2015."
"Michael J. Graetz is professor at Columbia Alumni of Tax Law. He was born at November 20, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is married and has five children. He is also a leading expert on national and international tax law. He has taught at University of Virginia Law School, University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, and Yale Law School, and also worked as assistant to the secretary and special counsel for the Department of the Treasury. Graetz won the Daniel M. Holland Medal by the National Tax Association. He has written more than 80 articles on a wide range of tax, international taxation, health policy, and social insurance issues."
"In his work we can see that in comparison to OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) , he call the U.S. as a ""Low Tax Country"" , meant as the total federal, state and local tax revenues as a percentage of GDP( Gross Domestic Product) are much lower than the one of OECD. What can be interesting is that the Income Tax in the U.S. in comparison to EU27 and OECD is equal or even higher. The U.S. has according to Graetz's data from 2010 low consumption taxas a percentage of total taxation. Further he mentions that the U.S. has been the only OECD country without a VAT in comparison to more than 160 countries all over the world that has already have a VAT. This needs to change according to his work. So he came with the so called "" the five pieces of competitive tax plan"" The steps are:"
There are some basic principles in the proposal for the goods and service tax:
Proposed VAT is 12.9%.
"The next point in the competitive tax plan is to shrink the income tax. He proposed to limit the income tax only to high income earners in order to ensure federal tax progressivity. Another step is to provide a Family Allowance of $100,000 for married couples ($50,000 for singles, $75,000 for heads of households). This step will eliminate great part of income tax return( more than 120 million), and it also will resulted in fewer than 20 percent of all U.S. tax units will be required to file income tax returns. He stated specific levels of income tax rates. For example, for married couples it will be:"
"The next step of the Proposal is to ""Reduce and Reform the Corporate Income Tax"". Proposed tax rate is 15 percent. This step should solve the problem with international income taxation as it reverse current law’s incentives to locate deductions here and income abroad. It will also repeal the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. It should simplify small businesses taxation."
"Another part of the plan is to protect low and middle income families in the way that delivering new child credits through debit cards that can be used at the cash register. All children qualify for $1,500 per child( but for married couples with more than $150,000 ($75,000 singles and heads of households), these credits phase-out at a rate of 5%*). For low and moderate income workers it will be even more."
"Next to protecting low and middle income families, the plan also speaks about protecting low and moderate income workers by providing a Payroll Tax Credit of 15.3 percent for wages up to $10,000 and $1,530 per worker for all workers with earnings between $10,000 and $40,000. This credit eliminates all payroll taxes for workers with $10,000 or less of earnings, also it eliminates at least the employees’ share (half) of payroll taxes for workers with earnings below $20,000. Above $40,000 this credit phases out at a rate of 7.65 percent."
No formal bill for the Competitive Tax Plan itself is in Congress; however Senator Ben Cardin's Progressive Consumption Tax Act has many similar features.

"CGAS San Diego is also adjacent to Sector San Diego which houses two 41-foot Utility Boats, two USCG rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB's), one RB-HS and three RB-S. Being implemented are two Special Purpose Craft-Law Enforcement (SPC-LE), which are USCG vessels used for maritime Law Enforcement. The SPC-LE's have three Mercury Marine engines along with some of the most advanced electronics systems in existence. Also at the station are two USCG Coastal Patrol Boats. The air station is physically separated from the rest of the airfield, such that USCG fixed-wing aircraft must cross a busy, 6-lane city street to reach the runway; street light activation opens the locked gates to the airfield and the air station, and also stops traffic while aircraft are traversing the street."
"Lindbergh Field opened on October 16, 1934 on the Pacific Highway. The San Diego International Airport East Terminal opened on March 6, 1967, and the West Terminal opened July 11, 1979. A new Commuter Terminal opened July 23, 1996. It is self-contained, full service facility with four gates used by seven commuter airlines to handle 25,000 passengers each day. Construction of the expansion of the West Terminal ended in November, 1997. Almost 14 million passengers travel through Lindbergh Field each year. The 27 passenger and cargo airlines operate more than 500 flights each day from the runways."
"On December 11, 1935 negotiations between the City of San Diego and the U.S. Government were concluded which provided of tideland for the construction of a Coast Guard Air Station adjacent to Lindbergh Field, the Municipal Airport. This project had the strong support of many people and agencies, and particularly the Harbor Commission and Department of San Diego and the Chamber of Commerce. The area for this station was deeded to the Coast Guard at no cost, after approval by citizens of San Diego, at a municipal election held in April 1935."
The Royal Victorian Aero Club is an Australian aero club based at Moorabbin Airport in Melbourne. Originating in 1914 (six years before the national airline Qantas) it is amongst the world's oldest Aviation organisations.
"Founded by pioneer aviators in 1914 at Point Cook, the club is one of Australia's oldest flying training organisations."
The Australian Aero Club was formed on 28 October 1914 (and formally established on 9 April 1915) and was subsequently affiliated with the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain. The original hand-written minutes of this historic meeting establishing the club are preserved today.
"Renamed the Victorian Aero Club in October 1934, on 13 March 1935 approval to use the ""Royal"" prefix was granted and since that date the institution has been known as the Royal Victorian Aero Club."
"While originally formed at Point Cook, in 1919 the Club transferred operations to what was then the Commonwealth Aerodrome (or sometimes referred to as ""St Johns Field"") on Bulla Road in Essendon. Club operations were some of the first from St John's Field, as the aerodrome was not officially opened until 1922."
"The Civil Aviation Department provided support to the Australian Aero Club, by providing an establishment gift of six DeHavilland"
"Gypsy Moth aircraft two of which were allocated to the Victorian Chapter. The two Victorian Gypsy Moths, (G-AUAL and G-UAUG) arrived in July 1926 by ship and within a month they were taking part in a major aerial display at Essendon to celebrate the arrival of solo flyer A. J. Cobham from England. The Flying Section of the Club was officially opened by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Irvine on 21 August 1926."
In 1934 club member 28-year-old Freda Thompson flew her DH Moth Major solo from England to Australia in 19 days – the first Australian women fly the route (also notable for her record 5 hr flight from Koepang to Darwin). Freda Thompson was Club President in 1948.
"Operations were somewhat limited during the Second World War, and Essendon Airport subsequently became the primary commercial airport for Melbourne, the increased airliner traffic limiting private operations. Thus, in December 1949 the Club transferred to and became the first operator on what were once market-gardens on Centre Dandenong Road, at the newly established Moorabbin Airport, southeast of the city. A massive growth in the number of flying hours took place in the 1950s and 1960s, aided in part by a Commonwealth Government edict providing some subsidies for private flying training."

Some of those who played a vital role in Club flying operations and who have trained thousands of Australian aviators include:
"Laurie McPherson, Instructor 1950–1951. CFI 1952–1960, 1969–1970 and Manager 1961–1968 and 1978–1985. Pilot who conducted tests on behalf of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation to closely examine the spinning characteristics of the DHC Chipmunk."
"John Lindsay, Honorary Life Member, one-time CFI and manager and pre-eminent club member from 1945 to 2007."
"H Owen Jones, an employee for 42 years."
"Roy F Goon, first flew with RVAC in 1933, flew CAC Boomerang aircraft during Second World War in Darwin and Gove (Sqdn. Ldr. 83 Sqdn). Commanding Officer of l l l MFCU at Labuan. He held this position from 14 February 1943 to 7 September 1945 and was a test pilot with the RAAF, Commonwealth Aircraft Factory and Royal Flying Doctor Service. Held Commercial Pilot Licence No 511 and was an Instructor at the RVAC for 40 years and Chief Flying Instructor in 1977. Goon was a member of the well-known Chinese-Australian family from Ballarat, Victoria."
"George Campbell referred to by pioneer aviatrix Nancy Bird-Walton as """"a man who became a great trainer of pilots in the last war years."""
The Royal Victorian Aero Club provides aircraft and facilities for pilot training and private flying at Moorabbin Airport.
The Club currently trains pilots from various overseas countries and also offers an annual Scholarship as well as fly-aways and regular competitions.
"Additionally, the club (with the RAAF Roulettes as Patron) operates the Young Eagles programme for Victorians between 12 and 17 years of age, designed to introduce flying to potential aviators."
In the boom times of the 1950s much of the training and private flying was undertaken in the legendary De Havilland Moth series of aircraft (primarily the de Havilland Tiger Moth).
"The De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk and Victa Airtourer were used in the 1960s followed subsequently by a limited number of Beechcraft aircraft and in much greater numbers, the reliable Piper Aircraft and Cessna, current models of which remain the backbone of the fleet today."

"The Flehe Bridge, is a single tower cable stayed bridge located in Düsseldorf, over the Rhine. It connects the A 46 motorway from the left bank of the Rhine (Neuss, Aachen, Heinsberg district, the Netherlands) with the Bergisches Land on the right bank (Wuppertal, Solingen, Hagen) and the south of Düsseldorf. It forms at the same time the southern part of the ring of motorways around Düsseldorf. It includes a pedestrian and cyclist strip."
"This bridge opened in 1979 and eliminated a considerable amount of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete suspension tower, which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only broad. They were manufactured with a climbing formwork.

= = = Rappbode Dam = = =
"The Rappbode Dam () is the largest dam in the Harz region as well as the highest dam in Germany. Together with several other dams and retention basins, it forms the flood protection system for the eastern Harz."
"The earliest discussions about building flood protection barriers took place following devastating floods at the beginning of the 20th century. These envisaged a number of masonry dams being constructed across the tributaries of the Bode river. The first concrete plan, however, was to build just one dam but this would have meant sacrificing a number of villages. The eventual project work was completed in 1938 and proposed a plan which avoided flooding any of localities by constructing a number of dams. Construction on the Rappbode Valley Dam began in 1938. Construction was halted due to the war in 1942. After 1945, the newly founded East Germany, the project got under way again and was extended by including the treatment of drinking water, the original layout being retained and the technology being adapted. The foundation stone was laid on 1 September 1952 and, on 7 October 1959, the dam went into service. It was reconstructed between 2000 and 2003 and the national emblems of East Germany on the inscriptions at the tunnel exit of the road across the dam were removed. The two inscriptions on the left and on the right read:"
"The barrier is a straight gravity dam, which holds the water back by its sheer weight. It was built in several sections and finished in 1959. It is high and long. In recent years (before 2002) the crest of the dam was renewed. The roadway and the concrete had weathered and could no longer handle the weight of traffic. The lake behind the dam acts primarily as a reserve drinking water reservoir for the towns east of the Harz. The pressure pipes go to Aschersleben, Halberstadt, Bernburg (Saale), Halle (Saale) and even Leipzig. Its water quality is particularly good; water hardness averages 3° on the German hardness scale. So the water is ideal for use for steam generation and washing. The reservoir also contributes to generation of hydro-electric power to a small extent."
"In August 2012, a very large Sea Lion Cove, designed after the Central Coast’s Point Lobos, was opened. It contains 250,000 gallon saltwater tank with rock outcrops and islands, while preserving the redwood trees that surround the enclosures. A 35-ft viewing glass allows guest to watch the sea lions underwater. This exhibit also includes pelicans. This was the first major exhibit funded by Measure Z. The old sea lion enclosure was repurposed for river otters."
"In January 2014, ground was broken for the approximately 18-acre ""African Adventure"" expansion doubling the size of the zoo and including large animal exhibits such as lions, breeding elephants, cheetahs, rhinos, meerkats, hippos, gorillas, and penguins. Measure Z, which provided funding for capital zoo projects, was renewed by voters in November 2014."
"On October 15, 2015, phase one of African Adventure opened. The 13 acre exhibit is home to over 100 animals including lions, African elephants, cheetahs, and rhinos. In 2016, the zoo opened the ""Roo Walkabout,"" an Australian walk-through exhibit which features red kangaroos, emus and kookaburras. That year set a new attendance record with just under 1 million visitors."
"Attendance dropped significantly from 2016 to 2017, to 833,114 guests; 2018 saw another slight drop to 828,000 guests. While no major new exhibits opened in 2017, May 2018 saw the debut of a new children's water attraction named ""Wilderness Falls."" This new play area was designed to allow younger guests to ""cool off and make a splash in the waterfall, follow the footprints and explore the wilderness, and discover the fire lookout tower."" Work also began in late 2018 on an infrastructure project designed to enable future zoo expansion, including the forthcoming ""Kingdoms of Asia"" project, as well as a new warthog and tortoise exhibit. The warthog/tortoise exhibit opened in African Adventure in June 2019."
"= = = Elizabeth of Carinthia, Queen of Germany = = ="
"Elizabeth of Carinthia (also known as Elizabeth of Tyrol; – 28 October 1312), was a Duchess of Austria from 1282 and Queen of Germany from 1298 until 1308, by marriage to the Habsburg king Albert I."
"Born in Munich, Bavaria, she was the eldest daughter of Count Meinhard of Gorizia-Tyrol, and Elizabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Germany, widow of the late Hohenstaufen king Conrad IV of Germany."
"Elizabeth thus was a half-sister of Conradin, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Swabia. Elizabeth was in fact better connected to powerful German rulers than her future husband: a descendant of earlier monarchs, for example Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, she was also a niece of the Bavarian dukes, Austria's important neighbors."
"She was married in Vienna on 20 December 1274 to Count Albert of Habsburg, eldest son and heir of the newly elected King Rudolf I of Germany, thus becoming daughter-in-law of the King of the Romans and Emperor-to-be. After Rudolf had defeated his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he invested his son Albert with the duchies of Austria and Styria at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg on 17 December 1282."
"Albert initially had to share the rule with his younger brother Rudolf II, who nevertheless had to waive his rights according to the Treaty of Rheinfelden the next year. Duke Albert and Elizabeth solidified their rule in what was to become the Habsburg ""hereditary lands"", also with the help of Elizabeth's father Meinhard, who in his turn was created Duke of Carinthia by King Rudolf I in 1286."
"Elizabeth was described as shrewd and enterprising, in possession of some commercial talents. The construction of the Saline plant in Salzkammergut goes back to her suggestion."
"Upon the death of Albert's father in 1291, the princes elected Count Adolf of Nassau German king, while Duke Albert himself became entangled in internal struggles with the Austrian nobility. Not until Adolf's deposition in 1298, Elizabeth's husband was finally elected King of the Romans on 23 June 1298. Two weeks later, Adolf was defeated and killed in the Battle of Göllheim. In 1299, Elizabeth was crowned Queen of the Romans in Nuremberg."
"On 1 May 1308 her husband was murdered by his nephew John ""the Parricide"" near Windisch, Swabia (in modern-day Switzerland). After Albert's assassination, Elizabeth had the Poor Clare monastery of Königsfelden erected at the site, where she died on 28 October 1312 and was also buried. Today her mortal remains rest at Saint Paul's Abbey in Carinthia."

"Yancey Dirk Thigpen (born August 15, 1969) is a former professional American football wide receiver who played for the San Diego Chargers (1991), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1992–1997), and the Tennessee Oilers/Titans (1998–2000). Before his NFL career, he played for Winston-Salem State University, where he also played collegiate basketball."
"Thigpen played infrequently in his first three seasons, but had a breakout year in 1994, catching 36 passes for 546 yards. Then in 1995, he made the Pro Bowl, catching 85 passes for 1,307 yards and five touchdowns, and assisting his team to Super Bowl XXX, where he recorded three catches for 19 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers 27–17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. His tough style of play earned him the nickname ""Meatball,"" which was later changed to ""Phil"" when he joined the Oilers in 1998."
"Thigpen played only six games in the following season due to injuries, but made a full recovery in the 1997 season, catching 79 passes for 1,398 yards and 7 touchdowns and making his second Pro Bowl selection."
"In 1998, he signed a five-year, $21 million contract with the Oilers, which at the time was the highest known contract ever signed among wide receivers. He went on to play with them for the final three seasons of his career, assisting the team (now known as the Titans) to Super Bowl XXXIV in the 1999 season. Such a large contract for a wide receiver was a signal of the role which wide receivers would begin to play in the NFL. Thigpen retired after the 2000 season with 313 career receptions for 5,081 yards and 30 touchdowns. He also rushed for four yards, returned two punts for 30 yards, and gained 188 yards on eight kickoff returns."

"Using the Batavia Institute as the basis for its proposal, Batavia submitted a bid for the Illinois normal school in 1857. A normal school or teachers college is an educational institution for training teachers. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The State of Illinois passed an act to establish a normal school on 18 February 1857—the second west of the Appalachian Mountains."
"Bids were opened by the State Board of Education in Peoria on 7 May 1857. The first proposition on the agenda was from Batavia, which offered a subscription of $15,000, with the land and building belonging to the Batavia Institute, valued at $30,000, making $45,000 in all. Washington, in Tazewell County, Bloomington, and Peoria submitted proposals, as well. After considerable discussion, a resolution was adopted locating the new university at Bloomington—actually north of town at the village of North Bloomington, which was renamed Normal in 1865, for the school. Illinois State University celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007."
"The building and grounds of the Batavia Institute were sold in 1867 to Dr. Richard J. Patterson, who, as proprietor and medical superintendent, operated it as a private rest home and sanitarium for women, called Bellevue Place. The sanitarium operated until July 1965. The most notable patient was Mary Todd Lincoln, widow of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who was a patient for several months in the summer of 1875."
"In the 1960s, the building was converted to a residential facility for unwed mothers called the Fox Hill Home. The Fox Hill Home operated into the 1970s when the building fell into disrepair."
"In the middle of the 1980s, the building was once again named Bellevue Place and converted into apartments."
The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Place on 13 August 1976.

"Spatz is a children's comedy series that ran on Children's ITV during the 1990s, produced by Thames Television and created by Andrew Bethell. The show originally ran from 21 February 1990 to 10 April 1992. The show centred on a fast food restaurant situated in a fictional shopping mall in Cricklewood, London. It was operated by two Canadians, Karen Hansson (Jennifer Calvert), Spatz International's European Co-ordinator, and Thomas ""TJ"" Strickland ( Paul Michael ), the restaurant's manager. Vas Blackwood, Stephanie Charles, Jonathan Copestake, Sue Devaney, Joe Greco, Katy Murphy, Ling Tai and Samantha Womack appeared as Spatz restaurant employees. Guest stars included David Harewood, Rhys Ifans, Gary Lineker, Danny John-Jules and Nicholas Parsons."
"""Spatz"" was devised by Andrew Bethell as a drama for teenagers set in a 1930s themed burger bar, so named because spats might have been worn there. Alan Horrox at Thames Television bought the concept and title and passed them to Grant Cathro and Lee Pressman, already established at Thames Television as the writers of ""T-Bag"" and creators of ""Mike and Angelo"", to develop ""Spatz"" as a sitcom. While updating the setting to a standard fast food restaurant, the name ""Spatz"" was retained, with the writers noting that it suggested spats or disagreements."
"Series 1 of ""Spatz"" was a co-production between Thames Television and Canada's YTV. From Series 2 onwards, ""Spatz"" was produced solely by Thames Television."

"WPBF presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays)."
"Initially, WPBF had a small news department as it did not plan to launch one until after it received the ABC affiliation. After being purchased by Paxson Communications, the station added additional newscasts to its schedule. For a long time they struggled with ratings in their own market, which is attributable to WPLG's very strong over-the-air signal in Palm Beach County and its availability on Comcast throughout the area. However with Hearst's traditional hard news focus on their stations soon instituted within WPBF's news operation, WPBF eventually became a spirited second place news operation, and WPBF usually outranks WPEC currently in most timeslots (NBC affiliate WPTV has been well dominant in the market for years)."
"On July 12, 2006, it started airing a half-hour newscast called ""Weather First at 4"" on weekdays becoming the first station in West Palm Beach to do so. While the main intention of the new broadcast was to cover West Palm Beach area weather, news updates and headlines were added after a short time. This production is streamed live on their website. On July 17, 2006, WPBF added thirty minutes to its weekday morning show which began airing at 5:30. It became a full two-hour broadcast on January 28, 2008. The station debuted a new traffic reporting system featuring data from Traffic.com on February 14 that included a new traffic segment, ""Beat the Traffic"", seen on weekdays."
"Expansion of local news continued with the launch of a weekend morning newscast on March 8. On August 18, 2008, WPBF began broadcasting a broadcast at noon during the week which is also streamed live on its website. On September 14, 2009, the station debuted a new logo, set, and graphics package while expanding the 4 p.m. newscast to an hour. WPBF dropped weeknight newscasts in the 5 p.m. hour to make room for ""Dr. Phil"" which had moved to the station from WPTV; that change has since been reverted, for as of September 12, 2011, ""The Dr. Oz Show"" replaced the 4 p.m. newscast."
"Until October 4, 2010, WPBF was the only channel in the West Palm Beach market that did not offer newscasts in high definition or even enhanced definition widescreen. However, WPBF was operating HD-ready studios and field cameras for its broadcasts. The shows were displayed in pillarboxed standard definition while showing the station's logo and ""HD"" in the left and right thirds of the screen. On October 4 starting with the weeknight 4 p.m. newscast, WPBF started broadcasting local news in high definition. Upon the upgrade, it began using an updated music package and slightly revised HD graphics previously used by sister station WESH in Orlando. In December 2012, WPBF upgraded their graphics package to the new Hearst Television graphics along with new music and talent opens. However, like another sister station, KSBW in Salinas, California, HD is not mentioned in the news openings. WPBF will also continue to display HD in the left and right thirds of the screen when video footage is shown in 4:3 standard definition. The station does not currently operate a sports department which is unusual for both a big three network channel and a Hearst-owned station."

"Marjorie Celeste Champion (née Belcher; born September 2, 1919) is an American dancer and actress. At a young age, she was hired as a dance model for Walt Disney Studios animated films. Later, she performed as an actress and dancer in film musicals, and in 1957 had a TV show based on song and dance. She has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley."
"Marge Champion was born as Marjorie Celeste Belcher on September 2, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Hollywood dance director Ernest Belcher and his wife, Gladys Lee Baskette (née Rosenberg). She had an older half sister, Lina Basquette, who already was acting in silent films at the age of twelve. Lina was the daughter of her mother's first husband, Frank Baskette, who had committed suicide."
"Marjorie began dancing at an early age as her sister had done. She began dancing as a child under the instruction of her father, Ernest Belcher, a noted Hollywood ballet coach who trained Shirley Temple, Cyd Charisse, and Gwen Verdon. She studied exclusively with her father from age five until she left for New York. She credits her good health and long career to her father's teaching principles: careful, strict progression of activity, emphasis on correct alignment, precise placement of body, attention to detail and to the totality of dynamics and phrasing. Her first dance partner was Louis Hightower. In 1930, she made her debut in the Hollywood Bowl at age 11 in the ballet ""Carnival in Venice"". By age twelve, she became a ballet instructor at her father's studio. She was hired by The Walt Disney Studio as a dance model for their animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Her movements were copied to enhance the realism of the animated Snow White figure."
"In 1937, Marge Belcher married Art Babbitt (1907–1992), a top animator at Disney and creator of Goofy. They divorced in 1940."
"In 1947, she married dancer Gower Champion (1919–1980). They had two sons, Blake and actor Gregg Champion. They divorced in January 1973. Belcher met Gower when she was 12 years old in the ninth grade at Bancroft Junior High and that's when their romance started. Although performances often took them away from California, Los Angeles remained their home base."
"In 1977, she married director Boris Sagal. Sagal was killed on May 22, 1981, in an accident during the production of the miniseries ""World War III"". She became stepmother to Boris' five children, who include Katey, Jean, Liz, and Joey."
"The very first picture Belcher remembers being in was ""The Castles"" with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This gave her a feeling that she would really like to do movies but what she really wanted to do was go to New York and be in New York shows. Sadly, Belcher wasn't tall enough not even for ballet, which is what she trained all her life for."
"Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including their first MGM musical ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" (1946), ""Show Boat"" (1951) and ""Everything I Have Is Yours"" (1952). Other films with Gower included ""Mr. Music"" (1950, with Bing Crosby), ""Give a Girl a Break"" (1953), ""Jupiter's Darling"" (1955), and ""Three for the Show"" (1955). MGM wanted the couple to remake Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, but only one, ""Lovely to Look At"" (1952), a remake of ""Roberta"" (1935), was completed. The couple refused to remake any of the others, the rights to which were still owned by RKO."
"Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of ""What's My Line"". Mary Healy guessed who they were."
"During the summer of 1957, the Champions had their own TV series, ""The Marge and Gower Champion Show"", a situation comedy with song and dance numbers. Marge played a dancer and Gower a choreographer. Real-life drummer Buddy Rich was featured as a fictional drummer named Cozy."
"In the 1970s, Champion, actress Marilee Zdenek, and choreographer John West were part of a team at Bel Aire Presbyterian Church that created a number of creative worship services featuring dance and music. They later offered workshops and related liturgical arts programs throughout the country. She and Zdenek co-authored two books, ""Catch the New Wind"" and ""God Is a Verb"", related to this work."
"In 1978 she served as a dialogue and movement coach for the TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", adapted from Conrad Richter's trilogy of the same name. It was set in the late 18th-century Ohio Valley."
"Champion has also worked as a dance instructor and choreographer in New York City. In 1982, she made a rare television acting appearance on the dramatic TV series ""Fame"", playing a ballet teacher with a racial bias against African-American students."
"Champion appeared in several stage musicals and plays on Broadway as a performer. She made her New York debut in ""What's Up"" (1943). She also performed in the ""Dark of the Moon"" (1945) as the Fair Witch, and ""Beggar's Holiday"" (1946) having multiple roles. She made her last Broadway appearance in ""3 for Tonight"" in 1955. She also worked as a choreographer or Assistant, including ""Lend an Ear"" in 1948 as assistant to the Choreographer; ""Make a Wish"" in 1951, as assistant to Gower Champion; ""Hello, Dolly!"" in 1964 as special assistant; and ""Stepping Out"" (1987) as choreographic associate. In 2001, she appeared as Emily Whitman in the Broadway stage revival of ""Follies""."
"Champion states ""as a dancer, by the time you're 40 you're done. If I ever come back, I want to be an actress- it lasts long. But I was 81 when I was in ""Follies""."
"Marge Champion has been interviewed in numerous documentaries, including for the behind-the-scenes documentary directed by Oscar-winner Chris Innis, ""The Story of the Swimmer"", which was featured on the 2014 Grindhouse Releasing/Box Office Spectaculars Blu-ray/DVD restoration of ""The Swimmer"". She was also interviewed at a Hollywood film festival screening of ""The Swimmer"" by filmmaker Allison Anders for the same release.

"After their breakup, SLC released all their previous recordings under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), for free online distribution."
The band reformed for a once-off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for independent record store Fist2face.
"Sounds Like Chicken began in 1999 when Nathanael Kitingan (Nat Kitingan) met Nyall Dawson at Monash University in Melbourne. Nat and Nyall attempted to start an unnamed musical project with Hugh Ogilvy (also from Monash University) featuring Nyall on electric violin, Hugh on guitar and Nat on drums. This trio did not get off the ground and so brothers Joel and Elliot Dawson joined to form Sounds Like Chicken, a ska project taking influences from Voodoo Glow Skulls, The O.C. Supertones, The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. This early lineup was Nyall (vocals), Nat (bass/vocals), Elliot (drums), Joel (sax) and Hugh (guitar)."
"Sounds Like Chicken's first show was at Joel's 21st birthday party in mid-2000. Hugh left the band at the end of 2000 due to other commitments and was replaced by Tom Dowding on guitar. Tom was an extremely accomplished bass player and so Nat decided to swap to playing guitar so that Tom's talent could be fully utilised. The band decided they needed another horn and so after a number of unsuccessful audition attempts, in 2001 Nat met Natalie Parker at university and invited her to a practice. Natalie was initially apprehensive but was eventually convinced by the boys to join the band. During her second practice she was already laying down trumpet tracks on their first demo recording which ended up becoming the band's self-made demo EP, ""Slowly Going the Way of the Chicken""."
"Sounds Like Chicken toured interstate for the first time under this lineup in September 2001, playing in Sydney and Canberra and also at the Black Stump Music Festival. In 2002, Tom Dowding departed from Sounds like Chicken to be replaced by Joshua Diemar on bass. It was in this year that Sounds Like Chicken released their first studio EP, ""I Am Gibbon, Hear Me Roar"", produced by David Carr (Antiskeptic, Taxiride). The EP gave the band airplay on community radio, Christian radio, and Triple J."
"In early 2004, the band were signed to Boomtown Records, a Melbourne-based indie record label distributing through Shock Records and MGM. Deciding that a bigger ensemble was required, Sounds Like Chicken asked long-time friend Dave Powys (ex Staff Discount and Never In Doubt) to join on second guitar, making them a 7-piece band. Dave moved down from Canberra and recorded on the single Global Domination, their first release with Boomtown and distributed through MGM. The single received national airplay and spot airplay on Triple J and was sold out within 2 months of its limited pressing. It was noted that producer Dave Carr's production was a big step up from previous releases."
"It was shortly after this that the band decided it was time to move on and the band was without a bass-player. They were booked in to record an album and so asked if Carlos Echeverria (ex Know Exit and Wishful Thinking) would fill in and record bass for them. Their first full-length album, ""...Like a Cannonball to the Ocean Floor"" was released late that year through Boomtown, also doing well on the airwaves. The album drew acclaim from reviewers as a ""brilliantly released debut album"", although the length of 17 tracks drew some criticism. Sounds Like Chicken did a joint national tour with label-mates Wishful Thinking to launch the album. Carlos officially joined shortly after the album's release."
"In early 2005 founding member and manager, Elliot, decided to part ways with the band. Mike ""Carcass"" Haydon (of Melbourne band ""The Knockabouts""), only 17 at the time, was able to fill the role of drummer. Mike had been a tour roadie for the band for the past 3 years and so was already well-acquainted with their songs. That year Sounds Like Chicken released the second double-A side single off the album, ""Take a Bullet to the Grave/El Chupanebre"" through Boomtown Records, and completed a national tour over 3 months to launch it."
"On 3 November 2006, founding member, Nyall Dawson, announced his decision to depart the band early in 2007."
Sounds Like Chicken have played and toured with numerous well-known Australian and international acts and have been featured on various international and Australian compilations and soundtracks such as Turn the Other Cheek Volume 1.
"On 18 December 2006 Sounds Like Chicken announced they were calling it a day in a bulletin released on the band's MySpace. The main factors in the breakup was the future departure of Nyall Dawson and other key members of the band, the band stated..."
"""""We guess it’s time for some of us to move on. There was other plans for our lives and with the impending departure of some key members, we felt that SLC would simply not be SLC if we went on without them. We all feel at peace about this decision."""""
"Shortly after, the band announced plans for an Australia wide farewell tour to take place in February–March 2007, along with the release of a final limited-edition compilation disk titled ""Death To The Crow"" to coincide with the tour."
"Sounds Like Chicken's final show was held at TLC Bayswater, Victoria on Saturday 17 March 2007."
The band's entire discography (except for Death To The Crow) was made available for free download on their website and on Jamendo
"In April 2007, former SLC members Mike Haydon, Dave Powys, Ben Hobson, Nat Kitingan and Joel Dawson together with new addition Paul McCasker formed reggae band San Salvador. They released an EP ""How To Hear"", two singles ""Like a Train"" and ""Spark the Fire"" and later the mini-album ""Rugged Are The Mountains""."
Former members Mike Haydon and Joe Ireland later joined indie band The Middle East which featured two tracks in Triple J's hottest 100 in 2010. Dave Powys also went on to join indie folk band The Paper Kites.
"On 31 March 2014 it was announced on the band's fan-run Facebook page that they were reforming for a once off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for Fist2face record store. The show was held at Ding Dong Lounge and featured supports from Antiskeptic, The Ramshackle Army, Best Before, Payoff and more. The show sold out."
= = = Full Scale (band) = = =
"Full Scale (formerly known as Full Scale Deflection, later known as Full Scale Revolution) is an Australian alternative metal band that formed in Perth, Western Australia during 1998. The band relocated to Melbourne in 2001."
"Full Scale released two extended plays; ""Black Arrows"" and ""White Arrows"" both in 2003 on Popstar Records. They also released a self-titled studio album issued in 2005 on Columbia Records, ""Full Scale""."
"Full Scale were formed in 1998 in Perth as Full Scale Deflection. By 1999, they consisted of Ezekiel the Ox on lead vocals, Nic Frey on drums, Chris Frey on bass guitar, Forrester Savell on synthesiser, and Jimmy Tee on guitar. Matt Crute (aka Crutey) soon replaced Nic Frey on drums. Rob Kaay replaced Chris Frey on bass guitar by 2000. They released the album, ""Symptoms of Chaos"", on 11 November 2000. The band dropped the word Deflection from their name and then moved to Melbourne in 2001. Despite playing their original songs for some of their shows, they developed new music."
"Kaay and Andrew McGuiness (a lawyer) formed a record label, Popstar Records, and Full Scale released their debut extended play, ""Black Arrows"" in March 2003. This was followed by a second EP, ""White Arrows"" in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively."
"According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, ""the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound – led by Ox's vocal seethe – caught the interest of American majors"". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, ""Full Scale"", on 8 March 2005. After the album's release they toured the United States as the opening act for US rap rock band, Hed PE."
"Upon returning to Australia, Crutey and Tee decided to play one last show with the band and Ben Brennan (Seven, Full Scale Revolution) played his first show with Full Scale on bass guitar at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne on 17 March 2006. Ox moved on to a new group, Mammal."
"In January 2016 Ox and Tee announced that they were reforming the band with a new rhythm section of Chris Webber (Webbsy) and Leigh Miller. They announced February 2016 tour dates in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth."
"The band released a new song entitled ""Jurassic Graveyard"" in January 2018, and embarked on a national tour of Australia. So far, no new album has yet been announced."
"After Full Scale, Ox became the front man for Mammal, from March 2006, they released an EP, ""Mammal"". Their single ""Slaves"" was produced by Ox's ex-bandmate Savell. They later released two albums ("""" and ""The Majority"") and disbanded in 2009. He was the front-man of The Ox & the Fury with Brennan, Lucius Borich and Dom Italiano, as an alternate country music group. Ox also appeared in theatre, and produced music for hip hop groups. Ox later became the front man of Over-Reactor (based in Melbourne), which released their album, ""Lose Your Delusion""."
"Kaay became an author and entrepreneur. He used the business management skills he had acquired to build Full Scale into the band that was signed to Columbia Records to start his own Australian company. Right after Full Scale, he joined Sunk Loto in September 2006, until they broke up in December 2007. After that he worked with the Brown brothers for nearly two years on an unreleased project tentatively entitled, ""The Flood The Flood"". Deciding to retire from the live-music-touring scene in 2008, Kaay released a series of books, ""Robkaay Journals. Vol. I, My Glorious Nightmare"" (2008), based on his recollections of his music career over a period of ten years. Vol. II followed in 2010 as ""This is what it's really like being in a band"". He has also written two fantasy fiction novels, ""Silverbirch: A Tear in the Fabric of the Night Sky""(2009) and Silverbirch: Fall of the Epicenter. His first Silverbirch novel cracked the Top 10 Amazon.com chart in its first week of release in the Science Fiction category. Kaay is now a successful entrepreneur running multiple businesses under his company Kaay.com.au(.)"
"Mu'in ad-Din Unur al-Atabeki (; died August 28, 1149) was the Turkish ruler of Damascus in the mid-12th century."
"Mu'in ad-Din was originally a Mameluk in the army of Toghtekin, the founder of the Burid Dynasty of Damascus. When Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo, besieged Damascus in 1135, Mu'in ad-Din was at the head of army defending the city. That year the Burid Shihab ad-Din Mahmud took control of Damascus after the assassination of his brother; when Zengi gave up the siege and instead besieged Homs, Shihab ad-Din sent Yusuf ibn Firuz and Mu'in ad-Din to govern it, with Yusuf acting as Mu'in ad-Din's lieutenant. In 1137 Mu'in ad-Din was still governor of Homs when the city was briefly besieged again by Zengi. In 1138, Shihab ad-Din appointed Mu'in ad-Din atabeg of Damascus and gave him the title ""Isfahsaller"". Later in 1138, Zengi negotiated a marriage between himself and Shihab ad-Din's mother Khatun Safwat al-Mulk, and as part of the settlement Zengi received Homs. Mu'in ad-Din was given the castle of Barin in place of Homs. On June 22, 1139, Shihab ad-Din was assassinated in Damascus; Jamal ad-Din, emir of Baalbek, was chosen as his successor, and Mu'in ad-Din was chosen to govern Baalbek in his absence. He was in charge of the defenses of Baalbek when Zengi arrived to avenge the murder of his stepson. Zengi besieged it with 14 catapults and the city surrendered to him."
"In 1140 Jamal ad-Din died, and Mu'in ad-Din continued to rule as regent for Jamal ad-Din's son Mujir ad-Din. That year, Mu'in ad-Din besieged Banias with help from King Fulk of Jerusalem and Prince Raymond of Antioch; Mu'in ad-Din offered 20 000 pieces of gold per month to pay for their expenses. When it was captured, Mu'in ad-Din handed it over to Fulk and returned to Damascus. A more thorough alliance, to protect Damascus against Zengi, was negotiated during a visit by Mu'in ad-Din to Jerusalem, accompanied by the future chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh."
"King Fulk died in 1143, and Zengi was assassinated in 1146. Zengi was succeeded by his sons Saif ad-Din Ghazi I in Mosul and Nur ad-Din in Aleppo, and Mu'in ad-Din took the opportunity to besiege Baalbek; the governor, Najm ad-Din Ayyub, father of Saladin, quickly surrendered to him. Mu'in ad-Din also asserted control over Homs and Hama, and sent Yarankash, the assassin of Zengi, to Nur ad-Din, after Yarankash sought refuge in Damascus."
"Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's power, but it was his policy to remain on friendly terms with his neighbours wherever possible, whether they were Christian or Muslim. In 1147 Nur ad-Din and Mu'in ad-Din negotiated an alliance, in which Nur ad-Din married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Having established peace with Aleppo, Mu'in ad-Din set out to besiege Salkhad and Bosra, after their governor, Altuntash, allied with Jerusalem against him. This broke Jerusalem's treaty with Damascus, forcing Mu'in ad-Din to turn to Nur ad-Din for assistance. Nur ad-Din arrived with the army of Aleppo, and the crusaders were forced to withdraw; both Bosra and Sarkhad then surrendered to Mu'in ad-Din. In August 1147 Mu'in ad-Din was formally recognized as governor of Damascus by the Caliph of Baghdad Al-Muqtafi and the Seljuk Sultan Mas'ud, and he was also recognized formally by the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt, al-Hafiz."
"In 1148 news reached Damascus of a new crusade, called in response to Zengi's capture of Edessa in 1145. Mu'in ad-Din prepared for the inevitable siege, although he had hoped his former alliance with Jerusalem could be restored and that the crusade would attack some other city. When the crusaders arrived in July, according to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Mu'in ad-Din ""distinguished himself in combat with them, and displayed a valour, steadfastness and gallantry such as was never seen in any other, never wearying in repelling them nor taking respite from the struggle against them."" Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly sent for help from Nur ad-Din and Saif-ad Din Ghazi, whose power he did not wish to see extend as far south as Damascus, and the crusaders besieged the city for only four days before withdrawing. It is possible that Mu'in ad-Din had bribed the crusaders to leave before Nur ad-Din arrived. After this success, the three emirs besieged the castle of Araima in the County of Tripoli, but Mu'in ad-Din was forced to acknowledge Nur ad-Din as his overlord."
"In 1149 Mu'in ad-Din led raids against crusader territory, in response to their raids against the territory of Damascus which they continued to make after the failure of their siege. He agreed to a two-year truce with King Baldwin III, and then joined with Nur ad-Din against the Principality of Antioch. Mu’in ad-Din patrolled the Hauran with his army while Nur ad-Din defeated Antioch at the Battle of Inab that year, in which Prince Raymond was killed."
"After returning to Damascus in July 1149, Mu'in ad-Din ""ate a hearty meal, as was his usual custom, and was seized thereafter by a loosening of the bowels...From this resulted in the disease known as dysentery..."" The emir died on August 28 and was buried in the university he had established in the city. As he had been acting as regent for Mujir ad-Din, the latter took his place as the rightful heir of Damascus. Mujir ad-Din was a weak ruler, however, and by 1154 Nur ad-Din was fully in control of the city and all of Syria."
"Mu'in ad-Din had three daughters, who married Nur ad-Din, Mujir ad-Din, and a soldier named Margar respectively. In addition to Ibn al-Qalanisi's favourable depiction of him, the Christian chronicler William of Tyre also speaks very highly of Mu'in ad-Din: he showed ""sincere fidelity"" in his negotiations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was ""a man of much wisdom and a lover of our people."" William of Tyre rendered his names in Latin as ""Meheneddin"" for Mu'in ad-Din and ""Anardus"" for Unur."

"Vladimir Monomakh () was an armoured cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1880s. The vessel was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev. She spent most of her career in the Far East, although the ship was in the Baltic Sea when the Russo-Japanese War began in 1904. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron and participated in the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. She was tasked to protect the Russian transports and was not heavily engaged during the daylight portion of the battle. The ship was torpedoed during the night and was scuttled the following morning by her captain to prevent her capture by the Japanese."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was classified as a semi-armored frigate and was an improved version of the preceding . The ship was designed with high endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a commerce raider able to outrun enemy battleships. She was laid out as a central battery ironclad with the armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a ram and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. The ship's hull was subdivided by ten transverse bulkheads and she had a double bottom deep. Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced at deep load."
"The ship had two vertical compound steam engines, each driving a four-bladed, manganese-bronze propeller. Steam was provided by six cylindrical boilers at a pressure of . The engines produced during sea trials which gave the ship a maximum speed around . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" carried of coal which gave her an economical range of at a speed of . She was ship rigged with three masts and had a total sail area of . To reduce drag while under sail, her funnels were retractable."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was armed with four guns, one at each corner of the battery that were sponsoned out over the sides of the hull. Eight of the dozen guns were mounted between the eight-inch guns in the central battery and the remaining four were outside the battery at the ends of the ship. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by four 9-pounder and ten Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with three above-water torpedo tubes."
"The ship's waterline belt was composed of compound armour and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to at the ship's ends. It extended above the waterline and below. Transverse bulkheads thick protected the guns in the battery from raking fire. The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick. The protective deck was thick."
"Construction began on ""Vladimir Monomakh"" on 22 February 1881 at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882 and completed on 13 July 1883. The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 rubles. Although the second vessel to be laid down in the ""Dmitri Donskoy"" class, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably by the time of completion. The ship was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev."
"On 11 October 1884, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" began a leisurely voyage from the Baltic Sea to the Far East. She made port visits in Kristiansand, Norway and Portland Harbour, England before reaching Malta on 25 November. The ship spent most of the next six weeks in Greek waters before arriving at Port Said, Egypt on 12 January 1885 to transit the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" encountered the British ironclad battleship there and was followed by her all the way to Japan as tensions were rising between Great Britain and Russia in early 1885. The ship arrived in Nagasaki in March 1885 and was appointed flagship of the Russian Pacific Fleet under Rear Admiral A.E. Kroun. Based out of Vladivostok, she normally wintered in warmer waters. For example, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" visited Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, Batavia, Dutch East Indies and Penang Island between November 1885 and March 1886. She returned to Kronstadt in 1887 and was refitted in 1888."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" departed Kronstadt for the Mediterranean on 6 November 1889 where she remained for the next year. She joined the official escort for the Tsarevich Nicholas II’s visit to the Far East. The Tsarevich travelled aboard the and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" provided protection. The two ships reached Singapore on 2 March 1891, and reached Vladivostok on 23 May. Once at Vladivostok, Captain Oskar Stark was appointed commander of the ship and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was overhauled through August. She wintered over again at Nagasaki, departing for Europe on 23 April 1892 and reached Kronstadt in August, where the ship was given a thorough refit beginning on 22 September. The heavy sailing rig was replaced by three signal masts, her funnels were fixed in place, and her boilers were also upgraded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was reclassified as a 1st Class Cruiser on 13 February 1892."
"On 2 October 1894 the ship, now under the command of Captain Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was ordered back to the Mediterranean. In view of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, the Council of Ministers ordered on 1 February 1895 that the Mediterranean Squadron reinforce the 2nd Pacific Squadron. She reached the Chinese treaty port of Chefoo on 16 April and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, 2nd in command of the Pacific Fleet, on 13 May. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained at Chefoo until late in the year before sailing to Vladivostok and then to Kobe, Japan in January 1896."
The ship only remained there for a short time before she was ordered back to Kronstadt for a major modernization. Her obsolete 8-inch and 6-inch guns were replaced with five new 45-calibre 6-inch and six Canet guns. The ship's six original boilers were replaced by a dozen cylindrical boilers.
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet in November 1897 and reached Nagasaki in February 1898. After the Triple Intervention expelled the Japanese from Port Arthur, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was part of the Russian force which subsequently occupied that strategic harbor. In June 1900, she transported troops involved in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. In September 1900, on her return to Port Arthur, she accidentally rammed and sank the merchant vessel ""Crown of Aragon"". In December 1901, she rendezvoused with ""Dmitri Donskoy"" at Hong Kong, and the two ships returned to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained in the Mediterranean until August 1902, and reached Kronstadt in October. In 1903–04 some of her Hotchkiss guns were replaced by ."
"In February 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron, which was sent to reinforce Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky's Second Pacific Squadron. The Third Pacific Squadron transited the Suez Canal and joined the 2nd Pacific Squadron at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 14 May 1905 where they was assigned to the Cruiser Division commanded by Rear Admiral Oskar Enkvist."
"At the decisive Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was positioned to the right side of the Russian line of battle, guarding the transports and so avoided the pounding that the other vessels of Second Pacific Squadron received, although she engaged the Japanese cruiser . The Japanese ship was hit several times and driven off, but only three crewmen were killed and seven wounded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was hit several times itself and had one 120 mm gun destroyed and its crew killed. The most dangerous hit was a shell that burst over a 6-inch shell hoist and started an ammunition fire. The prompt flooding of the magazine averted an explosion."
"At nightfall, the Japanese torpedo boats engaged the surviving Russian warships and the cruiser claimed to have sunk one of her attackers at 8:25 p.m. ""Vladimir Monomakh"", mistaking one of her attackers for a Russian destroyer, was hit around 8:40 by a single torpedo which ruptured her hull near the No. 2 coal bunker, but sank the torpedo boat. The damage was severe but her crew kept her afloat and her engines operational, although she continued to take on water. The next morning, however, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" headed towards Tsushima Island and began to unload her wounded into her surviving boats. Captain Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popov gave the order to abandon ship, and ordered the seacocks to be opened to scuttle the vessel rather than surrender it to the Japanese. The ship sank at 10:20 a.m. and the crew was captured by the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was officially removed from the navy list on 28 September 1905."

= = = Bahag (garment) = = =
"Bahag is a loincloth that was commonly used throughout the Philippines before the arrival of European colonizers, and which is used by some indigenous tribes of the Philippines today - most notably the Cordillerans in Northern Luzon."
"It is basically a hand-loomed piece of long cloth that is wrapped around a man's middle. The design of the weave is often unique to the tribe of the person wearing the Bahag, much like the Celtic Tartans were."
"The Udzungwa Mountains are a mountain range in south-central Tanzania. The mountains are mostly within Iringa Region, south of Tanzania's capital Dodoma. The Udzungwa Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species."
"The mountains are home to the Hehe people, and the name Udzungwa comes from the Kihehe word “Wadzungwa"", which means the people who live on mountainsides. Iringa is the largest settlement in the mountains, and the regional headquarters."
"The Undzungwa Mountains cover an area of 16,131.40 km², the largest of the Eastern Arc ranges. The highest peak in the range is Luhombero at . The mountain range extends generally northeast-southwest. The Usangu Plain lies to the northwest, drained by the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries. The Great Ruaha River separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Rubeho Mountains and Uvidunda Mountains to the northeast. The Kilombero River valley lies to the south and southeast. To the southwest the Makambako Gap separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Kipengere Range."
"Both the Great Ruaha and Kilombero rivers are tributaries of the Rufiji River, which empties into the Indian Ocean. The Lukosi River originates in the central part of the range, and empties eastwards into the Great Ruaha. The Little Ruaha River and its tributaries drain much of the western portion of the range, emptying northwards into the Great Ruaha."
"The Udzungwa Mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, and receive more rainfall than the surrounding lowlands. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and southeastern slopes facing the Indian Ocean, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations."
"The Udzungwa Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west."
"About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as ""islands"" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Udzungwa and other Eastern Arc mountains has extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species). 10 percent of them are protected by the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and the Udzungwa Scarp Nature Forest Reserve."
"The Udzungwa Mountains are covered with lowland rainforest, montane rainforest, miombo woodland, grassland, and heathland. Forests extend from 300 to 2579 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. The wetter eastern and southeastern slopes receive more rain from the Indian Ocean and support evergreen forests on the lower slopes; the drier western and northwestern slopes have decidious miombo forests and woodlands at lower elevations and evergreen forests only at higher elevations."
Broad areas of forest on the central plateau have been cleared for agriculture and pasture. An analysis of satellite images taken between 1999 and 2003 found 1353 km² of the mountains were still covered in evergreen forest.
"The mountains are home to many mammals, including Abbott's duiker ""(Cephalophus spadix)"", Kipunji ""(Rungwecebus kipunji)"", and Udzungwa red colobus ""(Cercocebus galeritus)"", and unusual animals such as the grey-faced sengi ""(Rhynchocyon udzungwensis)"". The Udzungwa forest partridge (""Xenoperdix udzungwensis"") is an endemic species, with its closest relatives appearing to be the hill partridges of Asia. Elephants ""(Loxodonta africana)"" are found in the forests along the southern escarpment."
"Although the two mountain groups are ecologically distinct, the Eastern Arc Mountains share many species and plant communities with the Southern Highlands which lie to the southwest across the Makambako Gap. Both are Afromontane regions, home to characteristic montane species and ecologically distinct from the adjacent lowlands.

"Jan. 9–10: BAMN held a press conference at Cass Tech High School in Detroit announcing that their appeal of the Federal Appeals Court decision overturning the delay of the ban on affirmative action. The next day, after placing holds on admissions, the University of Michigan announced that they will comply with the ban on affirmative action. Hours later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens responded to BAMN's appeal of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision overturning the delay of Proposal 2's implementation and ordered all briefs due by January 17. U-M, Wayne State, MSU, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm all filed briefs in support. Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox urged Stevens to deny the injunction. On January 19, the Supreme Court denied BAMN's appeal without comment."

"On Friday, July 1, 2011, the Federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held the amendment unconstitutional on the grounds that it ""reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests,"" and thus violates the 14th Amendment. Attorney General Bill Schuette then announced that he would appeal the ruling and ask to have the case re-heard ""en banc,"" by all active judges rather than a panel of three."

The data also show that in the period immediately before Proposal 2 was implemented, minority admissions was up 55% from the same period in 2006. A spokeswoman for the university, Julie Peterson, has said that since the numbers aren't final and since so many minority students applied early, the drop cannot necessarily be attributed to the amendment itself."

"Boulders Beach is a sheltered beach made up of inlets between granite boulders, from which the name originated. It is located in the Cape Peninsula, near Simon's Town towards Cape Point, near Cape Town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is also commonly known as Boulders Bay. It is a popular tourist stop because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. Boulders Beach forms part of the Table Mountain National Park."
"These African penguins are only found on the coastlines of Southern Africa - (South Africa & Namibia). These penguins are currently on the verge of extinction. As a result, the penguins are under the protection of the Cape Nature Conservation."
"Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird (""Spheniscus demersus"") can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. This is partly due to the reduction in commercial pelagic trawling in False Bay, which has increased the supply of pilchards and anchovy, which form part of the penguins' diet."
"Bordered mainly by indigenous bush above the high-water mark on the one side, and the clear water of False Bay on the other, the area comprises a number of small sheltered bays, partially enclosed by granite boulders that are 540 million years old."
"The most popular recreational spot is Boulders Beach, but the penguins are best viewed from Foxy Beach, where newly constructed boardwalks take visitors to within a few meters of the birds. It is also a popular swimming beach, although people are restricted to beaches adjacent to the penguin colony."

Baker had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of colonel but resigned following his election as lieutenant governor, during which time he played an important role in overseeing the formation and training of states levies. He served as acting-governor for five months during the illness of Governor Oliver Morton, and was elevated to Governor following Morton's resignation from office. During Baker's full term as governor, he focused primitively on the creation and improvement of institutions to help veterans and their families that had been disaffected by the war. He also championed the post-war federal constitutional amendments, and was able to successfully advocate their acceptance."
"Conrad Baker was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, on February 12, 1817, the son of Conrad Baker, a Presbyterian minister, and Mary Winternheimer Baker. He worked on the family farm until age fifteen and attended common school. He then enrolled in Pennsylvania College in Gettysburg where he studied law, but quit before graduating. He continued to study law in the office of Thaddeus Stevens. He met Matilda Escon Sommers and the couple married in 1838. They had two children. Baker was admitted to the bar in 1839 and opened his own office in Gettysburg."
"A third ""Yorga"" film, which would have featured a broken Count Yorga living in Los Angeles's sewers and creating an army of undead street people, never materialised."
"Though Count Yorga is referred to as ""the Deathmaster"" in publicity for this film, a later film called ""The Deathmaster"", also starring Robert Quarry as a vampire, has no relation to the Count Yorga series."
The film was released theatrically in the US by American International Pictures in 1971.
"The film was released on VHS home video (full screen format) in 1993 by Orion Home Video, which once held home video distribution rights to many titles in the American International Pictures catalog."
"The film was given a second VHS release by MGM Home Entertainment in September 2000. It later was released on DVD by MGM in 2005 as part of its Midnite Movies series. The disc was a double-feature release, pairing the film with ""Count Yorga, Vampire""."
"When CBS ran the movie in the 1970s on its ""Friday Night Late Movie"", the on-screen title was ""Yorga Returns""."

""Variety"" called it ""a solid follow-up"" to the original and ""a handsome-looking film which rings the bell on both the shocker and satirical level."" Gene Siskel of the ""Chicago Tribune"" gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it ""extremely frightening"" and adding, ""Persons familiar with the original will find the sequel better photographed, better acted and containing more mayhem a minute."" Kevin Thomas of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote, ""Those who saw 'Count Yorga' will be disappointed. Those who only see 'The Return' will wonder what all the fuss was about in regard to the original.

David Pirie of ""The Monthly Film Bulletin"" wrote that Count Yorga had been resurrected ""with considerably more enterprise and panache than before."" He praised the acting as being ""of a generally high standard"" and the castle set as ""skilfully utilised to give the impression of a labyrinth of Borgesian proportions,"" though he criticized ""a totally unnecessary and feeble attempt to make the Count into a sympathetic figure through such lines as, 'The most fragile emotion ever known has entered my breast.'"""
= = = Nuoli-class fast gunboat = = =
"The Nuoli class motor gunboats () was a series of thirteen fast attack craft (gun) of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1961 by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab in Turku, and modernized in 1979. The Nuoli motor gunboats played a very important role in naval training and were in service to early 90s."
"There are two distinctive versions, 1-10 and 11-13. The former could be distinguished by having a higher superstructure. All were equipped with three Soviet-made V-12 diesel engines. There was no separate cruise engine, except from a small auxiliary engine that produced electricity. The vessels were first equipped with large screws, but later changed to smaller, albeit equally effective screws, manufactured by Finnscrew."
"The Nuoli-class was planned to be armed with electrically controlled Bofors 40/70-system, but limitations of the auxiliary engine prevented this. For a brief time, Madsen 20/60 were replaced with Breda 12.7 mm heavy machine-gun which came from WW II-period Fiat G50-fighters; the change back to Madsen was done in 1981."
"Finland was forbidden to have torpedo boats after World War II, but the Nuoli class could quickly be converted into such, if need arose. in 1982 Nuoli-6 was transferred and ferried to Obbnäs torpedo test station to be used as test vessel for a new Finnish-origin torpedo system, which failed. The trip to Obbnäs was made in heavy weather - the waves were so hard that they damaged the wooden support structure of the bow. Nuoli-6 was driven aground in Obbnäs 1983 (summer/autumn) and was stricken."
"As service vessel these boats gave one a true feeling of being a sailor. Constructed of wood, they leaked ""a bit"" an so the atmosphere was rather moist. Living quarters were limited - even those of the commanding officer. There was no privacy at all - on Nuoli one was true member of the crew."
"The vessels are today spread all over Finland, and one is in Germany (Nuoli 12). Nuoli 8 is preserved at the Turku marine museum ""Forum Marinum""."
= = = 1991 Football League Cup Final = = =
The 1991 Football League Cup Final was a football match played on 21 April 1991 between Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday. It was the first of two years that the competition was sponsored by Rumbelows.
"Despite the previous season's FA Cup winners, Manchester United, being favourites to lift the trophy, Second Division side Sheffield Wednesday won the match 1–0, the winning goal scored by John Sheridan, giving the Owls their first League Cup title in a season when they also won promotion back to the top flight. The match is regarded as one of the most memorable League Cup finals of all time."
The trophy was presented to Wednesday skipper Nigel Pearson by Rumbelows employee of the year Tracy Bateman. Pearson was also named man of the match.
"The Football League Cup is a cup competition open to clubs in the Premier League and The Football League. It is played on a knockout basis, with the exception of the semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. As clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League, both teams entered the competition in the second round."
"Manchester United's second-round tie saw them drawn against Fourth Division Halifax Town; they won the first leg at The Shay 3–1, with goals from Clayton Blackmore, Brian McClair and Neil Webb, before Viv Anderson and Steve Bruce gave them a 2–1 win at Old Trafford and a 5–2 aggregate victory. Anderson, who was by now rarely used in the United first team, went on to be sold to Sheffield Wednesday three months later, his appearance for United in the early stages of the competition making him ineligible for Wednesday's matches and denying him the chance to add to the two League Cup medals he had won with Nottingham Forest and a later medal in the competition won with Arsenal."
"They were then drawn against rivals and reigning First Division champions Liverpool in the third round, where Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe joined Bruce on the score sheet in a 3–1 home win. In the fourth round, a 19-year-old Sharpe scored a hat-trick in addition to goals from Blackmore, Hughes and Danny Wallace to give United a 6–2 away win over Arsenal, who would go on to win the First Division title that season, just over a month after the two teams had been involved in a mass brawl during a 1–0 Arsenal win at Old Trafford that saw both teams deducted points."
"In the fifth round, United were held to a 1–1 draw away to Southampton, Hughes scoring their only goal; Hughes was again the only United player on the score sheet in the replay a week later, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 win that put them into the semi-finals. Southampton striker Alan Shearer, who within months was reported to be transfer target for Manchester United, scoring all of Southampton's goals during the two cup clashes with United."
"Goals from McClair and Sharpe gave United a 2–1 win in the first leg of the semi-final at home to Leeds United, and Sharpe scored again in the second leg – his sixth League Cup goal of the season – as United won 1–0, and 3–1 on aggregate, to put them into their second League Cup final."
"Sheffield Wednesday, whose last major honour had been the FA Cup in 1935, were fresh from relegation to the Second Division when they were drawn against Third Division Brentford in the second round, winning 2–1 in each of the two legs to put them into the third round. There they met fellow Second Division side Swindon Town, who held them to a goalless draw at Hillsborough, before succumbing to a 1–0 defeat at the County Ground in the replay a week later. Wednesday required another replay in the fourth round, after they played out another draw at home to Derby County, but beat them 2–1 at the Baseball Ground two weeks later."
"The quarter-final saw Wednesday drawn away to Coventry City, where a 1-0 victory for Wednesday ended any hopes that Coventry's new player-manager Terry Butcher might have had of beginning his managerial career with silverware. Their semi-final opponents were drawn against Chelsea. The first leg of the semi-final was played at Stamford Bridge, where goals from Peter Shirtliff and David Hirst gave them a 2–0 win, before Nigel Pearson, Danny Wilson and Paul Williams gave them a 3–1 win in the second leg at Hillsborough to put them into the final, 5–1 on aggregate. It was Wednesday's first Wembley cup final in 25 years."
"The broadcast of this League Cup final caused controversy in Yorkshire, where instead of showing the post-match celebrations (as London Weekend Television did), Yorkshire Television decided to cut the broadcast short to show a programme titled ""War of the Monster Trucks"". People from Sheffield often cite this event as a demonstration of the station's bias towards West Yorkshire, Leeds and above all Leeds United. The incident inspired the name of the Sheffield Wednesday fanzine ""War of the Monster Trucks""."

= = = Kirana gharana = = =
"Kirana gharana is one of the most prolific Indian classical khyal gharanas, and is concerned foremost with perfect intonation of notes (swara)."
"The central concern of the Kirana style is swara, or individual notes, in particular precise tuning and expression of notes. In the Kirana Gayaki (singing style), the individual notes (swaras) of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion. Highly emotional ""pukars"" in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience. Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the ""sargam taan"" (weaving patterns with the notations themselves) introduced by Abdul Karim Khan under influence from the Carnatic classical style."
In the late nineteenth century Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan revolutionized the khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit (a slow tempo section) to delineate the structure of the raga note by note.
"Frequently performed ragas by musicians of the gharana include Todi, Lalit, Multani, Patdeep, Puriya, Marwa, Shuddha Kalyan, Darbari Kanhara, and Komal-Rishabh Asavari. Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana are particularly fond of the Komal Re/Rishabh (or minor second in the western system) note of the classical music scale, a frequent feature of these commonly performed ragas."
"In the 19th-century the Kirana gharana coalesced around Miyan Bande Ali Khan, a player of the rudra veena. The gharana's style was further developed, and established as one of the prominent styles in modern Indian classical music in the late 19th / early 20th centuries by the musicians Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was an extremely popular musician, and was thus highly influential in popularizing the gharana. Some trace the gharana's roots back farther to the 13th-century musician Gopal Nayak, a Hindu musician (of the dhrupad style) who later converted to Islamic Sufism and in the process assimilated the predominantly Muslim khyal musical style."
"The name of this school of music derives from Kirana or Kairana, a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh. It is the birthplace of Abdul Karim Khan (1872–1937), who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindustani music in general in the twentieth century. A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore, Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music, and roots of the tradition can also be traced back to his great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula, the brother of Ghulam Ali."
"Owing to the popularity of Abdul Karim Khan, most contemporary Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana gharana, and Kirana gharana in turn has absorbed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition. The culturally rich border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is particularly well known for its association with the gharana."
"The other primary master of the gharana, in the early 20th century, was Abdul Karim Khan's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan who chose to settle at Lahore, Pakistan after the 1947 Partition of British India."
= = = James Robinson Graves = = =
"James Robinson Graves (April 10, 1820 – June 26, 1893) was an American Baptist preacher, publisher, evangelist, debater, author, and editor. He is most noted as the original founder of what is now the Southwestern family of companies. Graves was born in Chester, Vermont, the son of Z. C. Graves, and died in Memphis, Tennessee. His remains are interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis."
"In 1855, Graves established Southwestern Publishing House in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Southwestern originally published ""The Tennessee Baptist"", a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¢ and 30¢ each."
"Prior to the Civil War, most Bibles were printed in the North, rather than the Confederacy. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing Bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867."
"In 1868, Graves discontinued the company’s mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell Bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871."
"Though raised in a Congregationalist family, Graves joined a Baptist church at age 15. Contemporary fellow ministers in the Southern Baptist Convention praised his preaching abilities. Thomas Treadwell Eaton wrote, ""We have seen him hold a congregation packed uncomfortably, for three hours and a half without any sign of weariness on their part. This was not done once or twice, but scores of times."" Denominational leader James Bruton Gambrell described one of Graves' sermons at a small church in Mississippi as ""The Greatest Sermon I Ever Heard."" Scholars have recognized Graves as an early and chief promulgator of the Landmark movement. The subject's Nashville publishing house, Graves, Marks, & Co, which later became South-Western Publishing, published all of fellow 'Landmarker' Amos Cooper Dayton's books. Both were expelled as 'schismatics' between 1858 and 1859 from the Nashville First Baptist Church due to their theological perspectives on their apostolic connection."

"The half-pass is a lateral movement seen in dressage, in which the horse moves forward and sideways at the same time. Unlike the easier leg-yield, the horse is bent in the direction of travel, slightly around the rider's inside leg. The outside hind and forelegs should cross over the inside legs, with the horse's body parallel to the arena wall and his forehand leading. The horse should remain forward, balanced, and bent, moving with cadence. The inside hind leg remains engaged throughout the half-pass, and the horse should not lose its rhythm."
"The half-pass is a variation of haunches-in (travers), executed on a diagonal line instead of along the wall. At higher levels it is used to perform a counter-change of hand, combining more than two half-passes with changes of direction in a zig-zag pattern."

= = = Women's rugby union = = =
"Women's rugby union is a sport identical to men's rugby union with the same rules, same sized pitch, and same equipment. However, it has a history which is significantly different, due to various social pressures, and the self-image of rugby union in general. As a result, this history has been largely hidden until comparatively recently, although the game is gaining a higher profile thanks to international tournaments and financial investment."
"The secretive nature of the early years of women's sport—and especially rugby union—ensures that we do not really know where it began. Public reaction to women playing contact sports could be disrespectful, or even violent. In 1881, when two teams played a number of exhibition ""football"" games in Scotland and northern England, several games had to be abandoned due to rioting in or around the grounds."
"While most of these games appear to have been played to the new Association Football rules, it is clear from reports in the ""Liverpool Mercury"" of 27 June 1881 that at least one of these games, played at the Cattle Market Inn Athletic Grounds, Stanley, Liverpool on the 25th, involved scoring goals following ""touchdowns"" and may therefore have been played to at least a version of rugby rules."
"Whether this was the case is unknown. However, a series of sporting cigarette cards, published 1895 in the Liverpool, includes an image of a woman apparently playing what looks like rugby in kit very similar to that described in reports of the 1881 team (see left). It is therefore possible that these ""exhibition"" games similar to those in 1881 may have continued (with no press reporting) or the pictures may have been reprints for earlier illustrations inspired by the 1881 games, or they may just be an ""amusing"" cartoon or an illustration of a sport that was not actually being played. Again no further details are available."
Other than this the official record is silent for most of the nineteenth century. Some girls played the game unofficially as part of their school teams—and the earliest confirmed record of any female definitely playing rugby at any level anywhere in the world comes from a school game.
"This happened at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Emily Valentine's brothers were responsible for the formation of the school's first rugby team in c1884. Emily practised with the team and in c1887 she played for the school, scoring a try."
The first documented evidence of an attempt to form a purely women's team is from 1891 when a tour of New Zealand by a team of female rugby players was cancelled due to a public outcry.
There are also early reports of women's rugby union being played in France (1903) and England (1913) but in both cases the game was largely behind closed doors.
"During the First World War some women's charity games were organised, the most well documented taking place at Cardiff Arms Park on 16 December 1917, when Cardiff Ladies beat Newport Ladies 6–0. Maria Eley played full-back for Cardiff and went on to become probably the oldest women's rugby player before she died in Cardiff in 2007 at the age of 106. The Cardiff team (who all worked for Hancocks a local brewery) all wore protective headgear, which predates their male counterparts by some decades."
"In Sydney in 1921, two women's teams played a game of rugby league in front a crowd of 30,000—a photograph appeared in ""The Times"" in 1922—but pressure from authorities ensured that they did not play again. Throughout the 1920s a popular form of women's football game very similar to rugby called ""barette"" was played across France. The game had only minor differences to the full game (games were 10-a-side and had some minor restrictions on tackling) and there were national championships throughout the decade. It received support from several male rugby players and film also exists of a game being played in 1928. Both barette and the full game of rugby featured in several newspaper cartoons and many photographs exist. For reasons unknown the game appears to fade away in the 1930s."
"In 1930 a women's league playing the full game was formed in Australia, in the New South Wales areas of Tamworth and Armidale, which ran until halted by World War Two. Photographs of women's teams also exist from New Zealand from the same period and during the war Maori women took up the game. After the war in 1956 The ""Belles of St Mary’s""—an Australian women's rugby league team—played games in New South Wales—but even as late as the 1960s Women's rugby was banned in Samoa."
"The 1960s was the decade in which the game finally began to put down roots, initially in the universities of Western Europe. In 1962 the first recorded UK women's rugby union team appears at Edinburgh University, in 1963 female students participate in matches against male students in London, and in 1965 university sides are being formed in France."
"As the pioneering students left university an adult game began to evolve. Initially (1966) this tended to be confined to charity matches between male and female teams (especially at Worthing RFC, England), though the UK's ""Daily Herald"" newspaper includes photographs of girls' teams training in Thornhill, near Dewsbury in Yorkshire in 1965, and at Tadley in Hampshire in 1966—and appealing for fixtures. It is not recorded whether these teams did arrange any games, and so it is not until 1 May 1968 that the first fully documented and recorded women's club match takes place, in France, at Toulouse Fémina Sports in front of ""thousands of spectators"". The success of the event lead to the formation of the first national association for women's rugby union—the ""Association Francaise de Rugby Feminin"" (AFRF) at Toulouse, in 1970."
"1970 also saw the first reports of women's rugby union in Canada, and by 1972 four universities in the United States were playing the game: University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Missouri. By 1975 university students at Wageningen in the Netherlands were playing, and in the same year clubs appeared in Spain (Arquitectura in Madrid and Osas in Barcelona). The first non-university clubs formed in 1978 in Canada and Netherlands, and in Italy (Milan) a year later."
"By 1980 there were club championships in the United States and Sweden, and provincial championships in New Zealand. The game first appeared in Japan in 1981 and in February 1982 University College, London's women's team went on a tour to France playing, amongst other teams, Pontoise—the first recorded overseas tour by a UK team (and possibly the first international tour by any team). A few months later on 13 June 1982 the first women's international—Netherlands 0, France 4—took place at Utrecht (see Women's international rugby union for more details on the history of the international game)."
"In the UK 1983 saw the Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU) formed to govern the game across the British Isles. Founder member clubs are: Leicester Polytechnic, Sheffield University, University College London, University of Keele, Warwick University, Imperial College, Leeds University, Magor Maidens, York University and Loughborough University."
"The game began to be organised on a more formal basis elsewhere, including:"
The Vicesima hereditatium was a Roman 5% tax on inheritance money.
"No inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The ""vicesima hereditatium"" (""twentieth of inheritance"") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated—from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source, but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign."

"Alice Mary Baldwin (born January 24, 1879, Lewiston, Maine; died 1960) was a historian and educator, noted as the Dean of the Woman's College of Duke University from 1923 until her retirement in 1947."
"Baldwin was born in 1879 in Lewiston, Maine, the eldest of five children of a Congregationist minister. She moved with her family at the age of nine to East Orange, New Jersey, where she was educated in private school before entering Bates College in 1896. After one year, she transferred to Cornell University where she was named to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and from where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1900."
"Baldwin remained at Cornell to receive her master's degree in history in 1902, and then went to Europe on a fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and research in Sweden. (The subject of her master's thesis had been ""Gustavus III of Sweden: A Study in Enlightened Despotism."")"
"Returning from Europe in late 1903, Baldwin took a series of teaching positions culminating in a position as Instructor of History, and later head of the Department of History, at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While at the Baldwin School, she pursued graduate studies in history at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as studies in education at the Teachers College of Columbia University."
"In 1921, Baldwin left the Baldwin School to attend the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate degree."
"In 1923, Baldwin took the job as Acting Dean of Women at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina (later to become part of Duke University). Seeing little opportunity for a woman in the 1920s to become a full professor at the University of Chicago, Baldwin remained at Trinity to become Dean of Women and Assistant Professor of History. While at Trinity, Baldwin completed her doctoral thesis (on the topic of New England clergy and the American Revolution) in time to receive her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1926."
"Baldwin's responsibilities as dean and as an active teacher (which she believed necessary to remain effective as an administrator) left her no time for research, and she produced no further scholarly historical material after this time. She did, however, maintain active memberships in various women's educational organizations and North Carolina historical organizations. She also encouraged student participation state and national women's organizations as well as the formation of a number of student-led organizations on campus; under her guidance and example, students launched organizations such as a Forum Committee to invite speakers to East Campus, DISTAFF, a monthly magazine edited entirely by women, the Nereidians, a synchronized swimming club, and numerous honorary and leadership societies such as Ivy, Sandals, and the White Duchy, a counterpart to the Order of The Red Friars."
Baldwin retired from Duke University in 1947.
"As an historian, Baldwin is best remembered for her doctoral dissertation ""The New England Clergy and the American Revolution"". Her other writings include:"
"Baldwin has been held up as an example of the key issues in the intellectual life of women in the early twentieth century. Upon her retirement, she ordered that her papers and notes be sealed for twenty years. Upon their unveiling, it was revealed that Baldwin had struggled bitterly with her role as a female educator and on the education of women in general. She had found little documentation of interest in her research in the lives of women in colonial times, and left unfinished many papers and treatises in which she expressed the disdain she uncovered for the education of women in America."
"Baldwin remains a much-beloved figure at Duke University and is credited with advancing the prestige of the Woman's College at Duke and the education of young women. One of the most prominent buildings on Duke's East Campus, the auditorium anchoring the campus, is named in her honor in recognition of her dedication to the institution."
"Recognizing Baldwin's contributions to the University, Duke has created the Alice Mary Baldwin Collection within their library, wherein all of Baldwin's papers are available for review and research."

"Bayamón could not run with Arecibo and Flor Melendez knew that he could control the tempo of the game in the first two games of this final series. Both were very close games. Despite these woes, the Vaquero fans hoped Bayamon would come back. This was dispelled as soon as Richard Lugo was able to play for the Captains in game three."
"After the Cowboys rallied to win game four and force a fifth game, the Captains closed out the series in game five. Larry Ayuso scored 40 points on offense and played defense well in that closing game."

The match had to be stopped and subsequently confiscated, because the team's fans of Bayamón, began throwing objects onto the court and the game could not be terminated. We the game was stopped, there was still 1:42 on the clock, but Arecibo had absolute control of the game. It is noteworthy that this is the second Championship won by the Capitanes in the past three tournaments of the BSN."
"At the beginning of the meeting the atmosphere was worthy of a seventh game. Donta smith immediately began the annotations for Bayamón, but Larry Ayuso did not remain with folded arms. In the first five minutes of action, Ayuso had already made three triples. Then, when the clock struck 4:48, Danilo Pinncok managed a basket that gave them the first lead in the game 13 - 12. After this move Bayamón managed to take advantage on the board 19 - 17. All this so that in the next moves, Guillermo Díaz scoring three free throws and Danny Santiago make a dunk that brought the Capitanes to dominate the first quarter 22 - 19."
"The start of the second period for Arecibo was very explosive. The Capitanes opened with a push of 7-0, thanks to a triple by Larry Ayuso and two consecutive baskets by Danilo Pinnock. At that time, Arecibo took off on the scoreboard 29 - 19. Incidentally, those were the first points of a rally that did Danilo Pinnock. He scored eight consecutive points for Arecibo. The Vaqueros tried to answer with some baskets of Christian Dalmau and Robert Traylor, but the Capitanes managed to close strong at the half. After twenty minutes of action the Capitanes had twelve-point advantage, 43 - 31. During that first half, Larry Ayuso and Danilo Pinnock combined to make between them, thirty-three points.

"The fourth quarter began with an exchange of baskets by both, but the Capitanes knew how to answer on every possession. Larry Ayuso achieved another triple with 7:32 left and the score was 68–57 at the time. Plays later, Carmelo Lee scored a field goal by Bayamón, but this was answered immediately by the Capitanes. David Cortés managed a shot and Danny Santiago make another. In this way Arecibo was leading 72 - 60, while still detracted 3:45 left in the game. Bayamón managed to score three extra points, before they culminate the event. This was so because on the last play of the game, Danny Santiago achieved an impressive steal. After the steal, Andrés Rodríguez gets the ball and he received a hard foul that led him to the free throw line. Before Andrés Rodríguez could make his attempts, the fans from Bayamón began a relentless rain of objects and this forced the League officials to confiscate the game in Arecibo's favor. At that time, there is still 1:42 to play, but the game was largely dominated by Arecibo 73 - 62. Thus, the Arecibo Capitanes won their fourth championship of the BSN (1959, 2005, 2008 and 2010)."

"For the second time during the Final Series, the Captains came out strong in the offensive side of the court. Consecutive triples Larry Ayuso and David Cortes took off immediately to Arecibo on the scoreboard. To make matters worse, Danilo Pinnock prescribed another triple and this allowed Arecibo took off 13 by 6.

"Capitanes de Arecibo win 2 straight Championships (2010, 2011) and their fourth championship in 7 years."
"The PBL began its third season in 2010 with nine teams. The Capitanes were one of three expansion teams. For PBL play, the Capitanes take the name of Puerto Rico rather than their home city. The Capitanes established two different talent pools. As well as the original BSN team, they had a roster for PBL play that included selections in that league's player draft. Their subsequent first signings were Andrés Rodríguez and Bonzi Wells. Other international players signed by the Capitanes during the off-season were Elías Larry Ayuso, Angelo Reyes and Walter Hodge. Antonio Látimer and José Rosario completed the signings, while Hodge left during the season to join the Cangrejeros. Their performance earned the team constant inclusion in MLN Sports' basketball rankings, debuting in the fourth spot. During the undefeated streak, David Rosario was named PBL Coach of the Month for January."
"The team won its first series against the Maryland GreenHawks, with scores of 109:100 and 99:91. The Capitanes subsequently won their first contests against the Manchester Millrats (116:104) and Vermont Frost Heaves (114:103), establishing a lead in the league's standings. The Capitanes' next game was against the team that held the second place in the standing, the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry (3-0), winning with scores of 101:94.

The score was 106:94, Capitanes."
"In March 2010, the PBL announced that it was forced to expel the franchise due to an alleged failure to adhere to its rules & guidelines. Among the violations cited were, failing to appear at road games, failure to pay amount owed to the league, and lack of communication with league officers. At the moment, the team held the second best record in the league and had secured a spot in the playoffs."
"The Capitanes responded by hiring one of Puerto Rico's top litigation attorneys, Lee Sepulvado of the law firm Sepulvado & Maldonado. The team's lawyers filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction before federal court in Puerto Rico. The PBL hired O'Neill & Borges, one of Puerto Rico's top law firms and was represented by attorney Salvador Antonetti Stutts whom attended Harvard Law School and is a former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico."
After the attorneys conducted oral arguments before Federal Judge Juan Perez Gimenez the court entered a temporary restraining order against the PBL instructing the league to immediately reinstate the Capitanes and allow them to participate in the 2010 playoffs. Shortly thereafter the PBL agreed to the issuance of a preliminary injunction order formally reinstating the team.
The matter received extensive media coverage and the PBL was forced to accept its wrongdoing by setting aside the expulsion of the team. The Capitanes vehemently denied the charges and all along insisted their only goal was to win in the basketball court and not the legal court.
"As runners-up of the 2007 BSN season, the Capitanes were selected to represent Puerto Rico in the first edition of the FIBA Americas League, along with the BSN-champion Santurce Crabbers. Before the competition began, the Capitanes' coach, David Rosario, stated that the team's preparation was intense so that they would be able to adapt in order to match the advantage expected to be presented by Fuerza Regia and Halcones Xalapa, since the tournament occurred in the middle of the ""Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional"" season."

In its 'Shadow Operator' role, Etihad Rail DB will aim to utilise its expertise and lessons learned from Stage One to provide consultancy services to Etihad Rail in preparation for stage two. Such services will include reviewing the design of stage two assets, developing Emiratization requirements, drawing up operational procedures and safety management plans and assisting to ensure the project is delivered with the optimum operations cost."
"Since officially commencing commercial operations in January 2016, Etihad Rail DB has been responsible for the transport of up to 22,000 tonnes of granulated sulphur every day in trains of up to 110 wagons. Trains are hauled by 4,300 horsepower EMD SD-70 locomotives. In February 2017, Etihad Rail DB announced that it had safely run its 1,000th train for ADNOC. As of 20 January 2017, Etihad Rail DB confirmed that it had transported more than 10 million tonnes of sulphur in over 1 million hours worked with zero lost time injury (LTI) in a relatively short time since inception, which reflects its internal culture."
"As of the first half of 2017, Etihad Rail DB had achieved its highest performance records against all international safety standards with no lost-time injuries. As railways are new to the region, a community safety campaign was undertaken in 2014 to educate the public on safety around rail tracks."
"One of the key purposes of the Etihad Rail DB joint-venture is to facilitate knowledge transfer, the sharing of best practices, as well as providing the UAE with a world-class, modern, integrated and efficient rail network that will drive economic growth and social development. In May 2016, Etihad Rail and Etihad Rail DB co-signed an MoU with the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education & Training Institute (ADVETI) related to occupational training. Under the terms of this MoU, the stakeholders will collaborate to create opportunities for occupational training and share knowledge for Emirati students seeking qualifications in the UAE's rail industry, in line with the goals of the country's Emiratization policy. This means that UAE Nationals will have skills across many disciplines needed to operate and maintain the railway such as maintenance and mechanical technicians. Moreover, Etihad Rail DB has also established a human resources excellence programme which is enabling UAE nationals to gain on-the-job experience."

"Hermann Landois (19 April 1835, Münster – 29 January 1905) was a German zoologist. He was the brother of physiologist Leonard Landois (1837-1902)."
"He studied natural sciences and theology in Münster, where he was ordained as a priest in 1859. In 1863 he obtained his doctorate in zoology at the University of Greifswald, later becoming an associate professor of zoology at the Academy in Münster (1873)."
"In 1871 he founded the ""Westfälischen Vereins für Vogelschutz, Geflügel- und Singvögelzucht"" (Westphalian Association for bird protection, poultry and songbird breeding), and during the following year founded the ""Zoologischen sektion für Westfalen und Lippe"" (Zoological Division of Westphalia and Lippe)."
"In 1875, he founded the Westphalian zoo in Munster, a preserve with emphasis on European domestic mammals. It had a building for the display, cultivation and breeding of various fowl as well as avaries for songbirds. In 1876 a ""monkey house"" was constructed. Eventually, the zoo expanded to include native fauna in general. By the end of 1882, the site had ""niche displays"" (dioramas) representing fauna from Australia, the North Sea coast, German forests, the African landscape, as well as a section that contained fossils from prehistoric Westphalia."

= = = Bangladesh–Indonesia relations = = =
"Bangladesh–Indonesia relations refers to the bilateral relations of Bangladesh and Indonesia. Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, whereas Bangladesh is the world's fourth largest Muslim country. They are partners in the United Nations and various multilateral organisations, particularly in international peacekeeping, the Developing 8 Countries, the Non-Aligned Movement, the World Trade Organization and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Bangladesh has an embassy in Jakarta, whereas Indonesia has an embassy in Dhaka. Official diplomatic relations were established in 1972 after Indonesia became one of the first Muslim countries to recognise independent Bangladesh."
"The contacts between the Bay of Bengal region with Indonesian archipelago has commenced since centuries ago. Indonesia and Bangladesh were connected to maritime Silk Road of Indian Ocean trade network, where goods travels and ideas exchanged. Since early 4th-century Indonesia has received Hindu, and subsequently Buddhist influences from Indian subcontinent. In 9th-century the Srivijaya empire established contacts through religious and education relations with Buddhist schools, monasteries and universities in ancient India and Bangladesh, such as Nalanda and Somapura."
"After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Indonesia along with other non-Arab Muslim countries such as Malaysia, Turkey and Afghanistan immediately recognised Bangladesh sovereignty in 1971. Subsequently, Bangladesh soon after its independence in 1971 established diplomatic relations with Indonesia and the Embassy started functioning from May 1972."
"Both nations welcomes initiatives in furthering the bilateral co-operation in various areas including trade and investment, agriculture, defence, education, food security, good governance, counter-terrorism, research and technology as well as disaster mitigation and management. Besides bilateral co-operation, both nations exchanged their views on the two countries' co-operation in regional and global fora. As the Muslim majority countries, both nations also exchange view and voiced their concern on addressing the Rohingya Muslim refugees issue in neighbouring Myanmar."
"At the end of October, both Bangladesh and Indonesia saw strikes involving millions of low-wage workers demanding substantial increases in their minimum wages. Semen Indonesia, the country's largest cement maker, is mulling over plans to expand its business to Bangladesh in efforts to capitalize on Bangladesh's rising consumer demand. Bangladesh, Indonesia and Iran were rated as the nations most at risk from extreme weather and geophysical events according to a 2010 study."
", Global risks advisory firm Maplecroft, had developed the Natural Disasters Risk Index (NDRI) to enable businesses and insurance companies to identify risks to international assets."
Indonesia have recently signed a deal with a Bangladesh pharmaceutical company to export its goods to their country where Bangladesh sees another potential market for its pharmaceutical products. Trade between the two countries amounted to US$1.53 billion in 2017.

"The 2013–14 FC Anzhi Makhachkala season was the 4th successive season that Anzhi played in the Russian Premier League, the highest tier of football in Russia, in which they suffered relegation after finishing the season in 16th place. They were knocked out of the Russian Cup at the Round of 32 stage by Alania Vladikavkaz, and they reached the Last 16 of the Europa League where they were defeated by AZ."
"Anzhi started the season in the same manor as the previous season, entering the transfer market and signing Igor Denisov from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Aleksei Ionov from Kuban Krasnodar, Aleksandr Kokorin from Dynamo Moscow and resigning Christopher Samba from QPR. Following a draw and a defeat in their opening two games, Guus Hiddink resigned as manager on 22 July 2013."
"Recently appointed Assistant Coach Rene Meulensteen was then put in charge of the team in a caretaker capacity until 8 August 2013, when Gadzhi Gadzhiyev was appointed as the club's manager for a fifth time. The previous day, the club confirmed that Kerimov had decided to make drastic cuts to the team's budget, and the club's president, Konstantin Remchukov, suggested on Twitter that ""a lot of expensive players will leave"". As a result, Igor Denisov, Yuri Zhirkov and Aleksandr Kokorin, before Kokorin had made his debut, all left Anzhi in a package deal for Dynamo Moscow whilst Oleg Shatov left the club shortly after joining Zenit St. Petersburg."
"These sales prompted the club to recall Nikita Burmistrov and Serder Serderov from their loan deals, before Mbark Boussoufa and Lassana Diarra then joined Lokomotiv Moscow. On 29 August Arseniy Logashov joined Lokomotiv Moscow, whilst Vladimir Gabulov, Christopher Samba and Aleksei Ionov all joined Dynamo Moscow, and Samuel Eto'o joined Chelsea."

"Com'è profondo il mare (""""How deep is the sea"""") is an album by Italian singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla, released in 1977 by RCA Italiana. It was the first work in which Dalla wrote both the music and lyrics, after three albums in which the latter had been provided by poet Roberto Roversi."
"Other steam systems were opened in Devonport, Wellington and Christchurch."
"The first electric tram ran to Maori Hill, Dunedin in 1900, and the tram systems in the main centres were all electrified in the 1900s."
Dunedin also had several Cable Car lines to various suburbs and Wellington still has the Wellington Cable Car (actually a funicular) to Kelburn.
"Most twentieth-century systems were electric with overhead wires, apart from the Takapuna (Auckland) steam tramway (1910–1927) and Gisborne, which had two battery-electric trams (1913–1929). The only system to be closed during this period was Napier, in 1931 after the Napier earthquake. Several long suburban lines were replaced by buses, e.g. Christchurch City to Richmond, Burwood and North Beach in 1934, and to Linwood in 1936."
"During the 1950s and early 1960s all the tramway systems were replaced by buses or trolleybuses: Wanganui (1950), Invercargill (1952), Christchurch and New Plymouth (1954), Auckland and Dunedin (1956) and Wellington (1964). This followed a general international trend, especially in North American and British cities. The traditional tram systems of the period were perceived as a slow and outdated means of transport, characterised by inflexible routes and expensive infrastructure maintenance. In Wellington there was significant opposition to the closure of the last tramway system in New Zealand, and the final decision to disestablish the remaining lines followed on a public referendum in 1959."
"All trolleybus systems in New Zealand have now been closed: Christchurch (1956), New Plymouth (1967), Auckland (1980), Dunedin (1982) and Wellington (2017)."
"Auckland City had a private company operating horse-drawn trams from 1884. The Auckland Electric Tram Company's system was officially opened on 17 November 1902, but public service was delayed because three of the motormen, from Sydney, Australia, had been drowned in the SS Elingamite shipwreck near Three Kings Islands on 9 November 1902. Public service commenced on 23 November 1902 and continued to 29 December 1956."
"With services running from downtown at the Waitematā Harbour, across to Onehunga on the Manukau Harbour, Auckland had the world's only 'coast to coast' tramway system. The Electric Tram Company started as a private company before being acquired by Auckland City Council. The resulting council owned entity was required to run services outside the borders of Auckland City."
"In 1938, a circular trolleybus route opened, operating from Queen Street - Wyndham Street - Hobson Street - Victoria Street and servicing the Farmers department store in Hobson Street. Trolleybuses may have been chosen for this service because the corner of Queen Street and Wyndham Street was too sharp and steep for trams. Electric trams operated a similar Farmers department store connection from a terminus stop in Beresford Street off Pitt Street along Hobson Street to a terminus stop in Wyndham Street."
"From 1949 a modernisation programme saw the electric tram routes being replaced by trolleybuses, commencing with the Herne Bay route and with trolleybuses eventually replicating the entire network by December 1956 when the last electric tram ran."
"While the introduction of two light rail lines became a government commitment in 2018, as of there are only two tram services in Auckland, the Western Springs Tramway and the Wynyard loop tram. Both are heritage systems. The Western Springs Tramway runs between two MOTAT museum sites. The tracks run parallel to part of the original Point Chevalier tram route on Great North Road, but they were not part of the original system."
"Also known as the Wynyard Quarter tram and Dockline Tram. Operates on a circuit close to downtown Auckland. The route consists of the loop Halsey Street, Gaunt Street, Daldy Street and Jellicoe Street. There have been proposals to extend this in the future. The service was promoted and funded by the former Auckland Regional Council and now by Panuku Development Auckland. The tramway is operated by Auckland Tramways, administered by Panuku Development Auckland. Trams commenced testing and crew training on Friday 29 July 2011. The system was opened on 6 August 2011, prior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup."
"Three former Melbourne trams have been used. X1 class 466, (was for a time 2011-2017 renumbered ATL 257), is being leased from the Newstead Trams based at Bendigo Tramways and arrived at the Ports of Auckland by ship 8 June 2011 and was delivered to the new tram shed 15 June 2011. From 2011 until 2015, Melbourne W2 class 421, then numbered ATL 258 was leased from Bendigo. In July 2015, SW6 model trams 852 and 881 arrived from Melbourne after becoming surplus to requirements. In September 2011, MOTAT's Western Springs Tramway loaned restored 1906 Auckland tram No.44 for the Auckland Heritage Festival and through the summer 2011/12. No.44 was loaned again in September and early October 2012."
"The Dockline Tramway has closed a number of times for the gentrification of streets around Wynyard Quarter which have involved relevelling the roads. For instance in until October 2014, and again from mid 2015 until late 2016 while Gaunt Street and the southern end of Daldy Street were gentrified. In April 2017, trams ran on a short section of the line while roadworks and gentrification took place in Halsey Street and Daldy Street, including watergardens and realignment of the tramway along the reinstated Daldy Street. The Tramway was suspended indefinitely on 5 August 2018 due to Panuku selling an area that included part of its tracks to a developer, but was given a reprieve on 22 November 2018 with Auckland Councillors voting to reinstate the full original loop and have the tram running for Americas Cup 2021, then review its future."
Devonport on Auckland's North Shore had a horse tramway from September 1886 to 1888 running to Cheltenham Beach. The tramway utilised wooden rails and failed financially after two years.
"A steam tramway operated between Bayswater and Milford on Auckland's North Shore. It travelled along Lake Road, through Takapuna and circled Lake Pupuke between 22 December 1910 and 26 April 1927. The steam tram trailers had been built so that they could be converted to electric operation, to a similar design to Auckland M & L type trams. The carriages were hauled by 13"" steam motors, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia. The tramway struggled financially, and closed after 16 years. The carriages were sold to Wanganui and Dunedin and converted to electric trams and the steam tram boilers sold for other uses. A single trailer, which became a Dunedin electric tram ""Takapuna"" No.66, is the sole survivor, at the Otago Early Settlers Museum."
"Christchurch had steam and horse trams from 1880, then electric trams from 6 June 1905 to 11 September 1954. They were replaced by trolleybuses and motor buses. A Christchurch heritage tram line was established in the city centre on a loop track in 1995, and reopened on a limited circuit in November 2013 after being temporarily non-operational following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011, which interrupted tramway services while the CBD was cordoned off. The Tramway reopened November 27, 2013 on a combination of the original route and an extension that was in progress at the time of the earthquakes. There are plans to extend the route in 2014 to include the full pre-earthquake circuit and the extension through the Re:Start Mall and High Street which was nearly complete when the February 2011 earthquake struck."
"In Dunedin electric trams operated on several routes from 23 October 1900 (Maori Hill) and 24 December 1903 (municipal service, to Normanby & Gardens) to 29 March 1956, and were replaced by trolleybuses and buses."
"Gisborne had Edison-Beach battery-electric trams from 13 April 1913 to 8 July 1929. There were two trams from the Federal Storage Battery Car Co, New Jersey and two from Boon & Co, Christchurch. AR Harris of Christchurch was the New Zealand agent for Edison Batteries. The trams were slow; their maximum speed was 32 km/hour, and initially they were restricted by the Public Works Department to 16 km/hour. There were two inland routes: Ormond Rd, and Gladstone Rd to Te Hapara (Lytton Rd). They were replaced by buses, following a close referendum in 1928."
Auckland Weekly News had photos of the interior and exterior of trams at the 1913 opening.
"Invercargill had the southernmost tram system in the world, horse trams 1881–1908, electric trams from 26 March 1912 to 10 September 1952. They were replaced by buses."
"Construction began in January 1911 and lines to Waikiwi and Georgetown opened on 26 March 1912. Later that year two more lines opened, to North Invercargill and South Invercargill; the latter was the southernmost electrified street tram line in the world and ran to Tramway Road. The network operated as two routes: Route A between Georgetown and Waikiwi and Route B between North and South Invercargill. The Waikiwi line closed in 1947, though a section remained in operation until 1951. The Georgetown route closed on 2 July 1951, but the section to Rugby Park Stadium remained open until August 1951. The South Invercargill line closed on 31 May 1952. The last route, to North Invercargill, closed on 10 September 1952."
"Napier had electric trams to Port Ahuriri, from 8 September 1913 to 3 February 1931. The system was damaged by the Napier earthquake on 3 February 1931, and was never restored, being replaced by buses."
"New Plymouth had an electric tram service from 10 March 1916 to 23 July 1954, operated by the New Plymouth Corporation Tramways and reputedly the smallest municipality in the world to operate trams on the overhead electricity system. There were two main routes, through the town centre from the Port to Fitzroy, and from the town centre to David Street, Westown. In 1924 a short line was built to Pukekura Park (this closed in 1937) and proposals were also made for lines to Vogletown and Frankleigh Park."
"In 1950 the Westown route was replaced with a fleet of 4 Crossley trolleybuses in 1950, in turn being replaced with diesel buses in October 1967. The Port-Fitzroy route was replaced directly by diesel buses in 1954."
"There were 10 trams, 4 single-truck Boon cars (No.s 1–4), 3 Double-truck Boon cars (Nos 5–6 and 10) and 3 Birney Safety Cars introduced in 1921 (Nos. 7–9). These all lasted until closure of the system, at which time the bodies were auctioned off and sold. Only one tram body survives (Birney No 8) and is currently in Wanganui."
"Whanganui, then known as Wanganui had electric trams from 11 December 1908 to 24 September 1950. The service went two ways from the city centre, inland to Aramoho and out to Castlecliff and the Port. The Castlecliff route competed with the Castlecliff railway and the success of the trams at winning patronage led to the cancellation of passenger trains in April 1932. The trams were replaced by buses."
"Wanganui tram No.12 was restored in West Auckland by Dave Harre and his team and gifted to the people of Whanganui The Tramways Whanganui Trust has united the body onto a former Brussels Brill 21e type four-wheel truck, and plans to renovate Wanganui tram No.8 and New Plymouth Birney No.8. 120m of tramline has been laid alongside the Whanganui river between the new tram shed towards the berth of the PS Waimarie and due to be opened for demonstrations and rides once the appropriate Rail Operator Licences have been granted. Further extensions are planned."
"Wellington had steam then horse trams from 1878, then electric trams from 30 June 1904 to 2 May 1964. They were replaced by trolleybuses and buses. Wellington now has the only funicular cable car line operating in New Zealand."
"The Wellington Tramway Museum preserves and operates a collection of Wellington trams at The Kapiti Coast Electric Tramway, Queen Elizabeth Park, MacKays Crossing near Paekakariki on the Kapiti Coast. Planning for a light rail system is underway."
"Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864. The main towns, Greymouth, Westport, Hokitika and Ross, and smaller settlements like Brighton, Charleston, Kamiere and Kumara had wooden tramways. Publican John Behan of Charleston, now a ghost town, petitioned the Canterbury Provincial Council in 1870 for compensation after the rerouting of a wooden tramway along a branch road removed most of his stalwart drinkers. The 'bush tram' from Greymouth to Kumara took three hours, and during the trip passengers had to cross the Taramakau River in a cage or 'flying fox' suspended from a cable see photo c1880. These tramways were for freight and passengers. There were few roads on the Coast, and tramway owners were entitled to charge a toll to pedestrians walking along the tracks. The gauges varied from to , with wooden rails (see Stewart and May). Some of these were ""bush tramways"", similar to other systems used to carry timber out of the bush."
"The American firms of J G Brill, Philadelphia and John Stephenson Co, New Jersey supplied many trams, as well as other firms; English, Australian and local. Birney Safety cars were supplied by J.G. Brill Co. to Invercargill (6) and New Plymouth (3) in 1921, though they were too wide for Napier. Gordon Coates, then Minister of Transport was in New Plymouth for a test run on the new trams. When the driver showed how the 'dead man's control' worked by lifting his hand off the controller, the Minister and all were thrown to the floor when it nose dived on its front wheels then slumped back on the track with a shudder."
"Thallium(I) hydroxide, also called thallous hydroxide, TlOH, is a hydroxide of thallium, with thallium in oxidation state +1. Thallous hydroxide is a strong base; it is changed to thallous ion, Tl, except in strongly basic conditions. Tl resembles an alkali metal ion, A, such as Li or K."
= = = Abram Petrovich Gannibal = = =
"Abram Petrovich Gannibal, also Hannibal or Ganibal, or Abram Hannibal or Abram Petrov (; 1696 – 14 May 1781), was a Russian military engineer, general, and nobleman of African origin. Kidnapped as a child, Gannibal was taken to Russia and presented as a gift to Peter the Great, where he was freed, adopted and raised in the Emperor's court household as his godson."
"Gannibal eventually rose to become a prominent member of the imperial court in the reign of Peter's daughter Elizabeth. He had 11 children, most of whom became members of the Russian nobility; he was a great-grandfather of the author and poet Alexander Pushkin."
"The main reliable accounts of Gannibal's life come from ""The Moor of Peter the Great,"" Pushkin's unfinished biography of his great-grandfather, published after Pushkin's death in 1837. Scholars argue that Pushkin's account may be inaccurate due to the author’s desire to elevate the status of his ancestors and family. There are a number of contradictions between the biographies of Pushkin and the German novel, ""The Blackamoor of Peter the Great"" based on his great-grandfather. A historical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law, Rotkirkh, was largely responsible for the myth, propagated by some historians, that Gannibal was born in Ethiopia. However, more recent research by the scholars Dieudonné Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes has established that the general was instead likely born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in present-day Cameroon."
"Richard Pankhurst, the former professor at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, believed the young Abram, Ibrahim or Abraham, as he named him, was born around 1698. He was the son of a minor ""prince"" or chief whose capital was Logon (now part of present-day Cameroon). His father was relatively affluent taking several wives and having 19 children. However, after his father died in battle trying to defend his territory from the Ottoman Turks, Abram was abducted and taken to Constantinople by ship. His sister, Lagan, is said to have drowned in the sea in a desperate attempt to save her brother."
"Abram stayed in the Ottoman Empire for about a year in the service of Sultan Ahmed III's household. At the time, the Russian ambassador Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, representing Peter the Great, was looking for ""a few clever little African slaves"" for the Tsar's palace in Moscow, as was the custom in those days at the great courts in Europe. On orders of Vladislavich's superiors (one of whom was Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, great-grandfather of the celebrated writer Leo Tolstoy), Abram was selected for this purpose and soon ransomed from the Sultan's viziers with a bribe. In 1704, the ambassador immediately dispatched him by land to Moscow in order to be presented to Tsar Peter the Great."
"The Tsar is noted to have taken a liking to the boy’s intelligence and potential for military service, and brought the child into his household."
"Abram was baptized in 1705, in St. Paraskeva Church in Vilnius, with Peter as his godfather. The date of Gannibal’s baptism held personal significance; he used that date as his birthday because he did not know his actual date of birth."
"Abram valued his relationship with his godfather, as well as that of Peter's daughter (Elizabeth), and was loyal to them as if they were family."
"Starting at a young age, the boy Abram would travel alongside the emperor during his military campaigns, and at these military journeys he served as his godfather’s valet."
"In 1717, Abram was sent to Metz to receive an education in the arts, sciences and warfare from the highest institutes available. By then he was fluent in several languages and excelled in mathematics and geometry. In 1718 Abram joined the French Army with hopes of pleasing his godfather by expanding his learning in military engineering. He enrolled in the royal artillery academy at La Fère in 1720."
"During Abram's studies, conflict broke out between France and Spain, and he fought for France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, rising to the rank of captain. While fighting in the French war against Spain, Abram received a head injury and was captured by the Spanish army. He was released in 1722 and continued his studies in Metz."
"It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname ""Gannibal"" in honor of the Carthaginian general Hannibal (""Gannibal"" being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian). In Paris he met and befriended such Enlightenment figures as the Baron de Montesquieu and Voltaire (this claim by his biographer Hugh Barnes is disputed by reviewer Andrew Kahn). Voltaire called Gannibal the ""dark star of the Enlightenment""."
"Gannibal returned to Russia the following year, and his advanced training enabled him to apply and successfully acquire posts first as an engineer and then as a mathematics tutor for one of the Tsar's private guard units."
"Gannibal's education was completed by 1723, and he was due to return to Russia. After the death of Peter in 1725, Prince Menshikov gained power in Russia due to his good standing with Peter. However, Menshikov was not fond of Gannibal and was suspicious of his foreign origins and superior education. Gannibal was exiled to Siberia in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of Saint Petersburg. He was pardoned in 1730 due to his technical skills, and completed his service in Siberia in 1733. During this time he built a fortress and led several construction projects, where he became a master engineer."
"Elizabeth of Russia became the new monarch in 1741. Gannibal became a prominent member of her court, rose to the rank of major-general, and became superintendent of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on 22 March 1744 by ""A. Ganibal"" is held at the Tallinn City Archives. In 1742, the Empress Elizabeth gave him the Mikhailovskoye estate in Pskov Oblast with hundreds of serfs. He retired to this estate in 1762."
"In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to Empress Elizabeth, while petitioning for the rank of nobility and a coat of arms, he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an elephant and the mysterious word ""FVMMO"", which may mean ""homeland"" in the Kotoko language. In his book, ""Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg"", Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word. However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of ""The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian"", met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the Latin expression ""Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino"" which means ""Fortune has changed my life entirely."""
"Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a Greek woman. The couple married in 1731. Dioper despised her husband, whom she was forced to marry. The marriage between Dioper and Gannibal was very volatile, and he suspected her of infidelity early in their marriage. Gannibal’s suspicions were confirmed when Dioper gave birth to a white daughter. When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years."
"Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Siöberg (1705–1781), daughter of Mattias Johan Siöberg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her bigamously in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while he was still lawfully married to his first wife. His divorce from Dioper did not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a convent for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed lawful after his divorce. Gannibal’s second marriage to Christina was much happier, and he appreciated her fidelity and affection towards him."
"On her paternal side, Gannibal’s second wife was descended from noble families in Scandinavia and Germany: Siöberg (Sweden), Galtung (Norway), and Grabow (Denmark) / von Grabow (Brandenburg). Her paternal grandfather was Gustaf Siöberg, Rittmester til Estrup, who died in 1694, whose wife Clara Maria Lauritzdatter Galtung (ca. 1651–1698) was the daughter of Lauritz Lauritzson Galtung (ca. 1615–1661) and of Barbara Grabow til Pederstrup (1631–1696)."
"Abram Gannibal and Christine Regina Siöberg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of Alexander Pushkin. Gannibal's oldest son, Ivan, became an accomplished naval officer who helped found the city of Kherson in 1779 and attained the rank of general-in-chief, the second-highest military rank in imperial Russia."
"Some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, including Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and her sister, Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn. George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, is also a direct descendant, as the grandson of Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven."
"Gannibal's actual place of birth continues to be uncertain, and is subject to speculation by modern historians. Until recent scholarly field work, it was generally assumed that he originated in Ethiopia. Chiefly Russian scholars for many years believed that he was from the vicinity of Medri Bahri, an ancient kingdom in present-day Eritrea. In a letter he wrote to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, Gannibal stated that he was from the town of ""Logon"" or ""Lagone"". Anthropologist Dmitry Anuchin wrote an essay about Alexander Pushkin in which he theorized that ""Lagone"" referred to Logo-chewa in Eritrea. In 1999, the Russian Institute in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, also campaigned for a commemorative stamp to honor Pushkin's bicentennial."
"The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea each claim that Gannibal was born in their respective territories. Under this belief, the Ethiopian government named a street in Addis Ababa after Alexander Pushkin, Gannibal's great-grandson. It also placed a bust of him near the African Union headquarters in 2002, and arranged for a statue of Pushkin to be transferred from Moscow to Addis Ababa in 2014. However, the notion that Gannibal may have been born in Ethiopia holds little currency with the general Ethiopian population. The Eritrean government asserts that Gannibal was instead born in Loggo Sarda, an area in modern Eritrea. It also erected its own statue of Pushkin and named a street for him in 2009."
"Vladimir Nabokov cast doubt on Gannibal's ancestry, based on research findings during his work translating Pushkin's novel ""Eugene Onegin"". Nabokov disagreed with Anuchin's theory, stating that it was just as likely that Gannibal was referring to ""the Lagona region of equatorial Africa, south of Lake Chad."" Support for Anuchin's theory of Ethiopian birth declined after it was exposed as racially based, implying that ""hamitic"" Ethiopian origins better explained Gannibal's success than ""negroid"" origins."
"The Beninean historian Dieudonné Gnammankou, an expert on Russia, studied Russian, French and African sources and argued that Gannibal was indeed from Logone-Birni and was most likely the son of a chief in the ancient sultanate. In 1995, Gnammankou asserted that the ""Logon"" Gannibal wrote about was actually Logone, capital of the old Kotoko kingdom of Logone-Birni, now located in northern Cameroon. He believed that the pattern of slave trade around Lake Chad made that region a more plausible likelihood for Gannibal's birthplace than Gondar, Ethiopia. Gnammankou's biography of Gannibal was translated into Russian, and was voted the best book on Pushkin at the 1999 Moscow Book Fair."
"Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for ""homeland"" in the local Kotoko language of central Africa."
"In November, 2010, representatives from Russia and Estonia, the ambassador of Cameroon, and the sultan of Logone-Birni went to La Fère, France to unveil a commemorative plaque honoring Abram Petrovich Gannibal as a graduate of La Fère's royal artillery academy. The academy, which closed in the 1990s, had been started by King Louis XV shortly before Gannibal's enrollment there in 1720. The plaque declares that he was a graduate of the royal artillery academy of La Fère, and later became chief military engineer and general-in-chief of the Imperial Russian Army. It also notes that Gannibal is the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet. Dieudonné Gnammankou, whose research into Gannibal's background was largely responsible for the ceremony at La Fère taking place, also served as the main speaker at a symposium following the event."

= = = Juri Osada = = =
"Osada showed much promise as a young skater in her mid-teen years. Osada participated in her first international competition as an alternate for another skater, Megumi Aotani, at 1980 Enia Challenge Cup in the Netherlands at the age of 15. There, she landed three triples, a Salchow, a toe loop, and a loop in her free skate, which equaled or exceeded the difficulty of the top male skaters back then. Although her poor standings in compulsories caused her to place 6th overall, she received the special Rookie Award alongside Poland's 14-ear-old Grzegorz Filipowski. Then, in October 1982, Osada placed a close 2nd behind Midori Ito at All Japan Free Championships in Kobe, which was followed by a surprise 4th-place finish at the NHK Trophy in Tokyo, where she placed behind Katarina Witt, Rosalyn Sumners, and Tiffany Chin while finishing ahead of world medalists such as Claudia Leistner and Elizabeth Manley."
"After winning the All Japan Figure Skating Championships in January 1983, Osada was sent to the World Championships in Copenhagen in March, 1983. There, she made a series of errors in compulsories, in which she placed a disappointing 24th. In her short program, she missed the triple loop jump in her combination, which only allowed her to pull up to 21st after this segment of the competition. Due to the new rule instituted in the 1982–1983 season (which, incidentally, was abolished after that season), Osada was unable to skate her free program in ""Group A,"" or the main competition consisting of those who placed 15th or above after short program. Instead, she was placed in ""Group B"" and won the free skate, which resulted in the 3rd-place finish in ""Group B""--or 18th overall."
