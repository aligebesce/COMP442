"Well it's green and it's got cream in it, but it's not the exact symbol of the Body Shop,i a bit different."
It's weird!
It's just really puzzling me!
I don't know what it is.
.
Oh they're recording us.
What's it for ?
What?
You wanna put it on the table where it's  actually.
"Right, just put it on the table and leave it!"
No you can't.

You get endorsement!
Have they ?
Oh I went like hell then didn't I?
At least they've gone light and we can hammer along.
I didn't think you could.
No!
It looks better for going around most of the edges and going over the grass.
The back bed looks particularly good.
The one
It does.
by the
Yes.
Well I mean it was a lot
it was a lot of edging to do.
I mean it was just the back  though.
Now if you'll excuse me a moment.
I'll just watch the last few laps.
How many laps are there to go?
That .
Look.
Dad!
Yes love.
Come here.
"No I'm, just got sitting down again."
Yo go on you can tell me this joke and then you can finish.

Alright.
Well tell me whatever it is.

"It's down, down to those two cos of the Grand Prix on."
Those two do like watching it don't they?
Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
"Yeah, I just press this one."
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Cos it clears the whole mind.
Right.
What shall I press?
Nine  square root  is three.
So if you multiply three times three  you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
Yes.
the square root is four.
Yes.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self
Right.
gives you the number.
"Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six."
Oh yes.
Try and find the square root of six.
"What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be."
"Don't, don't press the button."
Six.
Er er
"What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?"
Three.
No.
Three times three is?
"I don six, six."
It's three.
No.
we'll only be briefing the interview staff
That's right.
and accounts staff.
Yeah.

"You don't want, you just want sort of crisps and nicknacky things"
Sausages.
Well that's the answer

Why am I
difficult.
missing  missing some subtle point here.
"Are we leaving the washing machine, by the way?"
No!
"Well that absolutely, we've gotta get a new washing machine!"
Don't be stupid!
"We have, look, this one!"
It's only because it's not so not erm  stable.
Just adjust the feet  slightly.
"If I had it on a solid floor, but it's gotta go, don't forget it's on a  a wooden floor."
Oh I suppose so.
"What you want is a so so , is a solid floor."
Is it?
Mhm.
Oh right.
"Well that makes a difference, solid floor."
Oh oh!
"Will you stand it, sort of the garage in your er  best job of the afternoon?"
Won't be too bad.
"Well this, well I think it's a Hotpoint."

to be quite simple to remove.
I'll have to try something different.
"I thought it'd be nice if you get, the teachers I get on really well with a bottle of wine or something."
We'll see!
Cos there's only a few that I get on really well with.
Well we'll see!
"It's,now."
"Probably more than that actually, and  er  well they are"
And the  policy you are.

Yeah.
Pretty fancy though.

It must be in there then.
"God, I'm thirsty again!"
I've been thirsty all evening!
hours.
Mhm.
Right?
And they said you did point one mile in point O O one hours
Hours.
so what speed is that?
Er
Have a guess at it then check it on your calculator.
Point   one divided by point zero one .
Will the two first  cancel out?
Do they?
No.
"If I gave you this  tenth, hundredth, thousandth okay?"
What would you do?
Run.
that's hours.
Are those?
That one and that one cancel.
It would cancel out.
So you've got one over one hundredth.
"So that's a bit tricky that, doing it that way, you've got one over one hundredth ."
"The, the easy way, do you like fractions on the bottom of fractions?"
No.
"Oh, times by  ah."
What are you going to times it by?
Times that by ten over one.
"No, times that by a thousand over one."
Times that by a thousand.
"Okay, and you've done, you've done that on one bit of the fraction, so you must do it on the top as well."
Times that by a thou aargh.
You've got to times that by a thousand.
Okay?
Luck  come on.
"Ooh, where did you go? oh don't look like that, no one 's gonna hurt you baby, might smack your bottom once or twice."
Come
Come on.
Come
In you get.
"Good boy, good lad , oh that Thrush song was a bonus wasn't it?"

It smelt terrible didn't it?
"Yeah, well it would help, it needs parsley you see in it."
"I haven't got any, they wo , I couldn't get any fresh parsley so I thought that might just give it a bit of colour, but I've got dried parsley if you'd rather use that."

Oh theirs.
Dunno.
Belongs to the caravan
Yeah.
"Well that's what I mean, belongs to the caravan."
Why was it stuck on the bed?
Because that is the mattress for the bed that folds away in the sitting room.
Right?
But it seems to me to be a foam thing.
Seven.
Mm mm.
"Yeah, seven."
Six?
No.
You need to look
Ah yeah.
you cannot talk about moving parcels around the country if you don't know where the towns are.
You don't have to visit all those you didn't get
Oh yeah.
"I think, in their own time at their own expense."
That's right.
Yeah.
I just get my bunches of three the wrong way round because I know where they are.
I think  before we go.
I know the Midlands is in the middle and  the south is in the south and
Not to your customers
Might be some
it isn't.
Not
Well
your customers
What's wrong?
Well I know the north is in the north and the south is in the south

No.
You do need to get
That's what we need to get
"very, very, you should have a national map in front of you."
"And not just  you don't want just our depots, you want them in relation"
That's the thing you see the
On the top there.

Mr Harrod.
"I don't know where, a hundred and forty pounds."
Too much.
Why?
"Because it is, isn't it Dave?"
What?
A hundred and forty pound for a suit.
What is?
"He, a hundred and forty pound, far too, be like those green trousers you bought, well you've never worn them yet."
Don't fit me.
"No, I have worn them actually."
You've worn them one night.
I've wore it a couple of times for .
Don't give me that rubbish.
"I have, but I like my jeans though."
"Well think, why pay out for a hundred and forty pounds for a suit, when you gonna wear it again?"
"Could be, wear it every week."
"Yeah, I'm sure   a walking bank   be glad when you've got a job, you'll be earning your own money  you can buy your own things."
"Yeah, but I do any way."
When?
Trainers  lost that eighty quid
Oh.
Oh yes I'll have them c gotta have them done.
And and probably said they'd maintain the thing for her  at a price.
Well at a price yeah.
I mean  they don't do nothing for nothing.
No of course not.
"They're out to get money, aren't they?"
It's their living.
"But when we had these things through for the chassis and the cleaning of the caravan, it was all optional."
"If I, if you wanted to go down there and scrub the van out, you go and scrub it out."
You go and do it.
And it saves
And I will next year.
it saves thirty five pounds.
Mm.
"But for that thirty five pounds  the carpets are shampooed, the seats are shampooed, the lot."
Were they in today?
What?
The men?
Darren was there.
Oh he was the only one.
Yeah.
Cos there was two
He come to see
two workmen went by.
"Yeah, further down."
"I even went, I was dying to go to the toilet  so I thought oh I'll go down to the big er  and I had no toilet paper  so I'll go down to the big toilets and shower rooms."
They're all locked.
Everything's locked up there.
Everything's locked there.
There's toilet paper in the caravan.
No.
Not even the holder it was on.
And the visibility didn't seem very good out of them.
"But the smallest one, the twelve foot ones, there's only one window."
The door's in the back end.
Erm  so I presume that was the opposite end to where the tow bar  would be
Mm.
and then just one window in it.
Maybe just down the length of one side.
Or even just at the end.
Yeah.
No I think it was down the side I think he said.
But I  I think that'll be too expensive anyway.
Mhm.
And that's why Mr  said he  he'd er
"He'd do it, yeah."
And we know where we are then with the toilet.
"You know, you know what you're getting don't you?"
Yeah.
How much ?
Yeah it'd be erm  Jim  said there would be no problem because his men have to empty their own chemical loos anyway.
But the bowl coupling could be a problem.
"He said but we'll sort it out, don't worry love."
They're all very nice   people.
They have got an accent  this  's got one  but he sounds more Lancashire than anything.
And he's nowhere near.
Perhaps he's just moved there.
Mm.
I'll have to er  give her a ring to   and tell them to send me the advert.
Tell them to buy .
Mhm.

Too hard.
"Let's go down the toilet, see if it's open."
No wait a minute.
No wait a minute.
"disconnected the gas, took that bloody old heater off, connected it up somewhere else and whatever they're gonna do  and then  the gas is coming through a fire."
Well Mark is there.
We can pop across and see.
He's not gonna go  round the caravan and  try each bed out is he?
He said he was going to   and see that it was done
Mhm.
things were done well that's a matter of .
Oh it'd be better for him to put that fire on at night time  and go over in the morning and switch it off.
"Well  be at work before he can be out of bed probably, in the morning."
Have to .
And if he's gonna walk to Tenby they could be starting when he's in Tenby.
Well Sally will be there.
Well Sally'll go with him.
Yeah?
"I mean if, if he forgets Sally could remind him."
"Had it trimmed, do you feel better?"
She's taken quite a lot off actually.
"And that  it didn't feel it when she was sort of combing it, but now I'm actually doing that I can feel it short."
It's not there.
"Mind you, it needed it."
It did need it.
She said it did.
Oh I need a cut.
So   yeah .
"So, I'm thinking oh it's hard, when I actually feel it it feels thicker at the end and it does feel better but  when I've washed it, I shall feel all hairy now all afternoon."
Yes.
I'm just going to look .
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's a really nice trim."

What I want
I think the trouble is
I want
"no, you're defending them!"
I won't give anybody any money  you can go to the shop and buy what you basically need.
You see yo
No but we're devia
your
we're deviating on the subject
"well you did  because your, straight away you go onto money  which is our God isn't it?"
"Well, no but you said it was corruption"
Yeah.
"and I've only yo mentioned, well you mentioned money because you mentioned Harold Wilson"
Mm.
with two homes  and you said the money they get!
Yes.
So you brought the subject of the money up!
"No, no"
Mm.
"but you're on about something else, you said the first thing I'd do, that's got nothing to do with Harold Wilson  the first thing I if I were in power"

That's correct.
dimensions then you cube it.
"We're gonna do cubing in a minute, do a few exercises on cubing."
"Yes, I mean,Je Mandy said er, if we've got any consignment which exceeds one point five cubic feet per ten kilos."
But you usually know don't you if
It's lower than that actually but  er sorry
Mm mm.
it isn't.
"I, I said, yeah a cubic foot, is se , six point six then."
"That's probably right, yeah."
One point five per ten kilos.
"You can usually tell when you get used to it and we're gonna talk about visual identity in a minute, but  when the mass seems greater overly large to the weight is what  er Jen , sorry Mandy said, and I think that's a good  er er  a good er  analogy there."
"I got if erm, if the size is greater than the weight actually."
Yes.
I got that.
I'll accept that at this stage alright?
"Next question is, what's number six?"
Who can read it out?
Er six .
Can't read that word.
Notional.

What notional weight is used for cubing?
Six point six per cubic foot.

"You see, I think that's really strange  in this day and age."

But I'd make
Good.
my own way there and meet them.

"Yeah, mine, mine used to be something like quarter to twelve, didn't it, quarter to twelve till three, and then they decided to change round, it used to be quarter to twelve to six, didn't it?"

"Convena did all his work  and they asked him to go to London  you know, there's some was on years ago  so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just couldn't believe it, he turned on him and said  you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said!"
Those lads down there they're fighting  living on their ruddy  strike pay  and look at you lot!
He said they were there the whisky was flowing  you know hypocrites!
"And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good"
Well
time you know.
on your argument then  anybody who  who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top  has gotta become corrupted!
"That's what you're saying, no ma"
Mm.
And I think we ought to get him over to one of our meetings.
And  and he said he would.
And I think if we could make it get one of the Uttlesford  chaps to the same meeting
marvellous thing they did.
Yeah.
Well what he did say was don't  you know  don't go over the top in criticizing that because
Yeah.
you know he he says that there's a lot of things which are happening.
He's got all sorts of schemes  a lot of schemes in the pipeline.
I suppose he doesn't want to be seen to be just reacting to your letter he's obviously started doing these things off his own bat anyway hasn't he?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
I mean and and he he feels that er  pressure groups like ourselves are very positive because it gives him a bit of  weight  when he's arguing for things.
Yeah
Well they can't push it from the top
But I mean  on a sort of wider thing  erm
Yeah.
You know one of the things that we could do  is to do another directory.
Yeah.
I think  because I think I think
But
it's a real shame  we're so out of date.
Mhm  but I I you know we we're  can we actually do it?
I mean we would need  fifty people
No I would not distribute it
to deliver
er from door to door.
"I would erm put it out in the library, put it out in in surgeries."
Put it out in public places and that's it because  I mean  the number of people  erm they went to these directories like hot cross buns.
I mean every week I supplied them with a new stack of  everybody wanted them.
"What, the recycling directory?"
"you see and they're asking for people who could ref who could, you know, give references to cos like  put all these, all, down on these different things that you want like  you know, say you want  but then a lot of people just put down small business and management, something like that."
You'll end up with some real wanker like.
"Ah no then, no."
I don't mind if it's yous guys.
"Oh it wouldn't be me cos I'm, I'm doing it this year and I only thought of it too late"

"No I have to go and, have to go to this"
"No some other people were saying about that, you know, ah that they, you know  that they were gonna put in for it but they wouldn't let them cos it was  shop, you know, blah blah blah."

It won't be me.
plonker that I don't know.
It wouldn't be me.
"No, no, that's alright"
You've not talked to me all day and then it's that sort of thing.
"Well I could probably get somebody who would be into comics like  and then that would maybe start you talking and then like, but he could still be an old wanker sure"

And I said just get the nail out and re repair the inner tube he said no it's the there's a new regulation  this year that if the outer case of the you know the tyre has
tea.

Presum I mean I just lost four

"He's now running lorry loads of worn tyres to Russia, to the Soviet Union and makes money  loads of money because the tyres, they couldn't ha get any tyres so  the tyres he saw there were totally without profile."
You know.
Yeah.
So the old tyres  he could erm find in Germany were a lot better.
He carted them over.
. Making thousands out of it.
Barbie doll  and that's what she was.
"Well no, not as attractive as a Barbie doll!"
"Well  no, but"
But
I'm  but the style was there
"She,i it was  it was becoming like a dictatorship!"
It was her at the helm
"Ooh well this is what it beca , it did"
And
"and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli , all these MP's and what not which would comprise  parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time  you know i it really  their voices on the, on the  the cabinet  you know, they were, they were just destroyed!"
"Well, you said  you know you, we were on about Germany and, and becoming you know  could it happen again?"
If  if she'd of had her way  she would of been the dictator of this
Yeah.
"country, and she would of been in power forever!"
Oh I know!
"You know that's, she would of been wanting to ma , make her life president or whatever it was!"
"I think she would of done with the Que , er done away with the Queen to get"
"Yes, I think there was a bit of competition on there wasn't"
Yeah.
there?
I'm convinced
But
she wouldould!
"Yeah, I mean"
"If it meant her staying in power that, I mean she"
Well
would of done it she would of got rid of them to make sure she  she stayed there.
Yes it came to er
Are you tired?
A fine state of affairs didn't it
"No, I'm alright Ken, yeah."
with her  even her own party  giving
Is it going in The Post?
No.
Didn't we tell you that?
"To have it in er  Daily Post, The Post is the morning one  The Echo's the evening  to have it in for one day in The Post and The Echo, how much?"
"Dunno, about eighty quid."
Three hundred and ninety six pound sixty four pence.
So you said we'll have it in all week?
How big was the advert?
Er about a hundred words in a box.
Two columns wide and  erm eight centimetres down.
We reckoned that was about quarter of a page.
It's a lot of money isn't it?
But see  the reason  I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in
Mhm.
cos it has to go through our advertising agents.
Cos we advertise in a special format don't we?
We have the  dash lines round the box
Mm.
and we have the logo on the bottom and that.
So they've had to do it so  I mean she quoted me
thirty six quid for this  thirty six eighty four or something for the local paper.
But erm  you know it might be more but that's
Mhm.
nothing to do with me.
But I mean like  I didn't think it was worth putting it in The Post to start off with anyway.
But if we don't get a good response to this I might stick it in for the day  in The Post.
Mhm.
Is the secretary at  dealing with it or is she gonna forward it all on to you?
No I've put our address.
I said that I didn't like that idea to start off with
No well it
because although it's only a small concern she's gonna have her own stuff to do.
"No,"
What's  what stinks then?
"Oh I didn't want to tell you this Phil, but"
What?
it's the
you've gotta
"No, this isn't gonna smell, I like the condom it's wearing"
It's just the things you poke your hairs up on a sharp stick
You can do a blue movie with this thing
What?
"Do shut up, what's that doing in there?"
Get it out
Oh dear
Have a goody
"Oh thank you, oh I love these, what you done to them?"
"Don't know, they're melting"
What have you done?
I use that thing  which sort of congeals them together
"That was a long word, congeal"
Here's another word conjugal
"I don't know why, good God what the hell's he doing over the road?"
He's not in the middle of the road
"He's not supposed to be in there, what the bike is doing, you're not allowed to go on this road"
It's a woman
I rest my case
Yeah
Women
Erm  close your window
Why?
otherwise you'll knock out the record
"Oh, sorry about that"
I thought  was cold
"It's gotten on to her land  and off her land and into the ditch, which is  you know the N R A"
Where is that?
Er  Roydon some way?
You know where all those nurseries are?
And because the oil is coming  to the ditch via her land they can't have a go at the primary source.
"This is what she said and I, to me it doesn't sound right."
She said nobody'll  Nob they all say they haven't got the power to prosecute and I said well the N R A has.
They've got more clout than anybody else.
Mm.
More clout than the District Council.
And then she keeps saying but you know what these councils are like.
"And I said I'm not talking about the council, I'm talking about the N R A!"
And now she wants me  to find out how can er found out about a solicitor or somebody who specialises in this sort of thing.
To take the District Council to court.
So that she's more expensive to them  than this other lot will be.
Apparently they're causing quite te dreadful pollution.
It's all this oil  from the boilers leaking on to her  into her soil and out into the ditch.
Well
Certainly is.
"But erm  in the back of my mind there comes  that she's saying to me  don't get involved, don't get involved."
"You know who owns all that land, it's the mafia."
And this could be why she's getting nowhere.
"You could give her er erm er wr , give her the address of Friends of the Earth, London."
Oh she's already .
That's how she got in contact with me!
You see they refer everybody on and then I
"Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor."
There must be green solicitors about.
I  have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and I pass it on to her.
Because I don't know off hand.
"I've asked Jeffrey to ask a friend about it who's a  solicitor if he knows anybody but I c , I can't  I haven't got the in information."
I don't
Ten o'clock!

"Oh and they show two things  so y you'll have to see if there's any correlation between the two  is there any correlation between rainfall and temperature, and is there?"
When rainfall goes up does temperature up and vice versa?
Dunno just gotta describe them.
"Well that's what you have to say, is there any correlation between"
What does correlation mean?
They all correlate.
Yeah.
It's connection isn't it Kev?
Mm.
Yeah  and you've gotta see
"That's level six, you should be doing that."
What's level six?
"Well correlation I've just done that with all my children, you should be level six, no good doing it, you should be it  Want you to do two pieces of work for Monday and  all the same level, so there's an extra  two you've got to do."

"And, and obviously it was ridiculous, every second word I was having to look up and then I'd get all that and it moves onto the next one."
Yep.
Which is ridiculous.
Anybody had
this experience?
"Erm  okay, the first word was erm  it talked about alchemy."
Any other problems with the language?
"Either  other areas where it's very specialized and you had to look up words, or other difficulties with the"
Yeah.
language?
It's not everyday English.
It's not everyday English.
"What at the moment, at th right, so a lot of, erm"
Yeah.
Ah but that is a good distinction.
Stereo.
Erm  ahead  in the sense that
Yeah.
we're used to a lot of Shakespeare's archaisms because he was studying them at A level and Shakespeare's got so a special sort of band of them that he uses.
"Even so, I  they can go and look up that lot of words in Shakespeare."
But Johnson  they're often old words  that are totally out of use  erm  and  we're not even used to Johnson's vocabulary because
it's not taught in schools.
At least not part  the mainstream part of our culture.
Any other reasons for the language difficulty?
"Or that the speech is difficult or the, any, any reason that there's a, a page that's difficult to read?"
"Er, it strikes me with the, with the comedy, he's trying to be so funny that he shoots off at all these angles and not having"
Aha.
"left, sort of boundaries."
Okay.
"So  erm  well, you might like to say that"
"Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to"
I saw Mr Bentley
Mm.
and er he hasn't got any stuff there of course
No.
"but er, he said oh try the guy"
Try?
"the chap in Mold, whatever his name is"
Robert .
"I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well"
Mm.
"so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the"
Yes I thought he probably would.
You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you?
I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over.
"Mm, I don't think so  but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all"
"Nobody's interested no, it's a shame"
"said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er"
"Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the"
Yes
What is it?
What do they call it that hall?
Hawkesbury hall
"Hawkesbury hall, yes"
"by the school, yeah"
"but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be"
"Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe."
Is it?
"Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it"
Oh oh they've just locked

"Yes I know er yes I er er I er er I, I think it's a good thing  that people, if they ask for information, you've got to buy books to get them."
But what's aggrieved me is that he's just waltzed off with it  and not
It looks like he just  and come here just to get a book.
"I'll ask him  and he's, he's just ignoring all the er"
That's right  a letter that we're taking him to court

Alan .
"Okay, a course on presentation skills."
How many have been on a on a  training course before?

What's the value?
Respective clients
"Indeed, indeed so that's what you might use, yep  What's the value, I mean what does it do what does it do for the company first of all?"
Promotes it
"Promotes it, so it's about image isn't it?"
"No, there's always been a mandate workshop, explaining why, you know, what our mandate is ."
"You, you did give once to a group a few years ago."
"Yes, I've done the mandate workshop, yes, and I've done it with other groups too."
Mm.
"So you've covered a bigger region in the past, not just Stortford."
"I, I have about five or six groups, I can, I can go and give talks  ."
"So even if we don't  call on you to, do it, you won't be called  ."
And I have a lobby workshop too.
"Amnesty's mandate what, what the  don't do, or do do."
"Will there be any erm talking about lobbying, be in, in erm  before and er ."
I don't know .
Done any .

So the er lobbying workshops is the

That's why they're being cancelled
"Epping Forest and Redbridge are doing, erm, they've got some lobbying workshops"
"Mm, presuming it's got that in mind"
"Yeah, I mean he is  ."
.
"Lobbying workshops would be that combined, erm  there is er, a one page journalist leaflet which we can order a pound for a hundred, that's it, that's all our journalist  friends ."
", yes that's , erm  yeah, I, last month I received the er, this booklet on the  trade and they seemed to be coming out to doing campaign on erm a collection between British training and goods, er and their use abroad erm, and they now, they've got a, a booking form for a fringe meeting at the A G M, if anyone's particularly interested attending."
"Shall I pass, shall we pass this one ."
.
"Yes, the report on this, this book."
"Yes,there are, there are feature on the, just highlighting a couple of case for these, I imagine a problem book"
Yeah.
"and, there is ."
"It is a good book that I, I've read through that, it's quite an informative."
It was in one of the Sunday .
"It's called the M S P, the Military Security Police, mm."
Security
Because there's so many.
"She keeps on about all the time, every time I'm there."
Where you going now.
Whose house are you going to.
"It's almost like I'm a refugee  I felt right  I'm like, you know,"
"When you go home now, to which house?"
Where are you going.
"We were walk walking to erm the, down the high street and a plane went over, and erm, I think mum must have been saying to her about Aunty Jill being on holiday, and she went, ah, there's Aunty Jill in the plane going to the city."
It was really funny.
"I said, where did she get that from, my mum went oh I don't know."
"She went, yeah, my Aunty Jill's gone to the city, she's gone to a city."
"And then she said to me, and then, when I was going, she went to me, would you like to come on holiday, I went, then she went, because of me and mum and dad, we went another day to holiday, we went to beach, and er, mum said, that, yeah, mum said that she was saying, erm, to her, why, why is it not, what was it she said, about the weather, mum was moaning saying it was cold, and she went why, why aren't we go on holiday, mum, and mum said we can't, we can't afford to go on holiday, and she ah, why don't we go to seaside when it's cold."
"Mum says cos it costs lots of pennies, she went ah, another day, we'll go another day."
It's really funny.
She's got no concept of time.
"No, she hasn't  age, because she thinks she's  she's been a big girl, and she's now a little girl."
"That's right, yeah."
"She thinks she's  er, when I was like you, when I was a big girl,"
Yeah.
I did things like that.
Yeah.
Whereas not I will do things like that when I get older.
"Yeah, she thinks that she's been big already"
"Yeah, when I was, er she says when I was as big as Rebecca or when I was a big Joanna, it's always the name."
What did she say she did
"Just like,"
"got something on, or you got something."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had one of them
Yeah.
when I was a big girl.
"Oh, buggery bollocks  you take yours anyway,get on"
"Erm, so   like all their ideas, on the erm, you know the ideas they were putting"
Yeah.
"were that in, in the borough there's lots of like fallen land, like, you know, Esher Common and things like that,"
Yeah.
"that they thought they could develop and hav hold events on, and er, he said, like we, we came up with some good ideas, put forward some ideas, really good ideas, for things to do on this land, and he said, the trouble is that all these councillors back on to these pieces of land, and he said, er, they don't want people coming along and enjoying themselves on it, because they want to go and walk their labradors on it."
"Oh, I see."
"So it might disturb their neighbourhood, you know, so they weren't very impressed with his ideas."
Ow.
"So er, he hasn't had a very good day at work, a bit fed up."
"But Alfie's coming down tonight, and they're going out."
Does he come down and visit quite a lot?
Yeah.
Does he?
"He's his partner in crime, as he calls it."
Do you think Maryanne's alright about that?
"Oh yeah, yeah."
All friends together as it were.
"Yeah, no, that's doesn't bother her at all."
"I mean, they've been on their own for weeks, so."
"You know, at the w they like to spend their weekends with everybody."
"Yeah, they don't want to section themselves off, obviously."
"I mean, Mike was like, you gonna stay down    and I was, I haven't seen anybody at college all week, so I think I'd better go back, actually."
"But erm, I did tell Maryanne if she wanted to go shopping tomorrow, I shall be around."
"Oh, God, yeah, I've forgot abo mind you Emily's coming back tomorrow, isn't she?"
Possibly.
But she might not be back till Sunday.
"Oh, I see."
"Do wh what do you, personally what do you think she'll do ?"
What Em?
Sunday I would have thought.
"Really, yeah."
day in day day out
True.
and it wasn't one of ours that dropped their whip
That's true.
out there so you know you can criticize .
Talking of the whip I mean we're only allowed to hit them five times over here.
In America they seem to hit them twenty five times
And in all sorts
everywhere they want to
anywhere they want to
Yeah
So  but there it's it's a very interesting point there because a lot of our young boys now the Dow Holland Alan Munroes are riding more the American style.
It's an interesting point.
I don't think he's right in what he says but I think it might have been a bit tongue in cheek as well.
They certainly weren't saying it about Lester Piggott on Royal Academy a couple of years back either.
No but I did say about it Lester Piggott on  a few weeks ago .
Yes.
Lester Piggott when he won on .
Mm.
And the next    .
Very good.
Very good impression.
Talking of Lester Piggott he of course was the winner of the first ever Channel Four personality of the year trophy which we awarded for the first time last year.
He was a guest on the morning line at Newmarket and there it is that magnificent  trophy which is valued at five thousand pounds.
Now we couldn't have him in this year to give the others a chance so this is how you voted for the nineteen ninety three racing personality of the year on Channel Four and let's take it in reverse order starting with the person who finished fourth.
In fourth place one of the hardest working and most successful trainers in Britain Jack Barry.
He polled nine percent.
In third place the most successful jockey in the history of national hunt racing Peter Scudimore.
He polled eleven percent.
Runner-up the ever popular Willie Carson.
Willie received seventeen percent of the overall votes.
So who did you vote for?
Jonathan !
you're working for a hundred
Yeah.
and forty pound a week but
Would you go and check see what the heating's on?
you have to be sick  you still get paid
The temperature's
I said you're going about it with the wrong attitude!
Mm.
A lot of people say I'm bloody lucky to get paid for being at home sick!
And that they've got a job.
"Yep, I said what are you"
Oh
I said no I was home sick  and I   in bed like you said I couldn't   who's gonna turn round and say well there are Geoff there's a hundred quid mate
That's it.
we know you're ill in bed?
I said but you're
Nobody is!
bloody lucky!
"I said that'd do you good to be in business for a couple of years, that'd get you sorted out!"
"They all think that's like  he said they think oh stand up in the corridor, that's alright, Amy said  if you don't  if you have a holiday, you don't get no money"
Absolutely!
Well like they're
He said they don't know half!
"that's what I said to Ron, I mean I've never known  I can't remember the last time I when I used to work for Colin for ten years  trying to get a holiday out of Colin was like trying to get blood!"
"Oh you can't have two weeks at once you know  but over there you gotta get rid of your holidays before December, you gotta get rid of them otherwise you lose them."
"Take them, you've got to get rid of them!"
Mm.
"In the end I couldn't get rid of them, I had two days off  when I was ill  and I had as holidays  to ge to get them  sort of settled up you know."
To get what?
That's like this woman at work
To get .
"well the phrase at the end, I'm just about get , but,"
Yeah
"get the phrase in the end, it's, what we've done is, at the end they go, they do a"
"rolling, rolling down the river, rolling, rolling, down the river, rolling, rolling down the river"
"and they, no, and they dropped  rolling, rolling  see what I mean?"
Oh yeah
"One, two and when you think, you think"
You want another one?
"Ooh I've got one another, it goes  rolling on the river  right"
yeah
yeah
no
"what I found very different, wrong with this"
"I mean you're like me, you want profession, you don't just come out and throw it, like that, you see"
"Oh we used to do one with erm the band, sometimes I'd get it right, others I wouldn't, but like you've just said they come"
"come up after and say, ah, that bit late for"
"I, but you did it for"
"Yeah, yeah, like I come down the other week and I"
Yeah
"I'm getting it, I'm getting over it very, very, very slowly"
"Here are, give us it back"
"I'm not being rude now, I've just come back from the Gambia and I haven't stopped"
"what you've just said now, and I'm gonna go now"
I don't know what the hell it is
"Oh well, I'll have to be careful, I don't know what er, what's, what happened"
"I said, I said to them, oh I hope he don't think I'm"
"but I said because you bring some guy, you'll lend me the room on a Sunday afternoons, up and down"
"you know, put the whistle on, and then bring them up and that'll be me"
"Yeah, I"
"I like do the Tom and, I won't, Tom and Jerry, I might do the Tom Jones one, cos I, I feel comfortable at"
Which I don't
You don't have to be beautiful
then then reshape the inside.
Yeah.
Er something before I I always forget everything.
The German Friends of the Earth's people told me never to do the washing on Monday mornings.
I mean that's something to put there as well I think.
Because  it's a peak time for electricity and the Electricity Board  er produces according to peak demands.
That's got nothing to do with recycling has it?
No.
I know but
No.
But you do you think honestly though that that really does still hold true because if everyone ha mostly having automatics now you just wash as you go you don't have a washing day or is it specially Monday they
Like I've got just automatically I wanted to do washing this morning.
Really?
I don't.
"I just put it, when it gets too bad you know if haven't got any clothes to"
It's an interesting though.
I didn't know that they produced according to peak
"Yeah, I think it's important to know"
"It's very important to know, yes."
erm  whatever.
Don't do it Monday mornings.
I usually do mine at midnight when I get home!
Yes.
A lot of people do it overnight
Yeah.
but it's not really a good idea because if something goes wrong with your machine
you're not there to deal with it.
I mean I've had mine flood and I've had its thermostat go and it boiled everything.
I mean that would have been a disaster I mean it's only because I was upstairs and I thought oh I can smell boiling.
You know it was like when you boil up hankies I thought what a!
. There was dye came out of everything it was awful.
And another time it was all pouring all over the floor
Erm  the alchemist is conning people promising them that he'll turn base metals into gold.
"One of the people he's conning is Sir Epicure Manhom  who wants a life of ease and luxury and has been giving  the alchemist loads of money in order to tu to, to perfect this  and  funny enough the alchemist hasn't managed, hasn't managed to do this, to get the person's money."
Okay.
So that's who Epicure Manhom is.
"One day, when he is, somewhere back in act two, one day he is visiting the alchemist he catches sight of this woman, Doll, quite obviously a prostitute, probably an a an absolutely  erm  catches sight of her and says, I must quickly think up some reason why this woman is, is in the house  cos  Sir Epicure Manhom thinks the alchemist is a pure, homely  er priest-like creature yet in fact, he's running a whorehouse."
Okay?
"So,has it's worse than Neighbours ."
"Erm, think  erm  so he's sort of bluffing, okay?"
I'll just find a scene where he does this.
"Er er  in act two, scene three  okay?"
"Er erm  quite a long way, there's that, that line  erm  two twenty."
Okay?
"Face had just realized that Sir Epicure Manhom has  erm  seen Doll, which he shouldn't have done, and  Manhom calls Face out and says stay Lungs."
That's what Face is called at the moment.
I dare not Sir.
Say man what is she ?
Now Face is bluffing here.
A Lord's sister sir.
", pray thee stay ."
And he sort of bluffs a bit more.
She's mad sir .
"Still trying to explain why a Lord's sister is staying with the alchemist, okay?"
She's mad sir.
"Send hither, he'll be mad too."
"I warrant thee, why send hither?"
"Sir, to be cured ."
"You know, he's, he's thinking on his feet."
"He's trying to find reasons for this, this woman to be in the house."
"Meanwhile Sottle off stage is more, is calling why rascal?"
And Face  low you hear sir ?
He's going out to spend some .
Okay.
I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
"Eighty gardens, oh  made me laugh."
"Well that's not what amazes me, eighty gardens."
"Eighty gardens, but then as a place that size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be"
"Well I expect now, they've got about five ."
"I should think they probably still, in the, in the high season, I should think they probably still need fifteen, twenty"
"Oh look,tractor  ."
I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he?
Mm.
And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
Mm.
But if they can use that er beautiful water
Ah right.
"to generate their own electricity, save them a bomb and they can sell some as well."
I know a lot of people say they shouldn't
Good idea .
"have houses that size, but I think it's an awful shame to let our heritage go."
"Yeah, I agree, if people did ."
"I tell you another thing that amazes me, how any one with a Sovereign right,were a Sovereign in those days, could have given up the palace of Westminster which is so beautiful,palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of  is it?"
.
"It was only built erm, what a couple of hundred years ago wasn't it?"
What Buckingham Palace?
Mm.
"I don't know, I didn't realise."
"At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful building"
Mm.
"and of course they had the Thames which was their main highway, Thames was much easier to use than"
Well that was Buckingham Palace was er .
Oh yes.
.
Oh yeah.
.
Great stuff.
So what's the trick to the solo on there?
"I don't know like, some of it's just real hard, most of it's just easy anyway it goes in the big diddly diddly diddly bit at the end, just"
stuff's no problem but er once it starts  and get the medium stuff done as well
And there's the bit
so that when he gets up
"three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong."
"And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies  and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going  and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on  too."
Och it might be  I dunno  it might be with you bending it  that there's a bump on that string.
"Yeah on the, that's a thought,"
I think
Yeah.
But th it's something wrong with
It looks real good with
"That's what I thought, I thought you know fuck  looks like a bloody comic shop for a change."
That's why I stuck all the posters here   think the back issues  loosening up a bit it was getting pretty tight.
Nine hundred series.
"Well okay   Anyway I thought they'd ring here but  couple of people, some, two women   I thought it was Belfast Station"
New window display and everything.
The big guns and the big guns  I found a use for the fucking thing.
That looks good actually    I thought you'd be practising like mad  on your day off.
No.
I was playing last night   Gotta learn this  album I used to have ages and ages ago   fucking .
"I was really annoyed last night, I was getting really     There was all this like down tuning and up tuning like all over the place    That looks like Bart Simpson's dad"
Mm yeah.
got the hair
Probably
What is it?
Going to  tonight.
Are you?
I thought you'd given that up.
"No, back on again."
"No, would you tell me what sort of word it is remembering what we did at the beginning of the week"
"yeah, but that's the, what it means, I want to know what kind of a word it is"
Yes I know it's spelt
Is it a verb?
"No it's not a verb, come on, what is it"
A noun
"Yes it's a noun, it's a name of something isn't it?"
"Because we were doing that at the beginning of the week, a scare, you could actually get"
"right, so can you put it back into, into a sentence again then"
Shirley?
"You've got a scare on, I saw Dracula"
"We've got a scare on, we saw Dracula, yes, that was it."
Right what's the next word?
Share
"Share, what does share mean?"
You share out
"You share out, can you put that in a sentence?"
I like to share out my sweets
"Oh that's lovely, I like to share out my sweets"
digging
"Digging, they're going onto double Gs now, why would it be double G?"
One put dig and then and then -ing
"Yes, but there is a rule isn't there"
Oh yeah
"Ah yes, Trevor"
"because, because, is it cos of erm, if you put D"
"no, not quite, you're nearly right, come on"
Is it because the I sounds like
"yes you would actually get, a magic E right, or a magic I making that vowel right say its long name, so it would be quite difficult to say dig giding"
"Right, lets try the next one, what's the next one?"
er bigger
"bigger that's for the same reason, there you've got an E, and so because you've got the E we can double the G to make the I go on, go on say short for"
"Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it?"
"And it's only an hour or so away, so  perhaps you should say that"
get a weekend in
I wonder where there is a cheap place to
where you can old furniture.
"Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored"
"No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture"
Oh no
all furniture
you've got no chance
mm.
"No I mean, what is he, different"
"in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is"
"Oh there yes, no I meant in this country"
Not on par with ours is it?
"I don't think, I don't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find."
"Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any"
"A lot, yeah"
from southern Italy at all do you?
Oh you see a lot of them from erm
"Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's"
paediatric coast don't you?
"farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them."
You see them for Rome don't you?
"Not very often, not in here"
Is it tours?
"Not very often, not really"
"Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm"
"mm, what's the other one?"
Catonica
Is it Rimini?
"Rimini, Catonica all on the"
"Like, we go into the loo and like, you can mend it."
Mm.
"So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all, okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup haven't they?"
Mm.
Did this one?
No!
The loop's attached to the end of the strap!
"It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart, unsewn!"
"So that meant I had to get  the part of the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the hoo , the hoop and then tie it in a knot!"
"So like, you can imagine  I had to have all the strap completely undone  so like  the, the buckle was like down here!"
And above the knot!
Comfortable then?
"Well  it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but like  it was really weird because like  you could see like, people like, especially the lads, just sort of looking at you  and then like  not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again as if to think  why has Emma got a, a extraordinary lump  on half the top of her boob, you know !"
It's like a lump there!
"They're thinking, mm, a shame !"
"But like, it was alright then because like  means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time  and so  I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on  like  for the reason that my bra strap was bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic  love bite around my neck !"
But like er
But I mean
So that was alright really.
"But, I couldn't believe it cos I  he goes to me, what do you think of love bites?"
"And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I don't"
Yeah.
like them!
Same as me!
"I goes to Scott, I really really  hate love bites   and er  and he goes, yeah and me."
"The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party  Fran , Franny someone, he's  actually a bloke !"
Ooh that's
"I said that's   he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk  and he gave  Scott, Noel and Ian  a love bite  like  for a joke !"
He just decided to do  just for a laugh!
"Oh, how sick!"
Ah what a gay !
"I know like, anyway  but like, Scott had gone home  said to his mum  like, is his mum isn't, going what's that on your neck?"
But I oh I used to go to the country dancing.
So was there a drama club going in  when you came here?
No.
That would be finished up?
"That was finished up, mhm."
"What about the  one, was it still going?"
When you came here?
"I don't think so, I can't remember  eh it going then."
Because I think it was Tommy that said it was really after the  one finished and there was nothing else round about that there was a gap of a few years and then you got started again here.
"Yes, but er it was actually Mike  that got it back up here,Mike  and Grace , John  's first wife that started it up."
"I can remember Leslie coming home, I think I must have been expecting Doreen at the time, that was in, that was early early on, nineteen, well that was nineteen sixty three, and he was, he had heard that had I had been in the Gatehouse Drama Club, and er he said, Would I be interested in com in coming to the Drama in  if they started?"
Leslie said he would need a special part for me then.
But that it took another oh quite a number of years really to get it started up.
They were very good for it's first
Oh the first concert oh yes
those kind of people.
The f I often find that really the first year it was more fun  and er then when they started on the plays and that it got more serious and
A bit more like hard work really?
"It was really, there wasn't so much fun in it, it was all more serious."
And when Bobby  was there it really was
I remember
Oh yes.
He and Andy  together were very good .
"Mhm, yes, oh they were, aha."
"Bobby was really, he just kept it going really."
Sometimes just one person like that or a couple of people ?
"It , it just needs a character really, just to keep it going."
And he really was a character.
"somehow in the drama, even though it's so long since he passed away ."
There's nobody can replace individual people .
"There no, no, nobody at all."
And do you think er the others feel that like you do about doing the plays that it's maybe a bit more of a strain you know the competitions and
"I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute."
"So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than   thereabouts and er that was it."
"But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the   ."
"Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did."
"He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then  he says he didn't carry on, like."
He hadn't been doing  and er  reckon he  and er  think I'm  and that was it  so  right    Been driving since he was  nineteen
"two or three months ago, I think it was."
"I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what  and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since  you know ."
"You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own  fine ."
"So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine?"
He says I am gonna cop it off me mother  cop it of his mother.
You're always going too fast!
I told you before!
"He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad!"
Mm.
slow down.
"Yeah  obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard."
"He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people?"
"Mm, yeah."
Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front.
Mm saw him coming  have to get it  cos Neil's mum was cross about it.
Oh well  he was only just finding out what the rules were.
There was a gang of us chatting with him.
I come up with six points.
That made his day.
He says have I got a fixed penalty?
I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty.
"Know somebody who got one, like."
"No, only a bloke  I've never seen one  had one."
"Yeah, that'd be Richard."
Mm only he's got to  take his licence and insurance in.
As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court  so  it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious.
"That is  their own fault  because according to, there was a programme on there and it was saying  they, they must be selling it to these firms that recy , that use it"
Mm.
they must be selling it
Well they will do.
"them very cheap  because it was sa , this programme was on about recycling"
No thanks.
and it said  about tin cans and aluminium and that  and it was costing them less  excuse me  to use recycled  you know er  used aluminium
Mm.
and used steel cans and that  it was costing them  less to use that  than it was to use
Brand new stuff.
yeah.
Yeah.
"So, I mean  to me, I don't know whether I'm right, but  that my first thought is that they must be buying it very"
It's gotta be profitable
they must be buying it very cheap then?
Mm.
Mm.
"So, so the people that are not making any money out of it by doing it  are selling it to them very cheap  so it is their own fault!"
I think initially er
It's only it's been cheaper to
now has got a cost more  in the initial
Well it does
"stages  until it's sort of, set up, until  everyone is sort of you know  geared into doing this  kind of  you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the  goes there"
"Well yes, because they're not"
"and all the companies that are responsible for  for re-using it  and all the  distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there  you know, once that network is going then surely"
Oh yes!
it's gotta be  useful because  instead of going  you know  from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being  ever seen again  it's going
That's right!
"in a circle and, and  surely that's gotta be cheaper once a network is set up?"
"And it's a, it's an ongoing thing"
Yeah!
"You know I mean, oh oh di you know I mean  it's to theorise, I suppose but I mean all it takes really is to have  three bins."
"ah, what, I, is that you?"
I mean it's all
don't mind what you're drinking then
No that'll do me
I didn't have anything last Saturday
you know what I mean?
I er
I bet you're all wondering what that is in the
"erm, I'm just not getting it"
"unknown territory, you know what it's like with a van, don't you, and then"
yeah
gotta get done
Yeah
"I'm arguing with them, when I'm"
"I give it a break for a couple of, well about three Sundays now"
"Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my babe  I'm a tell her, we've, we've"
"I mean, a couple of them I like"
"I remember a go, a go with some of them that I thought I could do, but realised I can't do, do you know what I mean?"
"I, I, I was, about, what I, I do, I bought an Elvis Presley one er a Tom Jones one, that drinks one, you know, that I like, it's, it's"
"well I like singing it, what I mean, I think what it is I'm looking for the old, I'm not being funny, I'm looking for the old voice"
"I don't like me voice, I'm not liking it at all and I think that's what putting me off on taping it and listening to myself after, I don't, I like, I like to"
"I shouldn't do it, I'm not gonna do it any more, I'm not gonna tape me own voice and listen to it  I just"
not listening to me own voice
"Left a good job in the city, working for a man"
"Yeah, quite smooth actually"
"Yeah, yeah, I thought that"
"Hiya, yeah"
"Yeah, some of them I like, some of them I don't like, er"
"nice number that, er nice number, you see like that song, like you've choose"
Well I can tell you that
"it's actually this one, it's not a"
and it is a good one
Pine pastures green to the tops of Ben Dorain and and up Black Mount where the Craig estate took it was it was in their estate.
So therefore my father was very keen to go too.
Mm.
And that's how we decided to go.
So Dalmally I should safely say was my first schooling.
Even though I was about eight and a half.
Mm.
Now your father was the the stocker at Tormore is that right ?
Yes he was the stocker at Tormore.
Who was he employed with then?
Well the estate er er er the Duke of Sutherland had the whole of Assynt and then h General Stewart who was born in Nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in Canada on the C P R.
Canadian Pacific Railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in  out to Canada.
Mm.
What d'ya recall of your early days with your father at Tormore?
Pardon?
What d'ya recall of your early days at Tormore with your father?
Well  he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of  as you would say because we had sheep then.
And if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down.
Mm.
Without a collie dog.
And well I remember hearing about it and and saw it probably as I grew up myself.
So he was  and it had it's Tormore House was really a lovely place.
Did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate?
Yes.
Oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to Inverness and then a charabanc or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then.
But they were good metal roads that took all the traffic.
Well I remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside Tormore House and many's the day I was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead.
A Hugh .
No  relation but a great friend of ours.
He was a steam roller driver.
Mm.
And were the gentry in er Lochassynt Lodge or was it Tormore?
right John has written a story about his home  right it's a good descriptive story on how people live
until one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it.
My home.
"I live in a tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and my sister."
"Our house is made of wood and is dark green, we have a four windows and four doors."
It has got wooden roof.
"There is a big hill in front of it and it is good but erm  because we climb the, the tree and climb it and  we play in the tree house today with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms and one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen here"
"Okay, right"
So if we cut out the one
they might
it might flow a bit more easily might it.
"That's good, it was alright apart from that you describe where John and"
are living well
"Yeah, I didn't see which sort of"
"No, did he describe the house though?"
Yeah
"Yeah, I think his description of where he was living in the tree house was very clear"
I think he could improve it just a bit Jonathan
"and then it might flow a bit more evenly, might it then, right Michael bring yours out now please."
"Just a minute John, right Michael I want you to read yours through once more for me please."
Do it about the monster
Monster from the marsh.
"When I saw the monster from the marsh, one night, I was, I was, I was frightened, I, I, I, I was  he looked liked a   when I saw him I ran back to camp and I felt frightened, I hid under my sleeping bag the end"
"Right, see Michael was describing that how he felt"
Yeah
How did feel then?
Frightened
You think that he came out quite
What Christine has said then do you think?
Well you said he went under a sleeping bag
Aha
", in olden days, before they built the er bridge."
When the all the traffic came across the level crossing there.
There's still a signal box there.
erm that's now a private house isn't it?
"Yeah, it's a listed building."
But er rather nice.
"And a barrow, a very common sight, and this this type of er of awning, erm very very common, er the barge-boarding er and the er and and the again the roof and the er chimneys and very interesting sort of a  In the garden erm of the sort of station master's house, is that."
Very much like er the style used er in coal offices and erm weigh weighbridge at .
That's still there.
"Erm where there's a caravan office, or caravan sales place just by the station, at , sorry at er ."
"Erm I remember er thinking one day, erm I must get a photograph of that er building which was clearly a erm er a coal office or similar, I'll go back at the weekend and get that."
I went back at the weekend and it was a pile of rubble.
"And that is the danger if you don't do things at the sec at the time, because er things do get er knocked down."
"Nice little building, little Wendy House there."
.another picture of it.
just playing .
But er nice little summer house there.
now.
And let's just w just take one or two other pictures just for interest.
Just to show you a bit further on.
That's what Nottingham Station i used to look like from London Road Bridge.
Isn't that beautiful.
". Absolute er Changed a bit hasn't it since er Well the lines have gone, the signal box and er and so on."
The old  's premises at the back.
"And the bridges, erm lovely  O six O, and er erm four wheeled guard's, guard's van with a veranda at this end."
Erm these er this is a one a of three or four photographs erm from the  Society collection.
We've got erm tens of thousands of photographs.
Quite a number are erm there's quite a few taken in the Nottingham area in .
"Erm and this is one in  Station, one of the  spinners."
Beautiful design locos.
These erm finished there days really on easy graded routes such as the Nottingham Lincoln line.
And er that's waiting to take a train out to Lincoln.
Yeah.
"Cos  that really got up, up my back when the , I mean tho ain't a ba , bad bunch of old boys but  I normally go down  but they they clear and once we've done our work  before dinner break they all clear off  and I go down to the   and then I sort of walk back  more or less behind them  you know, to the  break like  and as I go past the club, I go and wash my hands, they go straight in, I go and wash my hands and I walk past the   and er  we should go to dinner at quarter to twelve  and I go past, it's one minute past quarter to twelve  so cos when we go in there you see  quarter past twelve  due to go back  I always give them two or three minutes  and I say that's it, that's , ah we was late coming in, I said no you weren't!"
"We was  I said look  I can read a bloody clock as well you can, I said I wa walking behind you down the , you went in the canteen and when I went past it was one minute past quarter to!"
"So I said you know, the  one minute past quarter to  and there's a sort of quietly  you know  but then you know, just have to grab at"
Yeah.
they get excitement out of taking two extra minutes
"Give them an, inch and they want a yard"
I think oh my God!
"You know, I, it's so petty that!"
"That's like Sarah  at work, I mean  she leaves at twenty past five, if she thinks that, she'll leave at ten past five  I mean she thinks you're stupid because she don't always go  but even when she's not going  she"
Yeah.
still goes at twenty past five  so why don't she go at six when we do?
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
And she said she even
taking her home Sarah!
I told her I wouldn't.
"Yeah  cos she used to get me t , and then she rang me up one day when I was  and said  dad erm  dad can't bring me round there cos the car's not working, can you come and pick me up?"
Yeah  .
"She said I'll give you some petrol money, I said I'm not bothered about petrol money, I said it's the fact that I've gotta come round to pick you up, I said I'm not a taxi!"
Yeah.
"And then  I was late, when I got round there I thought well she'll at least be waiting at the top of the drive, if not at the top of the road."
Yeah.
"She weren't there, I had to go round the house knocking on her door and oh"
Yeah.
I was mad!
Yeah.
Well yeah you don't mind giving anybody a lift
No.
if they make their way to you.
"Yeah  and she used to be hammering on the door, twenty past five  you know  yeah"
So  that's the next stage.
Go.
can I start by asking your name?
Well my name is er Mr Laurence  er o of the Treasurer of the  in Edinburgh area.
And erm what was your date of birth?
"My date of birth was the thirty first of the, of the seventh, O nine."
Which makes me now approximately seventy six years of age.
What can you remember from when you were young about sort of housing conditions and
"What I remember of the housing conditions when I was then residing in Motherwell, a mining er community."
And known that particular time as the steel town of Scotland.
Was erm the whole town taken up with these sort of two occupations?
"Yes, it was all mining and steelworks."
Was all .
"In fact the Ravenscraig, present Ravenscraig was built up on the first place from a steelworks known then as Corral Steelworks."
Mhm.
"And D L Steelworks and Lanarkshire Steelworks, these er steelworks, all amalgamated which is now known as the Ravenscraig Steelworks."
Mhm.
What erm what kind of education did you go to when you ?
"Well I, my education was in a small er the local school, School in Motherwell."
Mm.
"And they were only a s s a sort of infants and secondary school er there, and you ."
"There was no, all these highfalutin er certificates to gain en all you had to, had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate, that was the only certificate issued in those days."
A qualifying certificate.
Er how old were you when you left the school?
I was er four I left the school at fourteen years of age and I was down the pit the following day.
The following day?
Mm.
What do you remember about working in the pit?
Well the working in the pit and the first and the first time I went down the pit er the pit was er John Watson's number four colliery in Motherwell.
And er I went with my dad and got into the cage which takes you down to the pit bottom and er er er immediately the cage left the surface it just dropped like a stone and I myself was frightened that the bottom of the cage collapsed completely.
Because my stomach come up and met my heart
"And if one goes back er and think about that wages were probably no more than two pounds a week on average, at that time, the er share capital of the Rail Railway I think I'm right in saying, was four hundred and fifty million pounds at that time."
Quite a concern.
"They had hundreds of thousands of employees, of horses and er everything."
Er massive organization.
"And of course if you strip everything that's profitable out of it, like the erm er the railway air services went, erm the er  the er erm hotels, ferries, everything else you can think of, you're left with er with a runt that doesn't make money, and not surprisingly the government then closes it down."
Still I'm mustn't get too political must I.
Er but you know you can always close things if you want to.
"Erm you can fiddle the books, I know that very well."
Another picture  show the  here a little bit here.
"Erm some of the a adverts in er our sort of parish magazines and and so on, er fifty sixty seventy years ago, some of the names,still there."
"Motor Company, well that used er that erm er that's the er ."
"Er  's, well they were well known, very big shop in the town they had."
Erm where Lloyd's is isn't it.
Now then Samuel .
"Some of  's wagons, delivering coal to Mr  's house, well no it was erm  's Manor, it was before Mr  came there."
"Er but erm that was er the Baron's house of course at one time in the eighteen, early eighteen hundreds."
Now a snow scene.
"Samuel , this was taken from an advertisement in one of the magazines, and one sometimes got a little bit of er of exaggeration."
"Er not quite certain how many he had, he had at least one wagon I know that."
"Erm very common, you know s seventy three, twenty five, eighteen, erm they very often started at sort of seventy three or something like that."
To give the impression  before.
Erm I say I don't know how many he did have.
Erm er but that er is a model of one that I made.
Er and er I I think it's a fairly accurate representation.
"Erm that is er four millimetres to the foot, erm so not very big."
But that's on to scale there.
I I work to a pretty  scale on these things.
eighteen point eight three millimetres between the tracks.
"'s  and all the rest of it, and er pictured just by the er er just by the station master's house."
I'll stop in about five minutes if that's alright.
Fine.
"Erm again,L M S yard there, residents  ."
"Then John,, said well didn't you ask her this morning then!"
And Joan says oh no I forgot!
"Well   and even that didn't jog his memory, that he should have asked her to judge it!"

Yeah.
"In where's Lisa, Where's Freddie, anyway it's Where's Wally, for that  he said er  I think I'll get a picture of somebody  and er course he   I said you gonna call it Where's Wally?"
He said no I'm wanna call it Where's the Wally!
"Milly said  cos we'd been talking about this all day and they, the children had been saying to John  you gonna have a picture of yourself in Where's the Wally thing?"
And erm  Milly said ha can't think of a more suitable candidate  and swept off !
If you don't want the car I'll drive to school tomorrow.

So nobody can get in at all
"Mm, or their transits"
"Erm and er this is coming in old Ordnance Survey map, coming in past the race course, at ."
"And er single track at the time, and running double track, and platforms either side, Erm a er wedge shape platform, nice wooden building there, another building there."
And and er er the platforms either side.
Signal box over here.
"Various sidings, er and the trains from  would come in to the left hand side of the top platform, erm and er would er go over here and and cut back and go out from this er this side."
"A little bit er  It's it's not a very good map the er Ordnance Survey map in the Nottingham Library, er local studies department."
About the best I could get off them.
Erm and I've I've obviously photographed it.
"Now there's a picture er in early B R days again, of the line coming in from  here and the very attractive in my opinion, wooden er structures, the shelter there."
"The racecourse at the back, fencing, platform here, wooden structure here, buildings erm and er you can just see the edge of er another canopy similar to that er on this side."
"This is taken from the er from a sta er from a signal box er just er over sort of where I am, er here roughly in in line."
And er well kept flower beds and so on.
"Barrow crossings here, signals and so on."
"There's another picture, now that's looking erm towards  up there, and the  branch coming in there, behind that er building."
"Very attractive, take note of what that looks like."
"A train waiting to go out go out to , er having met the er Nottingham Lincoln, or Lincoln Nottingham line which you can see just goes up the the back there."
And there's that wooden building there.
"The train having come in from , and just going er forward well I don't know erm before back to er er to ."
"I think that's an ex  carriage actually, but it makes you realize how small these things were."
"In B R days, not a very good picture, but an  B one Thompson, four six O B one on a erm probably a Birmingham  train, er real cross country."
And there's the   er in the platform there just having come in.
"Another picture er of the   not very good, but erm best I can do, best I've got."
"Again see the old wooden structures, rather nice lamps and so on."
That's what you've got now.
Don't know whether that's an improvement upon the wooden structures.
No I think not.
"That's where that rather nice, this is w this is the er the departure platform at ."
"And that's the platform arrival from Nottingham to Lincoln, on the  other side, the Lincoln to Nottingham one."
But er not terribly pretty.
There you can see that's looking up towards .
"Well the junction's gone completely, that was taken two or three years ago."
"And that's what you've got left, up there."
"Awfully sorry love, have to er dash off a bit"
Erm John

I want you to read your essay about your home.
Simon  I want you to read about your home as well
and as Martin is still giving out
"I think I'll have you Christopher please to read yours about monster, so I'll have the two monster ones first and then the two home ones."
"Right, just sit down for a minute and let's, Michael read his first."
The monster from the marsh.
I saw the monster arrive from the marsh  he looked at the   when I saw him I ran
The monster from the marsh.
"When I was walking past the marsh one, one night, when I was on my way back from school I heard a rus rustling noise behind a bu bush, when I went up the, went up first to the bush a big dragon-like thing jumped out from behind the bush, it gave me such a fright I nearly fainted."
"I started to run up, straight up the hill, erm lucky the monster was running straight at me and  sticking out of the crowd and he tripped over and after  the end"
My home.
"My home is near the trees and I live there  in, in my house there is"
I have lots of places in my
and I have one  one pigeon and a dog.
"My home is made of wood,"
and the roof is made of tin and the colour of it is grey.
"It has two doors, one, four windows, I, I don't have the garden or, oh, in my house there are six rooms and one of them is er, one, one of them is my, is my room and a picture and a"
"my  my, and"
room and er
My home.
"I live in a tree so does my mum  tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and dad live there."
Our house is made of wood and is dark green.
"We have four windows and four doors, we have got a  there is a big hill in front of it and it is good, but if it, if the tree house   because we find the, the trees and then  and then we were, we play in the tree house sometimes with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture, we have four rooms, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen"
Right then.
"I like erm, Christopher  and Simon"
"yes I know, take your books and show"
"right, erm, Jonathan here"
All our  w most of our money does come from  the members themselves as you've seen.
"Er  the er  the breeders' evening  now what happened on this breeders' evening is that the  they run the raffle  then give us our expenses out of it  so that eleven  pound eighty is the is the part of the  raffle proceeds which we need  to, to e to er  for our expenses, you'll see on the other side  erm  that we spent that eleven eighty, six  eighty for  er refreshments and five pound for the rent."
"Er, the rest of it they take  for the er  to keep the breeders'  going  keep ."
Erm
oh yes  excellent.
"er  the  coach to er  to er  Bowness  on the bus we took thirty nine pound  erm  with  discount from last year  people who er bought some last Christmas  we made twenty three pound on that   the library, only thirty pence  course, we've had trouble with the library because  we can't leave it here now  and er  so that's why it's s so low the, the income."
Er six twenty for the sale of badges  fancy some of that was from a previous year.
Yes it was  it was.
I forgot about the sale of badges last year
that's probably two years actually er  income from that.
"sales  that were left over from the open show, three pound thirty  fourteen pound ten for the  collection, now that is  as you see, that is over from last year  last year the table show   so we actually have double the number of entries on the bench this year  which is a healthy sign"
Really  that
and er  hopefully  if we can only just bring enough fish each and every time  erm we'll even get it higher.
"Now as you can see, our main income is our raffles  two hundred and sixty pound, that is an increase of  ooh  seventy five pound on last year."
"Paid a hundred and eighty five last, two hundred and sixty this year."
Er  I'd just like to thank everybody for their generosity  for taking part so .
Erm  we're trying to have beer put on  the price each time now to make it worthwhile  so you get a chance of getting your money back.
"Right that makes a total of seventeen eighty six, sixty one  over the year."
"Erm, right on the expenditure side we have our normal subscriptions for the year, A S  erm the F B A S  which you all know, there's no strangers here who don't know what these are  the A L A  and the Whale and Dolphin er  Preservation Society which we have taken on as a personal thing  in the, in the er  name of the club  because it's cheaper"
"No, it's in my name."
It's in your name but it's on behalf of the club.
"It's on behalf of the club, yeah."
"Because the  the, the club one's getting rather expensive  so we  yeah"
Eighteen pounds.
so we decided to join that for this year.
"The rent for the club room er five pound per go, a hundred and fifteen pound  erm the Christmas social, we spent fif thirty five fifty one on the refreshments and seven eighty nine on the whisky, making a forty three forty expenditure  the club trophies, we spent nineteen pound fifty this year and we saved a lot of money on that this year, we spent about a hundred and thirty to forty last year  erm so we have got a  quite a difference  just trying to find last year's  erm  there they are  trophies, a hundred and sixteen pound we paid last year  so have, we did save a lot of money by doing them ourselves more or less."
"Erm  the inter-club show erm  we had to pay judges  er  two of them  thirty pound, we would normally have got Keith  for nothing, I know that   we had two judges so we had to pay them  er we did like  so that's two fifty pounds and we bought some  we had some old trophies which we were able to buy plates for  to use for that event."
"Erm  postage and stationery eight forty four  raffle tickets  ten thirty eight  raffle prizes, sixteen twenty four,if I'm short."
"Erm  table show judges, we had a table at the beginning of the year when we had the gentleman from Runcorn, what's his name?"
Paul.
Paul came to  came to judge  erm  er that's the only time we've had a judge.
"Er  hundred and forty pound for the coach to Yorkshire  which we got  on the other side, a hundred and six pound back so the  club  er  sponsored that, a hundred and thirty four pound, and thirty four pound."
Hook wetted his dry lips .
"` Ay , ' he said , ` that 's the fear that haunts me . '"
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm .
"` Smee , ' he said , ` this seat is hot . '"
He jumped up .
"` Odds bobs , hammer and tongs I 'm burning . '"
"They examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in their hands , for it had no root ."
"Stranger still , smoke began at once to ascend ."
The pirates looked at each other . '
A chimney ! '
they both exclaimed .
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground .
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood .
Not only smoke came out of it .
"There came also children 's voices , for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering ."
"The pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom ."
They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees .
` Did you hear them say Peter Pan 's from home ? '
"Smee whispered , fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew ."
Hook nodded .
"He stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face ."
Smee had been waiting for it .
"` Unrip your plan , captain , ' he cried eagerly ."
"` To return to the ship , ' Hook replied slowly through his teeth , ` and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it ."
"There can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney ."
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece .
That shows they have no mother .
We will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids ' lagoon .
"These boys are always swimming about there , playing with the mermaids ."
"They will find the cake and they will gobble it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous 't is to eat rich damp cake . '"
"He burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , but honest laughter ."
"` Aha , they will die . '"
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
"I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder ."
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
"` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse ."
"` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father ."
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
"But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable ."
"So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars ."
"Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought ."
"This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm ."
"Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse ."
"The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors ."
"The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking ."
"Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink ."
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
"I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '"
"` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '"
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
"Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens ."
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
"` Why , here is a ring ! '"
"she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '"
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
"As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove ."
"` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess ."
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
But Ginger 's feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship .
He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold .
`` Why do you call him Ginger ? ''
"asked Anne , who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage ."
`` My brother the sailor named him .
Maybe it had some reference to his temper .
I think a lot of that bird though ... you 'd be surprised if you knew how much .
He has his faults of course .
That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another .
Some people object to his swearing habits but he ca n't be broken of them .
I 've tried ... other people have tried .
Some folks have prejudices against parrots .
"Silly , ai n't it ?"
I like them myself .
Ginger 's a lot of company to me .
"Nothing would induce me to give that bird up ... nothing in the world , miss . ''"
Mr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up .
"Anne , however , was beginning to like the queer , fussy , fidgety little man , and before the meal was over they were quite good friends ."
Mr. Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it .
`` That 's right .
Go ahead .
There 's lots of room for improvement in this settlement ... and in the people too . ''
"`` Oh , I do n't know , '' flashed Anne ."
"To herself , or to her particular cronies , she might admit that there were some small imperfections , easily removable , in Avonlea and its inhabitants ."
But to hear a practical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing .
"`` I think Avonlea is a lovely place ; and the people in it are very nice , too . ''"
"`` I guess you 've got a spice of temper , '' commented Mr. Harrison , surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him ."
"`` It goes with hair like yours , I reckon ."
Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I would n't have located here ; but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults ? ''
"`` I like it all the better for them , '' said loyal Anne ."
`` I do n't like places or people either that have n't any faults .
I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting .
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her nightgown were !
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round . '"
O mother ! '
"said Peter to himself , ` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . '"
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say ` Mother ' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh !"
how exquisitely delicious it would be to her .
"That , I am afraid , is how Peter regarded it ."
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
How proud of him they are !
"and very right and proper , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The fairies sit round on mushrooms , and at first they are well behaved -RSB- But why does Peter sit so long on the rail ; why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he should enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say ` Peter , ' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"Laddie was a handsome and intelligent black-and-white Newfoundland , with a magnificent coat ."
He and Ernest were great chums .
I felt sorry for the boy who was to lose his pet .
"`` Do n't take it so hard , Ern , '' I said , trying to comfort him ."
`` Uncle will likely get another pup . ''
`` I do n't want any other pup ! ''
Ernest blurted out .
"`` Oh , Ned , wo n't you try and coax your uncle not to sell him ?"
Perhaps he 'd listen to you . ''
I shook my head .
I knew Uncle Richard too well to hope that .
"`` Not in this case , Ern , '' I said ."
"`` He would say it did not concern me , and you know nothing moves him when he determines on a thing ."
"You 'll have to reconcile yourself to losing Laddie , I 'm afraid . ''"
"Ernest 's tow-coloured head went down on Laddie 's neck again , and I , deciding that there was no use in saying anything more , proceeded towards the shore , which was about a mile from Uncle Richard 's house ."
"The beach along his farm and for several farms along shore was a lonely , untenanted one , for the fisher-folk all lived two miles further down , at Rowley 's Cove ."
About three hundred yards from the shore was the peculiar formation known as Island Rock .
This was a large rock that stood abruptly up out of the water .
"Below , about the usual water-line , it was seamed and fissured , but its summit rose up in a narrow , flat-topped peak ."
"At low tide twenty feet of it was above water , but at high tide it was six feet and often more under water ."
I pushed Uncle Richard 's small flat down the rough path and rowed out to Island Rock .
"Arriving there , I thrust the painter deep into a narrow cleft ."
"This was the usual way of mooring it , and no doubt of its safety occurred to me ."
"I scrambled up the rock and around to the eastern end , where there was a broader space for standing and from which some capital views could be obtained ."
"The sea about the rock was calm , but there was quite a swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing ."
There were no boats visible .
"The tide was low , leaving bare the curious caves and headlands along shore , and I secured a number of excellent snapshots ."
It was now three o'clock .
"I must wait another hour yet before I could get the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall '' -- a huge , arch-like opening through a jutting headland to the west of me ."
"I went around to look at it , when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay ."
"This was nothing less than the flat , drifting outward around the point ."
The swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her loose -- and I was a prisoner !
"If you can not attend to your business , I shall go to the floor walker and ask him to direct me to somebody who can ."
The laziness and disobligingness of the girls in this store is really getting beyond endurance . ''
A passionate answer was on the point of Marcella 's tongue .
All her bitterness and suffering and resentment flashed into her face and eyes .
"For one moment she was determined to speak out , to repay Mrs. Liddell 's insolence in kind ."
A retort was ready to her hand .
"Everyone knew that Mrs. Liddell , before her marriage to a wealthy man , had been a working girl ."
"What could be easier than to say contemptuously : `` You should be a judge of a clerk 's courtesy and ability , madam ."
You were a shop girl yourself once ? ''
"But if she said it , what would follow ?"
Prompt and instant dismissal .
And Patty ?
The thought of the little sister quelled the storm in Marcella 's soul .
For Patty 's sake she must control her temper -- and she did .
"With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back the hot words and said quietly : `` I beg your pardon , Mrs. Liddell ."
I did not mean to be inattentive .
"Let me show you some of our new lingerie waists , I think you will like them . ''"
But Mrs. Liddell did not like the new lingerie waists which Marcella brought to her in her trembling hands .
For another half hour she examined and found fault and sneered .
"Then she swept away with the scornful remark that she did n't see a thing there that was fit to wear , and she would go to Markwell Bros. and see if they had anything worth looking at ."
"When she had gone , Marcella leaned against the counter , pale and exhausted ."
She must have a breathing spell .
"Oh , how her head ached !"
How hot and stifling and horrible everything was !
She longed for the country herself .
"Oh , if she and Patty could only go away to some place where there were green clover meadows and cool breezes and great hills where the air was sweet and pure !"
During all this time a middle-aged woman had been sitting on a stool beside the bargain counter .
"When a clerk asked her if she wished to be waited on , she said , `` No , I 'm just waiting here for a friend who promised to meet me . ''"
She was tall and gaunt and grey haired .
"She had square jaws and cold grey eyes and an aggressive nose , but there was something attractive in her plain face , a mingling of common sense and kindliness ."
She watched Marcella and Mrs. Liddell closely and lost nothing of all that was said and done on both sides .
Now and then she smiled grimly and nodded .
"But cast with what skill he might , it availed nothing , for the salmon would not even look at the bait . '"
"I am beaten at last , unless the Doran-donn can deliver me , ' he cried ."
"And as he spoke there was a swish of the water , and the face of the Doran-donn looked up at him . '"
"O catch me , I pray you , that salmon under the rock ! '"
said Covan son of Gorla .
"And the Doran-donn dived , and laying hold of the salmon by his tail , bore it back to the place where Covan was standing ."
"` The roe , and the duck , and the salmon are here , ' said Covan to the old man , when he reached the cottage ."
"And the old man smiled on him and bade him eat and drink , and after he hungered no more , he would speak with him ."
"And this was what the old man said : ` You began well , my son , so things have gone well with you ."
"You set store by your mother 's blessing , therefore you have been blest ."
"You gave food to the raven when it hungered , you were true to the promise you had made to me , and did not suffer yourself to be turned aside by vain shows ."
"You were skilled to perceive that the boy who tempted you to leave the temple was a teller of false tales , and took with a grateful heart what the poor had to offer you ."
"Last of all , difficulties gave you courage , instead of lending you despair ."
"And now , as to your reward , you shall in truth take your sister home with you , and your brothers I will restore to life ; but idle and unfaithful as they are their lot is to wander for ever ."
"And so farewell , and may wisdom be with you . '"
` First tell me your name ? '
asked Covan softly . '
"I am the Spirit of Age , ' said the old man ."
The Princess Bella-Flor -LSB- Taken from a Celtic Story .
Translated by Doctor Macleod Clarke . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons .
"When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country , and for many years no one heard anything about him ."
"Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father , who died at last in a good old age , leaving great riches behind him ."
"For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father 's wealth freely , believing that he alone remained to enjoy it ."
"But , one day , as he was coming down stairs , he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall , looking about as if the house belonged to him ."
` Have you forgotten me ? '
asked the man . '
"I ca n't forget a person I have never known , ' was the rude answer . '"
"I am your brother , ' replied the stranger , ` and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made ."
"And , what is worse , they tell me in the village that my father is dead ."
I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more . '
"` He died six months ago , ' said the rich brother , ` and he left you , as your portion , the old wooden chest that stands in the loft ."
Richard of Gloucester flushed .
"`` Mark it right well , '' he said , harshly ."
"`` I love not mercy , nor yet mercymongers ."
Ye have this day laid the foundations of high fortune .
"If ye oppose to me my word , which I have plighted , I will yield ."
"But , by the glory of heaven , there your favour dies !"
"`` Mine is the loss , '' said Dick ."
"`` Give him his sailor , '' said the duke ; and wheeling his horse , he turned his back upon young Shelton ."
Dick was nor glad nor sorry .
He had seen too much of the young duke to set great store on his affection ; and the origin and growth of his own favour had been too flimsy and too rapid to inspire much confidence .
One thing alone he feared -- that the vindictive leader might revoke the offer of the lances .
"But here he did justice neither to Gloucester 's honour -LRB- such as it was -RRB- nor , above all , to his decision ."
"If he had once judged Dick to be the right man to pursue Sir Daniel , he was not one to change ; and he soon proved it by shouting after Catesby to be speedy , for the paladin was waiting ."
"In the meanwhile , Dick turned to the old shipman , who had seemed equally indifferent to his condemnation and to his subsequent release ."
"`` Arblaster , '' said Dick , `` I have done you ill ; but now , by the rood , I think I have cleared the score . ''"
But the old skipper only looked upon him dully and held his peace .
"`` Come , '' continued Dick , `` a life is a life , old shrew , and it is more than ships or liquor ."
"Say ye forgive me ; for if your life be worth nothing to you , it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune ."
"Come , I have paid for it dearly ; be not so churlish . ''"
"`` An I had had my ship , '' said Arblaster , `` I would ` a ' been forth and safe on the high seas -- I and my man Tom ."
"But ye took my ship , gossip , and I 'm a beggar ; and for my man Tom , a knave fellow in russet shot him down ."
` Murrain ! '
"quoth he , and spake never again ."
"` Murrain ' was the last of his words , and the poor spirit of him passed . '"
"A will never sail no more , will my Tom . ' ''"
"Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity ; he sought to take the skipper 's hand , but Arblaster avoided his touch ."
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` let be ."
"Y ' have played the devil with me , and let that content you . ''"
The words died in Richard 's throat .
"He saw , through tears , the poor old man , bemused with liquor and sorrow , go shambling away , with bowed head , across the snow , and the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels , and for the first time began to understand the desperate game that we play in life ; and how a thing once done is not to be changed or remedied , by any penitence ."
But there was no time left to him for vain regret .
"Catesby had now collected the horsemen , and riding up to Dick he dismounted , and offered him his own horse ."
He would have elected to bear any suffering if by so doing he could have freed her from the nightmare dread of Harmon 's returning to claim her .
That dread had always hung over her and now it must be intensified to agony by her love for another man .
And he could do nothing -- nothing .
He groaned aloud in his helplessness .
One evening in late November Alan flung aside his pen and yielded to the impulse that urged him to the lake shore .
He did not mean to seek Lynde -- he would go to a part of the shore where there would be no likelihood of meeting her .
But get away by himself he must .
A November storm was raging and there would be a certain satisfaction in breasting its buffets and fighting his way through it .
"Besides , he knew that Isabel King was in the house and he dreaded meeting her ."
"Since his conviction that she had written that letter to Lynde , he could not tolerate the girl and it tasked his self-control to keep from showing his contempt openly ."
Perhaps Isabel felt it beneath all his outward courtesy .
At least she did not seek his society as she had formerly done .
It was the second day of the storm ; a wild northeast gale was blowing and cold rain and freezing sleet fell in frequent showers .
Alan shivered as he came out into its full fury on the lake shore .
At first he could not see the water through the driving mist .
"Then it cleared away for a moment and he stopped short , aghast at the sight which met his eyes ."
"Opposite him was a long low island known as Philip 's Point , dwindling down at its northeastern side to two long narrow bars of quicksand ."
Alan 's horrified eyes saw a small schooner sunk between the bars ; her hull was entirely under water and in the rigging clung one solitary figure .
So much he saw before the Point was blotted out in a renewed downpour of sleet .
"Without a moment 's hesitation Alan turned and ran for Four Winds , which was only about a quarter of a mile away around a headland ."
"With the Captain 's assistance , something might be done ."
Other help could not be obtained before darkness would fall and then it would be impossible to do anything .
"He dashed up the steps of Four Winds and met Emily , who had flung the door open ."
Behind her was Lynde 's pale face with its alarmed questioning eyes .
`` Where is the Captain ? ''
gasped Alan .
`` There 's a vessel on Philip 's Point and one man at least on her . ''
"`` The Captain 's away on a cruise , '' said Emily blankly ."
`` He went three days ago . ''
"`` Then nothing can be done , '' said Alan despairingly ."
`` It will be dark long before I can get to the village . ''
"Lynde stepped out , tying a shawl around her head ."
We could n't make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them .
"I ca n't believe that of Mr. Blair , for he is always so quiet and meek ; but at least he had great provocation , for Marilla , when that poor man came to the door , red as a beet , with perspiration streaming down his face , he had on one of his wife 's big gingham aprons . '"
"I ca n't get this durned thing off , ' he said , ` for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I ca n't bust 'em , so you 'll have to excuse me , ladies . '"
We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down .
"Mr. Blair sat down too ; he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up , but he did look so ashamed and worried that I felt sorry for him , and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time ."
"` Oh , not at all , ' said Mr. Blair , trying to smile ... you know he is always very polite ... ` I 'm a little busy ... getting ready to bake a cake as it were ."
My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she 's gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea .
She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I 've clean forgot half the directions already .
"And it says , ` flavor according to taste . '"
What does that mean ?
How can you tell ?
And what if my taste does n't happen to be other people 's taste ?
Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake ? ''
`` I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man .
He did n't seem to be in his proper sphere at all .
I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one .
"It was on my lips to say , ` Mr. Blair , if you 'll give us a subscription for the hall I 'll mix up your cake for you . '"
But I suddenly thought it would n't be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress .
So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all .
He just jumped at my offer .
"He said he 'd been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him , and yet he hated to disappoint his wife ."
"He got me another apron , and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake ."
Mr. Blair ran about and got us the materials .
He had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought she would die to see it .
He said he could bake the cake all right ... he was used to that ... and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars .
So you see we were rewarded .
But even if he had n't given a cent I 'd always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him . ''
Theodore White 's was the next stopping place .
"Neither Anne nor Diana had ever been there before , and they had only a very slight acquaintance with Mrs. Theodore , who was not given to hospitality ."
Should they go to the back or front door ?
While they held a whispered consultation Mrs. Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers .
"Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps , and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers ."
"`` A much larger share than mine , '' said Alan , smiling ."
"`` If Pat had not come for me , I would not have known of your danger ."
What a magnificent fellow he is ! ''
`` Is n't he ? ''
she agreed proudly .
"`` And so is Laddie , my other dog ."
He went with Father today .
I love my dogs more than people . ''
She looked at him with a little defiance in her eyes .
`` I suppose you think that terrible . ''
"`` I think many dogs are much more lovable -- and worthy of love -- than many people , '' said Alan , laughing ."
How childlike she was in some ways !
That trace of defiance -- it was so like a child who expected to be scolded for some wrong attitude of mind .
And yet there were moments when she looked the tall proud queen .
"Sometimes , when the path grew narrow , she walked before him , her hand on the dog 's head ."
"Alan liked this , since it left him free to watch admiringly the swinging grace of her step and the white curves of her neck beneath the thick braid of hair , which today was wound about her head ."
"When she dropped back beside him in the wider spaces , he could only have stolen glances at her profile , delicately , strongly cut , virginal in its soft curves , childlike in its purity ."
"Once she looked around and caught his glance ; again she flushed , and something strange and exultant stirred in Alan 's heart ."
"It was as if that maiden blush were the involuntary , unconscious admission of some power he had over her -- a power which her hitherto unfettered spirit had never before felt ."
"The cold indifference he had seen in her face at their first meeting was gone , and something told him it was gone forever ."
When they came in sight of Four Winds they saw two people walking up the road from the harbour and a few further steps brought them face to face with Captain Anthony Oliver and his old housekeeper .
The Captain 's appearance was a fresh surprise to Alan .
"He had expected to meet a rough , burly sailor , loud of voice and forbidding of manner ."
"Instead , Captain Anthony was a tall , well-built man of perhaps fifty ."
"His face , beneath its shock of iron-grey hair , was handsome but wore a somewhat forbidding expression , and there was something in it , apart from line or feature , which did not please Alan ."
"He had no time to analyze this impression , for Lynde said hurriedly , `` Father , this is Mr. Douglas ."
He has just done me a great service . ''
"She briefly explained her accident ; when she had finished , the Captain turned to Alan and held out his hand , a frank smile replacing the rather suspicious and contemptuous scowl which had previously overshadowed it ."
"`` I am much obliged to you , Mr. Douglas , '' he said cordially ."
`` You must come up to the house and let me thank you at leisure .
"As a rule I 'm not very partial to the cloth , as you may have heard ."
"In this case it is the man , not the minister , I invite . ''"
"`` Why , I am not running Rilla down , '' said Irene , opening her eyes widely ."
`` It was only her lack of feeling I was criticizing .
I suppose she ca n't help it .
"Of course , she 's a born manager -- everyone knows that ."
"She 's very fond of managing , too -- and people like that are very necessary I admit ."
"So do n't look at me as if I 'd said something perfectly dreadful , Betty , please ."
"I 'm quite willing to agree that Rilla Blythe is the embodiment of all the virtues , if that will please you ."
And no doubt it is a virtue to be quite unmoved by things that would crush most people . ''
Some of Irene 's remarks were reported to Rilla ; but they did not hurt her as they would once have done .
"They did n't matter , that was all ."
Life was too big to leave room for pettiness .
She had a pact to keep and a work to do ; and through the long hard days and weeks of that disastrous autumn she was faithful to her task .
"The war news was consistently bad , for Germany marched from victory to victory over poor Rumania ."
"`` Foreigners -- foreigners , '' Susan muttered dubiously ."
"`` Russians or Rumanians or whatever they may be , they are foreigners and you can not tie to them ."
But after Verdun I shall not give up hope .
"And can you tell me , Mrs. Dr. dear , if the Dobruja is a river or a mountain range , or a condition of the atmosphere ? ''"
"The Presidential election in the United States came off in November , and Susan was red-hot over that -- and quite apologetic for her excitement ."
"`` I never thought I would live to see the day when I would be interested in a Yankee election , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
"It only goes to show we can never know what we will come to in this world , and therefore we should not be proud . ''"
"Susan stayed up late on the evening of the eleventh , ostensibly to finish a pair of socks ."
"But she ` phoned down to Carter Flagg 's store at intervals , and when the first report came through that Hughes had been elected she stalked solemnly upstairs to Mrs. Blythe 's room and announced it in a thrilling whisper from the foot of the bed ."
`` I thought if you were not asleep you would be interested in knowing it .
I believe it is for the best .
"Perhaps he will just fall to writing notes , too , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I hope for better things ."
"I never was very partial to whiskers , but one can not have everything . ''"
"When news came in the morning that after all Wilson was re-elected , Susan tacked to catch another breeze of optimism ."
"`` Well , better a fool you know than a fool you do not know , as the old proverb has it , '' she remarked cheerfully ."
"`` Not that I hold Woodrow to be a fool by any means , though by times you would not think he has the sense he was born with ."
"But he is a good letter writer at least , and we do not know if the Hughes man is even that ."
All things being considered I commend the Yankees .
They have shown good sense and I do not mind admitting it .
"Well , four years ago his wife disappeared -- it was n't known how or when ."
"She just was n't ever seen again , that 's all ."
Whether she died or was murdered or went away nobody ever knew .
There was some talk of an investigation but nothing came of it .
"As for the girl , she 's always lived there with her father ."
She must be a perfect heathen .
"He never goes anywhere , but there used to be talk of strangers visiting him -- queer sort of characters who came up the lake in vessels from the American side ."
"I have n't heard any reports of such these past few years , though -- not since his wife disappeared ."
He keeps a yacht and goes sailing in it -- sometimes he cruises about for weeks -- that 's about all he ever does .
"And now you know as much about the Olivers as I do , Mr. Douglas . ''"
Alan had listened to this gossipy narrative with an interest that did not escape Isabel King 's observant eyes .
"Much of it he mentally dismissed as improbable surmise , but the basic facts were probably as Mrs. Danby had reported them ."
"He had known that the girl of the shore could be no commonplace , primly nurtured young woman ."
`` Has no effort ever been made to bring these people into touch with the church ? ''
he asked absently .
"`` Bless you , yes ."
Every minister that 's ever been in Rexton has had a try at it .
The old cousin met every one of them at the door and told him nobody was at home .
Mr. Strong was the most persistent -- he did n't like being beaten .
"He went again and again and finally the Captain sent him word that when he wanted parsons or pill-dosers he 'd send for them , and till he did he 'd thank them to mind their own business ."
"They say Mr. Strong met Lynde once along shore and wanted to know if she would n't come to church , and she laughed in his face and told him she knew more about God now than he did or ever would ."
Perhaps the story is n't true .
Or if it was maybe he provoked her into saying it .
Mr. Strong was n't overly tactful .
"I believe in judging the poor girl as charitably as possible and making allowances for her , seeing how she 's been brought up ."
You could n't expect her to know how to behave . ''
"Somehow , Alan resented Mrs. Danby 's charity ."
"Then , his sense of humour being strongly developed , he smiled to think of this commonplace old lady `` making allowances '' for the splendid bit of femininity he had seen on the shore ."
A plump barnyard fowl might as well have talked of making allowances for a seagull !
"Alan walked home with Isabel King but he was very silent as they went together down the long , dark , sweet-smelling country road bordered by its white orchards ."
"Isabel put her own construction on his absent replies to her remarks and presently she asked him , `` Did you think Lynde Oliver handsome ? ''"
The question gave Alan an annoyance out of all proportion to its significance .
`` Of course you may !
"This proves to me that we have a hold on the boy 's heart , and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob . ''"
"Dan heard a soft little sound , as if Mrs. Jo thanked her husband without words , and , in the instant 's silence that followed , two great tears that had slowly gathered in the boy 's eyes brimmed over and rolled down his dusty cheeks ."
"No one saw them , for he brushed them hastily away ; but in that little pause I think Dan 's old distrust for these good people vanished for ever , the soft spot in his heart was touched , and he felt an impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that was so patient and forgiving ."
"He said nothing , he only wished the wish with all his might , resolved to try in his blind boyish way , and sealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain , fatigue , nor loneliness could wring from him ."
`` Come and see his foot .
"I am afraid it is badly hurt , for he has kept on three days through heat and dust , with nothing but water and an old jacket to bind it up with ."
"I tell you , Fritz , that boy is a brave lad , and will make a fine man yet . ''"
"`` I hope so , for your sake , enthusiastic woman , your faith deserves success ."
"Now , I will go and see your little Spartan ."
Where is he ? ''
"`` In my room ; but , dear , you 'll be very kind to him , no matter how gruff he seems ."
I am sure that is the way to conquer him .
"He wo n't bear sternness nor much restraint , but a soft word and infinite patience will lead him as it used to lead me . ''"
`` As if you ever like this little rascal ! ''
"cried Mr. Bhaer , laughing , yet half angry at the idea ."
"`` I was in spirit , though I showed it in a different way ."
"I seem to know by instinct how he feels , to understand what will win and touch him , and to sympathize with his temptations and faults ."
"I am glad I do , for it will help me to help him ; and if I can make a good man of this wild boy , it will be the best work of my life . ''"
"`` God bless the work , and help the worker ! ''"
"Mr. Bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done , and both came in together to find Dan 's head down upon his arm , as if he was quite overcome by sleep ."
"But he looked up quickly , and tried to rise as Mr. Bhaer said pleasantly , `` So you like Plumfield better than Page 's farm ."
"Well , let us see if we can get on more comfortably this time than we did before . ''"
"`` Thanky , sir , '' said Dan , trying not to be gruff , and finding it easier than he expected ."
"`` Now , the foot !"
Ach !
this is not well .
We must have Dr. Firth to-morrow .
"Warm water , Jo , and old linen . ''"
"Mr. Bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot , while Mrs. Jo prepared the only empty bed in the house ."
"It was in the little guest-chamber leading from the parlor , and often used when the lads were poorly , for it saved Mrs. Jo from running up and down , and the invalids could see what was going on ."
"When it was ready , Mr. Bhaer took the boy in his arms , and carried him in , helped him undress , laid him on the little white bed , and left him with another hand-shake , and a fatherly `` Good-night , my son . ''"
I had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for making soap .
And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten .
"Walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair , holding the kitten , and you were standing on a chair at the other side ."
You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled .
You were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony .
"Walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon , kitten and all ."
If I had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned .
"I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done , and your mother , who had seen it all from the upstairs window , came down and picked you up , dripping as you were , and gave you a beautiful spanking ."
"Ah , '' said Susan with a sigh , `` those were happy old days at Ingleside . ''"
"`` Must have been , '' said Ken ."
His voice sounded queer and stiff .
Rilla supposed he was hopelessly enraged .
The truth was he dared not trust his voice lest it betray his frantic desire to laugh .
"`` Rilla here , now , '' said Susan , looking affectionately at that unhappy damsel , `` never was much spanked ."
She was a real well-behaved child for the most part .
But her father did spank her once .
"She got two bottles of pills out of his office and dared Alice Clow to see which of them could swallow all the pills first , and if her father had not happened in the nick of time those two children would have been corpses by night ."
"As it was , they were both sick enough shortly after ."
But the doctor spanked Rilla then and there and he made such a thorough job of it that she never meddled with anything in his office afterwards .
"We hear a great deal nowadays of something that is called ` moral persuasion , ' but in my opinion a good spanking and no nagging afterwards is a much better thing . ''"
Rilla wondered viciously whether Susan meant to relate all the family spankings .
But Susan had finished with the subject and branched off to another cheerful one .
"`` I remember little Tod MacAllister over-harbour killed himself that very way , eating up a whole box of fruitatives because he thought they were candy ."
It was a very sad affair .
"He was , '' said Susan earnestly , `` the very cutest little corpse I ever laid my eyes on ."
"It was very careless of his mother to leave the fruitatives where he could get them , but she was well-known to be a heedless creature ."
One day she found a nest of five eggs as she was going across the fields to church with a brand new blue silk dress on .
"So she put them in the pocket of her petticoat and when she got to church she forgot all about them and sat down on them and her dress was ruined , not to speak of the petticoat ."
Let me see -- would not Tod be some relation of yours ?
Your great grandmother West was a MacAllister .
Her brother Amos was a MacDonaldite in religion .
I am told he used to take the jerks something fearful .
"` It shall be done , ' answered the youth ; ` but you must give me two years to manage it , for my beard must grow so that he may not know me . '"
"` So be it , ' said the king ."
"And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon 's house and on the way he met a beggar , whom he persuaded to change clothes with him , and in the beggar 's garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon ."
"He found his enemy before his house , very busy making a box , and addressed him politely , ` Good morning , your worship ."
Have you a morsel of bread ? '
"` You must wait , ' replied the dragon , 'till I have finished my box , and then I will see if I can find one . '"
` What will you do with the box when it is made ? '
inquired the beggar .
"` It is for the young man who killed my wife , and stole my flying horse and my bed covering , ' said the dragon ."
"` He deserves nothing better , ' answered the beggar , ` for it was an ill deed ."
"Still that box is too small for him , for he is a big man . '"
"` You are wrong , ' said the dragon ."
` The box is large enough even for me . '
"` Well , the rogue is nearly as tall as you , ' replied the beggar , ` and , of course , if you can get in , he can ."
But I am sure you would find it a tight fit . '
"` No , there is plenty of room , ' said the dragon , tucking himself carefully inside ."
"But no sooner was he well in , than the young man clapped on the lid and called out , ` Now press hard , just to see if he will be able to get out . '"
"The dragon pressed as hard as he could , but the lid never moved ."
"` It is all right , ' he cried ; ` now you can open it . '"
"But instead of opening it , the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still ; then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king ."
"And when the king heard that the dragon was inside , he was so excited that he would not wait one moment , but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there ."
"He was very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out , but unluckily there was just room for his great mouth , and with one snap the king vanished down his wide red jaws ."
"Then the young man married the king 's daughter and ruled over the land , but what he did with the dragon nobody knows ."
The Goblin and the Grocer Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
"There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic , and he had nothing in the world of his own ."
"There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor , and he had the whole house for his own ."
"The Goblin belonged to him , for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer 's a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle ."
"The grocer could afford this , so the Goblin stayed in the grocer 's shop ; and this teaches us a good deal ."
"One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese ; he had no one to send , so he came himself ."
"He got what he wanted , paid for it , and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife -LRB- she was a woman who could do more than nod ; she could talk -RRB- ."
"When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still , reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped ."
It was a leaf torn out of an old book -- a book of poetry ` There 's more of that over there ! '
"`` Well , I will ; but it 's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very nicest things , '' sighed Daisy ."
"`` A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of , so we must , '' explained Demi , to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were reading about them in school ."
"`` Is Rob coming too , '' asked Daisy ."
"`` Yes , and he is going to bring his toy village ; it is all made of wood , you know , and will burn nicely ."
"We 'll have a grand bonfire , and see them blaze up , wo n't we ? ''"
"This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy , and she ate her dinner with a row of paper dolls before her , as a sort of farewell banquet ."
"At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth , each child bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse ."
"Teddy insisted on going also , and seeing that all the others had toys , he tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm , and old Annabella under the other , little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him ."
"`` Where are you going , my chickens ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , as the flock passed her door ."
`` To play by the big rock ; ca n't we ? ''
"`` Yes , only do n't do near the pond , and take good care of baby . ''"
"`` I always do , '' said Daisy , leading forth her charge with a capable air ."
"`` Now , you must all sit round , and not move till I tell you ."
"This flat stone is an altar , and I am going to make a fire on it . ''"
"Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze , as he had seen the boys do at picnics ."
"When the flame burned well , he ordered the company to march round it three times and then stand in a circle ."
"`` I shall begin , and as fast as my things are burnt , you must bring yours . ''"
"With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures , pasted in by himself ; this was followed by a dilapidated boat , and then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death ."
"Not one faltered or hung back , from the splendid red and yellow captain to the small drummer who had lost his legs ; all vanished in the flames and mingled in one common pool of melted lead ."
"`` Now , Daisy ! ''"
"called the high priest of Kitty-mouse , when his rich offerings had been consumed , to the great satisfaction of the children ."
"`` My dear dollies , how can I let them go ? ''"
"moaned Daisy , hugging the entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe ."
"`` You must , '' commanded Demi ; and with a farewell kiss to each , Daisy laid her blooming dolls upon the coals ."
"`` Let me keep one , the dear blue thing , she is so sweet , '' besought the poor little mamma , clutching her last in despair ."
`` More !
more ! ''
"growled an awful voice , and Demi cried , `` that 's the Kitty-mouse !"
"she must have every one , quick , or she will scratch us . ''"
"In went the precious blue belle , flounces , rosy hat , and all , and nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band ."
"`` Stand the houses and trees round , and let them catch themselves ; it will be like a real fire then , '' said Demi , who liked variety even in his `` sackerryfices . ''"
"We promised Ed to stand by Bob , so I did as well as I knew how ; '' and Jack seemed to think that was about all there was to say ."
`` I never saw such a fellow for keeping a promise !
"You stick to it through thick and thin , no matter how silly or hard it is ."
"You remember , mother , last summer , how you told him not to go in a boat and he promised , the day we went on the picnic ."
"We rode up , but the horse ran off home , so we had to come back by way of the river , all but Jack , and he walked every step of five miles because he would n't go near a boat , though Mr. Burton was there to take care of him ."
I call that rather overdoing the matter ; '' and Frank looked as if he thought moderation even in virtue a good thing .
`` And I call it a fine sample of entire obedience .
"He obeyed orders , and that is what we all must do , without always seeing why , or daring to use our own judgment ."
"It is a great safeguard to Jack , and a very great comfort to me ; for I know that if he promises he will keep his word , no matter what it costs him , '' said Mamma warmly , as she tumbled up the quirls with an irrepressible caress , remembering how the boy came wearily in after all the others , without seeming for a moment to think that he could have done anything else ."
`` Like Casabianca ! ''
"cried Jill , much impressed , for obedience was her hardest trial ."
"`` I think he was a fool to burn up , '' said Frank , bound not to give in ."
`` I do n't .
"It 's a splendid piece , and every one likes to speak it , and it was true , and it would n't be in all the books if he was a fool ."
"Grown people know what is good , '' declared Jill , who liked heroic actions , and was always hoping for a chance to distinguish herself in that way ."
"`` You admire ` The Charge of the Light Brigade , ' and glow all over as you thunder it out ."
Yet they went gallantly to their death rather than disobey orders .
"A mistake , perhaps , but it makes us thrill to hear of it ; and the same spirit keeps my Jack true as steel when once his word is passed , or he thinks it is his duty ."
"Do n't be laughed out of it , my son , for faithfulness in little things fits one for heroism when the great trials come ."
One 's conscience can hardly be too tender when honor and honesty are concerned . ''
"`` You are right , mother , and I am wrong ."
"I beg your pardon , Jack , and you sha 'n' t get ahead of me next time . ''"
"Frank made his mother a little bow , gave his brother a shake of the hand , and nodded to Jill , as if anxious to show that he was not too proud to own up when he made a mistake ."
"`` Please tell on , Jack ."
"This is very nice , but I do want to know all about the other , '' said Jill , after a short pause ."
`` Let me see .
"Oh , I saw Bob at church , and he looked rather blue ; so , after Sunday School , I asked what the matter was ."
"He said Jerry bothered him for some money he lent him at different times when they were loafing round together , before we took him up ."
He would n't get any wages for some time .
"The Captain keeps him short on purpose , I guess , and wo n't let him come down town except on Sundays ."
"He did n't want any one to know about it , for fear he 'd lose his place ."
So I promised I would n't tell .
"Three days and three nights they swam through the sea , and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home ."
"The turtle bade him farewell , and was gone in a moment ."
Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps .
"He saw the smoke curling through the roof , and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted ."
"He heard the children shouting and calling , and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto , and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return ."
Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street .
"After all , everything was changed ."
Neither men nor houses were those he once knew .
"Quickly he saw his old home ; yes , it was still there , but it had a strange look ."
"Anxiously he knocked at the door , and asked the woman who opened it after his parents ."
"But she did not know their names , and could give him no news of them ."
"Still more disturbed , he rushed to the burying ground , the only place that could tell him what he wished to know ."
Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant .
And he was right .
"In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents , and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son , and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea ."
"And so he found that since he had deft his home , three hundred years had passed by ."
"Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street , hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old ."
"But when the man spoke , he knew he was not dreaming , though he felt as if he had lost his senses ."
In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess .
Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true .
"He might be the victim of some enchanter 's spell , and in his hand lay the counter-charm ."
"Almost unconsciously he opened it , and a purple vapour came pouring out ."
"He held the empty box in his hand , and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled , like the hand of an old , old man ."
"He ran to the brook , which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain ."
and saw himself reflected as in a mirror .
It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him .
"Wounded to death , he crept back through the village , and no man knew the old , old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before ."
"So he toiled wearily back , till he reached the shore , and here he sat sadly on a rock , and called loudly on the turtle ."
"But she never came back any more , but instead , death came soon , and set him free ."
"But before that happened , the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story , and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea , and the most beautiful woman in the world besides ."
The Slaying of the Tanuki From the Japanische Murchen und Sagen .
"Near a big river , and between two high mountains , a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long , long time ago ."
"Now , alas !"
it was absolutely finished .
"Oh , dear no !"
` Gracious me ! '
"cried a brass manufacturer , ` there 's no handle on the door , ' and he put one on ."
"An ironmonger added a scraper , and an old lady ran up with a door-mat ."
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
` Finished !
"how can it be finished , ' the plumber demanded scornfully , ` before hot and cold are put in ? '"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower-garden to the right of the verandah , and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Shook his bald head and murmured , ` Cold , quite cold ' -RSB- Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished , and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , ` Tony , ' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"As Tony made no answer , she sat up , whereupon her head hit the roof , and it opened like the lid of a box , and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow ."
"As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself , so she pinched her cheeks , and then she knew it was herself , and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure ."
"She remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies , but how ever , she asked herself , had she got into this funny place ?"
"She stepped out by the roof , right over the garden , and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night ."
It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else . '
O you darling !
O you sweet !
O you love ! '
she cried .
"Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house , or maybe it now knew that its work was done , for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller ; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking , yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now ."
"It always remained as complete as ever , but it became smaller and smaller , and the garden dwindled at the same time , and the snow crept closer , lapping house and garden up ."
"Now the house was the size of a little dog 's kennel , and now of a Noah 's Ark , but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall , every one complete ."
"The glow-worm light was waning too , but it was still there ."
"` Darling , loveliest , do n't go ! '"
"` We must rest here as best we can , ' spoke Covan to the cows ."
And they bowed their heads and lay down in the place where they stood .
"Then came the black raven of Corri-nan-creag , whose eyes never closed , and whose wings never tired ; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty , and soft moss for a bed ."
"` Go with me thither , ' he said to Covan , ` and you shall lay aside three-thirds of your weariness , and depart in the morning refreshed , ' and Covan listened thankfully to his words , and at dawn he rose up to seek his cows ."
` Farewell ! '
cried the black raven .
"` You trusted me , and took all I had to offer in return for the food you once gave me ."
"So if in time to come you need a friend , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"As before , the cows were standing in the spot where he had left them , ready to set out ."
"All that day they walked , on and on , and on , Covan son of Gorla walking behind them , till night fell while they were on the banks of a river ."
"` We can go no further , ' spake Covan to the cows ."
"And they began to eat the grass by the side of the stream , while Covan listened to them and longed for some supper also , for they had travelled far , and his limbs were weak under him ."
"Then there was a swish of water at his feet , and out peeped the head of the famous otter Doran-donn of the stream ."
"` Trust to me and I will find you warmth and shelter , ' said Doran-donn ; ` and for food fish in plenty . '"
"And Covan went with him thankfully , and ate and rested , and laid aside three-thirds of his weariness ."
"At sunrise he left his bed of dried sea-weed , which had floated up with the tide , and with a grateful heart bade farewell to Doran-donn ."
"` Because you trusted me and took what I had to offer , you have made me your friend , Covan , ' said Doran-donn ."
"` And if you should be in danger , and need help from one who can swim a river or dive beneath a wave , call to me and I will come to you . '"
"Then he plunged into the stream , and was seen no more ."
"The cows were standing ready in the place where Covan had left them , and they journeyed on all that day , till , when night fell , they reached the cottage ."
"Joyful indeed was the old man as the cows went into their stables , and he beheld the rich milk that flowed into the pail of the golden-haired maiden with the silver comb ."
"` You have done well indeed , ' he said to Covan son of Gorla ."
"` And now , what would you have as a reward ? ' '"
"I want nothing for myself , ' answered Covan the Brown-haired ; ` but I ask you to give me back my brothers and my sister who have been lost to us for three years past ."
"You are wise and know the lore of fairies and of witches ; tell me where I can find them , and what I must do to bring them to life again . '"
The old man looked grave at the words of Covan .
"` Yes , truly I know where they are , ' answered he , ` and I say not that they may not be brought to life again ."
But the perils are great -- too great for you to overcome . '
"` Tell me what they are , ' said Covan again , ` and I shall know better if I may overcome them . '"
"` Listen , then , and judge ."
"In the mountain yonder there dwells a roe , white of foot , with horns that branch like the antlers of a deer ."
On the lake that leads to the land of the Sun floats a duck whose body is green and whose neck is of gold .
The door was opened almost at once by the maid .
`` Is Dr. Livesey in ? ''
I asked .
"No , she said , he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire ."
"`` So there we go , boys , '' said Mr. Dance ."
"This time , as the distance was short , I did not mount , but ran with Dogger 's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens ."
"Here Mr. Dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house ."
"The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire ."
I had never seen the squire so near at hand .
"He was a tall man , over six feet high , and broad in proportion , and he had a bluff , rough-and-ready face , all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels ."
"His eyebrows were very black , and moved readily , and this gave him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high ."
"`` Come in , Mr. Dance , '' says he , very stately and condescending ."
"`` Good evening , Dance , '' says the doctor with a nod ."
"`` And good evening to you , friend Jim ."
What good wind brings you here ? ''
"The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson ; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other , and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest ."
"When they heard how my mother went back to the inn , Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh , and the squire cried `` Bravo ! ''"
and broke his long pipe against the grate .
"Long before it was done , Mr. Trelawney -LRB- that , you will remember , was the squire 's name -RRB- had got up from his seat and was striding about the room , and the doctor , as if to hear the better , had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll ."
At last Mr. Dance finished the story .
"`` Mr. Dance , '' said the squire , `` you are a very noble fellow ."
"And as for riding down that black , atrocious miscreant , I regard it as an act of virtue , sir , like stamping on a cockroach ."
"This lad Hawkins is a trump , I perceive ."
"Hawkins , will you ring that bell ?"
Mr. Dance must have some ale . ''
"`` And so , Jim , '' said the doctor , `` you have the thing that they were after , have you ? ''"
"`` Here it is , sir , '' said I , and gave him the oilskin packet ."
"The doctor looked it all over , as if his fingers were itching to open it ; but instead of doing that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat ."
"`` Squire , '' said he , `` when Dance has had his ale he must , of course , be off on his Majesty 's service ; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup . ''"
"`` As you will , Livesey , '' said the squire ; `` Hawkins has earned better than cold pie . ''"
"So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable , and I made a hearty supper , for I was as hungry as a hawk , while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed ."
"`` And now , squire , '' said the doctor ."
"I could not help wondering who it was that had `` got itt , '' and what `` itt '' was that he got ."
A knife in his back as like as not .
"`` Not much instruction there , '' said Dr. Livesey as he passed on ."
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries .
"There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , as in common account-books , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of crosses between the two ."
"On the 12th of June , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone , and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause ."
"In a few cases , to be sure , the name of a place would be added , as `` Offe Caraccas , '' or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , as `` 62o 17 ' 20 '' , 19o 2 ' 40 '' . ''"
"The record lasted over nearly twenty years , the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on , and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions , and these words appended , `` Bones , his pile . ''"
"`` I ca n't make head or tail of this , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
"`` The thing is as clear as noonday , '' cried the squire ."
`` This is the black-hearted hound 's account-book .
These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered .
"The sums are the scoundrel 's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer ."
"` Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast ."
God help the poor souls that manned her -- coral long ago . ''
`` Right ! ''
said the doctor .
`` See what it is to be a traveller .
Right !
"And the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank . ''"
"There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French , English , and Spanish moneys to a common value ."
`` Thrifty man ! ''
cried the doctor .
`` He was n't the one to be cheated . ''
"`` And now , '' said the squire , `` for the other . ''"
"The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that I had found in the captain 's pocket ."
"The doctor opened the seals with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , soundings , names of hills and bays and inlets , and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores ."
"It was about nine miles long and five across , shaped , you might say , like a fat dragon standing up , and had two fine land-locked harbours , and a hill in the centre part marked `` The Spy-glass . ''"
"There were several additions of a later date , but above all , three crosses of red ink -- two on the north part of the island , one in the southwest -- and beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain 's tottery characters , these words : `` Bulk of treasure here . ''"
"Over on the back the same hand had written this further information : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet ."
"The bar silver is in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it ."
"The arms are easy found , in the sand-hill , N. point of north inlet cape , bearing E. and a quarter N. J.F. ."
Sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably .
"In the meantime , we could never make out where he got the drink ."
That was the ship 's mystery .
"Watch him as we pleased , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we asked him to his face , he would only laugh if he were drunk , and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water ."
"He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody was much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappeared entirely and was seen no more ."
`` Overboard ! ''
said the captain .
"`` Well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons . ''"
"But there we were , without a mate ; and it was necessary , of course , to advance one of the men ."
"The boatswain , Job Anderson , was the likeliest man aboard , and though he kept his old title , he served in a way as mate ."
"Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea , and his knowledge made him very useful , for he often took a watch himself in easy weather ."
"And the coxswain , Israel Hands , was a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything ."
"He was a great confidant of Long John Silver , and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship 's cook , Barbecue , as the men called him ."
"Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible ."
"It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore ."
Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck .
"He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces -- Long John 's earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now trailing it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly as another man could walk ."
Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced .
"`` He 's no common man , Barbecue , '' said the coxswain to me ."
`` He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and brave -- a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John !
I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together -- him unarmed . ''
All the crew respected and even obeyed him .
He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service .
"To me he was unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he kept as clean as a new pin , the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner ."
"`` Come away , Hawkins , '' he would say ; `` come and have a yarn with John ."
"Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son ."
Sit you down and hear the news .
"Here 's Cap'n Flint -- I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer -- here 's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v ` yage ."
"Was n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"And the parrot would say , with great rapidity , `` Pieces of eight !"
Pieces of eight !
Pieces of eight ! ''
"He often played ships at the Round Pond , but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass ."
"Of course , he had never seen a hoop , and he wondered what you play at with them , and decided that you play at pretending they are boats ."
"This hoop always sank at once , but he waded in for it , and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond , and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops ."
"Another time , when he found a child 's pail , he thought it was for sitting in , and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of it ."
Also he found a balloon .
"It was bobbing about on the Hump , quite as if it was having a game by itself , and he caught it after an exciting chase ."
"But he thought it was a ball , and Jenny Wren had told him that boys kick balls , so he kicked it ; and after that he could not find it anywhere ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely , and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw another one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry ."
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"The Little House Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"Dick told him his name , and presented Lord Foxham 's signet , which the duke immediately recognised ."
"`` Ye come too soon , '' he said ; `` but why should I complain ?"
"Ye are like me , that was here at watch two hours before the day ."
"But this is the first sally of mine arms ; upon this adventure , Master Shelton , shall I make or mar the quality of my renown ."
"There lie mine enemies , under two old , skilled captains -- Risingham and Brackley -- well posted for strength , I do believe , but yet upon two sides without retreat , enclosed betwixt the sea , the harbour , and the river ."
"Methinks , Shelton , here were a great blow to be stricken , an we could strike it silently and suddenly . ''"
"`` I do think so , indeed , '' cried Dick , warming ."
`` Have ye my Lord Foxham 's notes ? ''
inquired the duke .
"And then , Dick , having explained how he was without them for the moment , made himself bold to offer information every jot as good , of his own knowledge ."
"`` And for mine own part , my lord duke , '' he added , `` an ye had men enough , I would fall on even at this present ."
"For , look ye , at the peep of day the watches of the night are over ; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward -- only scour the outskirts with horsemen ."
"Now , then , when the night watch is already unarmed , and the rest are at their morning cup -- now were the time to break them . ''"
`` How many do ye count ? ''
asked Gloucester .
"`` They number not two thousand , '' Dick replied ."
"`` I have seven hundred in the woods behind us , '' said the duke ; `` seven hundred follow from Kettley , and will be here anon ; behind these , and further , are four hundred more ; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day from here , at Holywood ."
"Shall we attend their coming , or fall on ? ''"
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` when ye hanged these five poor rogues ye did decide the question ."
"Churls although they were , in these uneasy , times they will be lacked and looked for , and the alarm be given ."
"Therefore , my lord , if ye do count upon the advantage of a surprise , ye have not , in my poor opinion , one whole hour in front of you . ''"
"`` I do think so indeed , '' returned Crookback ."
"`` Well , before an hour , ye shall be in the thick o n't , winning spurs ."
"A swift man to Holywood , carrying Lord Foxham 's signet ; another along the road to speed my laggards !"
"Nay , Shelton , by the rood , it may be done ! ''"
Therewith he once more set his trumpet to his lips and blew .
This time he was not long kept waiting .
In a moment the open space about the cross was filled with horse and foot .
"Richard of Gloucester took his place upon the steps , and despatched messenger after messenger to hasten the concentration of the seven hundred men that lay hidden in the immediate neighbourhood among the woods ; and before a quarter of an hour had passed , all his dispositions being taken , he put himself at their head , and began to move down the hill towards Shoreby ."
His plan was simple .
"He was to seize a quarter of the town of Shoreby lying on the right hand of the high road , and make his position good there in the narrow lanes until his reinforcements followed ."
"If Lord Risingham chose to retreat , Richard would follow upon his rear , and take him between two fires ; or , if he preferred to hold the town , he would be shut in a trap , there to be gradually overwhelmed by force of numbers ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely ; and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."

-LSB- Illustration : Fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk -RSB- And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- IV LOCK-OUT TIME It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children ."
"Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came trooping in that very evening ."
"They ca n't resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed to go , and also partly because they are so cunning ."
"They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !"
"-LSB- Illustration : They are so cunning -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity you ca n't write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy ."
"Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing looking at a fairy all the time ."
The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .
This is one of their best tricks .
Her cheek was swollen and her face ached .
"The schoolroom was cold and smoky , for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups ."
Anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before .
Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seat-mate and then glance at her with a grin .
"Never , so it seemed to Anne , had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning ; and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results ."
"The coal rolled to every part of the room , her slate was broken into fragments , and when she picked herself up , her face , stained with coal dust , sent the boys into roars of laughter ."
Anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing .
"`` Really , Barbara , '' she said icily , `` if you can not move without falling over something you 'd better remain in your seat ."
It is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward . ''
"Poor Barbara stumbled back to her desk , her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque ."
"Never before had her beloved , sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion , and Barbara was heartbroken ."
"Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation , and the second reader class remember that lesson yet , as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed ."
Just as Anne was snapping the sums out St. Clair Donnell arrived breathlessly .
"`` You are half an hour late , St. Clair , '' Anne reminded him frigidly ."
`` Why is this ? ''
"`` Please , miss , I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner 'cause we 're expecting company and Clarice Almira 's sick , '' was St. Clair 's answer , given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates ."
"`` Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty-four of your arithmetic for punishment , '' said Anne ."
St. Clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate .
Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the aisle .
Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel .
Old Mrs. Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling `` nut cakes '' by way of adding to her scanty income .
The cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them .
"On their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at Mrs. Hiram 's , bring the cakes along with them to school , and , if possible , eat them and treat their mates during school hours ."
"Anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated ; and yet here was St. Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel of them , wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper Mrs. Hiram used , under her very eyes ."
"`` Joseph , '' said Anne quietly , `` bring that parcel here . ''"
"Joe , startled and abashed , obeyed ."
He was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened .
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment .
"`` Throw it into the fire , '' said Anne ."
Joe looked very blank .
"`` P ... p ... p ... lease , m ... m ... miss , '' he began ."
"`` Do as I tell you , Joseph , without any words about it . ''"
said the eyes of one to the eyes of the other .
Meanwhile the swallows had spoken again .
` That was indeed good fortune ! '
cried they .
` And when the children are grown up they can return to their father and set their mother free . '
"` It will not be so easy as you think , ' answered the city swallow , shaking her head ; ` for they will have to prove that they are the king 's children , and also that their mother never went mad at all ."
"In fact , it is so difficult that there is only one way of proving it to the king . '"
` And what is that ? '
cried all the swallows at once .
` And how do you know it ? ' '
"I know it , ' answered the city swallow , ` because , one day , when I was passing through the palace garden , I met a cuckoo , who , as I need not tell you , always pretends to be able to see into the future ."
"We began to talk about certain things which were happening in the palace , and of the events of past years ."
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` the only person who can expose the wickedness of the ministers and show the king how wrong he has been , is the Bird of Truth , who can speak the language of men . '' '"
`` And where can this bird be found ? ''
I asked . '
"`` It is shut up in a castle guarded by a fierce giant , who only sleeps one quarter of an hour out of the whole twenty-four , '' replied the cuckoo ."
` And where is this castle ? '
"inquired the country swallow , who , like all the rest , and the children most of all , had been listening with deep attention ."
"` That is just what I do n't know , ' answered her friend ."
"` All I can tell you is that not far from here is a tower , where dwells an old witch , and it is she who knows the way , and she will only teach it to the person who promises to bring her the water from the fountain of many colours , which she uses for her enchantments ."
"But never will she betray the place where the Bird of Truth is hidden , for she hates him , and would kill him if she could ; knowing well , however , that this bird can not die , as he is immortal , she keeps him closely shut up , and guarded night and day by the Birds of Bad Faith , who seek to gag him so that his voice should not be heard . '"
"` And is there no one else who can tell the poor boy where to find the bird , if he should ever manage to reach the tower ? '"
asked the country swallow .
"` No one , ' replied the city swallow , ` except an owl , who lives a hermit 's life in that desert , and he knows only one word of man 's speech , and that is `` cross . ''"
"So that even if the prince did succeed in getting there , he could never understand what the owl said ."
"But , look , the sun is sinking to his nest in the depths of the sea , and I must go to mine ."
"Good-night , friends , good-night ! '"
"Then the swallow flew away , and the children , who had forgotten both hunger and weariness in the joy of this strange news , rose up and followed in the direction of her flight ."
"After two hours ' walking , they arrived at a large city , which they felt sure must be the capital of their father 's kingdom ."
"Seeing a good-natured looking woman standing at the door of a house , they asked her if she would give them a night 's lodging , and she was so pleased with their pretty faces and nice manners that she welcomed them warmly ."
"It was scarcely light the next morning before the girl was sweeping out the rooms , and the boy watering the garden , so that by the time the good woman came downstairs there was nothing left for her to do ."
"This so delighted her that she begged the children to stay with her altogether , and the boy answered that he would leave his sisters with her gladly , but that he himself had serious business on hand and must not linger in pursuit of it ."
Isaac was a well-to-do old bachelor who had never had any notion of getting married until his sister died in the winter .
"And then , as soon as the spring planting was over , he began to look round for a wife ."
He came to me first and I said `` No '' good and hard .
"I liked Isaac well enough ; but I was snug and comfortable , and did n't feel like pulling up my roots and moving into another lot ; besides , Isaac 's courting seemed to me a shade too business-like ."
I ca n't get along without a little romance ; it 's my nature .
"Isaac was disappointed and said so , but intimated that it was n't crushing and that the next best would do very well ."
"The next best was Melissa , and he proposed to her after the decent interval of a fortnight ."
Melissa also refused him .
"I admit I was surprised at this , for I knew Melissa was rather anxious to marry ; but she has always been down on Isaac Appleby , from principle , because of a family feud on her mother 's side ; besides , an old beau of hers , a widower at Kingsbridge , was just beginning to take notice again , and I suspected Melissa had hopes concerning him ."
"Finally , I imagine Melissa did not fancy being second choice ."
"Whatever her reasons were , she refused poor Isaac , and that finished his matrimonial prospects as far as Jersey Cove was concerned , for there was n't another eligible woman in it -- that is , for a man of Isaac 's age ."
"I was the only widow , and the other old maids besides Melissa were all hopelessly old-maiden ."
"This was all three months ago , and Isaac had been keeping house for himself ever since ."
"Nobody knew much about how he got along , for the Appleby house is half a mile from anywhere , down near the shore at the end of a long lane -- the lonesomest place , as I did not fail to remember when I was considering Isaac 's offer ."
"`` I heard Jarvis Aldrich say Isaac had got a dog lately , '' said Melissa , when we finally came in sight of the house -- a handsome new one , by the way , put up only ten years ago ."
`` Jarvis said it was an imported breed .
I do hope it is n't cross . ''
"I have a mortal horror of dogs , and I followed Melissa into the big farmyard with fear and trembling ."
"We were halfway across the yard when Melissa shrieked : `` Anne , there 's the dog ! ''"
"There was the dog ; and the trouble was that he did n't stay there , but came right down the slope at a steady , business-like trot ."
"He was a bull-dog and big enough to bite a body clean in two , and he was the ugliest thing in dogs I had ever seen ."
Melissa and I both lost our heads .
"We screamed , dropped our parasols , and ran instinctively to the only refuge that was in sight -- a ladder leaning against the old Appleby house ."
"I am forty-five and something more than plump , so that climbing ladders is not my favorite form of exercise ."
But I went up that one with the agility and grace of sixteen .
"Melissa followed me , and we found ourselves on the roof -- fortunately it was a flat one -- panting and gasping , but safe , unless that diabolical dog could climb a ladder ."
I crept cautiously to the edge and peered over .
"The beast was sitting on his haunches at the foot of the ladder , and it was quite evident he was not short on time ."
The gleam in his eye seemed to say : `` I 've got you two unprincipled subscription hunters beautifully treed and it 's treed you 're going to stay .
That is what I call satisfying . ''
I reported the state of the case to Melissa .
`` What shall we do ? ''
"Even as I spoke on these grave subjects , my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect , and my heart jump with pride ."
"About my clear duty to my friend , the lawyer had no doubt ."
"I must help him out of the county at whatever risk ; but in the case of James , he was of a different mind ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , '' says he , `` is one thing , Mr. Thomson 's kinsman quite another ."
"I know little of the facts , but I gather that a great noble -LRB- whom we will call , if you like , the D. of A. -RRB- * has some concern and is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter ."
"The D. of A. is doubtless an excellent nobleman ; but , Mr. David , timeo qui nocuere deos ."
"If you interfere to balk his vengeance , you should remember there is one way to shut your testimony out ; and that is to put you in the dock ."
"There , you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ."
"You will object that you are innocent ; well , but so is he ."
"And to be tried for your life before a Highland jury , on a Highland quarrel and with a Highland Judge upon the bench , would be a brief transition to the gallows . ''"
* The Duke of Argyle .
Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply to them ; so I put on all the simplicity I could .
"`` In that case , sir , '' said I , `` I would just have to be hanged -- would I not ? ''"
"`` My dear boy , '' cries he , `` go in God 's name , and do what you think is right ."
It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising you to choose the safe and shameful ; and I take it back with an apology .
"Go and do your duty ; and be hanged , if you must , like a gentleman ."
There are worse things in the world than to be hanged . ''
"`` Not many , sir , '' said I , smiling ."
"`` Why , yes , sir , '' he cried , `` very many ."
And it would be ten times better for your uncle -LRB- to go no farther afield -RRB- if he were dangling decently upon a gibbet . ''
"Thereupon he turned into the house -LRB- still in a great fervour of mind , so that I saw I had pleased him heartily -RRB- and there he wrote me two letters , making his comments on them as he wrote ."
"`` This , '' says he , `` is to my bankers , the British Linen Company , placing a credit to your name ."
"Consult Mr. Thomson , he will know of ways ; and you , with this credit , can supply the means ."
"I trust you will be a good husband of your money ; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson , I would be even prodigal ."
"Then for his kinsman , there is no better way than that you should seek the Advocate , tell him your tale , and offer testimony ; whether he may take it or not , is quite another matter , and will turn on the D. of A. Now , that you may reach the Lord Advocate well recommended , I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own , the learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig , a man whom I esteem ."
It will look better that you should be presented by one of your own name ; and the laird of Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord Advocate Grant .
"I would not trouble him , if I were you , with any particulars ; and -LRB- do you know ? -RRB-"
I think it would be needless to refer to Mr. Thomson .
"Form yourself upon the laird , he is a good model ; when you deal with the Advocate , be discreet ; and in all these matters , may the Lord guide you , Mr. David ! ''"
"Thereupon he took his farewell , and set out with Torrance for the Ferry , while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh ."
"As we went by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge , we kept looking back at the house of my fathers ."
"It stood there , bare and great and smokeless , like a place not lived in ; only in one of the top windows , there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward , like the head of a rabbit from a burrow ."
"`` We all want to wear the nice things , so let us draw lots ."
Would n't that be the fairest way ? ''
"asked Merry , looking like a rosy little bride , under a great piece of illusion , which had done duty in many plays ."
"`` The Prince is light , so the Princess must be darkish ."
"We ought to choose the girl who will look best , as it is a picture ."
"I heard Miss Delano say so , when the ladies got up the tableaux , last winter , and every one wanted to be Cleopatra , '' said Jill decidedly ."
"`` You choose , and then if we ca n't agree we will draw lots , '' proposed Susy , who , being plain , knew there was little hope of her getting a chance in any other way ."
"So all stood in a row , and Jill , from her sofa , surveyed them critically , feeling that the one Jack would really prefer was not among the number ."
"`` I choose that one , for Juliet wants to be Queen , Molly would make faces , and the others are too big or too light , '' pronounced Jill , pointing to Merry , who looked pleased , while Mabel 's face darkened , and Susy gave a disdainful sniff ."
"`` You 'd better draw lots , and then there will be no fuss ."
"Ju and I are out of the fight , but you three can try , and let this settle the matter , '' said Molly , handing Jill a long strip of paper ."
"All agreed to let it be so , and when the bits were ready drew in turn ."
"This time fate was evidently on Merry 's side , and no one grumbled when she showed the longest paper ."
"`` Go and dress , then come back , and we 'll plan how we are to be placed before we call up the boys , '' commanded Jill , who was manager , since she could be nothing else ."
"The girls retired to the bedroom and began to `` rig up , '' as they called it ; but discontent still lurked among them , and showed itself in sharp words , envious looks , and disobliging acts ."
`` Am I to have the white silk and the feather ? ''
"asked Merry , delighted with the silvery shimmer of the one and the graceful droop of the other , though both were rather shabby ."
`` You can use your own dress .
"I do n't see why you should have everything , '' answered Susy , who was at the mirror , putting a wreath of scarlet flowers on her red head , bound to be gay since she could not be pretty ."
"`` I think I 'd better keep the plume , as I have n't anything else that is nice , and I 'm afraid Emma would n't like me to lend it , '' added Annette , who was disappointed that Mabel was not to be the Beauty . ''"
I do n't intend to act at all ! ''
"declared Mabel , beginning to braid up her hair with a jerk , out of humor with the whole affair . ''"
"I think you are a set of cross , selfish girls to back out and keep your nice things just because you ca n't all have the best part ."
I 'm ashamed of you ! ''
"scolded Molly , standing by Merry , who was sadly surveying her mother 's old purple silk , which looked like brown in the evening ."
"`` I 'm going to have Miss Delano 's red brocade for the Queen , and I shall ask her for the yellow-satin dress for Merry when I go to get mine , and tell her how mean you are , '' said Juliet , frowning under her gilt-paper crown as she swept about in a red table-cloth for train till the brocade arrived ."
"`` Perhaps you 'd like to have Mabel cut her hair off , so Merry can have that , too ? ''"
"cried Susy , with whom hair was a tender point ."
"`` Light hair is n't wanted , so Ju will have to give hers , or you 'd better borrow Miss Bat 's frisette , '' added Mabel , with a scornful laugh ."
`` I just wish Miss Bat was here to give you girls a good shaking .
"Do let someone else have a chance at the glass , you peacock ! ''"
"exclaimed Molly Loo , pushing Susy aside to arrange her own blue turban , out of which she plucked the pink pompon to give Merry ."
`` Now we must fly round and fill up .
"Come , boys , sort out the green and hand us the flowers as we want them ."
"Then we must direct them , and , by the time that is done , you can go and leave them , '' said Jill , setting all to work ."
`` Ed must choose his baskets first .
"These are ours ; but any of those you can have ; '' and Molly pointed to a detachment of gay baskets , set apart from those already partly filled ."
"Ed chose a blue one , and Merry filled it with the rosiest may-flowers , knowing that it was to hang on Mabel 's door-handle ."
"The others did the same , and the pretty work went on , with much fun , till all were filled , and ready for the names or notes ."
"`` Let us have poetry , as we ca n't get wild flowers ."
"That will be rather fine , '' proposed Jill , who liked jingles ."
"All had had some practice at the game parties , and pencils went briskly for a few minutes , while silence reigned , as the poets racked their brains for rhymes , and stared at the blooming array before them for inspiration ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"I ca n't find a word to rhyme to ` geranium , ' '' sighed Molly , pulling her braid , as if to pump the well of her fancy dry ."
"`` Cranium , '' said Frank , who was getting on bravely with `` Annette '' and `` violet . ''"
`` That is elegant ! ''
"and Molly scribbled away in great glee , for her poems were always funny ones ."
"`` How do you spell anemoly -- the wild flower , I mean ? ''"
"asked Jill , who was trying to compose a very appropriate piece for her best basket , and found it easier to feel love and gratitude than to put them into verse ."
"`` Anemone ; do spell it properly , or you 'll get laughed at , '' answered Gus , wildly struggling to make his lines express great ardor , without being `` too spoony , '' as he expressed it ."
"`` No , I should n't ."
"This person never laughs at other persons ' mistakes , as some persons do , '' replied Jill , with dignity ."
"Jack was desperately chewing his pencil , for he could not get on at all ; but Ed had evidently prepared his poem , for his paper was half full already , and Merry was smiling as she wrote a friendly line or two for Ralph 's basket , as she feared he would be forgotten , and knew he loved kindness even more than he did beauty ."
"`` Now let 's read them , '' proposed Molly , who loved to laugh even at herself ."
"The boys politely declined , and scrambled their notes into the chosen baskets in great haste ; but the girls were less bashful ."
"Jill was invited to begin , and gave her little piece , with the pink hyacinth basket before her , to illustrate her poem ."
"`` TO MY LADY `` There are no flowers in the fields , No green leaves on the tree , No columbines , no violets , No sweet anemone ."
"So I have gathered from my pots All that I have to fill The basket that I hang to-night , With heaps of love from Jill . ''"
`` That 's perfectly sweet !
"Mine is n't ; but I meant it to be funny , '' said Molly , as if there could be any doubt about the following ditty : -- `` Dear Grif , Here is a whiff Of beautiful spring flowers ; The big red rose Is for your nose , As toward the sky it towers ."
"`` Oh , do not frown Upon this crown Of green pinks and blue geranium But think of me When this you see , And put it on your cranium . ''"
"`` O Molly , you will never hear the last of that if Grif gets it , '' said Jill , as the applause subsided , for the boys pronounced it `` tip-top . ''"
"`` Do n't care , he gets the worst of it any way , for there is a pin in that rose , and if he goes to smell the mayflowers underneath he will find a thorn to pay for the tack he put in my rubber boot ."
"I know he will play me some joke to-night , and I mean to be first if I can , '' answered Molly , settling the artificial wreath round the orange-colored canoe which held her effusion ."
A ` phone message has just come through from Charlottetown that Woodrow Wilson has sent that German ambassador man to the right about at last .
They tell me that means war .
"So I begin to think that Woodrow 's heart is in the right place after all , wherever his head may be , and I am going to commandeer a little sugar and celebrate the occasion with some fudge , despite the howls of the Food Board ."
I thought that submarine business would bring things to a crisis .
I told Cousin Sophia so when she said it was the beginning of the end for the Allies . ''
"`` Do n't let the doctor hear of the fudge , Susan , '' said Anne , with a smile ."
`` You know he has laid down very strict rules for us along the lines of economy the government has asked for . ''
"`` Yes , Mrs. Dr. dear , and a man should be master in his own household , and his women folk should bow to his decrees ."
I flatter myself that I am becoming quite efficient in economizing '' -- Susan had taken to using certain German terms with killing effect -- `` but one can exercise a little gumption on the quiet now and then .
"Shirley was wishing for some of my fudge the other day -- the Susan brand , as he called it -- and I said ` The first victory there is to celebrate I shall make you some . '"
"I consider this news quite equal to a victory , and what the doctor does not know will never grieve him ."
"I take the whole responsibility , Mrs. Dr. dear , so do not you vex your conscience . ''"
Susan spoiled Shirley shamelessly that winter .
"He came home from Queen 's every week-end , and Susan had all his favourite dishes for him , in so far as she could evade or wheedle the doctor , and waited on him hand and foot ."
"Though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him , but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse ; and when the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued , Susan 's exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed ."
Surely the end was in sight -- would come now before -- anyone else -- could go .
`` Things are coming our way at last .
"We have got the Germans on the run , '' she boasted ."
"`` The United States has declared war at last , as I always believed they would , in spite of Woodrow 's gift for letter writing , and you will see they will go into it with a vim since I understand that is their habit , when they do start ."
"And we have got the Germans on the run , too . ''"
"`` The States mean well , '' moaned Cousin Sophia , `` but all the vim in the world can not put them on the fighting line this spring , and the Allies will be finished before that ."
The Germans are just luring them on .
That man Simonds says their retreat has put the Allies in a hole . ''
"`` That man Simonds has said more than he will ever live to make good , '' retorted Susan ."
`` I do not worry myself about his opinion as long as Lloyd George is Premier of England .
He will not be bamboozled and that you may tie to .
Things look good to me .
"The U. S. is in the war , and we have got Kut and Bagdad back -- and I would not be surprised to see the Allies in Berlin by June -- and the Russians , too , since they have got rid of the Czar ."
"That , in my opinion was a good piece of work . ''"
"`` Time will show if it is , '' said Cousin Sophia , who would have been very indignant if anyone had told her that she would rather see Susan put to shame as a seer , than a successful overthrow of tyranny , or even the march of the Allies down Unter den Linden ."
"But then the woes of the Russian people were quite unknown to Cousin Sophia , while this aggravating , optimistic Susan was an ever-present thorn in her side ."
"Just at that moment Shirley was sitting on the edge of the table in the living-room , swinging his legs -- a brown , ruddy , wholesome lad , from top to toe , every inch of him -- and saying coolly , `` Mother and dad , I was eighteen last Monday ."
"By good luck , his knife flew out of his hand as he fell ."
"I picked up both that and his brogues , wished him a good morning , and set off upon my way , leaving him barefoot and disarmed ."
"I chuckled to myself as I went , being sure I was done with that rogue , for a variety of reasons ."
"First , he knew he could have no more of my money ; next , the brogues were worth in that country only a few pence ; and , lastly , the knife , which was really a dagger , it was against the law for him to carry ."
"In about half an hour of walk , I overtook a great , ragged man , moving pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff ."
"He was quite blind , and told me he was a catechist , which should have put me at my ease ."
"But his face went against me ; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret ; and presently , as we began to go on alongside , I saw the steel butt of a pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket ."
"To carry such a thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence , and transportation to the colonies upon a second ."
"Nor could I quite see why a religious teacher should go armed , or what a blind man could be doing with a pistol ."
"I told him about my guide , for I was proud of what I had done , and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence ."
"At the mention of the five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two , and was glad he could not see my blushes ."
`` Was it too much ? ''
"I asked , a little faltering ."
`` Too much ! ''
cries he .
"`` Why , I will guide you to Torosay myself for a dram of brandy ."
And give you the great pleasure of my company -LRB- me that is a man of some learning -RRB- in the bargain . ''
"I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide ; but at that he laughed aloud , and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle ."
"`` In the Isle of Mull , at least , '' says he , `` where I know every stone and heather-bush by mark of head ."
"See , now , '' he said , striking right and left , as if to make sure , `` down there a burn is running ; and at the head of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of that ; and it 's hard at the foot of the hill , that the way runs by to Torosay ; and the way here , being for droves , is plainly trodden , and will show grassy through the heather . ''"
"I had to own he was right in every feature , and told my wonder ."
`` Ha ! ''
"says he , `` that 's nothing ."
"Would ye believe me now , that before the Act came out , and when there were weepons in this country , I could shoot ?"
"Ay , could I ! ''"
"cries he , and then with a leer : `` If ye had such a thing as a pistol here to try with , I would show ye how it 's done . ''"
"I told him I had nothing of the sort , and gave him a wider berth ."
"If he had known , his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket , and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt ."
"But by the better luck for me , he knew nothing , thought all was covered , and lied on in the dark ."
"He then began to question me cunningly , where I came from , whether I was rich , whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him -LRB- which he declared he had that moment in his sporran -RRB- , and all the time he kept edging up to me and I avoiding him ."
"We were now upon a sort of green cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay , and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel ."
"I had so plainly the upper-hand that my spirits rose , and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of blindman 's buff ; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier , and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff ."
"Ned fell out of a tree , and split his jacket down the back , but suffered no other fracture ."
"Emil and Jack established rival claims to a certain thick patch , and while they were squabbling about it , Stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes and fled to the protection of Dan , who was enjoying himself immensely ."
"The crutch was no longer necessary , and he was delighted to see how strong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture , full of interesting rocks and stumps , with familiar little creatures in the grass , and well-known insects dancing in the air ."
"But of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which befell Nan and Rob was the most exciting , and it long remained one of the favorite histories of the household ."
"Having explored the country pretty generally , torn three rents in her frock , and scratched her face in a barberry-bush , Nan began to pick the berries that shone like big , black beads on the low , green bushes ."
"Her nimble fingers flew , but still her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired , so she kept wandering here and there to search for better places , instead of picking contentedly and steadily as Daisy did ."
"Rob followed Nan , for her energy suited him better than his cousin 's patience , and he too was anxious to have the biggest and best berries for Marmar ."
"`` I keep putting 'em in , but it do n't fill up , and I 'm so tired , '' said Rob , pausing a moment to rest his short legs , and beginning to think huckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it ; for the sun blazed , Nan skipped hither and thither like a grasshopper , and the berries fell out of his pail almost as fast as he put them in , because , in his struggles with the bushes , it was often upside-down ."
`` Last time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great bouncers ; and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire .
"Let 's go and fill our things quick , and then hide in the cave and let the others find us , '' proposed Nan , thirsting for adventures ."
"Rob consented , and away they went , scrambling over the wall and running down the sloping fields on the other side , till they were hidden among the rocks and underbrush ."
"The berries were thick , and at last the pails were actually full ."
"It was shady and cool down there , and a little spring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy cup ."
"`` Now we will go and rest in the cave , and eat our lunch , '' said Nan , well satisfied with her success so far ."
`` Do you know the way ? ''
asked Rob . ''
"` Course I do ; I 've been once , and I always remember ."
Did n't I go and get my box all right ? ''
"That convinced Rob , and he followed blindly as Nan led him over stock and stone , and brought him , after much meandering , to a small recess in the rock , where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made ."
"`` Now , is n't it nice ? ''"
"asked Nan , as she took out a bit of bread-and-butter , rather damaged by being mixed up with nails , fishhooks , stones and other foreign substances , in the young lady 's pocket ."
`` Yes ; do you think they will find us soon ? ''
"asked Rob , who found the shadowy glen rather dull , and began to long for more society ."
"`` No , I do n't ; because if I hear them , I shall hide , and have fun making them find me . ''"
`` P'raps they wo n't come . ''
`` Do n't care ; I can get home myself . ''
`` Is it a great way ? ''
"asked Rob , looking at his little stubby boots , scratched and wet with his long wandering ."
"`` It 's six miles , I guess . ''"
"Nan 's ideas of distance were vague , and her faith in her own powers great ."
"`` I think we better go now , '' suggested Rob , presently ."
`` I sha n't till I have picked over my berries ; '' and Nan began what seemed to Rob an endless task .
`` We 'd like to have him .
"The little wagon is all ready for the girls ; you wo n't mind walking just up to Pennyroyal Hill , will you Aunty ? ''"
`` I should like it exceedingly ; but are you quite sure I shall not be in the way ? ''
"`` Oh , no , indeed !"
"we want you very much ; and the party will be spoilt if you do n't come , '' cried Demi , with great earnestness ."
"`` Thank you kindly , sir ; '' and Aunt Jo made him a grand curtsey , for she liked frolics as well as any of them ."
"`` Now , young ladies , we must not keep them waiting ; on with the hats , and let us be off at once ."
I 'm all impatience to know what the surprise is . ''
"As Mrs. Bhaer spoke every one bustled about , and in five minutes the three little girls and Teddy were packed into the `` clothes-basket , '' as they called the wicker wagon which Toby drew ."
"Demi walked at the head of the procession , and Mrs. Jo brought up the rear , escorted by Kit ."
"It was a most imposing party , I assure you , for Toby had a red feather-duster in his head , two remarkable flags waved over the carriage , Kit had a blue bow on his neck , which nearly drove him wild , Demi wore a nosegay of dandelions in his buttonhole , and Mrs. Jo carried the queer Japanese umbrella in honor of the occasion ."
"The girls had little flutters of excitement all the way ; and Teddy was so charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard , and when it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself , evidently feeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the party ."
"When they came to the hill `` nothing was to be seen but the grass blowing in the wind , '' as the fairy books say , and the children looked disappointed ."
"But Demi said , in his most impressive manner , `` Now , you all get out and stand still , and the surprise party with come in ; '' with which remark he retired behind a rock , over which heads had been bobbing at intervals for the last half-hour ."
"A short pause of intense suspense , and then Nat , Demi , and Tommy marched forth , each bearing a new kite , which they presented to the three young ladies ."
"Shrieks of delight arose , but were silenced by the boys , who said , with faces brimful of merriment , `` That is n't all the surprise ; '' and , running behind the rock , again emerged bearing a fourth kite of superb size , on which was printed , in bright yellow letters , `` For Mother Bhaer . ''"
"`` We thought you 'd like one , too , because you were angry with us , and took the girls ' part , '' cried all three , shaking with laughter , for this part of the affair evidently was a surprise to Mrs. Jo ."
"She clapped her hands , and joined in the laugh , looking thoroughly tickled at the joke ."
"`` Now , boys , that is regularly splendid !"
Who did think of it ? ''
"she asked , receiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did theirs ."
"`` Uncle Fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others ; he said you 'd like it , so we made a bouncer , '' answered Demi , beaming with satisfaction at the success of the plot ."
`` Uncle Fritz knows what I like .
"Yes , these are magnificent kites , and we were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours , were n't we , girls ? ''"
"`` That 's why we made them for you , '' cried Tommy , standing on his head as the most appropriate way of expressing his emotions ."
"`` Let us fly them , '' said energetic Nan ."
"`` I do n't know how , '' began Daisy ."
"`` We 'll show you , we want to ! ''"
"cried all the boys in a burst of devotion , as Demi took Daisy 's , Tommy Nan 's , and Nat , with difficulty , persuaded Bess to let go her little blue one ."
"`` Aunty , if you will wait a minute , we 'll pitch yours for you , '' said Demi , feeling that Mrs. Bhaer 's favor must not be lost again by any neglect of theirs ."
"`` Bless your buttons , dear , I know all about it ; and here is a boy who will toss up for me , '' added Mrs. Jo , as the professor peeped over the rock with a face full of fun ."
"He came out at once , tossed up the big kite , and Mrs. Jo ran off with it in fine style , while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle ."
`` Do n't quarrel about me .
"I shall do well enough , and the scarlet shawl will hide my ugly dress , '' said Merry , from the corner , where she sat waiting for her turn at the mirror ."
"As she spoke of the shawl her eye went in search of it , and something that she saw in the other room put her own disappointment out of her head ."
"Jill lay there all alone , rather tired with the lively chatter , and the effort it cost her not to repine at being shut out from the great delight of dressing up and acting ."
"Her eyes were closed , her net was off , and all the pretty black curls lay about her shoulders as one hand idly pulled them out , while the other rested on the red shawl , as if she loved its glowing color and soft texture ."
"She was humming to herself the little song of the dove and the donjon , and something in the plaintive voice , the solitary figure , went straight to Merry 's gentle heart ."
"`` Poor Jilly ca n't have any of the fun , '' was the first thought ; then came a second , that made Merry start and smile , and in a minute whisper so that all but Jill could hear her , `` Girls , I 'm not going to be the Princess ."
But I 've thought of a splendid one ! ''
`` Who ? ''
"asked the rest , staring at one another , much surprised by this sudden announcement ."
`` Hush !
"Speak low , or you will spoil it all ."
"Look in the Bird Room , and tell me if that is n't a prettier Princess than I could make ? ''"
"They all looked , but no one spoke , and Merry added , with sweet eagerness , `` It is the only thing poor Jill can be , and it would make her so happy ; Jack would like it , and it would please every one , I know ."
"Perhaps she will never walk again , so we ought to be very good to her , poor dear . ''"
"The last words , whispered with a little quiver in the voice , settled the matter better than hours of talking , for girls are tender-hearted creatures , and not one of these but would have gladly given all the pretty things she owned to see Jill dancing about well and strong again ."
"Like a ray of sunshine the kind thought touched and brightened every face ; envy , impatience , vanity , and discontent flew away like imps at the coming of the good fairy , and with one accord they all cried , -- `` It will be lovely ; let us go and tell her ! ''"
"Forgetting their own adornment , out they trooped after Merry , who ran to the sofa , saying , with a smile which was reflected in all the other faces , `` Jill , dear , we have chosen another Princess , and I know you 'll like her . ''"
`` Who is it ? ''
"asked Jill , languidly , opening her eyes without the least suspicion of the truth ."
"`` I 'll show you ; '' and taking the cherished veil from her own head , Merry dropped it like a soft cloud over Jill ; Annette added the long plume , Susy laid the white silk dress about her , while Juliet and Mabel lifted the scarlet shawl to spread it over the foot of the sofa , and Molly tore the last ornament from her turban , a silver star , to shine on Jill 's breast ."
"Then they all took hands and danced round the couch , singing , as they laughed at her astonishment , `` There she is !"
There she is !
Princess Jill as fine as you please !
`` Do you really mean it ?
But can I ?
Is it fair ?
How sweet of you !
Come here and let me hug you all ! ''
"cried Jill , in a rapture at the surprise , and the pretty way in which it was done ."
"The grand scene on the Twenty-second was very fine , indeed ; but the little tableau of that minute was infinitely better , though no one saw it , as Jill tried to gather them all in her arms , for that nosegay of girlish faces was the sweeter , because each one had sacrificed her own little vanity to please a friend , and her joy was reflected in the eyes that sparkled round the happy Princess ."
"`` Oh , you dear , kind things , to think of me and give me all your best clothes !"
"For our Lowland beggars -- even the gownsmen themselves , who beg by patent -- had a louting , flattering way with them , and if you gave them a plaek and asked change , would very civilly return you a boddle ."
"But these Highland beggars stood on their dignity , asked alms only to buy snuff -LRB- by their account -RRB- and would give no change ."
"To be sure , this was no concern of mine , except in so far as it entertained me by the way ."
"What was much more to the purpose , few had any English , and these few -LRB- unless they were of the brotherhood of beggars -RRB- not very anxious to place it at my service ."
"I knew Torosay to be my destination , and repeated the name to them and pointed ; but instead of simply pointing in reply , they would give me a screed of the Gaelic that set me foolish ; so it was small wonder if I went out of my road as often as I stayed in it ."
"At last , about eight at night , and already very weary , I came to a lone house , where I asked admittance , and was refused , until I bethought me of the power of money in so poor a country , and held up one of my guineas in my finger and thumb ."
"Thereupon , the man of the house , who had hitherto pretended to have no English , and driven me from his door by signals , suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful , and agreed for five shillings to give me a night 's lodging and guide me the next day to Torosay ."
"I slept uneasily that night , fearing I should be robbed ; but I might have spared myself the pain ; for my host was no robber , only miserably poor and a great cheat ."
"He was not alone in his poverty ; for the next morning , we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a rich man to have one of my guineas changed ."
"This was perhaps a rich man for Mull ; he would have scarce been thought so in the south ; for it took all he had -- the whole house was turned upside down , and a neighbour brought under contribution , before he could scrape together twenty shillings in silver ."
"The odd shilling he kept for himself , protesting he could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying `` locked up . ''"
"For all that he was very courteous and well spoken , made us both sit down with his family to dinner , and brewed punch in a fine china bowl , over which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start ."
"I was for getting angry , and appealed to the rich man -LRB- Hector Maclean was his name -RRB- , who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment of the five shillings ."
"But Maclean had taken his share of the punch , and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was brewed ; so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear Jacobite toasts and Gaelic songs , till all were tipsy and staggered off to the bed or the barn for their night 's rest ."
"Next day -LRB- the fourth of my travels -RRB- we were up before five upon the clock ; but my rascal guide got to the bottle at once , and it was three hours before I had him clear of the house , and then -LRB- as you shall hear -RRB- only for a worse disappointment ."
"As long as we went down a heathery valley that lay before Mr. Maclean 's house , all went well ; only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder , and when I asked him the cause , only grinned at me ."
"No sooner , however , had we crossed the back of a hill , and got out of sight of the house windows , than he told me Torosay lay right in front , and that a hill-top -LRB- which he pointed out -RRB- was my best landmark ."
"`` I care very little for that , '' said I , `` since you are going with me . ''"
The impudent cheat answered me in the Gaelic that he had no English .
"`` My fine fellow , '' I said , `` I know very well your English comes and goes ."
Tell me what will bring it back ?
Is it more money you wish ? ''
"`` Five shillings mair , '' said he , `` and hersel ' will bring ye there . ''"
"I reflected awhile and then offered him two , which he accepted greedily , and insisted on having in his hands at once `` for luck , '' as he said , but I think it was rather for my misfortune ."
"The two shillings carried him not quite as many miles ; at the end of which distance , he sat down upon the wayside and took off his brogues from his feet , like a man about to rest ."
I was now red-hot .
`` Ha ! ''
"said I , `` have you no more English ? ''"
"He said impudently , `` No . ''"
"At that I boiled over , and lifted my hand to strike him ; and he , drawing a knife from his rags , squatted back and grinned at me like a wildcat ."
"At that , forgetting everything but my anger , I ran in upon him , put aside his knife with my left , and struck him in the mouth with the right ."
"I was a strong lad and very angry , and he but a little man ; and he went down before me heavily ."
"So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he took, he still spilt one drop on the horse's flank. So it became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop, the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam safe to land. But when the Trolls came to the lake, they lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled till they burst."
"""Now we're rid of them,"" said the Horse."
"So when they had gone a long, long while, they came to a green patch in a wood."
"""Now, strip off all your arms,"" said the Horse, ""and only put on your ragged clothes, and take the saddle off me, and let me loose, and hang all my clothing and your arms up inside that great hollow lime-tree yonder. Then make yourself a wig of fir-moss, and go up to the king's palace, which lies close here, and ask for a place."
"Whenever you need me, only come here and shake the bridle, and I'll come to you."""
"Yes! the lad did all his Horse told him, and as soon as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly, and pale, and miserable to look at, no one would have known him again. Then he went up to the king's palace and begged first for leave to be in the kitchen, and bring in wood and water for the cook, but then the kitchen-maid asked him:"
"""Why do you wear that ugly wig? Off with it. I won't have such a fright in here."""
"""No, I can't do that,"" said the lad; ""for I'm not quite right in my head."""
"""Do you think then I'll have you in here about the food,"" cried the cook. ""Away with you to the coachman; you're best fit to go and clean the stable."""
"But when the coachman begged him to take his wig off, he got the same answer, and he wouldn't have him either."
"""You'd best go down to the gardener,"" said he; ""you're best fit to go about and dig in the garden."""
"So he got leave to be with the gardener, but none of the other servants would sleep with him, and so he had to sleep by himself under the steps of the summer-house. It stood upon beams, and had a high staircase. Under that he got some turf for his bed, and there he lay as well as he could."
"So, when he had been some time at the palace, it happened one morning, just as the sun rose, that the lad had taken off his wig, and stood and washed himself, and then he was so handsome, it was a joy to look at him."
"So the Princess saw from her window the lovely gardener's boy, and thought she had never seen any one so handsome. Then she asked the gardener why he lay out there under the steps."
"""Oh,"" said the gardener, ""none of his fellow-servants will sleep with him; that's why."""
"""Let him come up to-night, and lie at the door inside my bedroom, and then they'll not refuse to sleep with him any more,"" said the Princess."
So the gardener told that to the lad.
"""Do you think I'll do any such thing?"" said the lad. ""Why they'd say next there was something between me and the Princess."""
"""Yes,"" said the gardener, ""you've good reason to fear any such thing, you who are so handsome."""
"""Well, well,"" said the lad, ""since it's her will, I suppose I must go."""
"So, when he was to go up the steps in the evening, he tramped and stamped so on the way, that they had to beg him to tread softly lest the King should come to know it. So he came into the Princess' bedroom, lay down, and began to snore at once. Then the Princess said to her maid:"
"""Go gently, and just pull his wig off;"" and she went up to him."
"But just as she was going to whisk it off, he caught hold of it with both hands, and said she should never have it. After that he lay down again, and began to snore. Then the Princess gave her maid a wink, and this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad so lovely, and white and red, just as the Princess had seen him in the morning sun."
After that the lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom.
"But it wasn't long before the King came to hear how the gardener's lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom; and he got so wroth he almost took the lad's life. He didn't do that, however, but he threw him into the prison tower; and as for his daughter, he shut her up in her own room, whence she never got leave to stir day or night."
"All that she begged, and all that she prayed, for the lad and herself, was no good. The King was only more wroth than ever."
"Some time after came a war and uproar in the land, and the King had to take up arms against another king who wished to take the kingdom from him. So when the lad heard that, he begged the gaoler to go to the King and ask for a coat of mail and a sword, and for leave to go to the war. All the rest laughed when the gaoler told his errand, and begged the King to let him have an old worn-out suit, that they might have the fun of seeing such a wretch in battle. So he got that, and an old broken-down hack besides, which went upon three legs, and dragged the fourth after it."
"Then they went out to meet the foe; but they hadn't got far from the palace before the lad got stuck fast in a bog with his hack. There he sat and dug his spurs in, and cried, ""Gee up! gee up!"" to his hack."
"And all the rest had their fun out of this, and laughed, and made game of the lad as they rode past him. But they were scarcely gone, before he ran to the lime-tree, threw on his coat of mail, and shook the bridle, and there came the Horse in a trice, and said: ""Do now your best, and I'll do mine."""
"But when the lad came up the battle had begun, and the King was in a sad pinch; but no sooner had the lad rushed into the thick of it than the foe was beaten back, and put to flight. The King and his men wondered and wondered who it could be who had come to help them, but none of them got so near him as to be able to talk to him, and as soon as the fight was over he was gone. When they went back, there sat the lad still in the bog, and dug his spurs into his three-legged hack, and they all laughed again."
And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.
"Jane said so, but George said, ""Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute."""
"The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the cold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made of one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the great white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an enormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the stalks of tall lilies."
"And as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a hurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the flame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping, scrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even walking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires and danced around in a ring."
"""It's bears,"" said Jane. ""I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come; and my boots are so wet."""
"The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of furry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the middle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur dresses, and the white silence was quite gone."
"""Bears, indeed,"" cried a shrill voice. ""You'll wish we were bears before you've done with us."""
"This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children had only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began to be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference between ""lawn"" and ""grass"" did not seem so great as it had at Forest Hill."
"Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So that these people had never seen anyone cry before."
"""Don't cry for real,"" whispered George, ""or you'll get chilblains in your eyes. But pretend to howl it frightens them."""
"So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It always does when you begin to pretend. You try it."
"Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane, George said: ""Yah who's afraid? We are George and Jane who are you?"""
"""We are the sealskin dwarfs,"" said the brown people, twisting their furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in kaleidoscopes. ""We are very precious and expensive, for we are made, throughout, of the very best sealskin."""
"""And what are those fires for?"" bellowed George for Jane was crying louder and louder."
"""Those,"" shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, ""are the fires we make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now so he sleeps curled up around the Pole but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and go and eat everybody in the world except us."""
"""WHATEVER DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO THAT FOR?"" yelled George."
"""Oh just for spite,"" bawled the dwarfs carelessly as if they were saying, ""Just for fun."""
"Jane stopped crying to say: ""You are heartless."""
"""No, we aren't,"" they said. ""Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin, just like little fat sealskin purses """
"And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads were like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their hands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were like seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin."
"""Thank you so much for telling us,"" said George. ""Good evening. (Keep on howling, Jane!)"""
"But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the muttering stopped and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid to howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white silence better."
"Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: ""What's that on your head?"""
And George felt it was all up for he knew it was his father's sealskin cap.
"The dwarf did not wait for an answer. ""It's made of one of us,"" he screamed, ""or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your fate is sealed!"""
"Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt that their fate was sealed indeed."
"The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole."
"You have no idea how cold it was the kind of cold that makes you feel small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of."
"The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very close and said: ""Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you."""
"The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and colder."
"""We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one comfort,"" said George. ""We shall be turned into ice long before that."""
"""Perhaps,"" was the answer. ""But until you do feel it you can never understand it, for it is not like any other feeling that there is."""
"Then they all started for a low clump of bushes to find shelter from the storm. Once they were frightened by seeing a great creature come tramping through the woods towards them. ""A man!"" said Mr. Grouse."
"""Hide!"" said Mrs. Grouse, and each little Grouse hid under the leaves so quickly that nobody could see how it was done. One might almost think that a strong wind had blown them away. The mother pretended that she had a broken wing, and hopped away, making such pitiful sounds that the man followed to pick her up. When she had led him far from her children, she, too, made a quick run and hid herself; and although the man hunted everywhere, he could not find a single bird."
"You know that is always the way in Grouse families, and even if the man's foot had stirred the leaves under which a little one was hiding, the Grouse would not have moved or made a sound. The children are brought up to mind without asking any questions. When their mother says, ""Hide!"" they do it, and never once ask ""Why?"" or answer, ""As soon as I have swallowed this berry."" It is no wonder that the older ones are proud of their children. Any mother would be made happy by having one child obey like that, and think of having twelve!"
"At last, the whole family reached the bushes where they were to stay, and then they began to feed near by. ""Eat all you can,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""before the snow gets deep. You may not have another such good chance for many days."" So they ate until their little stomachs would not hold one more seed or evergreen bud."
"All this time the snowflakes were falling, but the Grouse children were no longer afraid of them. Sometimes they even chased and snapped at them as they would at a fly in summer-time. It was then, too, that they learned to use snow-shoes. The oldest child had made a great fuss when he found a fringe of hard points growing around his toes in the fall, and had run peeping to his mother to ask her what was the matter. She had shown him her own feet, and had told him how all the Ruffed Grouse have snow-shoes of that kind grow on their feet every winter."
"""We do not have to bother about them at all,"" she said. ""They put themselves on when the weather gets cold in the fall, and they take themselves off when spring comes. We each have a new pair every year, and when they are grown we can walk easily over the soft snow. Without them we should sink through and flounder."""
"When night came they all huddled under the bushes, lying close together to keep each other warm. The next day they burrowed into a snow-drift and made a snug place there which was even better than the one they left; the soft white coverlet kept the wind out so well. It was hard for the little ones to keep quiet long, and to amuse them Mr. Grouse told how he first met their mother in the spring."
"""It was a fine, sunshiny day,"" he said, ""and everybody was happy. I had for some time been learning to drum, and now I felt that I was as good a drummer as there was in the forest. So I found a log (every Ruffed Grouse has to have his own place, you know) and I jumped up on it and strutted back and forth with my head high in the air. It was a dusky part of the forest and I could not see far, yet I knew that a beautiful young Grouse was somewhere near, and I hoped that if I drummed very well she might come to me."""
"""I know!"" interrupted one of the little Grouse. ""It was our mother."""
"""Well, it wasn't your mother then, my chick,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""for that was long, long before you were hatched."""
"""She was our mother afterwards, anyway,"" cried the young Grouse. ""I just know she was!"""
"Mr. Grouse's eyes twinkled, but he went gravely on. ""At last I flapped my wing's hard and fast, and the soft drumming sound could be heard far and near. 'Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump; thump-thump-rup-rup-rup-rup-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.' I waited, but nobody came. Then I drummed again, and after that I was sure that I heard a rustling in the leaves. I drummed a third time, and then, children, there came the beautiful young Grouse, breaking her way through the thicket and trying to look as though she didn't know that I was there."""
"""Did she know?"" cried the little Grouse."
"""You must ask your mother that,"" he answered, ""for it was she who came."
"Ah, what happy days we had together all spring! We wandered all through this great Forest and even made some journeys into the edge of the Meadow. Still, there was no place we loved as we did the dusky hollow by the old log where we first met. One day your mother told me that she must begin housekeeping and that I must keep out of the way while she was busy. So I had to go off with a crowd of other Ruffed Grouse while she fixed her nest, laid her eggs, and hatched out you youngsters. It was rather hard to be driven off in that way, but you know it is the custom among Grouse. We poor fellows had to amuse ourselves and each other until our wives called us home to help take care of the children."
"We've been at that work ever since."""
"""Oh!"" said one of the young Grouse. ""Oh, I am so glad that you drummed, and that she came when she heard you. Who would we have had to take care of us if it hadn't happened just so?"""
"That made them all feel very solemn and Mr. Grouse couldn't answer, and Mrs. Grouse couldn't answer, and none of the little Grouse could answer because, you see, it is one of the questions that hasn't any answer."
"Still, they were all there and happy, so they didn't bother their crested heads about it very long."
A MILD DAY IN WINTER
"It had been a cold and windy winter. Day after day the storm-clouds had piled up in the northwest and spread slowly over the sky, dropping great ragged flakes of snow down to the shivering earth. Then the forest trees were clothed in fleecy white garments, and the branches of the evergreens drooped under their heavy cloak."
"Then there had been other days, when a strong wind stripped the trees of their covering, and brought with it thousands of small, hard flakes."
"These flakes were drier than the ragged ones had been, and did not cling so lovingly to everything they touched. They would rather frolic on the ground, rising again and again from their resting-places to dance around with the wind, and help make great drifts and overhanging ledges of snow in the edge of the Forest, where there was more open ground."
"It is true that not all the winter had been cold and stormy. There were times when the drifts melted slowly into the earth, and the grass, which last summer had been so tender and green, showed brown and matted on the ground. Still the Great Horned Owl and his wife could not find enough to eat. ""We do not mean to complain,"" said he with dignity, as he scratched one ear with his feathered right foot, ""but neither of us has had a meal hearty enough for a healthy Robin, since the first heavy snow came."""
"This was when he was talking to his cousin, the Screech Owl. ""Hearty enough for a Robin!"" exclaimed Mrs. Great Horned Owl. ""I should say we hadn't. I don't think I have had enough for a Goldfinch, and that is pretty hard for a bird of my size. I am so thin that my feathers feel loose."""
"""Have you been so hungry that you dreamed about food?"" asked the Screech Owl."
"""N-no, I can't say that I have,"" said the Great Horned Owl, while his wife shook her head solemnly."
"""Ah, that is dreadful,"" said the Screech Owl. ""I have done that several times. Only yesterday, while I lay in my nest-hollow, I dreamed that I was hunting. There was food everywhere, but just as I flew down to eat, it turned into pieces of ice. When I awakened I was almost starved and so cold that my beak chattered."""
"It was only a few days after the Screech Owl's call upon his cousins that he awakened one night to find the weather milder, and the ground covered with only a thin coating of soft snow. The beautiful round moon was shining down upon him, and in the western sky the clouds were still red from the rays of the setting sun."
"Somewhere, far beyond the fields and forests of this part of the world, day-birds were beginning to stir, and thousands of downy heads were drawn from under sheltering wings, while in the barnyards the Cocks were calling their welcome to the sun. But the Screech Owl did not think of this. He aroused his wife and they went hunting. When they came back they did not dream about food. They had eaten all that they could, and the Great Horned Owl and his wife had made a meal hearty enough for a dozen Robins, and a whole flock of Goldfinches. It was a good thing for the day-birds that this was so, for it is said that sometimes, when food is very scarce, Owls have been known to hunt by daylight."
"But at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and they saw that it was a dragon exactly the size of the dining room at home."
"So then they knew that all was lost. The dragon swooped down and caught the two children in his claws; he caught Effie by her green silk sash, and Harry by the little point at the back of his Eton jacket and then, spreading his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage when the brake is hard on."
"""Oh, Harry,"" said Effie, ""I wonder when he will eat us!"" The dragon was flying across woods and fields with great flaps of his wings that carried him a quarter of a mile at each flap."
"Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges and rivers and churches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than you see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train."
"And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air as they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily."
"""He knows where he wants to go,"" said Harry. ""Oh, if he would only drop us before he gets there!"""
"But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at last, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a rattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there on his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath, because he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket."
"Then Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her birthday. It had cost only sixpence to begin with, and she had had it a month, and it never could sharpen anything but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed to make that knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving the dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That knife would never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though, and when Effie had tried for some time she saw that this was so and gave it up. But with her help Harry managed to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that the dragon had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children crept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It was much too narrow for the dragon to get in also, so they stayed in there and waited to make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and begin to think about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they made faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them, but they ran farther into the cave so that he could not reach them, and when he was tired of blowing he went away."
"But they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they went farther in, and presently the cave opened out and grew bigger, and the floor was soft sand, and when they had come to the very end of the cave there was a door, and on it was written: UNIVERSAL TAPROOM. PRIVATE. NO ONE ALLOWED INSIDE."
"So they opened the door at once just to peep in, and then they remembered what St. George had said."
"""We can't be worse off than we are,"" said Harry, ""with a dragon waiting for us outside. Let's go in."""
"They went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door behind them."
"And now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid rock, and all along one side of the room were taps, and all the taps were labeled with china labels like you see in baths. And as they could both read words of two syllables or even three sometimes, they understood at once that they had gotten to the place where the weather is turned on from. There were six big taps labeled ""Sunshine,"" ""Wind,"" ""Rain,"" ""Snow,"" ""Hail,"" ""Ice,"""
"and a lot of little ones, labeled ""Fair to moderate,"" ""Showery,"" ""South breeze,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" ""Skating,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""South wind,"" ""East wind,"" and so on. And the big tap labeled ""Sunshine"" was turned full on. They could not see any sunshine the cave was lighted by a skylight of blue glass so they supposed the sunlight was pouring out by some other way, as it does with the tap that washes out the underneath parts of patent sinks in kitchens."
"Then they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass, and when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in the world and all at once, too, which is not like most looking glasses."
"They saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County Council offices, and they saw St. George asleep under the dragonproof veil. And they saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out in the dreadful, dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had eaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a great puzzle map green in the field parts and brown in the towns, and black in the places where they make coal and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All over it, on the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there was a network of green dragons. And they could see that it was still broad daylight, and no dragons had gone to bed yet."
"Effie said, ""Dragons do not like cold."" And she tried to turn off the sunshine, but the tap was out of order, and that was why there had been so much hot weather, and why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So they left the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and left the tap full on while they went to look in the glass. There they saw the dragons running all sorts of ways like ants if you are cruel enough to pour water into an ant-heap, which, of course, you never are. And the snow fell more and more."
"Then Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently the dragons began to wriggle less, and by-and-by some of them lay quite still, so the children knew the water had put out the fires inside them, and they were dead. So then they turned on the hail only half on, for fear of breaking people's windows and after a while there were no more dragons to be seen moving."
Then the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers of their country.
"""They will put up a monument to us,"" said Harry, ""as high as Nelson's!"
"All the dragons are dead."""
"""I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!"" said Effie."
"""And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with such a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them, and they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the rain would wash them off into the sea."""
"But this did not happen, and the children began to feel that they had not been so frightfully clever after all."
"""I wonder what this old thing's for,"" said Harry. He had found a rusty old tap, which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. Its china label was quite coated over with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had cleaned it with a bit of her skirt for curiously enough both the children had come out without pocket handkerchiefs she found that the label said ""Waste."""
"""Let's turn it on,"" she said. ""It might carry off the dragons."""
"The tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time, but together they managed to turn it on, and then ran to the mirror to see what happened."
"Already a great, round black hole had opened in the very middle of the map of England, and the sides of the map were tilting themselves up, so that the rain ran down toward the hole."
"""Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"" cried Effie, and she hurried back to the taps and turned on everything that seemed wet. ""Showery,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" and even ""South"" and ""South-West,"" because she had heard her father say that those winds brought rain."
"And now the floods of rain were pouring down on the country, and great sheets of water flowed toward the center of the map, and cataracts of water poured into the great round hole in the middle of the map, and the dragons were being washed away and disappearing down the waste pipe in great green masses and scattered green shoals single dragons and dragons by the dozen; of all sizes, from the ones that carry off elephants down to the ones that get in your tea."
"Presently there was not a dragon left. So then they turned off the tap named ""Waste,"" and they half-turned off the one labeled ""Sunshine"" it was broken, so that they could not turn it off altogether and they turned on ""Fair to moderate"" and ""Showery"" and both taps stuck, so that they could not be turned off, which accounts for our climate."
"From this on to the Revolution, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nova Scotia became a royal province. Nova Scotia is that way yet, and has to go to Boston for her groceries."
"The year 1692 is noted mostly for the Salem excitement regarding witchcraft. The children of Rev. Mr. Parris were attacked with some peculiar disease which would not yield to the soothing blisters and bleedings administered by the physicians of the old school, and so, not knowing exactly what to do about it, the doctors concluded that they were bewitched. Then it was, of course, the duty of the courts and selectmen to hunt up the witches. This was naturally difficult."
"Fifty-five persons were tortured and twenty were hanged for being witches; which proves that the people of Salem were fully abreast of the Indians in intelligence, and that their gospel privileges had not given their charity and Christian love such a boom as they should have done."
"One can hardly be found now, even in Salem, who believes in witchcraft; though the Cape Cod people, it is said, still spit on their bait. The belief in witchcraft in those days was not confined by any means to the colonists. Sir Matthew Hale of England, one of the most enlightened judges of the mother-country, condemned a number of people for the offence, and is now engaged in doing road-work on the streets of the New Jerusalem as a punishment for these acts done while on the woolsack."
"Blackstone himself, one of the dullest authors ever read by the writer of these lines, yet a skilled jurist, with a marvellous memory regarding Justinian, said that, to deny witchcraft was to deny revelation."
"""Be you a witch?"" asked one of the judges of Massachusetts, according to the records now on file in the State-House at Boston."
"""No, your honor,"" was the reply."
"""Officer,"" said the court, taking a pinch of snuff, ""take her out on the tennis-grounds and pull out her toe-nails with a pair of hot pincers, and then see what she says."""
"It was quite common to examine lady witches in the regular court and then adjourn to the tennis-court. A great many were ducked by order of the court and hanged up by the thumbs, in obedience to the customs of these people who came to America because they were persecuted."
"Human nature is the same even to this day. The writer grew up with an Irishman who believed that when a man got wealthy enough to keep a carriage and coachman he ought to be assassinated and all his goods given to the poor. He now hires a coachman himself, having succeeded in New York city as a policeman; but the man who comes to assassinate him will find it almost impossible to obtain an audience with him."
"If you wish to educate a man to be a successful oppressor, with a genius for introducing new horrors and novelties in pain, oppress him early in life and don't give him any reason for doing so. The idea that ""God is love"" was not popular in those days. The early settlers were so stern even with their own children that if the Indian had not given the forefather something to attract his attention, the boy crop would have been very light."
"Even now the philosopher is led to ask, regarding the boasted freedom of America, why some measures are not taken to put large fly-screens over it."
CHAPTER VI.
THE EPISODE OF THE CHARTER OAK.
The Colonies of Maine and New Hampshire were so closely associated with that of Massachusetts that their history up to 1820 was practically the same.
"Shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims, say two years or thereabouts, Gorges and Mason obtained from England the grant of a large tract lying between the Merrimac and Kennebec Rivers. This patent was afterwards dissolved, Mason taking what is now New Hampshire, and Gorges taking Maine. He afterwards sold the State to Massachusetts for six thousand dollars. The growth of the State may be noticed since that time, for one county cost more than that last November."
"In 1820 Maine was separated from Massachusetts. Maine is noted for being the easternmost State in the Union, and has been utilized by a number of eminent men as a birthplace. White-birch spools for thread, Christmas-trees, and tamarack and spruce-gum are found in great abundance. It is the home of an industrious and peace-loving people."
Bar Harbor is a cool place to go to in summer-time and violate the liquor law of the State.
"The Dutch were first to claim Connecticut. They built a trading-post at Hartford, where they swapped bone collar-buttons with the Indians for beaver-and otter-skins. Traders from Plymouth who went up the river were threatened by the Dutch, but they pressed on and established a post at Windsor."
"In 1635, John Steele led a company ""out west"" to Hartford, and Thomas Hooker, a clergyman, followed with his congregation, driving their stock before them. Hartford thus had quite a boom quite early in the seventeenth century. The Dutch were driven out of the Connecticut Valley, and began to look towards New York."
"Soon after this the Pequod War broke out. These Indians had hoped to form an alliance with the Narragansetts, but Roger Williams prevented this by seeing the Narragansett chief personally. Thus the Puritans had coals of fire heaped on their heads by their gentle pastor, until the odor of burning hair could be detected as far away as New Haven."
"The Pequods were thus compelled to fight alone, and Captain Mason by a coup d'état surrounded their camp before daylight and entered the palisades with the Indian picket, who cried out ""Owanux! Owanux!"""
"meaning ""Englishmen. Englishmen."" Mason and his men killed these Pequods and burned their lodges to the ground. There has never been a prosperous Pequod lodge since. Those who escaped to the forest were shot down like jack-rabbits as they fled, and there has been no Pequoding done since that time."
"The New Haven Colony was founded in 1638 by wealthy church members from abroad. They took the Bible as their standard and statute. They had no other law. Only church members could vote, which was different from the arrangements in New York City in after-years."
"The Connecticut Colony had a regular constitution, said to have been the first written constitution ever adopted by the people, framed for the people by the people. It was at once prosperous, and soon bought out the Saybrook Colony."
"In 1662 a royal charter was obtained which united the two above colonies and guaranteed to the people the rights agreed upon by them. It amounted to a duly-authenticated independence. A quarter of a century afterwards Governor Andros, in his other clothes and a reigning coat of red and gold trimmings, marched into the Assembly and demanded this precious charter."
"Cornwallis in this Virginia and Southern trip destroyed ten million dollars' worth of property, and then fortified himself at Yorktown."
"Washington decided to besiege Yorktown, and, making a feint to fool Clinton, set out for that place, visiting Mount Vernon en route after an absence of six and a half years, though only stopping two days."
"Washington was a soldier in the true sense, and, when a lad, was given a little hatchet by his father. George cut down some cherry-trees with this, in order to get the cherries without climbing the trees. One day his father discovered that the trees had been cut down, and spoke of it to the lad."
"""Yes,"" said George, ""I did it with my little hatchet; but I would rather cut down a thousand cherry-trees and tell the truth about it than be punished for it."""
"""Well said, my brave boy!"" exclaimed the happy father as he emptied George's toy bank into his pocket in payment for the trees. ""You took the words right out of my mouth."""
"In speaking of the siege of Yorktown, the historian says, ""The most hearty good will prevailed."" What more could you expect of a siege than that?"
"Cornwallis capitulated October 19. It was the most artistic capitulation he had ever given. The troops were arranged in two lines facing each other, British and American with their allies the French under Rochambeau."
"People came from all over the country who had heard of Cornwallis and his wonderful genius as a capitulator. They came for miles, and brought their lunches with them; but the general, who felt an unnecessary pique towards Washington, refused to take part in the exercises himself, claiming that by the advice of his physicians he would have to remain in his tent, as they feared that he had over-capitulated himself already."
"He therefore sent his sword by General O'Hara, and Washington turned it over to Lincoln, who had been obliged to surrender to the English at Charleston."
"The news reached Philadelphia in the night, and when the watchman cried, ""Past two o'clock, and Cornwallis is taken!"" the people arose and went and prayed and laughed like lunatics, for they regarded the war as virtually ended. The old door-keeper of Congress died of delight. Thanks were returned to Almighty God, and George Washington's nomination was a sure thing."
"England decided that whoever counselled war any further was a public enemy, and Lord North, then prime minister, when he heard of the surrender of Cornwallis through a New York paper, exclaimed, ""Oh, God!"
"it is all over!"""
"Washington now showed his sagacity in quelling the fears of the soldiers regarding their back pay. He was invited to become king, but, having had no practice, and fearing that he might run against a coup d'état or faux pas, he declined, and spoke kindly against taking violent measures."
"In 1783, September 3, a treaty of peace was signed in Paris, and Washington, delivering the most successful farewell address ever penned, retired to Mount Vernon, where he began at once to enrich his farm with the suggestions he had received during his absence, and to calmly take up the life that had been interrupted by the tedious and disagreeable war."
"The country was free and independent, but, oh, how ignorant it was about the science of government! The author does not wish to be personal when he states that the country at that time did not know enough about affairs to carry water for a circus elephant."
"It was heavily in debt, with no power to raise money. New England refused to pay her poll-tax, and a party named Shays directed his hired man to overturn the government; but a felon broke out on his thumb, and before he could put it down the crisis was averted and the country saved."
CHAPTER XIX.
THE FIRST PRESIDENT.
"It now became the duty of the new republic to seek out the man to preside over it, and George Washington seems to have had no rivals. He rather reluctantly left his home at Mount Vernon, where he was engaged in trying the rotation of crops, and solemnly took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which had been adopted September 17, 1787. His trip in April, 1789, from Mount Vernon to the seat of government in New York was a simple but beautiful ovation."
"Everybody tried to make it pleasant for him. He was asked at all the towns to build there, and 'most everybody wanted him ""to come and make their house his home."" When he got to the ferry he was not pushed off into the water by commuters, but lived to reach the Old Federal Hall, where he was sworn in."
"In 1791 the seat of government was removed to Philadelphia, where it remained for ten years, after which the United States took advantage of the Homestead Act and located on a tract of land ten miles square, known as the District of Columbia. In 1846 that part of the District lying on the Virginia side of the Potomac was ceded back to the State."
"President Washington did not have to escape from the capital to avoid office-seekers. He could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight. He could remain in the forest back of his house until Martha blew the horn signifying that the man who wanted the post-office at Pigback had gone, and then he could return."
"How times have changed with the growth of the republic! Now Pigback has grown so that the name has been changed to Hogback, and the President avails himself of every funeral that he can possibly feel an interest in, to leave the swarm of jobless applicants who come to pester him to death for appointments."
The historian begs leave to say here that the usefulness of the President for the good of his country and the consideration of greater questions will some day be reduced to very little unless he may be able to avoid this effort to please voters who overestimate their greatness.
"It is said that Washington had no library, which accounted for his originality. He was a vestryman in the Episcopal Church; and to see his tall and graceful form as he moved about from pew to pew collecting pence for Home Missions, was a lovely sight."
As a boy he was well behaved and a careful student.
"At one time he was given a hatchet by his father, which"
But what has the historian to do with this morbid wandering in search of truth?
150 The Old Beggar-Woman
"There was once an old woman, but thou hast surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now? This woman begged likewise, and when she got anything she said, “May God reward you.” The beggar-woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself. The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door, “Come, old mother, and warm yourself.” She came in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began to burn, and she was not aware of it. The boy stood and saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out. Is it not true that he ought to have put them out? And if he had not any water, then should he have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them."
151 The Three Sluggards
"A certain King had three sons who were all equally dear to him, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death. When the time came when he was about to die, he summoned them to his bedside and said, “Dear children, I have been thinking of something which I will declare unto you; whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom.” The eldest said, “Then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye, I will not open it that I may sleep.” The second said; “Father, the kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am sitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg.” The third said, “Father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to be hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope, I would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope.” When the father heard that, he said, “Thou hast carried it the farthest, and shalt be King.”"
151* The Twelve Idle Servants
"Twelve servants who had done nothing all the day would not exert themselves at night either, but laid themselves on the grass and boasted of their idleness. The first said, “What is your laziness to me, I have to concern myself about mine own? The care of my body is my principal work, I eat not a little and drink still more. When I have had four meals, I fast a short time until I feel hunger again, and that suits me best. To rise betimes is not for me; when it is getting near mid-day, I already seek out a resting-place for myself. If the master call, I do exactly as if I had not heard him, and if he call for the second time, I wait awhile before I get up, and go to him very slowly."
In this way life is endurable.”
"The second said, “I have a horse to look after, but I leave the bit in his mouth, and if I do not want to do it, I give him no food, and I say he has had it already. I, however, lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours. After this I stretch out one foot and move it a couple of times over the horse’s body, and then he is combed and cleaned. Who is going to make a great business of that? Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me.”"
"The third said, “Why plague oneself with work? Nothing comes of it! I laid myself in the sun, and fell asleep. It began to rain a little, but why should I get up? I let it rain on in God’s name. At last came a splashing shower, so heavy indeed, that it pulled the hair out of my head and washed it away, and I got a hole in the skull; I put a plaster on it, and then it was all right. I have already had several injuries of that kind.”"
"The fourth said, “If I am to undertake a piece of work, I first loiter about for an hour that I may save up my strength. After that I begin quite slowly, and ask if no one is there who could help me. Then I let him do the chief of the work, and in reality only look on; but that also is still too much for me.”"
"The fifth said, “What does that matter? Just think, I am to take away the manure from the horse’s stable, and load the cart with it. I let it go on slowly, and if I have taken anything on the fork, I only half-raise it up, and then I rest just a quarter of an hour until I quite throw it in. It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day. I have no fancy for killing myself with work.”"
"The sixth said, “Shame on ye; I am afraid of no work, but I lie down for three weeks, and never once take my clothes off. What is the use of buckling your shoes on? For aught I care they may fall off my feet, it is no matter. If I am going up some steps, I drag one foot slowly after the other on to the first step, and then I count the rest of them that I may know where I must rest.”"
"The seventh said, “That will not do with me; my master looks after my work, only he is not at home the whole day. But I neglect nothing, I run as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls. If I am to get on, four sturdy men must push me with all their might. I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other. I lay down by them and slept too. There was no wakening me again, and when they wanted to have me home, they had to carry me.” The eighth said, “I see plainly that I am the only active fellow; if a stone lie before me, I do not give myself the trouble to raise my legs and step over it. I lay myself down on the ground, and if I am wet and covered with mud and dirt, I stay lying until the sun has dried me again. At the very most, I only turn myself so that it can shine on me.” The ninth said, “That is the right way! To-day the bread was before me, but I was too idle to take it, and nearly died of hunger! Moreover a jug stood by it, but it was so big and heavy that I did not like to lift it up, and preferred bearing thirst. Just to turn myself round was too much for me, I remained lying like a log the whole day.” The tenth said, “Laziness has brought misfortune on me, a broken leg and swollen calf. Three of us were lying in the road, and I had my legs stretched out. Some one came with a cart, and the wheels went over me. I might indeed have drawn my legs back, but I did not hear the cart coming, for the midges were humming about my ears, and creeping in at my nose and out again at my mouth; who can take the trouble to drive the vermin away?”"
"The eleventh said, “I gave up my place yesterday. I had no fancy for carrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away again. There was no end of it all day long. But to tell the truth, he gave me my dismissal, and would not keep me any longer, for his clothes, which I had left lying in the dust, were all moth-eaten, and I am very glad of it.”"
"The twelfth said, “To-day I had to drive the cart into the country, and made myself a bed of straw on it, and had a good sleep. The reins slipped out of my hand, and when I awoke, the horse had nearly torn itself loose, the harness was gone, the strap which fastened the horse to the shafts was gone, and so were the collar, the bridle and bit."
"Some one had come by, who had carried all off. Besides this, the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast. I left it standing, and stretched myself on the straw again. At last the master came himself, and pushed the cart out, and if he had not come I should not be lying here but there, and sleeping in full tranquillity.”"
152 The Shepherd Boy
"There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question. The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy. Then he said to him, “If thou canst give me an answer to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shalt dwell with me in my royal palace.” The boy said, “What are the three questions?” The King said, “The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?” The shepherd boy answered, “Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.” The King said, “The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?” The shepherd boy said, “Give me a great sheet of white paper,” and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight. Then he said, “There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.”"
"But no one was able to do it. The King said, “The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.” Then said the shepherd boy, “In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles and a half high, two miles and a half wide, and two miles and a half in depth; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.”"
"The King said, “Thou hast answered the three questions like a wise man, and shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.”"
153 The Star-Money
"There was once on a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her. She was, however, good and pious."
"And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God. Then a poor man met her, who said, “Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!” She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, “May God bless it to thy use,” and went onwards. Then came a child who moaned and said, “My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.” So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also. At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself, “It is a dark night and no one sees thee, thou canst very well give thy little shirt away,” and took it off, and gave away that also. And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her little shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen. Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the days of her life."
154 The Stolen Farthings
"A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children, and a good friend who had come on a visit was with them. And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o’clock, the stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in. It did not look around, and it did not speak; but went straight into the next room. Soon afterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner. On the second and on the third day, it came also exactly in the same way. At last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged? “I have never seen it,” said he, neither did he know to whom it could belong. The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who however did not see it, and the mother and the children also all saw nothing. On this the stranger got up, went to the room door, opened it a little, and peeped in. Then he saw the child sitting on the ground, and digging and seeking about industriously amongst the crevices between the boards of the floor, but when it saw the stranger, it disappeared. He now told what he had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother recognized it, and said, “Ah, it is my dear child who died a month ago.” They took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man; it, however, had thought, “Thou canst buy thyself a biscuit for that,” and had kept the farthings, and hidden them in the openings between the boards; and therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings. The parents gave the money at once to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again."
155 Brides On Their Trial
"There was once a young shepherd who wished much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty, so that it was difficult to him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them. Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, “Invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it.” The youth did so; the first, however, swallowed the cheese with the rind on; the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also; the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little. The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, “Take the third for thy wife.” This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her."
156 Odds And Ends
"There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent. When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, span them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself. A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said,—"
"“Ah, how that girl does jump about, dressed in my odds and ends.”"
"The bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it?"
"Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away. When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife."
"He was put in a common jail to await trial. Afterwards he was discharged, but was never again on good terms with the government, and never rose again."
"When he came into town and registered at the hotel the papers did not say anything about it; and so he stopped taking them, thus falling into ignorance and oblivion at the same moment, although at one time he had lacked but a single vote to make him President of the United States."
"England and France still continued at war, and American vessels were in hot water a good deal, as they were liable to be overhauled by both parties. England especially, with the excuse that she was looking for deserters, stopped American vessels and searched them, going through the sleeping-apartments before the work was done up, one of the rudest things known in international affairs."
"An Embargo Act was passed forbidding American vessels to leave port, an act which showed that the bray of the ass had begun to echo through the halls of legislation even at that early day."
"In the mean time, Jefferson had completed his second term, and James Madison, the Republican candidate, had succeeded him at the helm of state, as it was then called."
"His party favored a war with England, especially as the British had begun again to stir up the red brother."
"Madison was a Virginian. He was a man of unblemished character, and was not too haughty to have fun sometimes. This endeared him to the whole nation. Unlike Adams, he never swelled up so that his dignity hurt him under the arms. He died in 1836, genial and sunny to the last."
"It was now thought best to bring on the war of 1812, which began by an Indian attack at Tippecanoe on General Harrison's troops in 1811, when the Indians were defeated. June 19, 1812, war was finally declared."
"The first battle was between the forces under General Hull on our side and the English and Indians on the British side, near Detroit. The troops faced each other, Tecumseh being the Indian leader, and both armies stood ready to have one of the best battles ever given in public or private, when General Hull was suddenly overcome with remorse at the thought of shedding blood, especially among people who were so common, and, shaking a large table-cloth out the window in token of peace, amid the tears of his men, surrendered his entire command in a way that reminded old settlers very much of Cornwallis."
CHAPTER XX.
THE WAR WITH CANADA.
"October 13, General Van Rensselaer crossed the Niagara River and attacked the British at Queenstown Heights. The latter retreated, and General Brock was killed. General Van Rensselaer went back after the rest of his troops, but they refused to cross, on the ground that the general had no right to take them out of the United States, and thus the troops left in charge at the Heights were compelled to surrender."
"These troops who refused to go over and accept a victory already won for them, because they didn't want to cross the Canadian line, would not have shied so at the boundary if they had been boodlers, very likely, in later years."
"August 19 occurred the naval fight between the Constitution and Guerriere, off the Massachusetts coast. The Constitution, called ""Old Ironsides,"" was commanded by Captain Isaac Hull. The Guerriere was first to attack, but got no reply until both vessels were very close together, when into her starboard Captain Hull poured such a load of hardware that the Guerriere was soon down by the head and lop-sided on the off side. She surrendered, but was of no value, being so full of holes that she would not hold a cargo of railroad-trestles."
"The economy used by the early American warriors by land and sea regarding their ammunition, holding their fire until the enemy was at arm's length, was the cause of more than one victory. They were obliged, indeed, to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not produced here, and powder was imported."
"October 13, the naval fight between the Frolic and Wasp took place, off the North Carolina coast. The Frolic was an English brig, and she wound up as most frolics do, with a severe pain and a five-dollar fine. After the Wasp had called and left her R. S. V. P. cards, the decks of the Frolic were a sight to behold. There were not enough able-bodied men to surrender the ship. She was captured by the boarding-crew, but there was not a man left of her own crew to haul down the colors."
"Other victories followed on the sea, and American privateers had more fun than anybody."
"Madison was re-elected, thus showing that his style of administration suited one and all, and the war was prosecuted at a great rate. It became a sort of fight with Canada, the latter being supported by English arms by land and sea. Of course the Americans would have preferred to fight England direct, and many were in favor of attacking London: but when the commanding officer asked those of the army who had the means to go abroad to please raise their right hands, it was found that the trip must be abandoned. Those who had the means to go did not have suitable clothes for making a respectable appearance, and so it was given up."
"Three divisions were made of the army, all having an attack on Canada as the object in view, viz., the army of the Centre, the army of the North, and the army of the West. The armies of the Centre and North did not do much, aside from the trifling victory at York, and President Madison said afterwards in a letter to the writer's family that the two armies did not accomplish enough to pay the duty on them. The army of the West managed to stand off the British, though the latter still held Michigan and threatened Ohio."
"September 10, Perry's victory on Lake Erie occurred, and was well received. Perry was twenty-seven years old, and was given command of a flotilla on Lake Erie, provided he would cut the timber and build it, meantime boarding himself. The British had long been in possession of Lake Erie, and when Perry got his scows afloat they issued invitations for a general display of carnage. They bore down on Perry and killed all the men on his flag-ship but eight. Then he helped them fire the last gun, and with the flag they jumped into a boat which they paddled for the Niagara under a galling fire. This was the first time that a galling fire had ever been used at sea. Perry passed within pistol-shot of the British, and in less than a quarter of an hour after he trod the poop of the Niagara he was able to write to General Harrison, ""We have met the enemy, and they are ours."""
"Proctor and Tecumseh were at Malden, with English and Indians, preparing to plunder the frontier and kill some more women and children as soon as they felt rested up. At the news of Perry's victory, Harrison decided to go over and stir them up. Arriving at Malden, he found it deserted, and followed the foe to the river Thames, where he charged with his Kentucky horsemen right through the British lines and so on down the valley, where they reformed and started back to charge on their rear, when the whole outfit surrendered except the Indians. Proctor, however, was mounted on a tall fox-hunter which ran away with him. He afterwards wrote back to General Harrison that he made every effort to surrender personally, but that circumstances prevented. He was greatly pained by this."
"The Americans now charged on the Indians, and Johnson, the commander of the Blue Grass Dragoons, fired a shot which took Tecumseh just west of the watch-pocket. He died, he said, tickled to death to know that he had been shot by an American."
"Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, having taken the British brig Peacock, was given command of the Chesapeake, which he took to Boston to have repaired. While there, he got a challenge from the Shannon. He put to sea with half a crew, and a shot in his chest that is, the arm-chest of the ship burst the whole thing open and annoyed every one on board. The enemy boarded the Chesapeake and captured her, so Captain Lawrence, her brave commander, breathed his last, after begging his men not to give up the ship."
"However, the victories on the Canadian border settled the war once more for the time, and cheered the Americans very much."
"The Indians in 1813 fell upon Fort Mimms and massacred the entire garrison, men, women, and children, not because they felt a personal antipathy towards them, but because they the red brothers had sold their lands too low and their hearts were sad in their bosoms. There is really no fun in trading with an Indian, for he is devoid of business instincts, and reciprocity with the red brother has never been a success."
"General Jackson took some troops and attacked the red brother, killing six hundred of him and capturing the rest of the herd. Jackson did not want to hear the Indians speak pieces and see them smoke the pipe of peace, but buried the dead and went home. He had very little of the romantic complaint which now and then breaks out regarding the Indian, but knew full well that all the Indians ever born on the face of the earth could not compensate for the cruel and violent death of one good, gentle, patient American mother."
Admiral Cockburn now began to pillage the coast of the Southern States and borrow communion services from the churches of Virginia and the Carolinas. He also murdered the sick in their beds.
"Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful things there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing beside her little boy's cradle. The Magician thought her more beautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch that he asked her to go home with him and to marry him. But she said, ""My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; I will stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is grown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings of his father. Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry you."""
"At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into a little black dog, and led her away; saying, ""Since you will not come with me of your own free will, I will make you."" So the poor Princess was dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or of letting her sisters know what had become of her. As Punchkin passed through the palace gate the servants said to him, ""Where did you get that pretty little dog?"" And he answered, ""One of the Princesses gave it to me as a present."" At hearing which they let him go without further questioning."
"Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their nephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much surprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then they questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and the little black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in every direction seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be found. What could six poor women do? They gave up all hopes of ever seeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband, again, and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of their little nephew."
"Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old. Then, one day, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did he hear it, than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of his father and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bring them home again. His aunts, on learning his determination, were much alarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, ""We have lost our husbands, and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if you go away, what shall we do?"" But he replied, ""I pray you not to be discouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my father and mother and uncles with me."" So he set out on his travels; but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search."
"At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents, he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, and trees, and there he saw a large palace with a high tower; hard by which was a Malee's little house."
"As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of the house and said, ""My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this dangerous place?"" He answered, ""I am a Raja's son, and I come in search of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked enchanter bewitched."""
"Then the Malee's wife said, ""This country and this palace belong to a great enchanter; he is all powerful, and if any one displeases him, he can turn them into stones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see here were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what they now are. Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly afterwards came his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees; and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower lives a beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there for twelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him."""
"Then the little Prince thought, ""These must be my parents and my uncles. I have found what I seek at last."" So he told his story to the Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that place awhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned; and she promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himself lest the Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone. To this the Prince agreed. So the Malee's wife dressed him up in a saree, and pretended that he was her daughter."
"One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his garden he saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her who she was. She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magician said, ""You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take a present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in the tower."""
"The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went immediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom he determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise, and trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for establishing some communication with his mother, if it were indeed she."
"Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her a small gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on her little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was older his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able to wear it. The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-known treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trust to her recognising it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as such a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of her ever establishing communication with her friends), that though the supposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day, the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time."
"At last one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one was looking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna's feet. It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to see what made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers. On recognising it, she at once believed the story her son told her of his long search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had better do; at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his life by trying to rescue her. She told him that for twelve long years the Magician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry him, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release."
"Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, ""Do not fear, dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the Magician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate my father and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and trees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; now rather speak kindly. Tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing to marry him. Then endeavour to find out what his power consists in, and whether he is immortal, or can be put to death."""
"Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent for Punchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested."
"The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible."
"But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little more time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, after being enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen by degrees. ""And do tell me,"" she said, ""are you quite immortal? Can death never touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?"""
"""Why do you ask?"" said he."
"""Because,"" she replied, ""if I am to be your wife, I would fain know all about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, or if possible to avert it."""
"""It is true,"" he added, ""that I am not as others. Far, far away, hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small cage which contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrot depends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is, however,"" he added, ""impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country, and because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palm trees, and kill all who approach the place."""
Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.
"The Prince, however, replied, ""Mother, unless I can get hold of that parrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be not afraid, I will shortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in good humour still putting off your marriage with him on various pretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here."""
"So saying, he went away."
"Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thick jungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep."
"He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a large serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in the tree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles. The Prince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killed the serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air, and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for their young ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and the young Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, ""Dear boy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; whenever you are in need, therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as for these little eagles, take them, and let them be your servants."""
"At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their wings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over the thick jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle of palm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water. It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great. All round the trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were such countless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossible for any one to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped the strong-winged eaglets down jumped the Prince; in an instant he had overthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little green parrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted again into the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasure gone, set up a wild and melancholy howl."
"Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the great tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, ""Take back your little ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand in need of help, I will not fail to come to you."" He then continued his journey on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace, where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot."
"Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, ""My boy, where did you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you."""
"But the Prince answered, ""Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a great pet of mine; I have had it many years."""
"Then the Magician said, ""If it is an old favourite, I can understand your not caring to give it away; but come what will you sell it for?"""
"""Sir,"" replied the Prince, ""I will not sell my parrot."""
"Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, ""Anything, anything; name what price you will, and it shall be yours."" The Prince answered, ""Let the seven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly liberated."""
"""It is done as you desire,"" said the Magician, ""only give me my parrot."" And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband and his brothers resumed their natural shapes. ""Now, give me my parrot,"""
"""It was not more than fifteen minutes after I had left, you say?""  I"
inquired.
"""No, m'sieur, not more."""
"""Mademoiselle had no other visitor?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Of that we are all certain."""
"""And the Countess, where was she during the time I was here?"""
"""She was out driving.  She did not return till about five minutes after"
"we had made the terrible discovery."""
"""And how did madame act?"""
"""She ordered us to carry poor mademoiselle to her room.  Poor madame!"
"She bore the blow with wonderful fortitude."""
That remark caused me to prick up my ears.
"""I don't quite understand,"" I said.  ""Did she not give way to tears?"""
"""No, m'sieur; she shed no tears, but sat erect, motionless as a statue."
She appeared unable to realise that poor mademoiselle was actually dead.
"At last she rang, and sent Jean to you."""
"""You are absolutely certain that mademoiselle had no visit or after I"
"left?"""
"Ilaria stirred in her sleep. Her mouth quivered, her hair stirred"
"sudden under the heather, like tendrils of gold shivering in the sun."
"Even as the light increased, Francesco knelt and looked down upon her."
"Hope and life, glorious, sudden, seemed to fall out of the east, a"
radiant faith begotten of spirit-power. Banners of gold were streaming
"in the sky. The gloom fled. A vast expectancy hung solemn, breathless,"
upon the red lips of the day.
"A sigh, and the long, silken lashes quivered. The lips moved, the eyes"
opened.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"Sudden silence followed, a vast hush as of undreamed hope. The woman's"
eyes were silently searching the man's face. He bent and cowered over
"her as one who weeps. His hands touched her body, yet she did not"
stir.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"It was a hoarse, passionate outcry that broke the golden stupor of the"
"dawn. A sudden light leaped lustrous into the woman's eyes, her face"
shone radiant in its etherealized beauty.
"""Francesco!"""
"""Ah! At last!"""
A great shudder passed through her body. Her eyes grew big with fear.
The duke regarded his host out of half-shut watery eyes.
"""My own choice is Chianti!"""
"""A difference of five years in purgatory!"""
Thereupon the duke blew the froth of his wine in the Abbot's face.
"""Purgatory!--A mere figure of speech!"""
The Abbot emptied his tankard.
"""The figures of speech are the pillars of the Church!"""
He beckoned to the custodian.
"""Poculum alterum imple!"""
The lean friar came and disappeared noiselessly.
They drank for a time in heavy silence. After a time the Abbot
"sneezed, which caused Beelzebub, the Abbot's black he-goat, who had"
"been browsing outside, to peer through the crescent-shaped aperture in"
the casement and regard him quizzically.
"The duke, who chanced to look up at that precise moment, saw the red"
"inflamed eyes of the Abbot's tutelar genius, and, mistaking the goat"
"for another presence, turned to his host."
"""Do you not fear,"" he whispered, ""lest Satan may pay you a visit"
"during some of your uncanonical pastimes?"""
For an instant Brand was dumbfounded. For here was language he could
understand--which was incredible on this far-flung globe. Then he
suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd
had some experience with telepathy on Venus; but theirs was a crude
thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl
before him.
"""Who are you?"" he asked wonderingly."
"""I am Greca""--it was very hard to grasp names or abstract terms--""of"
"the fourth satellite."""
"""Then you are not of these monsters of Jupiter?"""
"""Oh, no! I am their captive, as are all my people. We are but slaves"
"of the tall ones."""
"Brand glanced at Dex. ""Here's a chance to get some information,"
"perhaps,"" he murmured."
Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."
"""I shall be happy to tell you anything in my power to tell,"" she"
"informed him. ""But you must be quick. I can only remain with you a"
"little while."""
She sat down on the floor with them--the few bench-like things
obviously used by the tall creatures as chairs were too high for
"""Looks like too little, too late."" He stretched beside her."
"""What did she mean just now? About our 'contribution'?"""
"""Probably the protocol. My guess is she wants to see it destroyed."
Let's hope that'll be the end of it. The godfather's got his money. And
"Alex's problem is solved permanently."""
"Now Kenji Nogami was entering the room, an island of Zen-like calm"
amidst all the bedlam.
"""Michael, I'm so sorry."" He stepped over. ""When the money didn't show"
"up as scheduled, they called Jiro Sato and he suggested they try here."
"There was nothing I could do."""
"Vance nodded. ""That's how I figured it'd be played. We didn't move fast"
"enough on this end. It was my fault."""
"""Too bad. We came close."" He sighed. ""But I'm not going to underwrite"
"the rest of those bogus debentures. He'll have to kill me."""
"""And he'll probably do just that. The hell with it. You tried, we all"
tried. Now it looks like Tanzan Mino's scam is going to go through
whether we play or not. You might as well save your own skin. With any
"luck, we can still sort out our end, but you--you're going to have to be"
"dealing with that bastard for years to come. Think about it."""
"""I'm still deciding,"" he said finally. ""Let's wait and see how things"
"go."""
"""Alex opted for suicide. You shouldn't follow his lead."""
"trumpet brayed, though a host had scattered in search of a woman's"
face.
"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"
"out!"""
Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
SPIRITUS JUNIPERI COMPOSITUS--COMPOUND SPIRIT OF JUNIPER
"DERIVATION.--Oil of juniper, 8; oil of caraway, 1; oil of fennel, 1;"
"alcohol, 1,400; water to make 2,000."
Compound spirit of juniper is similar to gin in its therapeutic action.
Contains about 15 per cent more alcohol. Gin is made by distillation of
fermented malt and juniper berries. Gin differs from the other alcoholic
preparations therapeutically in being more diuretic.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
RUM (not official)
Rum is made from a fermented solution of molasses by distillation. It
"contains, by weight, from 40 to 50 per cent of absolute alcohol. Rum"
does not differ physiologically from alcohol. There is no authoritative
Latin name for rum.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
VINUM ALBUM--WHITE WINE

like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.
“Will you forgive me?”
The poor little commonplace fell in the midst of devastating
emotions--pathetically incongruous.

dependent on him.
"“To-night I met him, in his empty apartment, alone. I knew that he had"
"what was left of his money with him, that everything was packed up. I"
went prepared. I would not elope. My plan was no less than to make him
pay the balance on the necklace that he had lost—or to murder him.
"“I carried a new pistol in my muff, one which Lynn had just bought. I"
don’t know how I did it. I was desperate.
"“He told me he loved me, that Lynn did not, never had—that Lynn had"
"married me only to show off his wealth and diamonds, to give him a"
social! position—that I was merely a—a piece of property—a dummy.
“He tried to kiss me. It was revolting. I struggled away from him.
"“And in the struggle, the revolver fell from my muff and exploded on"
the floor.
“At once he was aflame with suspicion.
"“‘So—it’s murder you want!’ he shouted. ‘Well, murder it shall be!’"
“I saw death in his eye as he seized my arm. I was defenseless now. The
old passion came over him. Before he killed—he—would have his way with
me.
“I screamed. With a wild effort I twisted away from him.
"“He raised his hand to strike me, I saw his eyes, glassy. Then he sank"
back—fell to the floor—dead of apoplexy—dead of his furious emotions.
all. 'And your gold chain is gone. I believe you have nothing but the
"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because
"you love me,' she whispered, shutting her eyes."
And I did not gainsay her.
CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
and the miracle of children’s being born from their mothers. The other
miracles I do not believe in. What for? They are so insignificant beside
the works of Nature!”
"“He is a pagan,” Kennedy again stated."
_YOUNG PAINTERS_
"They were chatting, when three young lads came into the tavern, all"
"three having the air of artists, black clothes, soft hats, flowing"
"cravats, long hair, and pipes. “Two of them are fellow-countrymen of"
"yours,” Kennedy told Cæsar."
"“They are Spanish painters,” the old man added. “The other is a sculptor"
"who has been in the Argentine, and he talks Spanish too.”"
The three entered and sat down at the same table and were introduced to
"Cæsar. Everybody chattered. Buonacossi, the Italian, was a real type."
"Of very low stature, he had a giant’s torso and strong little legs. His"
"head was like a woe-begone eagle, his nose hooked, thin, and reddish,"
"eyes round, and hair black."
"Buonacossi proved to be gay, exuberant, changeable, and full of"
vehemence.
"He explained his artistic ideas with picturesque warmth, mingling them"
with blasphemies and curses. Things struck him as the best or the worst
in the world. For him there doubtless were no middle terms.
"One of the two Spaniards was serious, grave, jaundiced, sour-visaged,"
"""Do you understand Accum?"""
"""I stopped shortly before Matrix. Accumulative Math is so much pothooks"
"on a sheet of paper to me."""
"""Um. Then I'd find it hard to explain. The theory seems to be"
"demonstrable, and the accumulative mathematics upholds the"
experimental evidence. But there hasn't yet been an acceptable verbal
"description of what happens."""
"""I've often wondered, leaving the nondirectional quality out of it,"
why we couldn't cut our emitting power and somehow compute range by
"observing the incoming power from a distant infrawave transmitter."""
"Allison shook his head. ""Oddly enough, the matrix mathematics that"
deal with radiation shows that for any hypothetical radiation with an
"infinite velocity of propagation, there can be no attenuation with"
"distance."""
"""Meaning that we should be able to transmit all the way from here to"
"hell and back."""
"""Not exactly. Infrawave radiation comes in quanta, you know. A kilowatt"
"covers two point one, seven nine three six plus parsecs. Two kilowatts"
"covers twice that distance minus the ninth root of two point, seven"
nine three six plus. Three kilowatts covers three times two point et
"cetera, minus two times the ninth root."" Allison shrugged and spread"
his hands.
*       *       *       *       *
then! I felt that I had become a different being altogether.
The boat entered the harbour and ran alongside the quay. A train was
waiting for us. We poured out of the ship in two streams that spread out
fan-wise and flowed into the carriages.
It was good to sit by the window in a comfortable compartment and lean
back against soft cushions.
Glad anticipation and barely suppressed excitement were visible on
everybody's face.
"The train sped through familiar country: meadows, pastures, cornfields,"
orchards and woodlands. People waved their handkerchiefs at us from
cottage windows.
It was growing dark as the first rows of drab suburban houses began to
glide past.
So this was London. I stared out of the window and tried to grasp the
"tremendous, wonderful fact with all the power of my mind. Somehow or"
"other it did not seem real, but I felt I could make it real by an effort"
of the will.
Streets and houses and moving people soon crowded the whole view. The
people filled me with intense curiosity. I longed to talk to them and
find out what they felt and thought about the war.
We entered Victoria Station. I opened the door of the compartment with
"hasty, trembling hands. I did not wait to change my French money, but"
hurried out into a street and got on to a 'bus.
"this ever happened."""
"She flipped down the computer's screen, then turned back."
"""Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple. I'm sorry to have to tell"
"you two that we haven't seen the last of each other."" She paused, then"
"continued. ""In fact, we are about to become much better acquainted."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""You once told me, back when we met on the plane from Athens, you would"
welcome that. You should be happy that your wish is now about to be
"granted. You both are going to be our guests."""
"""That's kind of you."" He stared at her, startled. ""But we can probably"
"bear up to the separation."""
"""No, I must insist. You were right about the difficulties. Your death"
"now would be awkward, for a number of reasons. Alex will be trouble"
"enough to explain, but that is purely an internal Soviet matter. Moscow"
"Narodny can cover it. However, eliminating you two would raise awkward"
"inquiries. On the other hand, you represent a security risk to the"
"project. Consequently we have no option. Surely you understand."""
He understood all too well. This was the one turn he hadn't figured on.
Almost eight years. It had been that long ago. But what had Ken said?
The Tokyo _oyabun _never forgot. What this really meant was that Tanzan
Mino wanted to settle the score first hand. What did he have planned?
Vance had a sudden feeling he didn't want to know. It was going to be a
zero-sum game. Everything on the table and winner take all.
either.
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Very curious indeed!"""
"""What is curious?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""Those marks,"" he answered, indicating them with his finger.  ""They are"
"very puzzling.  I've never seen such marks before."""
"""Do they point to foul play?""  I inquired, feeling suspicious that she"
had by some mysterious means fallen the victim of an assassin.
"""Well, no,"" he responded, after some hesitation; ""that is not my"
"opinion."""
"""Then what is your opinion?"""
"""At present I have none.  I can have none until I make a thorough"
"examination.  There are certainly no outward marks of violence."""
"""We need not inform the police, I suppose?"""
"""Not at present,"" he replied, his eyes still fixed upon the blanched"
face of the woman who had once been all the world to me.
"I raised her dead hand, and upon it imprinted a last fervent kiss.  It"
was cold and clammy to my lips.  In that hour all my old love for her
"had returned, and my heart had become filled with an intense bitterness"
"and desolation.  I had thought that all my love for her was dead, and"
"that Edith Austin, the calm, sweet woman far away in an English county,"
"who wrote to me daily from her quiet home deep in the woodlands, had"
"taken her place.  But our meeting and its tragic sequel had, I admit,"
"'em as they were talking to Peasley. You'd better 'beat' it, quick!"""
"""How? I couldn't get through that crowd. They know me. Listen!"" Outside"
the street broke into a roar at some taunt of the fishermen high up in
"the rigging. ""I can't run away, and if those detectives get me I'm"
"ruined."""
"""Well! What's to be done?"" demanded Fraser, sharply. ""If you say the"
"word, we'll shoot it out with them, and get away on the ship before--"""
"""We can't do that--there are a dozen policemen in front here."""
"""Well, you'll have to move quick, or they'll 'cop' you, sure."""
"Boyd clinched his hands in desperation. ""I guess they've got me,"" he"
"said, bitterly. ""There's no way out."""
His eyes fell upon the letter containing his boastful assurance of
victory. What a mockery!
"""From what they said I don't think they know you,"" Fraser continued."
"""Anyhow, they wanted Peasley to point you out. When they come off,"
"maybe you can slip 'em."""
"""But how?"" Boyd seized eagerly upon the suggestion. ""The wharf is"
"empty--see! I'll have to cross it in plain sight."""
Through the rear door of the office that opened upon the dock proper
they beheld the great floor almost entirely clear. Save for a few tons
"of freight at which Big George's men were working, it was as"
"unobstructed as a lawn; and, although it was nearly the size of a city"
"block, it afforded no more means of concealment than did the little"
"his grotesque body, spoke for him."
"""That,"" he was certainly saying, ""is what will happen to any on your"
"helpless planet who dare oppose the Rogan will!"""
He whipped out a command to the terror-stricken girl. She rose from
her crouching position on the floor; and at length formulated the
Rogan's last order:
"""You will explain the working of the engine that drove your space ship"
"here."""
"Dex laughed. It was a short bark of sound, totally devoid of humor,"
but very full of defiance. Brand thrust his hands into the pockets of
"his tunic, spread his legs apart, and began to whistle."
*       *       *       *       *
A quiver that might have been of anger touched the Rogan leader's
repulsive little mouth. He glared balefully at the uncowed Earthmen
"and spoke again, evidently repeating his command. The two turned their"
backs to him to indicate their refusal to obey.
"At that, the tall leader pointed to Dex. In an instant three of the"
guards had wound their double pairs of arms around his struggling
"body. Brand sprang to help him, but a touch of the mysterious"
discharge from the leader's tube sent him writhing to the floor.
"""It's no use, Brand,"" said Dex steadily. He too had stopped"
"struggling, and now stood quietly in the slimy coils of his captors'"
"arms. ""I might as well go along with them and get it over with. I"
"probably won't see you again. Good luck!"""
"""But how do the plates function?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"Greca did not know this, save vaguely. She tried to express her little"
knowledge of the scientific achievements of the savage Rogans. After
some moments Brand turned to Dex and said:
"""As near as I can get it, the Rogans, by this peculiar red metal"
"alloy, manage to trap and divert the permanent lines of force, the"
"magnetic field, of Jupiter itself. So the whole red spot is highly"
"magnetized, which somehow upsets natural gravitational attraction. I"
"suppose it is responsible for the discoloration of the ground, too."""
"He turned to question the girl further about this, but she had got"
nervously to her feet already.
"""I'll be taken away soon,"" she said. ""I was brought in here only to"
"urge you to eat the food. I must be interpreter, since the Rogans"
"speak not with the mind, and I know their hateful tongue."""
"""Why are they so anxious for us to eat?"" demanded Dex with an uneasy"
frown.
"""So you will be strong, and endure for a long time the--the ordeal"
"they have in store for you,"" faltered the girl at last. ""They intend"
"to force from you the secret of the power that drove your ship here,"
"so they too may have command of space."""
"""But I don't understand,"" frowned Brand. ""They must already have a"
means of space navigation. They came here to Jupiter from the
"visible, and from a first shyness that did not lack charm he expanded"
"briskly. After visiting a ""dry"" café, to seal this fortunate"
acquaintanceship--as he insisted upon calling it--he warmed up to us and
"we to him, with the result that his bags were soon carried down and"
"stowed in our spare stateroom. Leaving him there, we went on deck."
"""Dragot,"" Tommy mused. ""Speaks with a slight accent, but I can't make"
"out what!"""
"""Roumanian, possibly,"" I suggested, ""as he comes from there."""
"""You rather excel yourself,"" he smiled. ""Registering from Roumania,"
"however, isn't prima facie evidence that he's a Roumanian."""
"""He's a clever little talker, all the same."""
"""Right O! Too clever. I'm wondering if we aren't a pair of chumps to"
"take him."""
"""Why?"""
"""He may be a crook, for all we know. Did you notice what he said about"
"holding a commission from Azuria, and then hurrying to explain that"
Azuria isn't on the ordinary maps--just a wee bit of a kingdom up in the
"Carpathians, yet in the confines of Roumania? I call that fishy!"""
"""Not entirely so, Tommy. When you said it might now be turning into a"
"republic, did you notice how proudly he declared that the descendants of"
"Basil the Wolf couldn't be humbled?--that, situated in Moldavia, and"
"escaping the ravages of the Bulgarian army, they were stronger today"
"than ever?"""
"striking. Almost opposite us in a beetling archway, the bowed head and"
shoulders of a man stood up above the common level. There was a little
"space round him, whence men held back; and the red glow of the"
smouldering links which the executioners had cast on the ground at his
"feet, shone upwards on his swollen lips and starting eyeballs. As I"
"looked, the body seemed to writhe in its bonds; but it was only the"
wind swayed it. I went in shuddering.
"On the stairs I met Count Hugo coming down, and knew the moment I saw"
"him that there was something wrong. He stopped me, his eyes full of"
wrath.
"'My man,' he said sternly, 'I thought that you were to be trusted!"
Where have you been? What have you been doing? _Donner!_ Is your lady
to be left at dark with no one to man this door?'
"Conscience-stricken, I muttered that I hoped nothing had gone amiss."
"'No, but something easily might!' he answered grimly. 'When I came"
here I found three as ugly looking rogues whispering and peering in
"your doorway as man could wish to see! Yes, Master Martin, and if I"
"had not ridden up at that moment I will not answer for it, that they"
would not have been in! It is a pity a few more knaves are not where
"that one is,' he continued sourly, pointing through the open door. 'We"
could spare them. But do you see and have more care for the future.
"Or, mein Gott, I will take other measures, my friend!'"
So it had been a ruse after all! I went up sick at heart.
"There was no one in the lobby when he arrived there--no dead bodies,"
"either. But on the sidewalk, in front of the building, a woman lay dead"
in a pool of blood.
"In a sick rage, Taber looked in both directions and saw the android dive"
through a group of people half a block away. He tipped them over like
tenpins and ran on. Taber gripped the gun tight and started in pursuit.
He could not fire because there was enough sidewalk traffic to make it
"dangerous. On ahead, the android's path was blocked by a man. He sought"
to get clear but the android passed him close enough to jam the knife
into his neck and send him screaming to the sidewalk.
"A uniformed patrolman appeared on the other side of the street, further"
down. He took the situation in and understood Taber's frantic gesture. A
"car screamed to a halt as the patrolman raced across the street, drawing"
his gun.
"The android, seeing his escape cut off, veered into an areaway. The"
patrolman got there first and plunged in after him.
"Taber, gasps tearing at his lungs, arrived thirty seconds later. During"
"that time, he'd expected the sound of shots from the patrolman's gun."
But there was silence.
"He braked on his heels, skidded into the areaway, and saw the android"
"advancing on the patrolman. The latter stood motionless, the gun hanging"
useless at his side.
"""Drop! Drop!"" Taber yelled. He cursed as he tried to angle in the narrow"
areaway in order to get a clear shot.
"“How’s this, are you leaving already, father?” said Simonetta, as he"
went through the shop to get to the street.
"“I’m coming back, I’m coming back right away.”"
_SUPERSTITIONS_
"The three of them went to a rather dirty tavern in the same lane,"
and settled themselves by the window. This post was a good point of
"observation for that narrow street, so crowded and so picturesque."
"Workmen went by, and itinerant vendors, women with kerchiefs, half"
"head-dress and half muffler, and with black eyes and expressive faces."
"Opposite was a booth of coloured candies, dried figs strung on a reed,"
and various kinds of sweets.
"A wine-cart passed, and Kennedy made Cæsar observe how decorative it"
"was with its big arm-seat in the middle and its hood above, like a"
prompter’s box.
Giovanni Battista ordered a flask of wine for the three of them. While
"he chatted and drank, friends of his came to greet them. They were men"
"with beards, long hair, and soft hats, of the Garbaldi and Verdi type so"
abundant in Italy.
"Among them were two serious old men; one was a model, a native of"
"Frascati, with the face of a venerable apostle; the other, for contrast,"
"looked like a buffoon and was the possessor of a grotesque nose, long,"
thin at the end and adorned with a red wart.
"from the mill-house, the fate of which must have afforded a striking"
object-lesson to a costive magistracy in trouble about a forced loan.
"""We are undone,"" he cried; ""I am a married man, your Excellency, and"
have not a _maravedi_ to call my own. You had better shoot me out of
"hand, and be done with it. Indeed, we cannot possibly pay."""
"""Go and find your father,"" cried Cabrera; ""he pocketed half of the price"
of Don Ramon Garcia's house. I cannot see my namesake suffer. Tell him
that two thousand _duros_ is the price up till noon. After that it will
"have risen to four thousand, and by three of the afternoon, if the money"
be not paid into the treasury of the only absolute and Catholic
"sovereign (in the present instance my breeches pocket), I shall be"
reluctantly compelled to shoot one dozen of the leading citizens of the
township of Sarria. Let a strong guard accompany this young man till he
"returns from carrying his message."""
"In this way did Cabrera replenish the treasury of his master Don Carlos,"
and with such pleasant argument did he induce reluctant _alcaldes_ to
discover the whereabouts of their strong boxes.
"For a remarkably shrewd man was General Ramon Cabrera, the butcher of"
Tortosa.
CHAPTER XXIV
HOW TO BECOME A SOLDIER
"""And what's more,"" said Slyne, playing a trump card with great outward"
"indifference, ""you can make him pay you for your time instead of you"
paying him. I told you I came back here to do you a good turn. There's
more than a hundred thousand dollars of easy money for you in this
deal--if you go the right way about it.
"""But--don't take my word for anything."""
Captain Dove had palpable difficulty in suppressing the obvious repartee
to that last bit of advice. But cupidity and cunning kept him quiet for
a space.
"""All right. I'll go with you,"" he agreed very gruffly at last. And Slyne"
heaved a silent sigh of relief; he had feared more than once that the
contest of wills would after all go against him.
"""You're wise,"" he commented carelessly. ""It will pay you."
"""You'd better see Sallie now, don't you think, and tell her--"""
"""I'm not going to interfere between you and her--till I get my money"
"from you,"" declared the old man with a crafty grin. ""You must tackle her"
"yourself. She'll be up by now, but breakfast won't be ready for half an"
hour. If I were you I'd take that coat off and let her have a sight of
"those diamonds of yours."""
"Slyne did not wait to hear any more. He was already on his way aft, a"
somewhat incongruous figure on the decks of the _Olive Branch_. When he
reached the companion-hatch on the poop he was smiling sardonically.
"""I do believe it was my 'diamonds' that finally fetched that old"
"that we have Ned Nestor, the alleged juvenile detective, at our camp. He"
"seems inclined to keep what information he possesses to himself, and,"
"before proceeding to extreme measures with him, we decided to lay the"
case before you. I am afraid Nestor will receive rough treatment at the
hands of my allies unless the information they demand is given them.”
"“So that was a lying message you sent Nestor, was it?”"
"“There’s no use in discussing the matter at length,” the other stated."
“I think I’d better take you boys into camp and let the boss talk with
"you. And let me warn you now, before anything more is said, not to"
"attempt resistance. If you do, there’ll be shooting done, and it won’t"
"be my men who will get hurt! Now, face about to the north and march away"
"to camp, like good little boys. We don’t want to hurt you, but we insist"
on having our way in the matter of this information. Perhaps Nestor may
be able to convince you that you ought not to be so obstinate.”
"“I don’t think Nestor will attempt anything of the kind,” replied Jack,"
“and I think that you are a great big bluff!”
CHAPTER X
GILROY AND THE BEAR
"When, at last, Ned and Jimmie, still watching about for hostile forces,"
"came to the barricaded camp, the fire had burned down and no one was in"
sight. Ned regarded the wall of rock with a smile.
“Isn’t that great?” Jimmie asked.
and talking together. They were greatly agitated.
The old woman sniffed and wiped her eyes. The elder daughter was
"packing a few things in a bundle. One of the officers asked: ""What about"
"our coffee?"" but she took no notice. Her sister had gone out in search"
of further information.
"She soon returned. Yes, they would all have to leave at once, but, if"
"they liked to take the risk, they could come back to-morrow with a"
"wagon, if they could get one, and fetch their belongings."
They were comforted. They knew where they would be able to get a wagon.
They would cart their stock and their household property away on the
morrow. They would start another estaminet somewhere. They would suffer
"loss and inconvenience, but they would not be ruined--their valuable"
stock of wines would save them from that.
The bundle was made up and they prepared to leave. We paid our bill and
went out into the street. Numbers of soldiers were straggling past. They
looked wretched and exhausted. Their boots and puttees were caked with
mud. They had neither rifles nor packs. Three men were lying up against
"a garden wall. We asked them for news. They could not tell us much,"
except that the Germans were still advancing.
"""We was at Dickebusch when 'e started slingin' stuff over--gorblimy, 'e"
don't 'alf wallop yer--umpteen of our mates got bleed'n' well biffed. We
"cleared out afore it got too 'ot."""
"Several famished ""battle-stragglers"" had entered our camp in order to"
beg for food. They sat round the cook-house and ate in gloomy silence.
In the adjoining field a number of tents had sprung up. Blue figures
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
"those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices"
"within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three"
"coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking"
"about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning"
"their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had"
assumed another form.
"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said"
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.
"""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first"
"and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard."""
"""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of"
"them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two"
"others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,"
"and sink the ship with every man on board."""
"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the"
"day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?"""
once more asked the captain's wife.
"""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others."
"""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is"
"used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our"
"lives!"""
the fact that at one time I thought this passage beautiful. But the beat
of the blank verse carried me on. Sometimes it seemed to blend with the
buzzing of those angry wasps above and sometimes the two rhythms would
"vie with each other for speed, so that they hurried along each"
alternately ahead of the other. I came to a line where my memory failed
"me. I faltered for a moment, but the droning sound seemed to grow into"
"an enormous roar, and I leapt back to the beginning:"
"""He above the rest...."""
and then on and on a second time until my head throbbed with the double
pulsation.
Suddenly a man who had been lying on the far side of the marquee got up
and said:
"""I've had enough of this, I'm going to sleep in a ditch."""
"He went off. The wasps were still buzzing, but the interruption had"
broken the spell. I felt a sense of relief. I became conscious of
intense weariness and felt ashamed of my fears. I cursed the German
"aeroplanes and thought, ""Let them do their worst, I don't care."" I made"
up my mind to go to sleep and resolutely buried my face in my pillow.
Then it occurred to me that I would never be able to enjoy _Paradise
"Lost_ again, and I was half-amused and agreeably distracted by the"
trivial thought.
But the wasps were still buzzing. Another man began to groan loudly:
"""Gawd--this is bloody awful--why the bloody 'ell can't they leave us"
"alone!"""
"""Uncanonical!"" roared the Abbot. ""I scorn the charge! I"
"scorn it with my heels! Two masses daily,--morning and"
"evening--Primes,--Nones,--Vespers,--Aves,--Credos,--Paters--"""
"""Excepting on moonlight nights,"" the duke blinked."
"""Exceptis excipiendis,"" replied the Abbot."
"""Sheer heresy!"" roared the duke. ""The devil is apt to keep an eye on"

"""Let him roar!"" shouted the Abbot, bringing his fist down upon the"
"table, and looking about in canonical ire, when the door opened"
noiselessly and in its dark frame stood Francesco.
He had waited at the camp for the return of the duke until his misery
"and restlessness had mastered every other sensation. Sleep, he felt,"
"would not come to his eyes, and he craved for action. He should have"
"liked nothing better than to mount his steed on the spot, ride"
single-handed into Anjou's camp and redeem his honor in the eyes of
those who regarded him a bought instrument of the Church. The memory
of Ilaria wailed through the dark chambers of his heart. He felt at
"this moment, more than ever, what she had been to him, and to himself"
"he appeared as a derelict, tossed on a vast and shoreless sea."
"For a moment he gazed as one spellbound at the drinkers, then he"
strode up to the duke and shook him soundly.
"""To the rescue, my lord duke!"" he shouted, in the excess of his"
"frenzy, till the vaults re-echoed his cry from their farthest"
"recesses. ""Conradino has been betrayed by the Frangipani!"""
"of the populous city, and its smoky shadow slowly followed it. The"
lights of the lamps paled in the dawn; the stars went out; and out of
the daffodil east the day came up--and there was light in the world.

"In the still grey dawn, in dripping drizzle, Gavroche the anarchist"
slouched forth from prison-cell to his harsh doom.
He was dejected.
"He missed the band, the public eye, the shouts of the comrades."
"What, Gavroche! this is thy dramatic moment--thou hast the stage all to"
thy sole swaggering self--and though thou roused at daybreak from thy
broodings to lilt a braggart song with all thy best intent to play the
"reckless swashbuckler, the florid eager pressman can only report that"
thou didst sing “somewhat palsily.”
"Tush, man! Is it thus thou goest to thy end? Hath thy desire to be"
Ruthless Overman brought only this about--that thou art to become no
"better than manure? Where is now thy dream of Ruthless Overman? Nay,"
"what avails at all now thy Overmanhood, Gavroche? does not thy neck"
feel rather with unpleasant shiver of discomfort the overlordship
"of the Commonweal? The aristocrat despised it yesterday, and thou"
"to-day. Hast thou, even thus late, a glimmering that thy vaunted"

falls on the bidding of that overwhelming force which is the public

Household. But what's going to become of that human creature morally and
spiritually? That's what I want to know.”
"“It's an interesting problem,” said Herold. “She may be either a"
"benumbed half-idiot or a vicious, vindictive she-brute.”"
"“Just so,” said John. “That is, if she goes to slave in some squalid"
household. But suppose she were transferred to different surroundings
"altogether? Suppose she had ease of life, loving care, and all the rest"
of it?”
The senile travesty of Herold laughed.
“You want me to say that she may develop into some sort of flower of
womanhood.”
"“Do you think she might?” John asked seriously. “My dear fellow,” said"
"Herold, “there are Heaven knows how many hundred million human beings"
"on the face of the earth, and every one of them is different from the"
others. How can one tell what any particular young woman whom one does
n't know might or might not do in given circumstances? But if you want
me to say whether I think it right for you to step in and look after the
"poor little devil's future, then I do say it's right. It 's stunning of"
you. It's the very best thing you can do. It will give the poor little
"wretch a chance, at any rate, and will give you something outside"
yourself to think of.”
"“I was going to do it whether you thought it right or not,” said Risca."
"Herold laughed again. “For a great, hulking bull of a man you 're"
"sometimes very feminine, John.”"
Dex started to reply to that; but Brand flung him a warning look.
"""Tell him we are the least of the Earth people,"" he answered steadily."
"""Tell him we are of an inferior race. Most of those on Earth are"
"giants five times as large as we are, and many times more powerful."""
"Greca relayed the message in the whistling, piping Rogan tongue. The"
"tall one stared, then hissed another sentence to the beautiful"
interpreter.
"""He wants to know,"" said Greca, ""if there are cities on your globe as"
"large and complete as this one."""
"""There are cities on Earth that make this look like a--a--"" Brand cast"
"about for understandable similes--""like a collection of animal"
"burrows."""
"""He says to describe your planet's war weapons,"" was the next"
interpretation. And here Brand let himself go.
"With flights of fancy he hadn't known he was capable of, he described"
"great airships, steered automatically and bristling with guns that"
discharged explosives powerful enough to kill everything within a
range of a thousand miles. He told of billions of thirty-foot giants
sheathed in an alloy that would make them invulnerable to any feeble
rays the Rogans might have developed. He touched on the certain
wholesale death that must overtake any hostile force that tried to
invade the planet.
"""The Rogan shock-tubes are toys compared with the ray-weapons of"
"Earth,"" he concluded. ""We have arms that can nullify the effects of"
"yours and kill at the same instant. We have--"""
CHAPTER XXIII
THE POTTER'S WHEEL
'Life is like a great whirlpool wherein we are dashed to and fro by
our passions.'--_Saying of the Buddha._
"It is a hard teaching, this of the Buddha about death. It is a teaching"
"that may appeal to the reason, but not to the soul, that when life goes"
"out, this thing which we call 'I' goes out with it, and that love and"
remembrance are dead for ever.
It is so hard a teaching that in its purity the people cannot believe
"it. They accept it, but they have added on to it a belief which changes"
"the whole form of it, a belief that is the outcome of that weakness of"
humanity which insists that death is not and cannot be all.
"Though to the strict Buddhist death is the end of all worldly passion,"
"to the Burmese villager that is not so. He cannot grasp, he cannot"
"endure that it should be so, and he has made for himself out of Buddhism"
a belief that is opposed to all Buddhism in this matter.
"He believes in the transmigration of souls, in the survival of the 'I.'"
"The teaching that what survives is not the 'I,' but only the result of"
"its action, is too deep for him to hold. True, if a flame dies the"
"effects that it has caused remain, and the flame is dead for ever. A new"
"flame is a new flame. But the 'I' of man cannot die, he thinks; it lives"
and loves for all time.
"surely do as much for a mountain gipsy if, as you said just now, the"
"range is likely to be a short one!"""
Rollo began somewhat to change his opinion about the husband of the
"Queen. At first he had seemed both dandy and coward, a combination which"
Rollo held in the utmost contempt. But when Rollo had once seen him
"handle a gun, he began to have more respect for his recent Excellency"
the Duke of Rianzares.
"""Can you tell us, from your military experience,"" Rollo asked, ""which is"
"the most easily vulnerable part of this palace."""
"""It is easily vulnerable in every part,"" answered Muñoz, carelessly"
snapping the lock of a rifle again and again.
"""Nay, but be good enough to listen, sir,"" cried Rollo, with some heat."
"""There are women and children here. You do not know the gipsies. You do"
not know by whom they are led. You do not know the oaths of death and
"torture they have sworn----"""
"""By whom are they led?"" said Muñoz, still playing carelessly with the"
"rifle. ""I thought such fellows were mere savages from the hills, and"
"might be slaughtered like sheep."""
"""Perhaps--at any rate they are led by your own daughter!"" said Rollo,"
"briefly, growing nettled at the parvenu grandee's seeming indifference."
"""_My daughter!_"" cried Muñoz, losing in a moment his bright complexion,"
"and becoming of a slaty pallor, ""my daughter, that mad imp of hell--who"
"thrice has tried to assassinate me!"""
"And as he spoke, he let the gun fall upon the floor at his feet. Then he"
conditions seem to be reversed--the eight legs and two tails and two necks
"with one head pointing to enlargement of the land, whereas a double foetus"
with only six or five feet forebodes some impending misfortune[41].
Let us proceed further with this text.
"If it is a double foetus, one well formed and the second issuing from"
"the mouth of the first[42], the king will be killed and his army will"
"[revolt ?], his oil plantation and his dwelling will be destroyed[43]."
"If it is a double foetus, the second lying at the tail [of the"
"first], with two breasts and two tails, there will be no unity in the"
land[44].
"If it is a double foetus, and the second lies at the tail of the"
"first and enclosed and both are living, ditto."
"If it is a double foetus, and one rides over the other, victory,"
throne will support throne.
If it is a double foetus and one rides over the other and there is
"only one head, the power of the king will conquer the enemy's land."
"If it is a double foetus, one above and one below, with only one"
"spine and eight feet, four [Variant: 'two'] ears, and two tails,"
throne will support throne.
"If it is a double foetus with the faces downward, approach of the son"
"of the king, who will take the throne of his father, or a second son"
"of the king will die, or a third son of the king will die."

"He stopped her at last, and they talked in the half-light, floating"
"along together half dreamily, as if upon the bosom of some great"
current that bore them into strange regions which they dreaded yet
longed to explore.
"They heard a child crying somewhere in the rear of the house, and"
"Chakawana's voice soothing, then in a moment the Indian girl appeared"
in the doorway saying something about going out with Constantine.
"Cherry acquiesced half consciously, impatient of the intrusion."
"For a long time they talked, so completely in concord that for the most"
part their voices were low and their sentences so incomplete that they
would have sounded incoherent and foolish to other ears. They were
roused finally by the appreciation that it had grown very late and a
"storm was brewing. Boyd rose, and going to the door, saw that the sky"
"was deeply overcast, rendering the night as dark as in a far lower"
latitude.
"""I've overstayed my welcome,"" he ventured, and smiled at her answering"
laugh.
"With a trace of solicitude, she said:"
"""Wait! I'll get you a rain-coat,"" but he reached out a detaining hand."
In the darkness it encountered the bare flesh of her arm.
"""Please don't! You'd have to strike a light to find it, and I don't"
"want a light now."""
"He was standing on the steps, with her slightly above him, and so close"
that he heard her sharp-drawn breath.
"_A good many of us, who are now certain beyond a doubt that space"
"travel will forever remain in the realm of the impossible, probably"
"would, if a rocket that were shot to the moon, for instance, did"
"arrive, and perhaps return to give proof of its safe arrival on our"
"satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blasé, twentieth"
"century manner. Dr. Smith, that phenomenal writer of classic"
"scientific fiction, seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of"
the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the
"reader to feel, after finishing ""Spacehounds of IPC,"" that travel"
"in the great spaces is not already an established fact. Dr. Smith,"
"as a professional chemist, is kept fairly busy. As a writer, he is"
"satisfied with nothing less than perfection. For that reason, a"
masterpiece from his pen has become almost an annual event. We know
"you will like ""Spacehounds"" even better than the ""Skylark"" series._"

decisions will no longer be ours. Tonight I attempted to salvage the
"situation and failed. Surely you know what that means, for us both. But"
"if you will give me Vance, perhaps we can both still be saved. If you"
"refuse to cooperate, the _oyabun _will destroy you as well as Vance. We"
"both know that. I am offering you a way out."""
"""With deepest gratitude, I must tell you it is too late, Sato-sama,"

"concerning the purpose of this meeting."""
"""I need to locate this man Vance. Before the _kobun _from Tokyo arrive."

"“In return,” said he, “I hope you will allow me to send in some jellies"
"and fruits, or appliances, or whatever may be of pleasure or comfort to"
the child.”
"“Whatever you send her that is practical shall be applied to her use,”"
said the Sister superintendent.
"She was cold, unemotional; no smile, no ghost even of departed smiles,"
"seemed ever to visit the tired, gray eyes or the corners of the rigid"
mouth; coif and face and thin hands were spotless. She did not even
thank him for his forced gift to the orphanage.
"“I should like to know,” said John, regarding her beneath frowning"
"brows, “whether any one here loves the unhappy little wretch.”"
"“These children,” replied the Sister superintendent, “have naturally a"
hard battle to fight when they go from here into the world. They come
"mostly from vicious classes. Their training is uniformly kind, but it"
has to be austere.”
John rose. “I will bring what things I can think of to-morrow.”
"The Sister superintendent rose, too, and bowed icily. “You are at"
"liberty to do so, Mr. Risca; but I assure you there is no reason for"
your putting yourself to the trouble. In the circumstances I can readily
understand your solicitude; but again I say you have no cause for it.”
"“Madam,” said he, “I see that I have more cause than ever.”"
"The next day he drove to the orphanage in a cab, with a hamper of"
delicacies and a down pillow. The latter the Sister superintendent

"Shrubs or trees. Juice not milky. Leaves alternate, undivided, without"
"stipules. Flowers in axillary cymes, irregular, hermaphrodite. Calyx"
"truncate or 5-toothed. Corolla 5-lobed, slit open behind, with folded"
"aestivation. Stamens 5, alternating with the corolla-lobes, free from"

and medicaments. =Scaevola= L.
FAMILY 226. COMPOSITAE
"Leaves simple and exstipulate, but sometimes dissected or provided"
with stipule-like auricles. Flowers seated upon a dilated or elevated
receptacle and arranged in sometimes spike-like or one-flowered
heads which are surrounded by an involucre. Heads either containing
"only hermaphrodite flowers, several of which are sometimes sterile"
"(male), or consisting of hermaphrodite or male central (disc-) flowers"
"and female or neuter marginal (ray-) flowers, more rarely heads"
unisexual or reduced to a single flower. Calyx-limb (pappus) formed
"of sometimes connate scales or hairs, fully developed only in fruit,"

fourteen hours at a stretch. They must be swift as lightning in their
"movements, and possessed of judgment, ability, and nerve."
"It was impossible, of course, for Bob to pick out an ideal rear crew"
from merely having seen the men in action for a scant few minutes. He
"did not try. He simply used his very excellent judgment, reserving"
"mentally the right to change his mind whenever he felt like it, and"
juggle the men around as he chose.
"The principal necessity was to start things moving. When he had done so,"
Bainbridge returned to camp with the twofold object of giving the cook
"his orders, and having a final settlement with Schaeffer. The latter was"
"not particularly pleasant, but it was important. The man must quit the"
crew at once. Bob had made up his mind not to let the fellow spend even
the night where he would have a chance to talk with and perhaps
"influence the others. With this determination uppermost, he passed by"
"the mess tent to the other where the men slept, pulled aside the flap,"
and stepped inside.
"The place was a mess of blankets and half-dried clothes, but to Bob’s"
surprise it was vacant of anything in the nature of a man. Evidently

"hands clapping together in innocent delight, her white teeth disclosed"

"raptures twenty years before when he was an apprentice in Tortosa, that"
the grim man only smiled and turned again to the unwilling spokesman of
the municipality of Sarria.
A voice from the press before the burning house announced the delegate's
quality.

"""Speak on, Don Raphael,"" cried Cabrera; ""I will not shoot you unless it"
"should be necessary."""
Thus encouraged the trembling youth began.
"""Your Excellency,"" he quavered, ""we of Sarria have nothing to do with"

maize or a plate of lentil broth if he were starving. We are loyal men
and women--well-wishers to the cause of the only true and absolute King

"The door opened suddenly, the draught blowing down a fan and a"
"photograph-frame, and Miss Lindon entered."
"“My dear John, how good of you to come and see me!”"
"She was a fat, dumpy woman of fifty, lymphatic and, at first sight,"
"characterless. She lacked colour. Her eyes were light, but neither blue"
nor green nor hazel; her straight hair was of the nondescript hue of
"light-brown hair turning gray. Her face was fleshy and sallow, marked by"
"singularly few lines. She had lived a contented life, unscarred by care"
and unruffled by desire. Her dreams of the possibilities of existence
did not pierce beyond the gimcrackeries of Tregarthion Villas. As
"for the doings of the great world,--wars, politics, art, social"
"upheavals,--she bestowed on them, when they were obtruded on her notice,"
the same polite and unintelligent interest as she had bestowed on her
nephew's athletic feats in the days gone by.
"However, she smiled very amiably at John, and reached up to kiss him"
"on both cheeks, her flabby, white hands lightly resting on each"
"coat-sleeve. Having done this, she caught up the barking dog, who"
continued to growl from the soft shelter of arm and bosom with the
vindictiveness of pampered old age.
"“Naughty Dandy! I hope you were n't frightened at him, John. He never"
really does bite.”
“What does he do then? Sting?” John asked with gruff sarcasm.
"“Oh, no,” said Miss Lindon, round-eyed; “he 's quite harmless, I assure"
you. Don't you remember Dandy? But it's a long time since you 've been
"to see me, John. It must be three or four years. What have you been"
doing all this time?”
"captors waiting. With their shoulders bunched for abrupt action, and"
"their guns in hand, the two men walked to the trap-door of the ship."
"They threw the heavy bolts, drew a deep breath--and flung open the"
door to charge unexpectedly toward the thickest mass of creatures that
surrounded the ship!
*       *       *       *       *
In a measure their charge was successful. Its very suddenness caught
some of the tall monstrosities off guard. Half a dozen of them stopped
the fragile glass bullets to writhe in horrible death on the red metal
paving of the square. But that didn't last long.
"In less than a minute, thin, clammy arms were winding around the"
"Earthmen's wrists, and their guns were wrenched from them. And then"
started a hand-to-hand encounter that was all the more hideous for
being so unlike any fighting that might have occurred on Earth.
"With a furious growl Dex charged the nearest creature, whose huge"
round head swayed on its stalk of a body fully six feet above his own
"head. He gathered the long thin legs in a football grip, and sent the"
thing crashing full length on its back. The great head thumped
"resoundingly against the metal paving, and the creature lay"
motionless.
"For an instant Dex could only stare at the thing. It had been so easy,"
"like overcoming a child. But even as that thought crossed his mind,"
two of the tall thin figures closed in behind him. Four pairs of arms
"wound around him, feebly but tenaciously, like wet seaweed."
"They began to constrict and wind tighter around him. He tore at them,"
dislodged all but two. His sturdy Earth leg went back to sweep the

"""To whom would it be directed, Betty?"" I asked, to tease her."
"A faint expression of reproach came to her eyes, but after a moment of"
"pretty hesitancy, she answered boldly:--"
"""Since you are so unwise as to ask, I'll answer in like folly. The letter"
"could be directed to but one person in the world--you."""
"I had received more than I had expected, and though I longed to make a"
"suitable return, I dared not for the sake of my vows, so we all remained"
"silent, and somewhat embarrassed, for a minute or two."
"Turning to Frances, I said: ""If you don't want me to read your letter,"
"I'll give you the key, and you may make it into cipher."" But after"
"examining the key, she declared that she could never learn to use it, and"
I suggested that she write a shorter letter in terms fit for a modest man
to read.
"The next day she handed me a shorter letter, saying that she had cut and"
"pruned it till there was nothing left worth sending, but I assured her"
that George would think otherwise.
"When I read the letter, my eyes were opened to the fact that there was"
more fire in Frances's heart than I had supposed any woman capable of
holding in subjection. But that is a mistake often made by men.
"This was my cousin's ""cut and pruned"" letter:--"
"""DEAR ONE:"
"""Aren't you?"" she repeated, more sweetly imperious."
"""You bet,"" I stammered."
"""Then do hurry! It's almost ten, and I've been waiting such a long"
"time!"""
"Whereupon I heard her moving off, pressing her hands against the panels"
"for steadiness, and there struck me as having been an endearing pathos"
"in the way she said: ""such a long time!"""
"This was, no doubt, some of Tommy's doing. He had invited friends aboard"
"for luncheon, and was now daring one of them to play this joke. But my"
"glance turned to the room, to its equipment and toilette articles which"
"were large and curiously shaped, and the numbing truth crept into my"
brain that the stupid boatman had put me on the wrong yacht.
"I had known some tight places in France, but this one simply squeezed me"
"all over. There was nothing for it, of course, but go out and"
explain--yet how could a chap appear at noon draped in a sheet! The
"situation confused me, but I decided to search the wardrobe, of my"
"unknown host, to borrow his razor, appropriate a new toothbrush that"
"should be found in a box somewhere, and select flannels and linens in"
keeping with the hour. Still balanced between confusion and panic I must
"have done these things because, fittingly attired though with no very"
"good fit, I opened my door, stepped softly along the passageway, and"
entered the cabin.
On a wide couch built in at one side a girl lay reading. Her head was
"toward me, but as I advanced she arose with a low cry of gladness,"
saying:
We had been summoned over the telephone to the Blake mansion by
"Reginald Blake, Mrs. Blake’s eldest son. Reginald had been very"
"reticent over the reason, but had seemed very anxious and insistent"
that Kennedy should come immediately.
"Craig read quickly and I followed him, fascinated by the letter from"
its very opening paragraph.
"“Dear Madam,” it began. “Having received my diploma as doctor of"
"medicine and bacteriology at Heidelberg in 1909, I came to the United"
States to study a most serious disease which is prevalent in several of
the western mountain states.”
"So far, I reflected, it looked like an ordinary appeal for aid. The"
"next words, however, were queer: “I have four hundred persons of wealth"
on my list. Your name was—”
Kennedy turned the page. On the next leaf of the letter sheet was
pasted a strip of gelatine. The first page had adhered slightly to the
gelatine.
"“Chosen by fate,” went on the sentence ominously."
"“By opening this letter,” I read, “you have liberated millions of the"
virulent bacteria of this disease. Without a doubt you are infected by
"this time, for no human body is impervious to them, and up to the"
present only one in one hundred has fully recovered after going through
all its stages.”
I gasped. The gelatine had evidently been arranged so that when the two
"sheets were pulled apart, the germs would be thrown into the air about"
the person opening the letter. It was a very ingenious device.

knee.

THE TRUTH TOO LATE.
By four o'clock the next afternoon the Club had gathered ample materials
"for fresh gossip. The formalities attendant on the change of government,"
"the composition of the new Cabinet, the prospects of the election--these"
"alone would have supplied many hours, and besides them, indeed"
"supplanting them temporarily by virtue of an intenser interest, there"
"was the account of the inquest on Benyon's body. Medland had gone to it,"
"almost direct from his final interview with the Governor, and Kilshaw"
"had been there, fresh from a conference with Perry. The inquiry had"
"ended, as was foreseen directly Ned Evans' evidence was forthcoming, in"
a verdict of murder against Gaspard; but the interest lay in the course

who was then on tour in New Lindsey and had been made an honorary member

briefly stated how he had been connected with him in old days.

to both the Martian satellites. To do so safely you must pass the
"last meteorological station, M14, on schedule time plus or minus five"

door-knob.
"“I should like to see it,” said John."
"They entered. An almost full-grown orphan, doing duty as nurse, rose"
"from her task of plain sewing and bobbed a curtsy. The room was clean,"
"comfortless, dark, and cold. Two pictures, prints of the Crucifixion"
"and the Martyrdom of St. Stephen, hung on the walls. There were three"
"narrow, hard beds, two of which were occupied. Some grapes on a chair"

noticed angrily that some flowers which he had sent the day before had
been confiscated.

"Occasionally he had landed--always staying close to the space ship,"
"for Jupiter's gravity made movement a slow and laborious process, and"
he didn't want to be caught too far from security. At such times he
might hear a crashing and splashing and see a reptilian head loom
gigantically at him through the fog. Then he would discharge the
"deadly explosive gun which was Earth's latest weapon, and the creature"
would crash to the ground. The chorus of hissings and bellowings would
"increase as he hastened slowly and laboriously back to the ship,"
indicating that other unseen monsters of the steamy jungle had flocked
to tear the dead giant to pieces and bolt it down.

state. But he had worked only in one comparatively small area of the
northern hemisphere; had never been within thirty thousand miles of
"the red spot. What might lie in that ominous crimson patch, he could"
"not even guess. However, he reflected, he was soon to find out, though"
he might never live to tell about it.
"Shrugging his shoulders, he turned into the fifty story building in"

But the man was no longer to be denied; he kept on urging:
"""One kiss, only one."""
"Here was an appeal which could no longer be resisted, and though"
"half-frightened by the tone of his voice and the look in his eye, the"
Girl let herself be taken into his arms as she murmured:
"""'Tain't no use, I lay down my hands to you."""
"And so it was that, unconscious of the great havoc that was being"
"wrought by the storm, unconscious of the danger that momentarily"
"threatened their lives, they remained locked in each other's arms. The"
Girl made no attempt to silence him now or withdraw her hands from his.
Why should she? Had he not come to Cloudy Mountain to woo her? Was she
not awaiting his coming? To her it seemed but natural that the
"conventions should be as nothing in the face of love. His voice, low and"
"musical, charged with passion, thrilled through her."
"""I love you,"" said the man, with a note of possession that frightened"
"her while it filled her with strange, sweet joy. For months she had"
dreamed of him and loved him; no wonder that she looked upon him as her
hero and yielded herself entirely to her fate.
She lifted her eyes and he saw the love in them. She freed her hands
"from his grasp, and then gave them back to him in a little gesture of"

prophylactic which will destroy any number of these germs if used up to
the ninth day. It is necessary only that you should place five thousand
dollars in an envelope and leave it for me to be called for at the desk
"of the Prince Henry Hotel. When the messenger delivers the money to me,"
the prophylactic will be sent immediately.
"“First of all, take a match and burn this letter to avoid spreading the"
disease. Then change your clothes and burn the old ones. Enclosed you
will find in a germ-proof envelope an exact copy of this letter. The
room should then be thoroughly fumigated. Do not come into close
contact with anyone near and dear to you until you have used the

"“Blackmail!” exclaimed Kennedy, looking intently again at the gelatine"
"on the second page, as I involuntarily backed away and held my breath."
"“Yes, I know,” responded Mrs. Blake anxiously, “but is it true?”"
There could be no doubt from the tone of her voice that she more than
half believed that it was true.
"“I cannot say—yet,” replied Craig, still cautiously scanning the"
apparently innocent piece of gelatine on the original letter which Mrs.
Blake had not destroyed. “I shall have to keep it and examine it.”
On the gelatine I could see a dark mass which evidently was supposed to
contain the germs.

He knew also that deliberate planning could not have accomplished that
result half so well as this encounter with the tools of the Lumber
"Trust. The whole affair had proved a great piece of luck for him,"
thought the young lumberman. His meditation was broken in upon by the
sound of a strange voice.
“I had no idea lumbering was such a strenuous occupation.”
"A moment later Bainbridge was looking into a pair of pleasant, friendly"
eyes set in the handsome face of a man of about fifty. He was roughly
"dressed in well-worn, but finely made fishing clothes, and carried a"
"good trout rod in one hand. There was, too, about the stranger an air of"
forceful capability which attracted the younger man.
"“It’s not usually quite so full of incident,” said Bob; “but I don’t"
believe you’d ever find it exactly tame.”
"The stranger smiled, and made a comprehensive gesture with his hands."
"“And this is your idea of incident,” he murmured whimsically. “I should"
call it something decidedly stronger.”
"He hesitated for an instant, then moved closer to Bob."
"“You’re going downstream, aren’t you? Do you mind if I walk along with"
you? My camp’s down that way.”
Bainbridge acquiesced readily. There was something very taking about the
"stranger, and within ten minutes he found himself chatting as if to an"
"old friend. His companion turned out to be Wolcott Sears, of Boston, on"
a two weeks’ trip in the Maine woods. The name was only vaguely
"familiar, but Bob felt sure from his manner that he was a man of"
affairs. He was tremendously interested in hearing all about the
well if you would summon all the servants of the palace together and arm
"them with such weapons as may be available!"""
"Maria Cristina lifted her head from the shoulder of her Ferdinand, as if"
"she did not at first comprehend Rollo's speech, and was resolved to"
resent an intrusion at such a moment. Whereupon the Scot repeated his
words to such good purpose that the Queen-Regent threw up her hands and
"cried, ""Alas! this happens most unfortunately. We have only old Eugenio"
and a couple of lads in the whole palace since the departure of the
"guards!"""
"""Never mind,"" said Rollo; ""let us make the best of the matter. We will"
muster them; perhaps they will be able to load and fire a musket apiece!
"If I mistake not, the fighting will be at very short range!"""
It was upon this occasion that Señor Fernando Muñoz showed his first
spark of interest.
"""I will go and awake them,"" he said; ""I know where the servants are wont"
"to sleep."""
But on this occasion his fond wife would not permit him to stir.
"""The wicked murderers may have already penetrated to that part of the"
"castle,"" she palpitated, her arms still about his neck, ""and you must"
"not risk your precious life. Let Susana go and fetch them. She is old,"
"and has doubtless made her peace with religion."""
"""Nay, it is not fitting,"" objected Susana with spirit. ""I am a woman,"
and not so old as my lady says. I cannot go gadding about into the
"chambers of all and sundry. Besides, there has been purpose of marriage"
openly declared between me and the Señor Eugenio for upwards of thirty
"of Arthur, and again from the Chorus (which closes the acts, as in"
_Gorboduc_) we learn the great purpose beneath this overwhelming ruin of
"a king and kingdom--to show that the day and the hour do come, however"
"long deferred, when"
"Wrong hath his wreak, and guilt his guerdon bears."
"As before, all action is rigorously excluded from the stage, to be"
"reported, at great length and with tremendous striving after vividness"
"and effect, by one who was present. Dumb Shows before each act continue"
the attempt to balance matters spectacularly. Clearly the only hope of
dramatic advance for disciples of the Senecan school lay in improved
"dialogue. This was possible in four directions, namely, in more stirring"
"topics, in more personal feeling, in shorter speeches, and in a change"
"in the style of language and verse. Unfortunately for Thomas Hughes, it"
"is just here that he fails, and fails lamentably. What is more, he fails"
because of his methods. The dominant desire of the English 'classical'
school was to be impressive. Hence the adoption by Hughes of a ghostly
"introduction and conclusion. His conversations, therefore, must reflect"
"the same idea. He saw, indeed, that long speeches, except at rare"
"intervals, were tedious, and reduced his to reasonable proportions, even"
"making extensive use--as, we shall see, the author of _Damon and"
Pythias_ did before him--of the Greek device of stichomythia. He was
"most anxious, also, to provide stirring topics for his characters to"

"Nathaniel Hawthorne, in his _Marble Faun_, which, by the way, contains"
"the most charming of all the descriptive writing about Rome, put"
"the case none too strongly when he spoke of being ""disgusted with"
"the pretense of holiness and the reality of nastiness, each equally"
"omnipresent"" in the city of the popes. The new government has wrought"
"a great change in this respect, and Rome is in many parts of it now"
quite a clean city.
"There, then, are the facts as to the influence of the Roman Catholic"
"Church. I am, of course, very far from saying that there are no good"
"people in that church. As I have already stated, I believe that there"
"are many good people in it, but my own observation has satisfied me"
that the verdict of history as to the baleful influence of the system
is absolutely correct.
"""What, then,"" some one may ask, ""do the good people in that church"
think of all the immoralities and frauds that it has condoned and
"fostered?"" The answer is that the really good people in that church"
must grieve over them and deplore them just as the good people in other
churches do.

"_P. S._--It is generally believed, and apparently with good reason,"
"that the new Pope, Pius X., is a better man than many of his"
"predecessors, and that he cannot be charged with the immoralities or"
the ambition and avarice which characterized them. Let us hope that he
will have the courage to attempt some real reform in the lives of many
of his clergy.

"who considers himself duped, in his countenance. It had gone ill with La"
Giralda if she had not been able to prove her case. But she held
"something in her hand, the sight of which brought the butcher of Tortosa"
down from his saddle as quickly as if a Cristino bullet had pierced him
to the heart.
"La Giralda was holding out to him an old string of beads, simply carved"
"out of some brown oriental nut, but so worn away by use that the"
stringing had almost cut through the hard and polished shell.
"""My mother's rosary!"" he cried, and sinking on his knees, he devoutly"
received and kissed it. He abode thus a moment looking up to the
"sky--he, the man who had waded in blood during six years of bitter"
warfare. He kissed the worn beads one by one and wept. They were his
mother's way to heaven. And he did not know a better. In which perchance
he was right.
"""Whence gat you this?"" cried Cabrera, rising sharply as a thought struck"
"him; ""my mother never would have parted with these in her life--you"
"plundered it from her body after her death! Quick, out with your story,"
"or you die!"""
"""Nay, little foster-son,"" said La Giralda, ""I was indeed with your"
"mother at the last--when she was shot by Nogueras, and five minutes"
before she died she gave her rosary into my hands to convey to you.
"'Take this to my son,' she said, 'and bid him never forget his mother,"
nor to say his prayers night and morn. Bid him swear it on these sacred
beads!' So I have brought them to you. She kissed them before she died.
"At the risk of my life have I brought it."""
"""And these,"" said Cabrera--""do you know these dogs, La Giralda?"""
"""Tiger-Lily"" was not altogether gone. She looked back, her face"
wrinkling into one of those strangely unbecoming expressions of grim
playfulness.
"""I've half a mind to make an 'At Home' out of YOU!"" she said, nodding"
"at him energetically. ""Only you're not important enough!"""
Villiers burst out laughing. He was not proof against this touch of
"humor, and on a sudden good-natured impulse, sprang to the door and"
shook hands with her.
"""No, indeed, I am not!"" he said, with a charming smile--""Think of"
"it!--I haven't even invented a new biscuit! Come, let me see you into"
"the hall,--I'm really sorry if I've spoken roughly, but I assure you"
"Alwyn's not at all the sort of man you want for interviewing,--he's far"
too modest and noble-hearted. Believe me!--I'm not romancing a
"bit--I'm in earnest. There ARE some few fine, manly, gifted fellows"
"left in the world, who do their work for the love of the work alone,"
"and not for the sake of notoriety, and he is one of them. Now I'm not"
"certain, if you were quite candid with me, you'd admit that you"
yourself don't think much of the people who actually LIKE to be
"interviewed?"""
"His amiable glance, his kindly manner, took the gaunt female by"
"surprise, and threw her quite off her guard. She laughed,--a natural,"
unforced laugh in which there was not a trace of bitterness. He was
"really a delightful young man, she thought, in spite of his"
"old-fashioned, out-of-the-way notions!"
"""Well, perhaps I don't!"" she replied frankly--""But you see it is not my"
"business to think about them at all. I simply 'interview' them,--and I"
"generally find they are very willing, and often eager, to tell me all"
stalk-like legs of his attackers from under them. One of the things
"went down, to twist weakly in a laborious attempt to rise again. But"
"the other, by sheer force of height and reach, began to bear Dex down."
"Savagely he laced out with his fists, battering the pulpy face that"
"was pressing down close to his. The big eyes blinked shut, but the"
four hose-like arms did not relax their clasp. Dex's hands sought
"fiercely for the thing's throat. But it had no throat: the head, set"
"directly on the thin shoulders, defied all throttling attempts."
*       *       *       *       *
"Then, just as Dex was feeling that the end had come, he felt the"
"creature wrench from him, and saw it slide in a tangle of arms and"
"legs over the smooth metal pavement. He got shakily to his feet, to"
see Brand standing over him and flailing out with his fists at an ever
tightening circle of towering figures.
"""Thanks,"" panted Dex. And he began again, tripping the twelve-foot"
"things in order to get them down within reach, battering at the great"
"pulpy heads, fighting blindly in that expressed craving to take as"
many of the creatures into hell with him as he could manage. Beside
"him fought Brand, steadily, coolly, grim of jaw and unblinking of eye."
Already the struggle had gone on far longer than they had dreamed it
might. For some reason the grotesque creatures delayed killing them.
"That they could do so any time they pleased, was certain: if the"
monsters could reach them with their shock-tubes through the double
"insulated hull of the space ship, they could certainly kill them out"
in the open.
Yet they made no move to do so. The deadly tubes were not used. The
"'This is the place,' Steve muttered. 'It will be dawn in another hour."
"What do you think, Master Martin?'"
"'That we had better get off the road,' I answered. 'Take it they found"
him at midnight; the orderly's patience would scarcely last longer.
"Then, if they started after us a quarter of an hour later, they should"
be here in another twenty minutes.'
"'It is an aguey place,' he said doubtfully."
"'It will suit us better than the camp,' I answered."
"No one else expressed an opinion, and Steve, taking my lady's rein,"
led her horse on until he came to the hollow part of the road. Here
"the moonlight disclosed a kind of water-lane, running away between the"
"osiers, at right angles from the road. Steve turned into it, leading"
"my lady's horse, and in a moment was wading a foot deep in water. The"
"Waldgrave followed, then the women. I came last, with Marie's rein in"
"my hand. We kept down the lane about one hundred and fifty paces, the"
"horses snorting and moving unwillingly, and the water growing ever"
"deeper. Then Steve turned out of it, and began to advance, but more"
"cautiously, parallel with the road."
"We had waded about as far in this direction, sidling between the"
"stumps and stools as well as we could, when he came again to a stand"
"and passed back the word for me. I waded on, and joined him. The"
"osiers, which were interspersed here and there with great willows,"
rose above our heads and shut out the moonlight. The water gurgled
"black about our knees. Each step might lead us into a hole, or we"
might trip over the roots of the osiers. It was impossible to see a
"foot before us, or anything above us save the still, black rods and"
other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other
"during the lecture, but not _my_ sister! She hung on every word, took"
"notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser"
really work in those orientation periods.
"""I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,"" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,"
"""but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro"
Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand
"square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of"
"tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that--Wait, I remember"
something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an
edible one. The wild _dunging_ drug is harvested there by criminal
"speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing"
"in recent years. In fact--"""
"""Pardon me, sir,"" I broke in, ""but doesn't _dunging_ come only from"
Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?
"You remember, purser--Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the"
"island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?"""
"The purser nodded slowly. ""I forgot,"" he admitted. ""Sorry, ladies, but"
"the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes."""
"But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one."
"She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while"
I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture
of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the
opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out
with her.
"""Ferdinand,"" Sis said, ""let's go back to our cabin."""
"back of her hand with a most unchildlike gesture, and forthwith"
concealed it in her silken _faja_. Then she laid her hand once more on
the Sergeant's arm.
"""You will lead us, will you not, José Maria?"" she said pleadingly. ""I"
can trust you. You have done many great deeds. My nurse was a woman of
Ronda and told me of your exploits on the road from Madrid to Sevilla.
You will lead us to-night. Only you must leave these three in the palace
"to me. If you will, you shall have also my share of the plunder. But"
"what do I say, I know you are too noble to think only of that--as these"
"wolves do!"""
She cast a haughty glance around upon the gipsies at their card-play.
"""I, that am of Old Castile and noble by four descents, have demeaned"
"myself to mix with _Gitanos_,"" she said, ""but it has only been that I"
might work out my revenge. I told Pépe there of my plan. I showed him
"the way. He was afraid. He told ten men, and they were afraid. Fifty,"
"and they were afraid. Now there are a hundred and more, and were it not"
"that they know that all lies open and unguarded, even I could not lead"
"them thither. But they will follow you, because you are José Maria of"
"Ronda."" The Sergeant took the girl's hand in his. She was shaking as"
"with an ague fit, but her eyes, blue and mild as a summer sky, had that"
within them which was deadlier than the tricksome slippery demon that
"lurks in all black orbs, whether masculine or feminine."
"""Chica,"" he said, ""your wrongs are indeed bitter. I would give much to"
help you to set the balance right. Perhaps I may do so yet. But I cannot
be the commander of these men. They are not of my folk or country. They
have not even asked me to lead them. They are jealous of me! You see it
"as well as I!"""
Something was wrong. The shelling of the back-areas continued; air-raids
became more and more frequent. These were ominous signs.
Then the newspapers arrived. The Somme front had collapsed. The Fifth
Army was in full retreat. The Germans had taken Bapaume and Peronne and
were threatening Amiens.

Had I been living in Germany during the war I would have felt a powerful
"tendency to defend the cause of the Allies, to excuse their misdeeds, to"
"overrate their ability, while being highly critical and censorious of"
every German shortcoming.
"A nation at war is a mob whose very blatancy, injustice and cruelty"
drive one to hatred and opposition. The enemy mob seems less detestable
"because it is out of sight and one thinks almost involuntarily: ""It"
"cannot be as bad as our own."""
I could not bear to hear a victory joyfully announced. The jubilation
"and the self-glorification of the crowd filled me with loathing, and I"
could only think of the intensified slaughter and misery that are the
"price of every victory. They who pay the price, they alone have the"
"right to rejoice, but they do not rejoice. The German mob revealed its"
depravity when it hung out flags in the streets to celebrate the first
"German victories. And, when the first battle of Cambrai was won, London"
jeered at the bereaved and mocked the dead by ringing the joy-bells.
Every genuine patriot is called a traitor in his own country. But
"patriotism, however genuine, is a thing that must be surmounted. There"
"is only one good that war can bring to a nation--defeat. A patriot,"
"loving his own country, would therefore wish his country defeat in war."
to prevent me. I had only to lie close among the rocks until Count
"Hugo left, and then I might plod back on foot and search as I pleased."
"In a flash I saw the poplars, and the road running beneath the"
"ash-tree, and the woman's body lying stiff and stark on the sward. And"
I burned to be there.
Left to myself I should have gone too. But the plan was no sooner
"formed than shattered. While I stood, hotfoot to be about it, and"
"pausing only to consider which way I could steal off most safely, a"
"rustling warned me that some one was coming, and before I could stir,"
a burly trooper broke through the bushes and confronted me. He saluted
me stolidly.
"'Sergeant,' he said, 'the general is waiting for you.'"
'The general?' I said.
"'The Count, if you like it better,' he answered. 'Come, if you"
please.'
"I followed him, full of vexation. It was but a step into the road. The"
"moment I appeared, some one gave the word 'Mount!' A horse was thrust"
"in front of me, two or three troopers who still remained afoot swung"
themselves into the saddle; and I followed their example. In a trice
"we were moving down the valley at a dull, steady pace--southwards,"
"southwards. I looked back, and saw the fir trees and rocks where we"
"had lain hidden, and then we turned a corner, and they were gone."
"Gone, and all round me I heard the measured tramp of the troop-horses,"
"the swinging tones of the men, and the clink and jingle of sword and"
"spur. I called myself a cur, but I went on, swept away by the force of"
"numbers, as the straw by the current. Once I caught Count Hugo's eye"
"fixed on me, and I fancied he had a message for me, but I failed to"
"peculiar conditions of this particular drive, and before Bainbridge"
realized it he had given a brief narrative of his fight with the Lumber
Trust and the events which had grown out of it.
"“You interest me extraordinarily, Mr. Bainbridge,” the older man said,"
"in his crisp, decisive way, when at last they paused at the point"
"several miles below the scene of the last jam, where Sears had to branch"
"off to reach his camp. “Things of this sort always do, for it’s only"
those one has to struggle for which are really worth while. You’ve
"certainly had to fight hard in this case, but you’ve practically won"
"out, haven’t you? After this last fracas I shouldn’t suppose there’d be"
much chance for further interference.”
Bob shrugged his shoulders and smiled a little. “You sadly underestimate
"the power of the trust, Mr. Sears. I shan’t be beyond the chance of"
"interference until the drive is safe in our mill booms at Lancaster, and"
even then it wouldn’t surprise me if they’d try to work some dirty
trick.”
Sears frowned indignantly; then his face brightened.
“In spite of everything I think I should bet on you.” he chuckled.
“There’s a certain vigor in your method of dealing with these people
"which makes for success. I really believe you’ll win, Mr. Bainbridge,"
"and I surely hope so. It has been a great pleasure to meet you, and I"
"trust one to be repeated. I shall be hereabouts for some time yet, and"
may run across you before I leave.”
"Bob warmly reciprocated his feeling, and, after a hearty handshake,"
"turned south along the river, while Sears disappeared in the undergrowth"
to the westward.
"down to earth! Breathless, bewildered, lifted to a height of transport"
"beyond all words, Alwyn gazed upon her in entranced, devout"
"silence,--the vast cathedral seemed to swing round and round in great"
"glittering circles, and nothing was real, nothing steadfast, but that"
"slight, sweet maiden in her soft gray robes, with the Ardath-blossoms"
"gleaming white against her breast! Angel she was,--angel she ever would"
"be,--and yet--what did she SEEM? Naught but:"
"""A child-like woman, wise and very fair,"
"Crowned with the garland of her golden hair!"""
"This, and no more,--and yet in this was all earth and all heaven"
"comprised!--He gazed and gazed, overwhelmed by the amazement of his own"
"bliss,--he could have gazed upon her so in speechless ravishment for"
"hours, when, with a gesture of infinite grace and appeal, she stretched"
out her hands toward him:
"""Speak to me, dearest one!"" she murmured wistfully--""Tell me,--am I"
"welcome?"""
"""O exquisite humility!--O beautiful maiden-timid hesitation! Was"
"she,--even she, God's Angel, so far removed from pride, as to be"
uncertain of her lover's reception of such a gift of love? Roused from
"his half-swooning sense of wonder, he caught those gentle hands, and"
"laid them tenderly against his breast,--tremblingly, and all devoutly,"
"he drew the lovely, yielding form into his arms, close to his"
"heart,--with dazzled sight he gazed down into that pure, perfect face,"
those clear and holy eyes shining like new-created stars beneath the
soft cloud of clustering fair hair!
"""Welcome!"" he echoed, in a tone that thrilled with passionate awe and"
"ecstasy;--""My Edris! My Saint! My Queen! Welcome, more welcome than the"
"“Thank you--Curly,” Bainbridge said in a level voice. “That was"
touch-and-go for a minute.”
"That was all, but somehow Curly knew that what he had done was"
understood and appreciated. In the stress of the peril which the two had
"shared shoulder to shoulder like common brother river hogs, Kollock’s"
anger and hate had vanished utterly. He no longer desired revenge. His
attitude of a scant half hour before seemed small and mean and petty. He
"had saved the life of the man his brother wanted out of the way, and,"
"given the opportunity, he would do it as promptly again."
CHAPTER XIII. THE LIMIT
Curly Kollock’s interest and liking for his boss grew stronger day after
day. There was something about Bob Bainbridge which stirred the finer
"qualities in his nature, and brought twinges of shame to the young"
riverman whenever he thought how near he had come to throwing his lot
with his brother. If Bill ever showed up he resolved to tell him just
"what he thought of him, too. But in the meantime, not being much of a"
"penman, he made no effort to answer the letter. It was sufficient that"
he considered himself cut loose from the whole miserable bunch. If they
were expecting aid from him in their plotting they were doomed to
disappointment.
"More and more often as they descended the Katahdin River, the boy was"
stirred to anger at the constant succession of moves made by that gang
of crooks against the man who fought them practically alone and
singlehanded.
Along the river were several dams placed for the purpose of regulating
the head of water and facilitating the process of driving. They belonged
were moving in and out amongst them. The French had arrived.
"The next morning, about breakfast time, the first shell burst near the"
camp--a short rapid squeal followed by a sharp report. The second shell
"burst a few minutes after, throwing up earth and smoke. A steel fragment"
came sailing over in a wide parabola and struck the foot of a man
"standing in the breakfast queue. He limped to the first-aid hut, looking"
"very pale. When he got there, he had some difficulty in finding his"
"wound, it was so slight."
We paraded and marched off. Several shells burst in the neighbouring
fields. We reached the ration dump and began to load the train. A
civilian arrived with the newspapers. Our N.C.O.'s were powerless to
stop the general stampede that surged towards the paper-vendor.
The Germans had advanced on a wide front ... Armentières had fallen. The
news was several days old and much might have happened since.
We went back to our work and discussed events. We were bullied and
"threatened with arrest, but we talked in groups while we carried cases"
of rations. Would we be involved in the advance? We might even be
captured--that would at least be an experience and a change.
In the evening a few of us went to the St. Martin to see if the old
woman and her daughter had been able to fetch their property away. We
"observed that the windows, where tinned fruit, chocolate, cakes, soap,"
"postcards, and other articles used to be exhibited, had been cleared"
completely. We entered and found one of the girls in tears:
"""All gone--all gone--I show you--you come into de cellar--all de wine"
"gone--bottles all, all broken. English soldiers come in de night and"
take everysing 'vay--ve nussing left--it's de soldiers in de camp over
"""At the same time you are held indemnified for all killings of"
such persons as may stand in your way in the execution of the
"duty laid upon you, and by order of the King himself you hereby"
"take rank as a full Colonel in his service."""
Meanwhile Cabrera had been bending his brows over the note which had
been directed to him personally. He rose and paced the length of the
"garden-wall with the letter in his hand, while Rollo stood his ground"
with an unmoved countenance. Presently he stopped opposite the young man
and stood regarding him intently.
"""I am, I understand, to furnish you with men for this venture,"" he said;"
"""good--but I am at liberty to prove you first. That you are cool and"
"brave I know. We must find out whether you are loyal as well."""
"""I am as loyal as any Spaniard who ever drew breath,"" retorted Rollo,"
"hotly, ""and in this matter I will answer for my companions as well."""
"""And pray in what way, Sir Spitfire?"" said Cabrera, smiling."
"""Why, as a man should,"" said Rollo, ""with his sword or his pistol,"
or--as is our island custom--with his fists--it is all the same to me;
"yes, even with your abominable Spanish knife, which is no true"
"gentleman's weapon!"""
"""I am no unfriend to plainness, sir, either in speech or action,"" said"
"Cabrera; ""I see you are indeed a brave fellow, and will not lessen the"
king's chances of coming to his own by letting you loose on the men
under my command. Still for one day you will not object to ride with
"us!"""
"to them was barred. For a long, dull period the voyagers lay as"
"helpless as if in dry-dock, while wandering herds of seals barked at"
them or bands of walruses ceased their fishing and crept out upon the
ice-pans to observe these invaders of their peace. When an opportunity
"at last presented itself, they threaded their way southward, there to"
"try another approach, and another, and another, until the first of May"
"had come and gone, leaving them but little closer to their goal than"
when they first hove-to. Late one evening they discerned smoke on the
"horizon, and the next morning's light showed a three-masted steamship"
"fast in the ice, a few miles to the westward."
"""That's _The Juliet_,"" Big George informed his companions, ""one of the"
"North American Packers' Association tenders."""
"""She was loading when we left Seattle,"" Boyd remarked."
"""It is Willis Marsh's ship, so he must be aboard,"" supplemented Cherry."
"""She's a wooden ship, and built for this business. If we don't look out"
"he'll beat us in, after all."""
"""What good will that do him?"" Clyde questioned. ""The fish don't bite--I"
"mean run--for sixty days yet."""
Emerson and Balt merely shrugged.
To Cherry Malotte this had been a voyage of dreams; for once away from
"land, Boyd had become his real self again--that genial, irrepressible"
self she had seen but rarely--and his manner had lost the restraint and
coolness which recently had disturbed their relations. Of necessity
"their cramped environment had thrown them much together, and their"
companionship had been most pleasant. She and Boyd had spent long hours
"together, during which his light-heartedness had rivalled that of Alton"
"is how to keep sober. And I want it to be understood from the start--"""
"""Not so much of it now!"" snarled Captain Dove from his cabin. ""You"
attend to your own business--and I'll attend to mine. I know how to
"behave myself--among gentlemen. And, don't you forget, either, that I'm"
"going ashore to play my own hand. I've a card or two up my sleeve,"
"Mister Slyne, that will maybe euchre your game for you--if you try to"
"bluff too high."""
"Slyne swore hotly, under his breath. He would have given a great deal to"
"know exactly what the old man meant by that mysterious threat, and only"
knew that it would be useless to ask him. There was nothing for it but
"to put up with his capricious humours, as patiently as might"
be--although Slyne shivered in anticipation of the strain that might
entail--till he could be dispensed with or got rid of altogether.
"Nor, as it presently appeared, were his fears at all ill-founded. For"
Captain Dove emerged from his cabin got up for shore-going in a guise at
sight of which Slyne could by no means suppress an involuntary groan.
"""I'm all ready now,"" Captain Dove announced. ""Will you pay for a cab if"
"I call one?"""
"""My car's waiting,"" Slyne returned, and, as the old man whistled"
amazedly over that further and unexpected proof that his former
"accomplice's fortunes had changed for the better, ""You look like a fool"
"in that outfit,"" said Slyne. ""The right rig-out for motoring is a tweed"
"suit and a soft cap."""
Captain Dove was very visibly annoyed. He had been at particular pains
"to array himself properly. ""You want to be the only swell in the party,"
"of course!"" he grunted. ""You're jealous, that's what's the matter with"
patriotic politician.
"""I know to whom you refer,"" I said, with bowed head, after a moment's"
"pause.  ""It is currently reported that I love her.  I have loved her.  I"
do not seek to deny it.  When a man sustains such a blow as I sustained
"before we parted, he often rushes to another woman for consolation.  The"
influence of that second woman often prevents him from going to the bad
"altogether.  It has been so in my case."""
"""And you love her now?"" she cried, the fire of fierce jealousy in her"
"eyes.  ""You cannot deny it!"""
"""I do deny it,"" I cried.  ""True, until yesterday I held her in esteem,"
"even in affection; but it is not so now.  All my love for you, Yolande,"
has returned to me.  Our parting has rendered you dearer and sweeter to
"me than ever."""
"""I cannot believe it,"" she exclaimed falteringly."
"""I swear that it is so.  In all my life, although am compelled to treat"
"women with courtesy and sometimes to affect flirtation, because of my"
"profession as a diplomatist, I have loved only one woman--yourself;"" and"
"I raised her chilly hand to my lips, kissing it fervently."
Mine was no mere caprice at that moment.  With an all-consuming passion
"I loved her, and was prepared on her account to make any sacrifice she"
"demanded.  Let the reader remember what had already been told me, and"
"reflect that, like many another man, I loved madly, and was heedless of"
any consequences that might follow.  In this particular I was not alone.
"Thousands before me had been allured to their ruin by a woman's eyes,"
just as thousands of brave women's hearts have been broken and their
lives wrecked by men's false oaths of fidelity.  I have heard wiseacres
is the one common to all tropical countries on which Benjamin Kidd laid
an unerring finger when he referred to the unwisdom of longer permitting
the riches of the tropics to “remain undeveloped with resources running
to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency”. The
Panamanian authorities are making apparently sincere endeavors to
attract new settlers of greater efficiency. In proportion to the success
that attends the efforts the future of Panama will be bright.

CHAPTER XVI
THE INDIANS OF PANAMA
While that portion of the Panama territory that lies along the border of
Colombia known as the Darien is rather ill-defined as to area and to
"boundaries, it is known to be rich in timber and is believed to possess"
gold mines of great richness. But it is practically impenetrable by the
white man. Through this country Balboa led his force on his expedition
"to the unknown Pacific, and was followed by the bloodthirsty Pedrarias"
who bred up in the Indians a hatred of the white man that has grown as
the ages passed. No expedition can enter this region even today except
"I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on"
the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the
"ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like"
the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in
case of emergency. I looked for the _important_ things.
"As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't"
"decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,"
I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity
underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf
"of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make"
"faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do."
"Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the"
wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block
the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed
into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits
"standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the"
Middle Ages.
"""In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of"
"companionway,"" they had the words etched into the glass, ""break glass"
"with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the"
"following fashion."""
"I read the ""following fashion"" until I knew it by heart. _Boy_, I said"
"to myself, _I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get"
into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits
back in Undersea!_
And all the time I was alone. That was the best part.
CHAPTER XXVI
DEEP ROMANY
The news which Sergeant Cardono had to communicate was indeed fitted to
"shake the strongest nerves. If true, it took away from Rollo at once all"
hope of the success of his mission. He saw himself returning disgraced
"and impotent to the camp of Cabrera, either to be shot out of hand, or"
"worse still, to be sent over the frontier as something too useless and"
feeble to be further employed.
"Briefly, the boy's news as repeated by La Giralda to the Sergeant,"
informed Rollo that though the court was presently at La Granja and many
"courtiers in the village of San Ildefonso, the royal guards through fear"
"and hunger had mutinied and marched back to Madrid, and that the gipsies"
were gathering among the mountains in order to make a night attack upon
the stranded and forsaken court of Spain.
In the sergeant's opinion not a moment was to be lost. The object of the
"hill Gitanos was pure plunder, but they would think nothing of"
"bloodshed, and would doubtless give the whole palace and town over to"
"rapine and pillage. Themselves desperate with hunger and isolation, they"
had resolved to strike a blow which would ring from one end of Spain to
the other.
It was their intention (so the imp said) to kill the Queen-Regent and
"her daughter, to slaughter the ministers and courtiers in attendance, to"
"""He is come to do evil to--to Rollo!"" she said to herself, with a slight"
hesitation even in thought when she came for the first time upon the
Christian name.
But there was no hesitation in the swift assurance with which she set
"the rifle-stock to her shoulder, and no mistake as the keen and"
practised eye glanced along the barrel.
"She fired, and with a groan of pain the man fell back outside the"
enclosure.
The sound of Concha's shot was the first tidings to the besieged that
"the gipsies had really arrived. Rollo, stealing lightfoot from post to"
"post, pistol in hand, the Sergeant erect behind the vine-trellis on the"
"balcony between the rearward doors, Etienne and John Mortimer a little"
"farther along on the same side of the château, all redoubled their"
vigilance at the sound. But for the space of an hour or more nothing
"farther was seen or heard north, south, east, or west of the beleaguered"
palace of La Granja.
The gipsies had not had the least idea that their intention was known.
They expected no obstacles till the discharge of Concha's piece put them
"on their guard, and set them to concerting other and more subtle modes"
of attack. It was too dark for those in the château to see whether the
wounded man lay where he had fallen or whether he had been removed by
his comrades.
Rollo hastened back to Concha and inquired in a low voice what it was
she had fired at. Whereupon she told him the story of the man climbing
the railings and how she had stayed his course so suddenly. Rollo made
"no remark, save that she had done entirely right. Then he inquired if"
that he would come to her--that his soul would enter the body of the
"little baby soon about to be born, so that they two might be together in"
life once more.
"And in the dream the lover consented. He would come, he said, into the"
child of the woman he loved.
"When the woman awoke she remembered it all, and the desire of life"
"returned to her again, and all the world was changed because of the new"
life she felt within her. But she told no one then of the dream or of
what was to happen.
"Only she took the greatest care of herself; she ate well, and went"
"frequently to the pagoda with flowers, praying that the body in which"
"her lover was about to dwell might be fair and strong, worthy of him who"
"took it, worthy of her who gave it."
In due time the baby was born. But alas and alas for all her hopes! The
"baby came but for a moment, to breathe a few short breaths, to cry, and"
to die; and a few hours later the woman died also. But before she went
"she told someone all about it, all about the dream and the baby, and"
that she was glad to go and follow her lover. She said that her baby's
"soul was her lover's soul, and that as he could not stay, neither would"
she; and with these words on her lips she followed him out into the
void.
"The story was kept a secret until the husband died, not long"
afterwards; but when I came to the village all the people knew it.
"I must confess that this story is to me full of the deepest reality,"
full of pathos. It seems to me to be the unconscious protestation of
humanity against the dogmas of religion and of the learned. However it

"immediately followed the accident, and lasted some days. There"
"was no sickness, the bowels were confined three days, and there"
was pain across the back and down the thigh.
"On the tenth day he arrived at the Base, when he was lying on"
his back suffering considerable pain. The temperature ranged to
"101°. There was diarrhoea and cystitis, with a considerable"
"amount of pus in the urine, which was very offensive. A small"
"fluctuating spot existed on the back, just to the right of the"
original exit wound which was firmly healed. The abdomen moved
"fairly with respiration in its upper part, but was motionless"
"below, especially in the right iliac fossa; some induration was"
to be felt here. The right thigh was kept flexed.
"During the next few days the pus disappeared from the urine,"
and with this change the induration in the right iliac fossa
increased. An incision (Mr. Gairdner) was made into the
"fluctuating spot behind, and pus evacuated. The patient"
recovered.

"suffering from diarrhoea, but afterwards the bowels were"

"We gathered idly round the disputants, glad of a distraction that would"
help to pass the time. A third person joined in the argument:
"""If 'e bombs 'orspitals an' C.C.S.'s it's our own bloody fault. Look at"
our C.C.S. 'ere. There's a ordnance park and a R.E. dump up the road.
There's a railway in front an' a sidin' where troops is always

"the fields somewhere? I bet we'll cop it one o' these nights, an' serve"
"us right too."""
German aeroplanes had passed overhead almost every clear windless
"night, but the buzz of propellers, that often went on for hours, and the"
dull boom of bombs exploding far away had never caused anything more
than slight uneasiness and apprehension.
"One night, after we had been at the C.C.S. for about a month, we heard"
the uproar of a distant air-raid. Early the next morning a number of
"motor-ambulances arrived with their loads of wounded men. A camp, a mile"
"or two from the station, had been bombed and fifty men had been killed"
"and many more wounded. One of the ""cases"" brought into the theatre had"
been hit on the forehead. The bomb-fragment had not penetrated the
"skull, but had passed along its surface. The scalp hung over the"
"forehead loosely like an enormous flap, the red, jagged edge nearly"
touching the eyebrows. Since then I thought of this man every time there
was an air-raid.
also against other powers active in the Orient.
MONROE DOCTRINE OF THE PAST
'America's relation to this problem is more difficult. Monroeism is
thought to stand in the way. I appreciate the delicacy of venturing to
"discuss the policy of a nation other than my own, but I feel that"
Americans are too sensible to resent an honest expression of opinion.
"Monroeism is not part of the constitution, but the dictum of a"
"statesman. This dictum was made when our planet was very large, before"
the development of steam and electricity. The nations were isolated and
insulated by distance and non-communication.
'At that time American theory and practice relative to foreign affairs
"were in harmony. America was actually self-contained, but to-day the"
world is a tiny ball and America's flag and America's interests are on
"every sea. America is sovereign in Hawaii and the Philippines, and yet"
the American people cling to the idea of leaving distant matters alone.
Nevertheless the state department is widely and intelligently active.
AMERICAN INTEREST WORLD-WIDE
"'Theoretically you do not participate, actually your participation bears"
upon international events everywhere. Witness Secretary Hay's initiative
"respecting the Jews, as well as despatch after despatch aimed at Russian"
aggression in Manchuria. The world's interests are becoming woven into a
solid fabric. Great nations cannot escape the responsibility this
"involves. American theory and practice, in my judgment, will go on"
diverging until the notion of non-participation will be merely an
antiquated abstraction.
mantelpiece as if with purpose of personal assault. At such seasons the
stout old Abigail instantly remitted her attentions and stood perfectly
"well trained and motionless, with the brush and comb in her hand, till"
it pleased her lady to sit down again.
"All the while the gentleman said no word, but watched the development of"
"the scene with the utmost composure, passing his beautiful white fingers"
through his whiskers and moustache after the fashion of a comb. The
"lady's anger waxed higher and higher, and with it her voice also rose in"
an equal ratio. What the end would have been it is difficult to
"prophesy, for the Sergeant, realising that time was passing quickly,"
produced an instrument with a broad flat blade bent at an acute angle to
"the handle, and inserting it sharply into the crack of the French"
"window, opened it with a click which must have been distinctly audible"
"within, even in the height of the lady's argument."
CHAPTER XXXI
THE QUEEN'S ANTE-CHAMBER
Out of the darkness Rollo and the Sergeant stepped quickly into the
"room. Whereupon, small wonder that the lady should scream and fall back"
"into her chair, the waiting-maid drop upon the floor as if she had been"
"struck by a Carlist bullet, or the gentleman with the long and glossy"
whiskers suspend his caresses and gaze upon the pair with dropped jaw
and open mouth!
At his entrance Rollo had taken off his hat with a low bow. The Sergeant
"exactly how much--or, rather, how little money Slyne had had in his"
"pockets when he went ashore. And, if Slyne had already, within four and"
"twenty hours, been able to turn that over at a profit sufficient to"
"provide himself with a fur coat and diamonds, it might perhaps pay"
"Captain Dove to hear what he had to propose. Slyne, reading all the old"
"man's thoughts, could see that he had decided to temporise."
"""But, I can do with a damn sight less of _your_ back-chat!"" rumbled"
"Captain Dove, not to be put down without protest. ""If you've come back"
"on board to offer me a founder's share in any new gold-brick factory,"
"fire straight ahead--and be short about it. It'll save time, too, if"
you'll take it from me again that I'd rather have your room than your
"company."""
"And at that, Slyne made his next considered move."
"""All right,"" he said in a tone of the most utter contempt. ""That's"
enough. I'm off.
"""I came back to do you a good turn--although few men, in my position,"
"would ever have looked near you again,"" he paused in the doorway to"
"remark acridly. ""But I can see now what's the matter with you--and I"
only wish I had noticed it in time to save myself all it has cost me.
It's senile decay you're suffering from. You're far too old to be of any
"more use--even to yourself. You're in your dotage, and you'll soon be in"
"an asylum--for pauper lunatics!"""
He had evidently lost his own temper at last. And Captain Dove was
visibly pleased with that result of his tactics; as a rule he was better
"able to cope with Slyne on a basis of mutual abuse, heated on both"
sides; Slyne cool and collected had him at a disadvantage.
"sun shone no more, and the merriment was stilled for ever. So she"
"thought, and, if she were not right, it needed a philosopher to tell her"
"so; and then she would not have believed him, but caught her woe closer"
"to her heart, and nursed it with fiercer tenderness against his shallow"
"prating. Perhaps he might have told her too, that it is cruel kindness"
"unasked to set people on a pinnacle, and, when they cannot keep foothold"
"on that slippery height, to scorn their fall. Other things such an one"
"might well have said, but more wisely left unsaid; for cool reason is a"
"blister to heartache, and heartache is not best cured by blisters. Never"
yet did a child stop crying for being told its pain was nought and would
soon be gone. Yet this prescription had been Lady Eynesford's--although
"she was no philosopher, to her knowledge--for Alicia, and it had left"
"the patient protesting that she felt no pain at all, and yet feeling it"
all the more.
"""What do you accuse me of? Why do you speak to me?"" she had burst out."
"""What is it to me what he has done or not done? What do you mean, Mary?"""
Before this torrent of questions Lady Eynesford tactfully retreated a
little way. A warning against hasty love dwindled to an appeal whether
"so much friendliness, such constant meetings, either with daughter or"
"with father, were desirable."
"""I'm sure I'm sorry for the poor child,"" she said; ""but in this"
"world----"""
"""Suppose it's all a slander!"""
"""My dear Alicia, do they say such things about a man in his position"
"unless there's something in them?"""
"""It's nothing to me,"" said Alicia again."
"""I do not recognize you when you talk like that!"" she exclaimed."
"""That is surprising, seeing that you have made me what I am,"" he"
"answered. Then he made a quick gesture of apology. ""Forgive me, that"
sounded like a reproach or a complaint. I make neither. That is not my
"purpose."""
"""And yet you have the right,"" she said, drawing a deep breath, ""you"
"have every right, Nehal. It does not matter what the others did to"
you. I know that does not count an atom in comparison to my
"responsibilities. You trusted me as you trusted no one else, and I"
deceived you. So you have the right to hate me as you hate no one
"else. And yet--is it not something, does it not mitigate my fault a"
"little, that I deceived myself far, far more than I ever deceived"
"you?"" He raised his eyebrows. There was mockery in the movement, and"
"she went on, desperately resolute: ""I played at loving you, Nehal. I"
played a comedy with you for my own purposes. And one day it ceased to
be a comedy. I did not know it. I did not know what was driving me to
"tell the truth, and reveal myself to you in the ugliest light I could."
I only knew it was something in me stronger than any other impulse of
"my life. I know what it is now, and you must know, too. Can't you"
"understand? If it had been no more than a comedy, you must have found"
me out--months ago. But you never found me out. It was _I_ who told
"you what I had done and who I was--"""
"""Why did you tell me?"" He took an involuntary step toward her."
Something in his face relaxed beneath the force of an uncontrollable
emotion. He was asking a question which had hammered at the gates of
"his mind day after day and in every waking hour. ""Why?"" he repeated."
"""I have told you--because I had to. I had to speak the truth. I"
couldn't build up my new life on an old lie. You had to know. I had
"the wholesale slaughter, not only of those in the palace, but also of"
the inhabitants of the town of San Ildefonso.
"Then in her turn La Giralda told of her visit to the pavilion, of the"
"little Queen, passionate, joyous, kindly natured, absolutely Spanish,"
till the hearts of her hearers melted to the tale.
"""Our orders are to capture her and her mother the Regent,"" said Rollo,"
"thoughtfully. ""It would therefore serve our purpose but ill if we"
permitted these two to be sacrificed to the bloodthirsty fury of a mob
"of plunderers!"""
"""Then the sooner we find ourselves within the gates, the more chance we"
"shall have of saving them both!"" said the Sergeant. ""Serve out the"
"_puchero_, La Giralda!"""
Concha had taken no part in the discussion. But she had listened with
"all her ears, and now in the pause that followed she declared her"
unalterable intention of making one of the party.
"""I also am of Andalucia,"" she said with calm determination, ""there are"
two others of my country here who will answer for me. You cannot leave
"me alone, and La Giralda will be needed as guide when once you reach the"
"palace precincts. I shall not be in the way, I promise you, and if it"
"comes to gun and pistol, there I think you will not find me wanting!"""
"In his heart and though he made several objections, Rollo was glad"
enough to give way. For with all the unknown dangers of the night before
"them, and the certainty of bloodshed when the gipsies should attack, he"
relished still less the thought of leaving Concha alone in that pit on
the chill side of Guadarrama.
had acquired enough brazenness in the course of the summer not to
"hesitate, and approached the loud-voiced old man, holding out their palms"
"and clamoring: ""Money!"" But that did not suit the old man, who entered the"
"car forthwith, urging his companions to hurry. The driver, no doubt"
"thinking of his own tips, felt he would serve his passengers best by"
"driving off with them at once. So off he went. A toot of the horn, and a"
rapid fanfare--tara-ra-boom-de-ay!
"The spectators turned homeward, talking about the illustrious visitors."
"Foreign lands--ah, no, this country will not bear comparison with them!"
"""Did you see how tall the younger lord was?"" ""And did you see the other"
"one, the one with the skirts and the northern lights?"""
"But some of the homeward-turning bumpkins, such as the Olaus family, had"
more serious matters on their minds. Olaus for the first time understood
"what he had read in the paper so many times, that the Norwegian elementary"
school is a worthless institution because it does not teach English to the
"children of the lower orders. Here were his boys, losing a handsome tip"
merely because they could not swear back intelligibly at the gentleman
with the northern lights. The boys themselves had also something to think
"about: ""That driver, that scoundrel, that southerner! But just wait!"" They"
had heard that bits of broken bottle were very good for tires....

"I return to her knapsack and her clothes, and the reason why I do so is"
that Eilert is so little to be trusted. I want to count her clothes to
make sure none of them disappear; it was a mistake not to have done so at
once.
It may seem as though I kept returning to these clothes and thinking about
them; but why should I do that? At any rate it is now evident that I was
"multifariousness is at hand. Hasten the day, and save us from"
proletarian homogeneity and khaki all-alikeness.
"I love my indomitable coarse men from mountain Sardinia, for their"
"stocking-caps and their splendid, animal-bright stupidity. If only the"
"last wave of all-alikeness won't wash those superb crests, those caps,"
away.
And it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there;
"they were the women of the village, and the girls of her own age. But"
the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all.
"He made his way down to Melbustad in flying leaps, and howled and barked"
"in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they"
"followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,"
"and climbed the hills; and when he drew near, there stood a number of"
"horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,"
"looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting"
"together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people"
"from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At"
"that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one"
"larger than the other, came shooting out about his legs. When he went"
"in, there sat the maiden in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing"
"but the ring on her little finger, then all would have been complete."
"""In heaven's name, what has happened here?"" he asked, as he looked"
"around. All the silverware was still on the table, but all the tasty"
"dishes had turned to moss and toadstools, and frogs and toads and the"
like.
"""What does it all mean?"" said he. ""You are sitting here in all your"
"glory, just like a bride?"""
was thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists
"weren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd"
"always felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,"
rather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill
"of the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty"
sort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better--more
"disciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,"
which helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.
*       *       *       *       *
"The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was"
"also glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though"
he trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.
"Still, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even"
the Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!
Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal
"features, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the"
tape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had
"handed him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for"
"next year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet"
"minds--profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising"
"simplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were"
alike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical
"shorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines."
The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice
nervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly
put it away. No one spoke.
"Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. ""Section Five, Question"
"friendship,"" she answered with a smile.  ""I really wonder that I did not"
"object to her in the days long ago."""
"""Ah!""  I laughed, ""you certainly had no cause.  It is true that we have"
been good friends ever since the day when she arrived home from the
"convent-school at Bruges, a prim young miss with her hair tied up with"
"ribbon.  Thrown constantly together, as we were, I became her male"
confidant and intimate friend; hence my licence to give her counsel in
many matters and sometimes to criticise those actions of which I don't
"approve."""
"""Then if that is so, you care a little for her--just a little?  Now"
"admit it."""
"""I don't admit anything of the kind,"" I answered frankly.  ""For five"
"years we have been constantly together; and times without number, at"
"Lady Barmouth's request, I have acted as her escort here and there,"
until she looks upon me as a kind of necessary appendage who has a right
to chaff her about her flirtations and annoy her by judicious sarcasm.
"I don't entertain one single spark of love for her.  In brief, she has"
"developed into an essentially smart girl, in the true sense of the word,"
and by reason of our constant companionship knows that to attempt a
flirtation with me would result in a most dismal failure.  I accused her
"once, not long ago, of having designs upon my heart, whereupon she"
replied that to accomplish such a thing would be about as easy as to win
the affection of the bronze Neptune in the garden-fountain of the
"Embassy."""
"""You have been seen together a great deal of late?"""
"""Who told you so?"""
"'You loved her so much,' I said. 'She was such a good wife to you."
Surely you would like to live with her again.'
"'But all that,' she replied, 'was in a former life.'"
Now she loved only her present father and mother. The last life was like
"a dream. Broken memories of it still remained, but the loves and hates,"
"the passions and impulses, were all dead."
Another little boy told me once that the way remembrance came to him was
"by seeing the silk he used to wear made into curtains, which are given"
"to the monks and used as partitions in their monasteries, and as walls"
to temporary erections made at festival times. He was taken when some
"three years old to a feast at the making of a lad, the son of a wealthy"
"merchant, into a monk. There he recognised in the curtain walling in"
part of the bamboo building his old dress. He pointed it out at once.
This same little fellow told me that he passed three months between his
death and his next incarnation without a body. This was because he had
"once accidentally killed a fowl. Had he killed it on purpose, he would"
have been punished very much more severely. Most of this three months he
"spent dwelling in the hollow shell of a palm-fruit. The nuisance was, he"
"explained, that this shell was close to the cattle-path, and that the"
lads as they drove the cattle afield in the early morning would bang
with a stick against the shell. This made things very uncomfortable for
him inside.
It is not an uncommon thing for a woman when about to be delivered of a
"baby to have a dream, and to see in that dream the spirit of someone"
"asking for permission to enter the unborn child; for, to a certain"
"extent, it lies within a woman's power to say who is to be the life of"
her child.
"without undue hostility to strangers, they discourage their incursions."

A GIRL OF THE CHOCO TRIBE]
“Their means of persuasion are adjusted to the importance of the
intruder. They do not hesitate to shoot at any negro of the nearby
settlements poaching on their cocoanuts or other products; the trader or
any occasional visitor is very seldom allowed to stay ashore at night;
the adventurers who try to go prospecting into Indian territory are
invariably caught and shipped back to the next Panamanian port”.
Among the men of the San Blas tribe the land held by their people is
"regarded as a sacred trust, bequeathed to them by their ancestors and to"
be handed down by them to the remotest posterity. During the early days
of the Canal project it was desired to dig sand from a beach in the San
Blas country. A small United States man-of-war was sent thither to
"broach the subject to the Indians, and the Captain held parley with the"
chief. After hearing the plea and all the arguments and promises with
which it was strengthened the old Indian courteously refused the
privilege:
"“He who made this land”, said he, “made it for Cuna-Cuna who live no"
"longer, for those who are here today and also for the ones to come. So"
it is not ours only and we could not sell it”.
"To this decision the tribe adhered, and the wishes of the aborigines"
have been respected. It has been the policy of the United States to
avoid any possibility of giving offense to the native population of the
"said ""with all her own private grudge against the present ministry"
she felt _au fond_ she was _British_; she must range herself in time
"of war with her own people."""
Mrs. Warren went much farther. She was not very voluble nowadays.
The German occupation of her villa had given her a mental and
physical shock from which she never recovered. She often sat quite
silent and rather huddled at meal times and looked the old woman
now. In such a conversation as this she roused herself and her voice
"took an aggressive tone. ""My daughter write to her friends to ask"
them to obstruct the government at such a time as this? _Never!_ I'd
"disown her if she did, I'd repudiate her! She may have had her own"
"turn-up with 'em. I was quite with her there. But that, so to"
"speak, was only a domestic quarrel. We're British all through, and"
don't you forget it--sir--(she added deprecatingly): British _all
"through_ and we're goin' to beat Germany yet, _you'll_ see. The"
"British navy never _has_ been licked nor won't be, this time."""
Colonel von Giesselin did not insist. He seemed depressed himself at
"times, and far from elated at the victories announced in his own"
newspapers. He would in the dreary autumn evenings show them the
photographs of his wife--a sweet-looking woman--and his two
"solid-looking, handsome children, and talk with rapture of his home"
"life. Why, indeed, was there this War! His heart like his Emperor's"
bled for these unhappy Belgians. But it was all due to the
"Macchiavellian policy of ""Sir Grey and Asquiss."" If Germany had not"
felt herself surrounded and barred from all future expansion of
trade and influence she would not have felt forced to attack France
"and invade Belgium. Why, see! All the time they were talking,"
"barbarous Russia, egged on by England, was ravaging East Prussia!"
"Then, in other moods, he would lament the war and the policy of"
"“It's rather a mad notion, is n't it?”"
"“I don't think so at all,” replied Miss Lindon in a most disconcertingly"
matter-of-fact tone. “The only thing is that since poor papa died I've
"had so little to do with gentlemen, and have forgotten their ways."
"You see, dear, you have put me quite in a flutter. How do I know, for"
"instance, what you would like to have for breakfast? Your dear"
grandpapa used to have only one egg boiled for two minutes--he was
most particular--and a piece of dry toast; whereas I well remember
Mrs. Brownlow telling me that her husband used to eat a hearty meal of
"porridge and eggs and bacon, with an underdone beefsteak to follow. So"
"you see, dear, I have no rule which I could follow; you would have to"
tell me.”
"“That's quite a detail,” said John, rather touched by her unselfish,"
"if tangential, dealing with the proposal. “The main point is,” said he,"
"moving a step or two forward, “would you care to come and play propriety"
for me and this daughter of misery?”
“Do you really want me to?”
"“Naturally, since I 've asked you.”"
"She rose and came up to him. “My dear boy,” she said with wet eyes, “I"
"know I'm not a clever woman, and often when clever people like you talk,"
I don't in the least understand what they 're talking about; but I did
"love your dear mother with all my heart, and I would do anything in the"
wide world for her son.”
"John took her hand and looked down into her foolish, kind face, which"
wore for the moment the dignity of love. “I'm afraid it will mean an
"upon you."""
"""Your remarks, Cary,"" I observed, ""are deficient in tact. You might,"
"at least, pretend to believe that my personal charm has won for me"
"Dawson's affection. As a matter of fact, he cares not a straw for my"
_beaux yeux_; his motives are crudely selfish. He thinks that it is in
"my power to contribute to the greater glory of Dawson, and he"
cultivates me just as he would one of his show chrysanthemums. He has
"done me the honour to appoint me his biographer extraordinary."""
"""I am sure you are wrong,"" cried Cary. ""He was most frightfully angry"
about that story of ours in _Cornhill_. He demanded from me your name
"and address, and swore that if I ever again disclosed to you official"
secrets he would proceed against me under the Defence of the Realm
"Act. He was a perfect terror, I can assure you."""
"""And yet he always carries that story about with him in his"
breast-pocket; he has summoned me here to see him at his work; and you
have been commanded to tell me everything which you know! My dear
"Cary, do not be an ass. You are too simple a soul for this rather"
"grubby world. In your eyes every politician is an ardent,"
"disinterested patriot, and every soldier or sailor a knightly hero of"
"romance. Human beings, Cary, are made in streaks, like bacon; we have"
"our fat streaks and our lean ones; we can be big and bold, and also"
very small and mean. Your great man and your national hero can become
"very poor worms when, so to speak, they are off duty. But I didn't"
"come here, at great inconvenience, to talk this sort of stuff at"
midnight. Go ahead; give me the details of this sabotage case which is
baffling Dawson and the naval authorities; let me hear about the
"cutting of those electric wires."""
"""It is, as I told you, in my note, a queer business. The _Antinous_, a"
"courage, I think we should have stayed there till daylight, and been"
caught like birds limed on a bough.
"As it was, we plunged and strove for more than an hour in that place,"
"the dark sky above us, the quaking bog below, the women's weeping in"
"our ears. Then, at last, when I had almost given up hope, we struggled"
"out one by one upon the road, and stood panting and shaking,"
astonished to find solid ground under our feet. We had still two miles
"to walk, but on dry soil; and though at another time the task might"
"have seemed to the women full of adventure and arduous, it failed to"
frighten them after what we had gone through. Steve took Fraulein
"Anna, and I one of the women. My lady and the Waldgrave went hand in"
"hand; the one giving, I fancy, as much help as the other. For Marie,"
"her small, white face was a beacon of hope in the darkness. In the"
marsh she had never failed or fainted. On the road the tears came into
my eyes for pity and love and admiration.
"At length Steve bade us stand, and leaving us in the way, plunged into"
"the denser blackness of a thicket, which lay between it and the river."
"I heard him parting the branches before him, and stumbling and"
"swearing, until presently the sounds died away in the distance, and we"
remained shivering and waiting. What if the horses were gone? What if
they had strayed from the place where he had tethered them early in
"the day, or some one had found and removed them? The thought threw me"
into a cold sweat.
"Then I heard him coming back, and I caught the ring of iron hoofs. He"
"had them! I breathed again. In a moment he emerged, and behind him a"
string of shadows--five horses tied head and tail.
'Quick!' he muttered. He had been long enough alone to grow nervous.
"'We are two hours gone, and if they have not yet discovered him they"
leaning right over his patient. I had been conscious of a powerful
"impulse to duck down, but I grasped the table and gave way to the"
impulse so far as to lean slightly forward. This compromise saved me
from any violent expression of fear. The Sister was the only one of us
who showed no sign of fear at all.
The surgeon went on with his work and extracted several fragments of
bone from the injured limb. A few seconds passed and suddenly the
electric light went out in accordance with the orders that decreed that
all lights should be extinguished on the approach of hostile aeroplanes.
The surgeon cursed loudly and the Sister fetched an electric torch which
"she held over the knee. The operation continued, but it was not long"
before anti-aircraft fire broke out once more. Then there was a weird
"bustling, rushing sound, followed by a roar that again shook the theatre"
and rattled the windows. Six explosions followed in rapid succession.
"This time the orderly controlled himself, for he knew the Sister was"
"watching. Nevertheless, his knees trembled violently. The Sister held"
the torch steadily and the surgeon paused for a moment and went on with
the operation as soon as all was quiet.
In a few minutes it was finished. The wound was dressed and bandaged and
the patient carried away.
I stepped out into the clear night. The sky was thronged with glittering
"stars. Everything seemed strangely peaceful. I walked round the station,"
"trying to find out where the bombs had fallen, but nobody knew. I went"
"to the marquee and found Private Trotter sitting there, breathless and"
white. The neighbouring C.C.S. a few hundred yards away had been hit. A
Sister and an orderly had been killed and several patients wounded.
"""It didn't 'alf put me wind up,"" said Trotter, excitedly. ""When the"

"83,648. If a foreign professor would not come and serve in India for the"
"same remuneration as he obtained in his own country, the witness would"
certainly not force him to come.
"83,649. (Mr. Abdur Rahim). Recruitment for the Educational Service"
"should be made in the first place in India, if suitable men were"
available; but if not then he would allow the best outsiders to be
brought in. In the present state of the country it would be very easy to
fill up many of the chairs by selecting the best men in India.
"83,650. The aim of the universities should be to promote two classes of"
"work--first, research; and secondly, an all-round sound education. Men"
of different types would be required for these two duties.
"83,651. (Mr. Madge). Any idea that the educational system of India was"
"so far inferior to that of England, that Indians, who had made their"
"mark, had done so, not because of the educational system of the country,"
"but in spite of it, was quite unfounded. The standard of education"
prevailing in India was quite up to the mark of several British
universities. It was as true of any other country in the world as of
"India that education was valued as a means for passing examinations, and"
"not only for itself, and there was no more cramming in India than"
elsewhere.
"83,652. The West certainly brought to the East a modern spirit, which"
"was very valuable, but it would be dearly purchased by the loss of an"
honorable career for competent Indians in their own country.
"83,653. The educational system in India had in the past been too"
"mechanical, but a turn for the better was now taking place and the"
"universities were recognising the importance of research work, and were"
"full of rocks, but it is straight. It will lead us somewhere, not round"
and round and round again--it will take us somewhere. And there is a
"light,' they said, 'before us, the light of a star. It is very small"
"now, but it is always steady; it never flickers or wanes. It is the star"
of Truth. Under that star we shall find that which we seek.'
"And so they went upon their road, toiling upon the rocks, falling now"
"and then, bleeding with wounds from the sharp points, sore-footed, but"
strong-hearted. And ever as they went they were farther and farther from
"the forest, farther and farther from the glades and the flowers with"
deadly scents; they heard less and less the crack of the whip of Time
falling upon the wanderers' shoulders.
"The star grew nearer and nearer, the light grew greater and greater, the"
"false lights died behind them, until at last they came out of the"
"forest, and there they found the lake that washes away all desire under"
the sun of Truth.
They had won their way. Time and Life and Fight and Struggle were behind
"them, could not follow them, as they came, weary and footsore, into the"
Great Peace.
"And of those who were left behind, of those who stayed in the glades to"
"gather the deadly flowers, to be driven ever forward by the whip of"
Time--what of them? Surely they will learn. The kindly whip of Time is
behind: he will never let them rest in such a deadly forest; they must
"go ever forward; and as they go they grow more and more weary, the"
"glades are more and more distasteful, the heavy-scented blossoms more"
and more repulsive. They will find out the thorns too. At first they
"forgot the thorns in the flowers. 'The blossoms are beautiful,' they"
"said; 'what care we for the thorns? Nay, the thorns are good. It is a"
pleasure to fight with them. What would the forest be without its
"body into which we may be born. It is the first duty of a monk, of him"
"who is trying to lead the purer life, to kill all these affections, or"
rather to blend them into one great compassion to all the world alike.
"'Gayüna,' compassion, that is the only passion that will be left to"
us. So say the learned.
"I met a little girl not long ago, a wee little maiden about seven years"
"old, and she told me all about her former life when she was a man. Her"
"name was Maung Mon, she said, and she used to work the dolls in a"
travelling marionette show. It was through her knowledge and partiality
"for marionettes that it was first suspected, her parents told me, whom"
she had been in her former life. She could even as a sucking-child
manipulate the strings of a marionette-doll. But the actual discovery
"came when she was about four years old, and she recognised a certain"
"marionette booth and dolls as her own. She knew all about them, knew"
"the name of each doll, and even some of the words they used to say in"
"the plays. 'I was married four times,' she told me. 'Two wives died, one"
"I divorced; one was living when I died, and is living still. I loved her"
"very much indeed. The one I divorced was a dreadful woman. See,'"
"pointing to a scar on her shoulder, 'this was given me once in a"
quarrel. She took up a chopper and cut me like this. Then I divorced
her. She had a dreadful temper.'
It was immensely quaint to hear this little thing discoursing like this.
"The mark was a birth-mark, and I was assured that it corresponded"
exactly with one that had been given to the man by his wife in just such
a quarrel as the one the little girl described.
The divorced wife and the much-loved wife are still alive and not yet
old. The last wife wanted the little girl to go and live with her. I
asked her why she did not go.
"tapering towards the end are made. The real Kula article, in which"
"the discs are much thinner, smaller in diameter and even in size from"
"one end of the necklace to the other, these were introduced into the"

"of the following chapters (Chapter XXI), where the other branches of"
the Kula are described.

"Now, having come to an end of this digression on kaloma, let us return"
"for another short while to our Sinaketan party, whom we have left"
on the Lagoon of Sanaroa. Having obtained a sufficient amount of the
"shells, they set sail, and re-visiting Tewara and Gumasila, stopping"
"perhaps for a night on one of the sandbanks of Pilolu, they arrive at"
last in their home Lagoon. But before rejoining their people in their
"villages, they stop for the last halt on Muwa. Here they make what is"
"called tanarere, a comparison and display of the valuables obtained"
"on this trip. From each canoe, a mat or two are spread on the sand"
"beach, and the men put their necklaces on the mat. Thus a long row of"
"valuables lies on the beach, and the members of the expedition walk"
"up and down, admire, and count them. The chiefs would, of course,"
"have always the greatest haul, more especially the one who has been"
the toli'uvalaku on that expedition.
"After this is over, they return to the village. Each canoe blows its"
"conch shell, a blast for each valuable that it contains. When a canoe"
"has obtained no vaygu'a at all, this means great shame and distress"
"for its members, and especially for the toliwaga. Such a canoe is"
"said to bisikureya, which means literally 'to keep a fast.'"
Thus far what we call civilization has dealt less harshly with the
Indians of the Isthmus than with our own. They have at least survived it
and kept a great part of their territory for their own. The “squaw-man”
who figures so largely in our own southwestern Indian country is unknown
there. Unquestionably during the feverish days of the Spaniards’ hunt
"for gold the tribes were frightfully thinned out, and even today"
sections of the country which writers of Balboa’s time describe as
thickly populated are desert and untenanted. Yet much land is still held
"by its aboriginal owners, and unless the operation of the Canal shall"
turn American settlement that way will continue so to be held. The
Panamanian has not the energy to dislodge the Indians nor to till their
lands if he should possess them.
"Many studies of the Panama Indians as a body, or of isolated tribes,"
"have been made by explorers or scientists, and mainly by French or"
Spanish students. The Smithsonian Institution catalogues forty-seven
publications dealing with the subject. But there is an immense mine of
anthropological information yet to be worked in the Isthmus. It is not
"to be acquired readily or without heavy expenditure of energy, patience"
and money. A thoroughly scientific exploring expedition to unravel the
"riddle of the Darien, to count and describe the Indian tribes of the"
"Isthmus, and to record and authenticate traditions dating back to the"
"Spanish days, would be well worth the while of a geographical society, a"
university or some patron of exploring enterprises.
CHAPTER XVII
SOCIAL LIFE ON THE CANAL ZONE
"himself into an armchair with another laugh, telling Grey he was sorry"
"his knaves of servants, who looked for perquisites everywhere, had let"
"in this flood of rogues upon him, but added that he must needs have the"
"wherewithal to cut a proper figure in London town, and forthwith set"
about the business of ordering an outfit for the young man which almost
took his guest’s breath away.
"""Poof!"" he cried, when the latter strove to remonstrate, ""you have"
plenty of money; and these rascals can wait if it suits your pleasure.
"Father’s memory!  Oh, be hanged to all such mawkish sentiment!  You need"
not think less of your father because you wear a blue coat in lieu of a
black! Rabbit me! but you are of a different world from this if you keep
"alive your father’s memory for six months after his decease!  No, no;"
you must cut a figure.  Sir Hugh’s name is clean forgot by now. I’ll eat
my boots if ’tis not so.  I’ll have you as gay as my fancy paints you.
"No black—no sables for the gentleman, I tell you.  Let us see those"
"other patterns.  Ah! here is something more like."""
"Grey submitted.  In sooth, he cared but little for the colour of his"
"clothes, or the set of his hat, or the cut of his coat.  He let Lord"
"Sandford have his way for the most part, only insisting here and there"
"upon soft and tender tints, and showing a predilection for white, which"
his friend quite approved.
"""You shall be a foil to me, not a rival.  I have learned that art from"
the ladies.  I like to blaze like old Sol in his strength; you shall
rather recall gentle Luna amid her galaxy of stars.  Faugh! One’s tongue
"gets into this silly trick of speech, so that one cannot drop it even"
betwixt man and man!  But you are right to think that white becomes you
"well.  You will look a pretty fellow, in all conscience, when you have"
"added a peruke to your other adornments."""
"softly crooning in an unknown tongue over the poor dead babe, she"
"lovingly closed its eyes, and taking a sheet from a wall-press that"
"stood partially open, she began to enwrap the little girl in its crisp"
"white folds. The Spaniards are like the Scottish folk in this, that they"
have universally stores of the best and finest linen.
La Giralda was about to lay the wooden puppet aside as a thing of little
"worth, but something in the clutch of the small dead hands touched and"
troubled her. She altered her intention.
"""No, you shall not be parted!"" she said, ""and if there be a resurrection"
"as the priests prate of--why, you shall e'en wake with the doll in your"
"arms!"""
"So the pair, in death not divided, were wrapt up together, and the gipsy"
woman prepared to carry her light burden afield. But before doing so she
"went to the bed. It was an ancient woman who lay thereon, clutching the"
"bed-clothes, and drawn together with the last agony. La Giralda gazed at"
her a moment.
"""You I cannot carry--it is impossible,"" she muttered; ""you must take"
"your chance--even as I, if so be that the plague comes to me from this"
"innocent!"""
"Nevertheless, she cast another coverlet over the dead woman's face, and"
"went down the broad stairs of red brick, carrying her burden like a"
"precious thing. La Giralda might be no good Catholic, no fervent"
"Protestant, but I doubt not the First Martyr of the faith, the Preacher"
"of the Mount, would have admitted her to be a very fair Christian. On"
the whole I cannot think her chances in the life to come inferior to
"those of the astute Don Baltasar Varela, Prior of the Abbey of"
"Montblanch, or those of many a shining light of orthodoxy in a world"
which had acted upon him like a charm.  It brought back to him the
"memory of his mother, and her noble dignity.  The look in her eyes"
"recalled those things that he had learned at her knee, and those"
aspirations after true greatness of life which she had cherished and
"fostered. Suddenly his present life looked to him utterly sordid, mean,"
"and unworthy; and in a burst of confidence, for which he could have"
"given no reason, he told her all his tale, encouraged by the soft and"
"earnest glances of her beautiful eyes, although she scarcely spoke a"
word from beginning to end.
And now she looked at him with a great compassion in her face.
"""Oh, it is sad, it is sad!"" she said in her earnest musical tones.  ""I"
know a little how sad it is.  I see it too.  But you are a man.  You are
"strong, you are your own master.  Why do you let yourself be made the"
"sport and plaything of fate?  Oh, do not do it! Rise to your calling as"
"a man, as a gentleman, as a Christian!  You can—I know you can!  I read"
it in your face!  What is Lord Sandford to you? The acquaintance of a
few weeks.  What are his comrades to you?  You know that in your heart
you despise them.  Then will you make yourself as one of them?  Will you
"sink to their level?  Oh no, no, no!  Break the fetters; they cannot be"
"fast riveted yet.  Break them, and stand a free man, and then see what"
"the world has to offer you."""
"She was gazing at him now, not shyly, not as a maiden archly coquetting"
"with a handsome young swain, but as a woman yearning to reclaim one"
"whose footsteps had well-nigh slipped in the mire, and whose whole soul"
was stirred by the effort.
"Grey listened like a man who dreams; and yet his eyes were on fire, and"
"his heart was kindled to a great flame—shame at his own weakness,"
yearnings after vanished memories and half-forgotten aspirations
entertained it.  It was decided that the rubbish left after some
repairs had been done to the barracks should be used for mending and
"filling up the ditches in their street, and for the transport of this"
"five horses were given by the fire brigade.  Still more, they even saw"
the necessity of laying a drain-pipe through the street.  This and many
other things vastly increased the popularity of the teacher.  He wrote
petitions for them and published various remarks in the newspapers.
"For instance, on one occasion Vaviloff's customers noticed that the"
herrings and other provisions of the eating-house were not what they
"should be, and after a day or two they saw Vaviloff standing at the bar"
with the newspaper in his hand making a public apology.
"""It is true, I must acknowledge, that I bought old and not very good"
"herrings, and the cabbage ... also ... was old.  It is only too well"
known that anyone can put many a five-kopeck piece in his pocket in
this way.  And what is the result?  It has not been a success; I was
"greedy, I own, but the cleverer man has exposed me, so we are quits ..."""
"This confession made a very good impression on the people, and it also"
gave Vaviloff the opportunity of still feeding them with herrings and
"cabbages which were not good, though they failed to notice it, so much"
were they impressed.
"This incident was very significant, because it increased not only the"
"teacher's popularity, but also the effect of press opinion."
"It often happened, too, that the teacher read lectures on practical"
morality in the eating-house.
"""I saw you,"" he said to the painter Yashka Tyarin, ""I saw you, Yakov,"
"beating your wife ..."""
"""There are some of them upstairs now,"" she replied, ""but, alas, none who"
will ever reclaim them from us! The excuse is the best that can be
"devised to introduce us into San Ildefonso, and, perhaps, if we have"
"luck, inside the palisades of La Granja also."""
"So without further parley the Sergeant proceeded, in the most"
"matter-of-fact way possible, to load the ass with huge fagots of"
kindling wood till the animal showed only four feet paddling along under
"its burden, and a pair of patient orbs, black and beady like those of"
"the Sergeant himself, peering out of a hay-coloured matting of hair."
"This done, the Sergeant turned his sharp eyes every way about the dim"
"smoky horizon. He could note, as easily as on a map, the precise notch"
in the many purple-tinted gorges where they had left their party. It was
exactly like all the others which slit and dimple the slopes of the
"Guadarrama, but in this matter it was as impossible for the Sergeant to"
make a mistake as for a town-dweller to err as to the street in which he
has lived for years.
"But no one was watching them. No clump of juniper held a spy, and the"
Sergeant was at liberty to develop his plans. He turned quickly upon the
old gipsy woman.
"""La Giralda,"" he said, ""there is small use in discovering the"
"disposition of the courtiers in San Ildefonso--ay, or even the defences"
"of the palace, if we know nothing of the Romany who are to march"
"to-night upon the place."""
"La Giralda, who had been drawing a little milk from the udders of each"
"she-goat, to ease them for their travel, suddenly sprang erect."
If you do not know Bogle’s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your
loss. For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you
should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions.
And if you belong to the half to whom waiters’ checks are things of
"moment, you should know Bogle’s, for there you get your money’s"
"worth—in quantity, at least."
"Bogle’s is situated in that highway of _bourgeoisie_, that boulevard of"
"Brown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables"
"in the room, six in each row. On each table is a caster-stand,"
containing cruets of condiments and seasons. From the pepper cruet you
"may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic"
dust. From the salt cruet you may expect nothing. Though a man should
"extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip, yet will his"
prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from Bogle’s cruets. Also
upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made “from
the recipe of a nobleman in India.”
"At the cashier’s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and"
"takes your money. Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change,"
"files your check, and ejects at you, like a toad, a word about the"
weather. Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you
"would better not venture. You are not Bogle’s friend; you are a fed,"
"transient customer, and you and he may not meet again until the blowing"
of Gabriel’s dinner horn. So take your change and go—to the devil if
you like. There you have Bogle’s sentiments.
The needs of Bogle’s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a
"Voice. One of the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful,"
"lively, gracious and learned in persiflage. Her other name? There was"
no more necessity for another name at Bogle’s than there was for
"goats, hastily deposited the babe within, and upon the white linen the"
"red earth fell first like thin rain, and afterwards, when the sheet was"
"covered, in lumps and mattock-clods. For La Giralda desired to be gone,"
suddenly becoming mindful of the precepts of the Sergeant.
"""No priest has blessed the grave,"" she said; ""I can say no prayers over"
her! Who is La Giralda that she should mutter the simplest prayer? But
"when the Master of Life awakes the little one, and when He sees the look"
"she will cast on her poor puppet of wood, He will take her to His bosom"
"even as La Giralda, the mother of many, would have taken her! God, the"
"Good One, cannot be more cruel than a woman of the heathen!"""
"And so with the broken pottery for a monument, and the clasp of infant"
"hands about the wooden doll for a prayer to God, the dead babe was left"
"alone, unblessed and unconfessed--but safe."
*       *       *       *       *
Meanwhile we must go over the hill with Sergeant Cardono. Whatever his
"thoughts may have been as he trudged up the barren glens, seamed and"
"torn with the winter rains, no sign of them appeared upon his sunburnt"
"weather-beaten face. Steadily and swiftly, yet without haste, he held"
"his way, his eyes fixed on the ground, as though perfectly sure of his"
"road, like a man on a well-beaten track which he has trod a thousand"
times.
"For more than an hour he went on, up and ever up, till his feet crisped"
"upon the first snows of Peñalara, and the hill ramparts closed in. But"
"when he had reached the narrows of a certain gorge, he looked keenly to"
"either side, marking the entrance. A pile of stones roughly heaped one"
upon the other fixed his attention. He went up to them and attentively
"perused their structure and arrangement, though they appeared to have"
"sympathetic listener, whose bright eyes stimulated all his capacities as"
"narrator, and whose bright smile welcomed every hairbreadth escape with"
a joy which Rollo could not but feel must somehow be heartfelt and
"personal. Besides, adventures sound so well when told in Spanish and to"
a Spanish girl.
"Yet, strange as it may seem, the young man missed several opportunities"
of arousing the compassion of his companion.
"He said not a word about Peggy Ramsay, nor did he mention the broken"
"heart which he had come so far afield to curé. And as for Concha,"
nothing could have been more nunlike and conventual than the expression
with which she listened. It was as if one of the Lady Superior's
"""Holiest Innocents"" had flown over the nunnery wall and settled down to"
listen to Rollo's tale in that wild gorge among the mountains of
Guadarrama.
*       *       *       *       *
Meantime the Sergeant and his gipsy companion pursued their way with
little regard to the occupations or sentiments of those they had left
"behind them. Cardono's keen black eyes, twinkling hither and thither, a"
myriad crows' feet reticulating out from their corners like spiders'
"webs, took in the landscape, and every object in it."
"The morning was well advanced when, right across their path, a"
"well-to-do farmhouse lay before them, white on the hillside, its walls"
"long-drawn like fortifications, and the small slit-like windows"
counterfeiting loopholes for musketry. But instead of the hum of work
"and friendly gossip, the crying of ox-drivers yoking their teams, or"
"adjusting the long blue wool over the patient eyes of their beasts,"
"there reigned about the place, both dwelling and office-houses, a"
"ravelled round everything. Here men don't idealise women, by the looks"
"of things. Here they don't make these great leering eyes, the inevitable"
yours-to-command look of Italian males. When the men from the country
"look at these women, then it is Mind-yourself, my lady. I should think"
the grovelling Madonna-worship is not much of a Sardinian feature. These
"women have to look out for themselves, keep their own back-bone stiff"
and their knuckles hard. Man is going to be male Lord if he can. And
"woman isn't going to give him too much of his own way, either. So there"
"you have it, the fine old martial split between the sexes. It is tonic"
"and splendid, really, after so much sticky intermingling and"
"backboneless Madonna-worship. The Sardinian isn't looking for the ""noble"
"woman nobly planned."" No, thank you. He wants that young madam over"
"there, a young stiff-necked generation that she is. Far better sport"
than with the nobly-planned sort: hollow frauds that they are. Better
"sport too than with a Carmen, who gives herself away too much, In these"
"women there is something shy and defiant and un-get-atable. The defiant,"
"splendid split between the sexes, each absolutely determined to defend"
"his side, her side, from assault. So the meeting has a certain wild,"
"salty savour, each the deadly unknown to the other. And at the same"
"time, each his own, her own native pride and courage, taking the"
dangerous leap and scrambling back.
"Give me the old, salty way of love. How I am nauseated with sentiment"
"and nobility, the macaroni slithery-slobbery mess of modern adorations."
*       *       *       *       *
One sees a few fascinating faces in Cagliari: those great dark unlighted
"eyes. There are fascinating dark eyes in Sicily, bright, big, with an"
"impudent point of light, and a curious roll, and long lashes: the eyes"
"of old Greece, surely. But here one sees eyes of soft, blank darkness,"
"all velvet, with no imp looking out of them. And they strike a stranger,"
she was to wait by the seashore. So at last the Master Girl had to give
in.
"""But when you get there, you must not take time to greet a single"
"person. You must at once go to the stable, harness the horses, and drive"
"back as swiftly as you can. They will all come to meet you, but you"
"must act as though you did not see them, and must not take a single bite"
"to eat. If you do not do that, you will make both of us unhappy,"" said"
she. And he promised to do as she had said.
"But when he got home to the castle, one of his brothers was just getting"
"married, and the bride and all the guests were already there. They all"
"crowded around him and asked him this, and asked him that, and wanted to"
"lead him in. But he acted as though he saw none of them, led out the"
"horses, and began to put them to the coach. And since they could by no"
"manner of means induce him to come into the castle, they came out with"
again. What th' deuce d'ye mean by shouting at me as if I were a drunken
deck-hand! Speak to me above a whisper now--and you'll see what'll
"happen to you. That's the police-boat pulling past."""
The opportune plash of oars had suggested to him that plausible threat.
"Captain Dove, listening intently, crouched back against the bulkhead,"
"his blinking, hot, suspicious eyes on Slyne's. The boat passed on. But"
"he had found time to observe that Slyne was in evening dress, with an"
expensive fur coat to keep the cold out. And Slyne's cool contempt for
his ill-temper would seem to have impressed him no less than Slyne's air
of solid prosperity.
"He himself, it appeared, had had care and adversity for his companions"
ever since parting with his former friend. His chief aim in calling at
"Genoa had been cheap coal and cheaper repairs, and he thought that he"
was less likely to be recognised there than elsewhere in the
every possible cutter of the wires on the mat before the Captain and
"me. We have looked into all their records, had their homes visited and"
"their people questioned, inquired of their habits--Mr. Copplestone,"
"here, knows what comes of drink--and found out how they spend their"
wages. Yet we have discovered nothing. It is the worst puzzle that
"I've struck. When and how the gun cable was cut I can't tell you, but"
whoever did it is much too clever to be about. He must have been
"exactly informed of the lie and use of the cables, had with him the"
"proper tools, and used them in some fraction of a minute when he"
wasn't under the eye of my own man whose business it was to watch
everybody and suspect everybody. I thought that I had schemed out a
pretty thorough system; up to now it has worked fine. Whenever we have
"had the slightest reason to suspect any man, we have had him kept off"
"the ship and watched. We have run down a lot of footling spies, too"
"stupid to give us a minute's anxiety, but this man who cut the"
"_Antinous_'s wires is of a different calibre altogether. He is AI, and"
"when I catch him, as I certainly shall, I will take off my hat to"
"him."""
"""You say that the _Antinous_ is all right now?"" I observed."
"""Yes. I saw her towed out of the repair basin an hour ago, and she"
must be away down the river by this time. It is not of her that I'm
"thinking, but of the other ships which are constantly in and out for"
"repairs. There are always a dozen here of various craft, usually small"
stuff. While the man who cut those wires is unknown I shall be in a
"perfect fever, and so will the Admiral-Superintendent. We'll get the"
"beauty sooner or later, but if it is later, there may be had mischief"
"done. If he can cut wires in one ship, he may do much worse things in"
"some other. The responsibility rests on me, and it is rather"
"crushing."""
"juste_. If you would kindly lock me up, say, for three years or the"
duration of the war I should be your debtor. I have often thought that
"a prison, provided that one were allowed unlimited paper and the use"
"of a typewriter, would be the most charming of holidays--a perfect"
rest cure. There are three books in my head which I should like to
"write. Arrest me, Dawson, I implore you! Put on the handcuffs--I have"
"never been handcuffed--ring up a taxi, and let us be off to jail. You"
"will, I hope, do me the honour of lunching with me first and meeting"
my wife. She will be immensely gratified to be quit of me. It cannot
"often have happened in your lurid career, Dawson, to be welcomed with"
"genuine enthusiasm."""
"""Why did that man say that he prepared the description of the ship for"
"you?"""
"""That is what we are going to find out, and I will help you all I can."
"My reputation is like the bloom upon the peach--touch it, and it is"
gone for ever. There is a faint glimmer of the truth at the back of my
mind which may become a clear light. Did he say that he had given it
"to me personally, into my own hand?"""
"""No. He said that he was approached by a man whom he had known off and"
"on for years, a man who was employed by you in connection with"
shipyard inquiries. He was informed that this man was still employed
"by you for the same purpose now as in the past."""
"""Your case against me is thinning out, Dawson. At its best it is"
"second-hand; at its worst, the mere conjecture of a rather careless"
draughtsman. I have two things to do: first to find out the real
"seducer, who is probably also the despatcher of the parcels to the"
"late lieutenant of Northumberland Fusiliers, and second, to save if I"

ASIA MINOR.
The first Oriental religion adopted by the Romans was that of the goddess
"of Phrygia, whom the people of Pessinus and Mount Ida worshiped, and who"
received the name of _Magna Mater deum Idea_ in the Occident. Its history
"in Italy covers six centuries, and we can trace each phase of the"
transformation that changed it in the course of time from a collection of
very primitive nature beliefs into a system of spiritualized mysteries used
by some as a weapon against Christianity. We shall now endeavor to outline
the successive phases of that slow metamorphosis.
This religion is the only one whose success in the Latin world was caused
"originally by a mere chance circumstance. In 205 B. C, when Hannibal,"
"vanquished but still threatening, made his last stand in the mountains of"
"Bruttium, repeated torrents of stones frightened the Roman people. When the"
books were officially consulted in regard to this prodigy they promised
that the enemy would be driven from Italy if the Great Mother of Ida could
be brought to Rome. Nobody but the Sibyls themselves had the power of
averting the evils prophesied by them. They had come to Italy from Asia
"Minor, and in this critical situation their sacred poem recommended the"
practice of their native religion as a remedy. In token of his {47}
"friendship, King Attalus presented the ambassadors of the senate with the"
"black aerolite, supposed to be the abode of the goddess, that this ruler"
had shortly before transferred from Pessinus to Pergamum. According to the
mandate of the oracle the stone was received at Ostia by the best citizen
"of the land, an honor accorded to Scipio Nasica--and carried by the most"
"economic principle, that is of the world of nature, of feeling, of"
"passion, as a positive grade of the spiritual process, will probably"
"be counted as Croce's greatest achievement, by those who shall be able"
to look back on his work with an ampler perspective. It is through
"it that his philosophy of the spirit, and in this philosophy, the"
"consciousness of our day, has taken possession of that other world, of"
"that persistent transcendance, which we call nature. In this direction"
"lies, undoubtedly, the future course of the thought of an age, to"
"which, in this afterglow of a great conflagration, all problems seem to"
"gather into the one of the subjection to its better and higher self,"
"the utilization for its purer purposes, of its own cumbersome economic"
"body, of its nature and of its passions."

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
"Croce's Complete Works form a collection of twenty-eight volumes, in"
"four distinct series, published by Laterza e Figli, of Bari, who are"
"also the publishers of _La Critica_, and of the following collections"
"initiated or directed by Croce: _Scrittori d'Italia, Scrittori"
"Stranieri, Classici della Filosofia Moderna._"
"We give here a full list of the _Opere di Benedetto Croce_, adding to"
"the title of each volume the year of the last available edition, the"
years of their composition having already been indicated in the text:
"Mr. Justin Carthew, on the other hand, is related to the family in a"
"very different and distant degree, and there are, as y'r ludship has"
"been good enough to agree, no other survivors."
"""I beg leave now to request that y'r ludship will rescind the authority"
"granted to Mr. Justin Carthew, and admit my client's petition _ad"
"referendum_."""
"""Produce your proofs,"" ordered his lordship, and Mr. Spettigrew"
extracted from a capacious black bag a pile of papers at which Mr.
Justice Gaunt looked with no little disgust.
"""What are they, in chief?"" asked Mr. Justice Gaunt, turning over page"
"after page of closely written law-script, as gingerly as if he believed"
that one might perhaps explode and blow him to pieces. And Mr.
"Spettigrew launched forth again into a long list of certificates,"
"records, researches, findings, orders of court, sworn statements and"
"affidavits, by Captain Dove--""Then trading in his own ship, m'lud, now"
"retired and devoting his time to mission-work among deep-sea sailors;"""
"by Mr. Jasper Slyne, gentleman; by Mr. Jobling, whom he did not pause"
"to describe; by a couple of dozen other people, living or dead, at home"
or abroad; all in due legal form and not to be controverted.
"""I think you'll find them in perfect order, and absolutely conclusive,"
"m'lud,"" counsel came to a finish triumphantly, and sat down, greatly to"
the relief of all present.
"""H'm!"" said his lordship, still gravely regarding Sallie: whose eyes had"
"nothing to conceal from him. ""And so this is the long-lost Lady"
"Josceline!"""
"His searching glance travelled slowly to Captain Dove's face, and then"
"for me and I mustn't delay him. How long will you be?"""
"""What sort of news is it?"" asked Sallie, no less dubious than her maid"
"had been; and called her maid in, notwithstanding her well-founded"
doubts as to the nature of any news he could bring. For Slyne had held
"out to her the same lure that the serpent offered to Eve, and her"
womanly curiosity would not allow her to order him at once from her
domain.
"Slyne smiled slightly as he sat down in a basket-chair, to look about"
him while she was still busy within. The little after-saloon which had
"been her home for so long was finely furnished; more so, perhaps, than"
"was apparent to Slyne, whose taste in that respect inclined to the"
florid. But he could not help noticing how dainty and neat and feminine
"was its entire effect, with its cushioned cosy corners, snow-white"
curtains and draperies. Its purely fragrant atmosphere stirred even
Slyne's conscience a little.
"He lay back in his seat, and, gazing about him, recalled to mind all he"
had been able to learn as to Sallie's strange past. It all fitted in so
perfectly with the fabric of his wonderful new plans that he could find
no possible flaw in them. And when Sallie herself at length came out to
"him from her cabin, he was optimistically disposed to be very generous"
in his dealings with her.
"Fresh from her bath and doubly bewitching in her clinging, intimate"
"draperies, she met Slyne's glad, eager glance with grave, doubtful eyes,"
and ignored entirely the hand he held out to her as he sprang from his
"chair. But he affected not to notice her attitude of distrust, and,"
"greeting her gaily, saved his face by laying his outstretched hand on"
"another chair, which he set a little nearer his own."
"“Then I’ll go,” Frank decided. “I don’t like the idea of sitting around"
"the camp and letting you boys have all the fun. Besides,” he continued,"
"“if it is the messenger who is making the signals, you’ll need all the"
help you can get.”
"“Come running, then!” advised Jack, starting down the slope."
"As the reader will remember, the signal observed by the boys had been"
"built by Jimmie in the hope of attracting the attention of Ned, or of"
"Norman, the boy who had made himself so conspicuous that morning. In"
building the fires and creating the columns of dense white smoke by
"heaping on green boughs, the boy had not given serious thought to the"
effect his action might have on his chums.
"In fact, at the time of his leaving camp, he had not fully decided what"
"course to pursue, and for this reason he had not informed the boys of"
his intention to set a signal for the benefit of the mysterious Boy
"Scout. Even at the time of making the signal, he had no idea that it"
would actually draw his three chums away from the camp.
"He might have known what the effect would be, but, though he did stop to"
"consider for a moment, he did not take in the whole situation. Jimmie"
"usually acted on impulse, and so the signal lifted to the sky without"
any explanation having been made to the Boy Scouts who were certain to
see it.
It will be remembered that when Jimmie descended from the elevation
where the fires had been built he did so in order to hasten in the
direction of a smoke signal which he saw to the north. The result of
this was that he was out of the vicinity of the fires long before the
boys reached that point.
Blighty! I was in hospital six weeks and then I got ten days' sick leave
"in London. Fritz came over one night--Christ, I didn't half have the"
"wind up! We were sitting in the kitchen, mother and father didn't seem"
to mind much--they didn't know what it meant. Fritz had never dropped
"any our way before. I never heard such a barrage, at least not for"
aeroplanes. It wasn't so bad as out here all the same--you could take
"shelter, anyhow. Air-raids are bloody awful things, they put my wind up"
"much more than shell-fire."""
We finished our work as the sun was setting. The clouds on the horizon
"had vanished. One by one the stars came out. It was ""an ideal night for"
"a raid."""
Soon after dark a man was brought into the station with a crushed knee.
Immediate operation was necessary. He was carried into the theatre and
laid on to one of the tables. He received an anæsthetic and became
unconscious. With his scalpel the surgeon made a deep cut in the
knee-joint and searched the cavity with his finger. There was a Sister
standing by. Also an orderly who had won the Military Medal for bravery
in an air-raid some months before. Suddenly there was an outburst of
anti-aircraft firing and a tumultuous whistling of shells overhead. It
"lasted for several seconds and then with a deafening, reverberating"
"thunder-clap that shook the entire theatre, the first bomb fell. Before"
our ears had ceased drumming another bomb exploded and then another. The
"orderly, who had held his hands in front of his face, now gave way to"
fear. He darted madly to and fro and then scuttled beneath a table. The
"Sister, who had remained quite calm, said in an amused voice: ""Pull"
"yourself together, it's all over now."" The orderly got up trembling, his"
face very white. The surgeon had not moved away. He had just grasped the
"edge of the table tightly and had bent his head forward, while his"
muscles seemed stiff with a violent but successful effort at
"self-control. The anæsthetist, too, had remained on his stool, but was"
voices. It seemed to him that he recognised Nick's voice. But whoever it
"was, he spoke in whispers, and though the wounded man strove to hear, he"
was unsuccessful.
After a while he heard the door close and then the tension was somewhat
"relaxed, for he knew that she was keeping his presence in her cabin a"
secret with all the wiles of a clever and loving woman. And more and
more he determined to gain an honoured place for her in some
"community--an honoured place for himself and her. Vague, very vague, of"
"course, were the new purposes and plans that had so suddenly sprang up"
"because of her influence, but the desire to lead a clean life had"
"touched his heart, and since his old calling had never been pleasing to"
"him, he did not for a moment doubt his ability to succeed."
"The morning was half gone when the Girl returned to her patient. Then,"
"in tones that did her best to make her appear free from anxiety, she"
"told him that it was the barkeeper, as he had surmised, with whom she"
had been talking and that she had been obliged to take him into her
"confidence. The man made no comment, for the situation necessarily was"
"in her hands, and he felt that she could be relied upon not to make any"
"mistake. Four people, he was told, knew of his presence in the cabin. So"
"far as Rance was concerned she had absolute faith in his honour, gambler"
though he was; there was nothing that Nick would not do for her; and as
"for the Indians, the secret was sure to be kept by them, unless"
"Jackrabbit got hold of some whisky--a contingency not at all likely, for"
"Nick had promised to see to that. In fact, all could be trusted to be as"
silent as the grave.
"The invalid had listened intently; nevertheless, he sighed:"
"""It's hard to lie here. I don't want to be caught _now_."""
know more of this man and his life held Grey’s soul in thrall.  He had
"always experienced a vivid curiosity to taste life in its various forms,"
"to know and understand the thoughts, the feelings, the aspirations, the"
ambitions of other men.  His travels had given him insight into many
matters; but he felt that these new experiences were likely to be more
"searching, more exciting, more full of keen personal interest.  He had"
"been, as it were, a spectator heretofore; now he was to be a"
participator.
He had not meant to be any man’s guest; he had meant to take a modest
"lodging of his own, and look about him for something in the way of"
"employment, but Lord Sandford had roared with laughter over such a"
notion.
"""What!  Sir Grey Dumaresq going cap in hand to some proud place-giver to"
"ask for patronage, or I know not what!  Gadzooks, man, with that face,"
"that figure, that horse, and a purse full of guineas, you can do better"
than that!  Trust yourself to me. I’ll show you where fame and fortune
lie.  You shall redeem your rat-infested old house in a very brief
"while, if you will but trust yourself to my guidance.  You be Damon to"
"my Pythias—or is it t’other way round, eh?—and I’ll show you the royal"
"road to the goal you want."""
"For lack of any definite plans, Grey had consented for the nonce to"
"accept Lord Sandford’s advice, and had quickly found himself installed"
"in some gloomy and stately yet luxurious chambers in a vast house, of"
"which only a portion was open for use, and the rest given over to a"
neglect and decay that Hartsbourne itself could scarcely rival.
"""But we shall change all that some day,"" spoke Lord Sandford, with a"
"careless laugh, as Grey expressed his surprise at the vast rooms and"
"long galleries shut up and infested by rats and spiders. ""Oh yes, we"
One loses track of time while sailing in south Florida waters. There is
a lassitude that laughs at clocks; the lotus floats over the waves even
"as over the land, and a poetic languor steals into the soul breeding an"
"indifference to hours and days--wretched things, at best, that were only"
"meant for slaves! Neither of us realized our passing into Barnes Sound,"
"and saw only that the _Whim_, sails gracefully drawing, cut the water as"
cleanly as a knife.
"Another day passed during which we shot at sharks, or trawled, or lay on"
deck smoking and occasionally gazing over the side at displays of fish
and flora twenty feet beneath us. But upon the third morning I asked:
"""Where are we bound, Gates?"""
"""Mr. Thomas says Key West, sir, and then Havana."""
"""Mr. Thomas, indeed,"" I laughed, for it was exactly like Tommy to take"
"over the command of a ship, or anything else that struck his fancy."
Before leaving Miami he had received a twenty page letter from the
Bluegrass region of Kentucky which threw him into a state of such
volatile ineptitude that I was well satisfied to let him give what
"orders he would, sending us to the world's end for all I cared. In a"
"very large measure Tommy's happiness was my own, as I knew that mine"
would always be dear to him.
"During our most trying hours in France, thoughts of this wonderful girl,"
"whose name was Nell, unfailingly kept his spirits high. In moments of"
confidence that come to pals on the eve of battle I saw that some day
"they might be eternal ""buddies""--certainly if he had his way; and toward"
"this achievement he had been, since graduating from the University of"
He assisted her to carry the inert old woman across the street and a
"short distance along the opposite pavement. Here, there was a"
"pleasant, modest-looking tea-shop with the name of Walcker over the"
"front, and embedded in the plate glass were the words ""Tea Rooms."""
"These of course dated from long before the war, when the best"
Chinese tea was only four francs the demi-kilo and the fashion for
afternoon tea had become established in Brussels. Vivie and her
mother had often entered Walcker's shop in happier days for a cup of
"tea and delicious forms of home-made pastry. Besides the cakes,"
"which in pre-war times were of an excellence rarely equalled, they"
had been drawn to the pleasant-looking serving woman. She was so
"English in appearance, though she only spoke French and Flemish."
Behind the shop was a cosy little room where the more intimate
clients were served with tea; a room with a look-out into a little
square of garden. Thither Mrs. Warren was carried or supported. She
"regained consciousness slightly as she was placed on a chair,"
"opened her eyes, and said ""Thank you, my dears."" Then her head fell"
over to one side and she was dead--seemingly....
The _agent de police_ went away to fetch a doctor and to disperse
the crowd of _ketjes_[1] and loafers which had transferred itself
"from the hotel to the tea-shop. The shop woman, who was one of those"
angels of kindness that turn up unexpectedly in the paths of unhappy
"people, called in a stout serving wench from the kitchen, and the"
three of them carried Mrs. Warren out of the inner tea-room into the
"back premises and a spare bedroom. Here she was laid on the bed,"
partially undressed and all available and likely restoratives
applied.

1517-18
"Erasmus at Louvain, 1517--He expects the renovation of the"
Church as the fruit of good learning--Controversy with Lefèvre
"d'Étaples--Second journey to Basle, 1518--He revises the edition"
"of the New Testament--Controversies with Latomus, Briard and"
Lee--Erasmus regards the opposition of conservative theology
merely as a conspiracy against good learning
When Erasmus established himself at Louvain in the summer of 1517 he had
"a vague presentiment that great changes were at hand. 'I fear', he"
"writes in September, 'that a great subversion of affairs is being"
"brought about here, if God's favour and the piety and wisdom of princes"
do not concern themselves about human matters.' But the forms which that
great change would assume he did not in the least realize.
He regarded his removal as merely temporary. It was only to last 'till
"we shall have seen which place of residence is best fit for old age,"
which is already knocking'. There is something pathetic in the man who
"desires nothing but quiet and liberty, and who through his own"
"restlessness, and his inability not to concern himself about other"
"people, never found a really fixed abode or true independence. Erasmus"
"is one of those people who always seem to say: tomorrow, tomorrow! I"
"must first deal with this, and then ... As soon as he shall be ready"
with the new edition of the New Testament and shall have extricated
"himself from troublesome and disagreeable theological controversies, in"
"which he finds himself entangled against his wish, he will sleep, hide"
"himself, 'sing for himself and the Muses'. But that time never came."
"Where to live when he shall be free? Spain, to which Cardinal Ximenes"
"called him, did not appeal to him. From Germany, he says, the stoves and"
We went down the fortress-stair to the eating-room. Here was a long
table with soup-plates upside down and a lamp burning an uncanny naked
"acetylene flame. We sat at the cold table, and the lamp immediately"
"began to wane. The room--in fact the whole of Sardinia--was stone cold,"
"stone, stone cold. Outside the earth was freezing. Inside there was no"
"thought of any sort of warmth: dungeon stone floors, dungeon stone walls"
"and a dead, corpse-like atmosphere, too heavy and icy to move."
"The lamp went quite out, and the q-b gave a cry. The brown woman poked"
her head through a hole in the wall. Beyond her we saw the flames of the
"cooking, and two devil-figures stirring the pots. The brown woman came"
and shook the lamp--it was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece
"vase--shook it well and stirred up its innards, and started it going"
"once more. Then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup, in"
which were bits of macaroni: and would we have wine? I shuddered at the
"thought of death-cold red wine of the country, so asked what else there"
"was. There was malvagia--malvoisie, the same old malmsey that did for"
"the Duke of Clarence. So we had a pint of malvagia, and were comforted."
"At least we were being so, when the lamp went out again. The brown woman"
"came and shook and smacked it, and started it off again. But as if to"
"say ""Shan't for you"", it whipped out again."
"Then came the host with a candle and a pin, a large, genial Sicilian"
with pendulous mustaches. And he thoroughly pricked the wretch with the
"pin, shook it, and turned little screws. So up flared the flame. We were"
"a little nervous. He asked us where we came from, etc. And suddenly he"
"asked us, with an excited gleam, were we Socialists. Aha, he was going"
to hail us as citizens and comrades. He thought we were a pair of
Bolshevist agents: I could see it. And as such he was prepared to
"embrace us. But no, the q-b disclaimed the honor. I merely smiled and"
shook my head. It is a pity to rob people of their exciting illusions.
"all that about Gaspard and the society came out, would they not call him"
"an accessory before the fact? The noose seemed really rather near, and"
"in his frightened fancy, as he lay sleepless beside his snoring wife,"
the rope dangled over his head. The poor wretch was between the devil
and the deep sea--between stern law and cruel Rule 3. He dared not toss
"about, his wife would ask him what ailed him; he lay as still as he"
"could, bitterly cursing his folly for mingling in such affairs, bitterly"
cursing the Frenchman who led him on into the trap and left him fast
there. How could he save his neck? And he restlessly rent the band of
"his coarse night-shirt, that pressed on his throat with a horrible"
suggestion of what might be. Where was that Gaspard? Had he fled over
"the sea? Ah, if he could be sure of that, and sure that the dreaded man"
"would not return! Or was he lurking in some secret hole, ready to steal"
out and avenge a violation of Rule 3? The doorkeeper had always feared
"the man; in the lurid light of this deed, Gaspard's image grew into a"
"monster of horror, threatening sudden and swift revenge for disobedience"
"or treachery. No; he must stand firm. But what of the police? Well, men"
"sleep somehow, and at last he fell asleep, holding the band of the"
night-shirt away from his throat: if he fell asleep with that pressing
"on him, God knew what he might dream."
"""It's very lucky,"" remarked the Superintendent of Police, who had a"
"happy habit of looking at the bright side of things, to one of his"
"subordinates, ""that this Benham seems to have had no relations and"
"precious few friends."""
"""No widows coming crying about,"" observed the subordinate, with an"
assenting nod.
"""Nothing known of him except that he came to Kirton a few months back,"
"did nothing, seemed to have plenty of money, took his liquor, played a"
"hand at cards, hurt nobody, seemingly knew nobody."""
"But what wonder is it that little Concha, in her passionate Spanish"
"fashion understanding but one way of love, and being little interested"
"in brothers, felt the tears come to her eyes as Rollo's step waxed"
"fainter in the distance, and said over and over to herself with smiling"
"pleasure, ""He loves me--he loves me! Oh, if only my mother had lived, I"
might have been worthier of him. Then I would not have played with men's
"hearts for amusement to myself, as alas, I have too often done. God"
"forgive me, there was no harm, indeed. But--but--I am not worthy of"
"him--I know I am not!"""
So Rollo's hasty kiss on the dark balcony was provocative of a healthy
self-reproach on both sides--which at least was so much to the good.
Concha peered out into the darkness towards the south where a few stars
were blinking sleepily through the ground-mist. She could dimly discern
"the outline of the town lying piled beneath her, without a light,"
"without a sound, without a sign of life. From beyond the hills came a"
"weird booming as of a distant cannonade. But Concha, the careless maiden"
"who had grown into a woman in an hour, did not think of these things."
"For to the Spanish girl, whose heart is touched to the core, there is"
"but one subject worthy of thought. Wars, battles, sieges, the distresses"
"of queens, the danger of royal princesses--all are as nothing, because"
her lips have been kissed.
"""All the same,"" she muttered to herself, ""he ought not have done it--and"
"when I have a little recovered I will tell him so!"""
"But at that moment, poised upon the topmost spike of the great gate in"
"front of her, she saw the silhouette of a man. He was climbing upwards,"
"with his hand on the cross-bar of the railing, and cautiously"
"insinuating a leg over the barrier, feeling meanwhile gingerly for a"
foothold on the palace side.
"""Of course, you can do nothing abrupt; but you'll gradually withdraw"
"from their acquaintance, won't you?"""
"Alicia had escaped without a promise, pleading for time to think in the"
same breath that she denied any concern in the matter. She was by way of
"thinking now, and all that Lady Eynesford had said repeated itself in"
her mind as she looked out on the garden and the glimpses of the town
"beyond. She understood now Dick's banishment, her sister-in-law's"
"unresting hostility to the Medlands, and the reason why she had been"
"pressed to go to Australia. She spared a minute to grief for Daisy, but"
"her own sorrow would not be denied, and engrossed her again. In the"
"solitude she had sought, she cried to herself, ""Why didn't they tell me"
"before? What's the use of telling me now?"" Then she would fly back to"
"the hope that the thing was not true, that her friends had clutched too"
"hastily at anything which would save her from what they dreaded, and,"
"she confessed to herself, rightly dreaded. No, she would not believe it"
"yet; and, if it were not true, why should she not be happy? Why should"
"she not, even though she did what Dick had not dared to do, and what,"
"when Coxon asked her, she had laughed at for an absurdity?"
There began to be more movement outside the gates. The first note of
"band-music was wafted to her ear, and the roll of wheels announced the"
return of the church-goers. She roused herself and went to meet them.
"They were agog with excitement, partly about the meeting, partly about"
the murder. While Eleanor was trying to tell her of the state of
"popular feeling, the Governor seized her arm and began to detail the"
story of the discovery.
"""You remember the man?"" he asked. ""He was at our flower-show--had a sort"
"of row with Medland, you know. Well, he's been found murdered (so the"
police think) in a low part of the town! The woman who keeps the house
other.
"A city watchman, with a pipe in his mouth, looked drowsily and frowsily"
out of the town-hall or _ayuntamiento_. He was retreating again to his
settle when it suddenly struck him that this intruder had paid no duty
"upon her milk and firewood. True, he was not the functionary appointed"
"by law to receive the tax; but since he was on the spot, and for lack of"
"other constituted the representative of civic state, he felt he must"
undertake the duty.
"So, laying aside his pipe and seizing his halberd and cocked hat, he"
sallied grumblingly forth to intercept the bold contravener of municipal
"laws. But the active limbs of the old gipsy, the lightened udders of the"
"she-goats, and the ass with his meek nose pointed homeward, took the"
party out of the village gate before the man in authority could
over-take La Giralda.
"Soon, therefore, the roofs of San Ildefonso and the white palace again"
lay beneath her as the gipsy reascended by her track of the morning. So
long had she occupied in her various adventures that the evening shadows
were already lengthening when she returned to the corrie where the party
had spent in restful indolence the burden and heat of the day. The
"Sergeant had not yet arrived, and La Giralda delayed her story till he"
should give her leave to speak. For not even to the gipsies of the
Guadarrama was José Maria a greater personage than Sergeant Cardono to
La Giralda of Sevilla.
"In the mean time she busied herself, with Concha's help, in preparing"
"the evening meal, as quick upon her legs as if she had done nothing but"
lounge in the shade all day. It was almost sundown when the Sergeant
"came in, dropping unannounced over the precipice as if from the clouds."
"The eminent statesman, Baron Suyematsu, kindly dictated in English to"
one of our editors answers relating to certain questions with regard to
"the relation between Japan and Europe, especially France and Germany."
"With the disclosure of the alleged Kodama report in view, how far"
may one give credit to the alleged Japanese plan of invasion of
Indo-China?
I know all that has been written in France on the subject. All those
"rumours appear to me to have come originally from Russia, and to have"
been put into circulation in order to excite French opinion against
"Japan, in other words, it is nothing else than a mere repetition of the"
Yellow Peril cry.
Japan does not covet Indo-China. I have shown elsewhere that the French
colonies in the Far East have no perceptible influence upon the
"situation of Japan, either from a political or an economical point of"
"view. Japan has sufficient to do at home, she does not want to plunge"
"into external adventures, such as meddling with Indo-China or picking a"
quarrel with a country like France. You may be sure that it would be
more politic for France to cultivate amicable relations with Japan than
irritate her by such accusations. Even if those accusations honestly
"represent the true sentiment of the French, the Japanese would only take"
"them for malicious manœuvres directed to aid Russia, and they could"
not produce any good impression on the minds of the Japanese.
Is there any reason to believe that the so-called Kodama report was
forged in Russia rather than in France?
I have demonstrated elsewhere that the document which was recently made
Eppendorf employs spies everywhere who watch Erasmus's correspondence
"with his friends. Aleander continually sets people to combat him, and"
lies in wait for him wherever he can. His interpretation of the
intentions of his assailants has the ingenious self-centred element
which passes the borderline of sanity. He sees the whole world full of
calumny and ambuscades threatening his peace: nearly all those who once
were his best friends have become his bitterest enemies; they wag their
"venomous tongues at banquets, in conversation, in the confessional, in"
"sermons, in lectures, at court, in vehicles and ships. The minor"
"enemies, like troublesome vermin, drive him to weariness of life, or to"
death by insomnia. He compares his tortures to the martyrdom of Saint
"Sebastian, pierced by arrows. But his is worse, for there is no end to"
it. For years he has daily been dying a thousand deaths and that alone;
"for his friends, if such there are, are deterred by envy."
He mercilessly pillories his patrons in a row for their stinginess. Now
and again there suddenly comes to light an undercurrent of aversion and
hatred which we did not suspect. Where had more good things fallen to
his lot than in England? Which country had he always praised more? But
suddenly a bitter and unfounded reproach escapes him. England is
"responsible for his having become faithless to his monastic vows, 'for"
"no other reason do I hate Britain more than for this, though it has"
always been pestilent to me'.
He seldom allows himself to go so far. His expressions of hatred or
"spite are, as a rule, restricted to the feline. They are aimed at"
"friends and enemies, Budaeus, Lypsius, as well as Hutten and Beda."
Occasionally we are struck by the expression of coarse pleasure at
"another's misfortune. But in all this, as regards malice, we should not"
measure Erasmus by our ideas of delicacy and gentleness. Compared with
most of his contemporaries he remains moderate and refined.
"preserve you from evil. Amen.'""[13]"
[Sidenote: The Benefits of Buying a Fac-simile of the Chains.]
In the sacristy we found a young priest doing a thriving business in
"copies of the relic. We bought from him ""an iron _fac-simile_ of the"
"chains (about the size of an ordinary watch-chain), authenticated by a"
certificate testifying to its having touched the original chains. On
the back of this certificate was printed an extract from the Rules of
"the Confraternity of the chains of St. Peter, from which we learned"
that all associates in this brotherhood must wear such a _fac-simile_
"as we had just bought, that the objects of the Confraternity are ""The"
"propagation of the veneration of the chains of St. Peter, an increase"
"of devotion to the Holy See, prayers for the Pope's intention, for the"
"needs of Holy Church, the conversion of infidels and sinners, and the"
"extirpation of heresy and blasphemy,"" and that Pius IX. had granted to"
"the members of the Confraternity various indulgences, one of which is"
"""_A plenary indulgence and remission of all sins_[14] if one visits the"
"Church of San Pietro in Vincoli on January 18th[15] and June 29th,[16]"
"between the first vespers of the feast and sunset of the said days,"
"or on August 1st, or any one of the seven days following it. The usual"
"prayers for the Holy Father's intention,"" etc., are comprised in these"
"visits. We are told also that ""the foregoing indulgences are applicable"
"to the souls in purgatory."""
[Sidenote: The Relics in St. Peter's Cathedral.]
We may close this running account of the relics at Rome with a brief
"mention of those that are to be seen in St. Peter's itself, the largest"
and costliest church in the world. The construction of it extended
over one hundred and seventy-six years. The cost of the main building
alone was fifty million dollars. The annual outlay for repairs is
it was rumoured that leave was going to start. How glorious it would be
to spend a sunny May or June in England!
Once a fortnight we paraded for our pay outside one of the bigger sheds
"of the yard. As a rule, I was filled with impatience and irritation at"
"having to wait in a long queue and move forward step by step, but now it"
"had become pleasant to tarry in the sunshine. One day, when we were"
"lined up between two large huts, a deep Yellow Brimstone butterfly came"
"floating idly past. It gave me inexpressible delight, a delight tempered"
by sadness and a longing for better times. I drew my pay and saluted
"perfunctorily, being unable and unwilling to think of anything but the"
"beauty of the sky, the sun, and the wonderful insect."
"I held my three ten-franc notes in my hand and thought: ""I _will_ enjoy"
this lovely day to the full. When we get back to camp I will do without
"the repulsive army fare, I will dine at the St. Martin and buy a bottle"
"of the best French wine, even if it costs me twenty francs. And then"
I'll walk to the little wood on the hill-slope and there I'll lie all
"the evening and dream or read a book."""
The whistle sounded. It was time to go back to work. But I cursed the
work and decided to take the small risk and remain idle for an hour or
two. I went to an outlying part of the yard and sat down on a patch of
long grass and leant back against a shed. The air was hot and several
bees flew by. Their buzzing reminded me of summer holidays spent in
"southern France before the war. I thought of vineyards and orchards, of"
"skies intensely blue, of scorching sunshine, of the tumultuous chirping"
"of cicadas and grasshoppers, and then of the tepid nights crowded with"
glittering stars and hushed except for the piping of tree-frogs.
Before the war--before the war--I repeated the words to myself. They
"conveyed a sense of immeasurable remoteness, of something gone and lost"
favour of the more difficult path. Dr. Bose chose the more difficult
"path, and entered into a phase of activity which was to test all his"
strength.
CASTE IN SCIENCE
Dr. Bose's discovery of Universal sensitiveness of matter was
"communicated to the Royal Society on May 7th, 1901, when he himself gave"
"a successful experimental demonstration. His communication was, however,"
"strongly assailed by Sir John Burden-Sanderson, the leading"
"physiologist, and one or two of his followers. They had nothing to urge"
against his experiments but objected to a physicist straying into the
preserve that had been specially reserved for the physiologist. He had
unwittingly strayed into the domain of a new and unfamiliar caste system
"and offended its etiquette. In consequence of this opposition his paper,"
"which was already in print, was not published. This is not by any means"
"to be regarded as an injustice done to a stranger. Even Lord Rayleigh,"
"who occupies an unique position in the world of science, was subjected"
"to fierce attacks from the chemists, because he, a physicist, had"
ventured to predict that the air would be found to contain new elements
not hitherto discovered.
"It is natural that there should be prejudice against all innovations,"
and the attitude of Sir John Burden-Sanderson is easily explained.
Unfortunately there was another incident about which similar explanation
could not be urged. Dr. Bose's Paper had been placed in the archives of
"the Royal Society, so that technically there was no publication. And it"
"came about that eight months after the reading of his Paper, another"
communication found publication in the Journal of a different society
which was practically the same as Dr. Bose's but without any
acknowledgment. The author of this communication was a gentleman who had
certainly having no prevision she would not recross the Channel for
"four years and four months, and not see Dover again for five or six"
years.
British war vessels were off the port and inside it. But there was
not much excitement or crowding on the Ostende steamer or any of
"those sensational precautions against being torpedoed or mined,"
which soon afterwards oppressed the spirits of cross-Channel
passengers. Vessels arriving from Belgium were full of passengers of
"the superior refugee class, American and British tourists, or"
wealthy people who though they preferred living abroad had begun to
think that the Continent just now was not very healthy and England
the securest refuge for those who wished to be comfortable.
"Vivie being a good sailor and economical by nature, never thought of"
securing a cabin for the four or five hours' sea-journey. She sat on
the upper deck with her scanty luggage round her. A nice-looking
"young man who had a cabin the door of which he locked, was walking"
up and down on the level deck and scrutinizing her discreetly. And
when at last they worked their way backwards into Ostende--the
"harbour was full of vessels, chiefly mine-dredgers and torpedo"
boats--she noticed the obsequiousness of the steamer people and how
he left the ship before any one else.
"She followed soon afterwards, having little encumbrances in the way"
of luggage; but she observed that he just showed a glimpse of some
paper and was allowed to walk straight through the Douane with
"unexamined luggage, and so, on to the Brussels train."
But she herself had little difficulty. She put her hand luggage--she
"had no other--into a first-class compartment, and having an hour and"
a half to wait walked out to look at Ostende.
the one or the other.  But yet he must break away.  Pacing up and down
"the room, he seemed to see the soft earnest eyes of the Lady Geraldine"
"bent upon him.  He had pledged his word to her, and in spirit to his"
dead mother.  From that pledge there was no drawing back.  Yet how could
the break best be made?
He thought over the engagements already entered into.  Was it needful
that these should be kept? He thought not—at least not those which were
but promises to meet at such and such clubs or coffee-houses for the
purposes of card-playing and similar recreations.  But there was one
engagement that Grey did not see his way honourably to break. He had
promised to ride Don Carlos the following Saturday in a course against
"three other picked horses, and heavy wagers, he knew, had been laid upon"
or against his steed.  This engagement he felt he could not break; but
the rest he would.  He might even make the excuse that Don Carlos wanted
"attention, and that he was going to take him into the country for"
"purposes of training; and, once away from Sandford House, he ought to be"
"able to pen a letter to the master which might excuse his return, and"
explain the nature of the change which had come over him.
"Yes, that would be the way.  He would not go open-mouthed to him this"
"morning, to be perhaps scoffed or cajoled into some rash compromise."
Grey knew that his ability to see both sides of a question often led him
into difficulties and the appearance of vacillation.  Surely he could
keep his pledge if he made the break with a certain diplomatic skill.
"Not only would it be easier to himself, but it might prove the safer"
method also.
"When he saw Lord Sandford in the midst of his friends, laughing at the"
"last bit of scandal, passing jokes over the latest repartee of the"
"redoubtable Duchess of Marlborough to the meek Queen, discussing the"
"rivalries of the ministers, and the other rivalries (to them more"
"found the Guaymies, the only primitive people living in large numbers"
"outside the Darien. There are about 5000 of them, living for the most"
"part in the valley of Mirando which lies high up in the Cordilleras, and"
in a region cut off from the plains. Here they have successfully
defended their independence against the assaults of both whites and
blacks. To remain in their country without consent of the Great Chief is
"practically impossible, for they are savage fighters and in earlier days"
it was rare to see a man whose body was not covered with scars. It is
apparent that in some ways progress has destroyed their industries and
"made the people less rather than more civilized, for they now buy cloth,"
"arms, tools, and utensils which they were once able to make. At one time"
"they were much under the influence of the Catholic missionaries, but of"
late mission work has languished in wild Panama and perhaps the chief
relic of that earlier religious influence is the fact that the women go
"clothed in a single garment. This simple raiment, not needed for warmth,"
"seems to be prized, for if caught in a rainstorm the women will quickly"
"strip off their clothing, wrap it in a large banana or palm leaf that it"
"may not get wet, and continue their work, or their play, in nature’s"
garb.
"It is said, too, that when strangers are not near clothes are never"
"thought of. The men follow a like custom, and invariably when pursuing a"
"quarry strip off their trousers, tying their shirts about their loins."
"Trousers seem to impede their movements, and if a lone traveler in"
Chiriqui comes on a row of blue cotton trousers tied to the bushes he
may be sure that a band of Guaymies is somewhere in the neighborhood
pursuing an ant bear or a deer.

seemed to them a fitting pretext to suppress the _bonae literae_. 'I
"have declared that you are perfectly unknown to me, that I have not yet"
read your books and therefore neither approve nor disapprove anything.'
"'I reserve myself, so far as I may, to be of use to the reviving"
studies. Discreet moderation seems likely to bring better progress than
impetuosity. It was by this that Christ subjugated the world.'
"On the same day he writes to John Lang, one of Luther's friends and"
"followers, a short note, not meant for publication: 'I hope that the"
endeavours of yourself and your party will be successful. Here the
Papists rave violently.... All the best minds are rejoiced at Luther's
boldness: I do not doubt he will be careful that things do not end in a
quarrel of parties!... We shall never triumph over feigned Christians
"unless we first abolish the tyranny of the Roman see, and of its"
"satellites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans and the Carmelites. But no"
one could attempt that without a serious tumult.'
"As the gulf widens, Erasmus's protestations that he has nothing to do"
with Luther become much more frequent. Relations at Louvain grow ever
more disagreeable and the general sentiment about him ever more unkind.
In August 1519 he turns to the Pope himself for protection against his
opponents. He still fails to see how wide the breach is. He still takes
it all to be quarrels of scholars. King Henry of England and King
Francis of France in their own countries have imposed silence upon the
quarrellers and slanderers; if only the Pope would do the same!
In October he was once more reconciled with the Louvain faculty. It was
"just at this time that Colet died in London, the man who had, better"
"perhaps than anyone else, understood Erasmus's standpoint. Kindred"
spirits in Germany still looked up to Erasmus as the great man who was
on the alert to interpose at the right moment and who had made
"moderation the watchword, until the time should come to give his friends"
"""It was all very simple,"" he went on, ""like most things in my business"
when one gets to the bottom of them. He was seduced by a man whom the
"local police have had on their string for a long time, but who will"
now be put securely away. Menteith was a frequenter of a certain
"public house down the river, where he posed as an authority on the"
"Navy, and hinted darkly at his stores of hidden information. Our"
"German agent made friends with him, gave him small sums for drinks,"
and flattered his vanity. It is strange how easily some men are
deceived by flattery. The agent got from Menteith one or two bits of
"news by pretending a disbelief in his sources of intelligence, and"
"then, when the fool had committed himself, threatened to denounce him"
"to the police unless he took service with him altogether. Money, of"
"course, passed, but not very much. The Germans who employ spies so"
extensively pay them extraordinarily little. They treat them like
"scurvy dogs, for whom any old bone is good enough, and I'm not sure"
they are not right. They go on the principle that the white trash who
will sell their country need only to be paid with kicks and coppers.
Menteith swears that he did not receive more than four pounds for the
plans and description of the _Rampagious_. Fancy selling one's country
and risking one's neck for four measly pounds sterling! If he had got
"four thousand, I should have had some respect for him. His home is in"
"a wretched state, and his wife--a pretty woman, though almost a"
"skeleton, and a very nicely mannered, honest woman--says that her"
husband unexpectedly gave her four pounds a month ago. He had kept
"none of the blood money for drink! Curious, isn't it?"""
"""It shows that the man had some good in him. It shows that he was"
ashamed to use the money upon himself. We must do something for the
"poor wife, Dawson."""
"""She will easily get work, and she will be far better without her sot"
of a husband. She did not cry when I told her everything. 'I ought to
"Generally the great park-gates stood hospitably open, and the little"
"town of San Ildefonso, with its lodgings and hostels, was at this season"
crowded with courtiers and hangers-on of the court. Guards circulated
"here and there, or clattered after the Queen-Regent as she drove out on"
the magnificent King's highway which stretched upwards over the
"Guadarrama towards Madrid, or whirled down towards Segovia and the"
plains of Old Castile. Bugles were never long silent in _plaza_ or
"barrack yard. Drums beat, fifes shrilled, and there was a continuous"
trampling of horses as this ambassador or that was escorted to the
"presence of Queen Cristina, widow of Fernando VII., mother of Isabel the"
"Second, and Regent of Spain."
"A word of historical introduction is here necessary, and it shall be but"
"a word. For nearly a quarter of a century Fernando, since he had been"
"restored to a forfeited throne by British bayonets, had acted on the"
ancient Bourbon principle of learning nothing and forgetting nothing.
"His tyrannies became ever more tyrannical, his exactions more shameless,"
his indolent arrogance more oppressive. Twice he had to invoke the aid
"of foreign troops, and once indeed a French army marched from one end of"
Spain to the other.
"But with the coming of his third wife, young Maria Cristina of Naples,"
all this was changed. Under her influence Fernando promptly became meek
and uxorious. Then he revoked the ordinance of a former King which
ordained that no woman should reign in Spain. He recalled his
"revocation, and again promulgated it according as his hope of offspring"
waxed or waned.
"Finally a daughter was born to the ill-mated pair, and Don Carlos, the"
"King's brother and former heir-apparent, left the country. Immediately"
upon the King's death civil war divided the state. The stricter
legitimists who stood for Don Carlos included the church generally and
"George crossed London Bridge, attired in his Quaker disguise, and made"
"his way to Deptford, where he preached in the streets. From Deptford"
"he followed the river by easy stages to Sheerness, where he lodged nearly"
"a week, awaiting a boat that would answer his purpose. Had he attempted"
"to board a vessel, he would have been seized and examined; therefore his"
"plan was to grow violent in his preaching, and, if possible, provoke the"
authorities to place him on board one of the outgoing crafts; that being
a favorite method of the king's men in getting rid of the too blatant
fanatics in Sheerness.
"The Dutch sea captains were fanatics almost to a man, and the exiled"
exhorters found them always willing to help their persecuted brethren of
the faith.
And so it happened with George in Sheerness. He was on the dock exhorting
"vehemently against the evils of the time, laying great stress on the"
wickedness of the king and denouncing the vileness of the court. Two of
"the king's officers tried to silence him, but failing, ordered him to"
leave England by a certain Dutch boat then waiting in the harbor with its
"pennant up. He protested and struggled, but at last was forced aboard,"
"raving against those godless Balaamites, the clergy of the Established"
"Church, who, with the devil, he declared, were behind his persecution."
So well did George play his part that a collection was taken up among the
passengers of the Dutch boat to help the good man so vilely put upon.
"There was a sweet bit of irony in the fact, learned afterwards, that the"
officers who forced George aboard the Dutch ship were at Sheerness for
the purpose of winning the two hundred pounds reward offered for his
capture.
The goodness of God occasionally takes a whimsical form.
involved in a series of polemics. To let the opposition of opponents
"pass unnoticed was forbidden not only by his character, for ever"
"striving to justify himself in the eyes of the world, but also by the"
"custom of his time, so eager for dispute."
"There were, first of all, his polemics with Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples,"
"or in Latinized form, Faber Stapulensis, the Parisian theologian, who as"
"a preparer of the Reformation may, more than anyone else, be ranked with"
Erasmus. At the moment when Erasmus got into the travelling cart which
"was to take him to Louvain, a friend drew his attention to a passage in"
"the new edition of Faber's commentary on St. Paul's epistles, in which"
"he controverted Erasmus's note on the Second Epistle to the Hebrews,"
"verse 7. Erasmus at once bought Faber's book, and soon published an"
"_Apologia_. It concerned Christ's relation to God and the angels, but"
"the dogmatic point at issue hinged, after all, on a philological"
interpretation of Erasmus.
"Not yet accustomed to much direct wrangling, Erasmus was violently"
"agitated by the matter, the more as he esteemed Faber highly and"
considered him a congenial spirit. 'What on earth has occurred to the
man? Have others set him on against me? All theologians agree that I am
"right,' he asserts. It makes him nervous that Faber does not reply again"
at once. Badius has told Peter Gilles that Faber is sorry about it.
Erasmus in a dignified letter appeals to their friendship; he will
suffer himself to be taught and censured. Then again he growls: Let him
be careful. And he thinks that his controversy with Faber keeps the
world in suspense: there is not a meal at which the guests do not side
with one or the other of them. But finally the combat abated and the
friendship was preserved.
"Towards Easter 1518, Erasmus contemplated a new journey to Basle, there"
"to pass through the press, during a few months of hard labour, the"
"chieftains to assist them in their affrays with rival tribes, and made"
more than one alliance by giving such assistance. But the later
atrocities perpetrated by the Spaniards seem to have had the effect of
uniting the Indians in a tacit peaceful bond against the whites.
"Picturesque and graphic as are the writings of men like Esquemeling, the"
"Fray d’Acosta and Wafer, who saw the Indians in the days of their"
earliest experience with the sort of civilization that Pedrarias and
"Pizarro brought to their villages, they do not bear more convincing"
"evidence of the savagery of the invaders, than is afforded by the sullen"
aloofness with which the Darien Indians of today regard white men of any
race. More than the third and fourth generation have passed away but the
sins of the Spaniards are still recalled among a people who have no
"written records whatsoever, and the memory or tradition causes them to"
withhold their friendship from the remotest descendants of the historic
oppressors.
"There seems to have been no written language, nor even any system of"
"hieroglyphics among the tribes of Panama, a fact that places them far"
below our North American Indians in the scale of mental development. On
the other hand in weaving and in fashioning articles for domestic use
they were in advance of the North American aborigines. Their domestic
"architecture was more substantial, and they were less nomadic, the"
latter fact being probably due to the slight encouragement given to
wandering by the jungle. The great houses of the San Blas Indians in
their villages recall the “Long houses” of the Iroquois as described by
Parkman.

referred to above:--
When Mr. Gilbert said that he would like to see the women's parts
"played by boys, he was not uttering a jest. In some of the"
"performances at Westminster School, he had seen boys in women's"
parts much more effective than any professional actress. If women
"players had been proposed to Shakespeare, he would not only have"
"been scandalised, but he would have pointed out that it was"
impossible to get the force from women that was obtained from boy

NOTE TO THE ARTICLE ON 'COMMERCIAL MORALITY'
In the October number of the _Anglo-Japanese Gazette_ (London) is
"published a criticism by Mr. Curtis, editor and proprietor of the _Kobe"
"Herald_, on 'the ridiculously sweeping assertions,' as he calls it, made"
by Mr. Longford in his article. I subjoin herewith a passage which
relates to Mr. Longford's assertion that a 'cordon' is drawn by the
"Japanese round the trading centres of Yokohama and Kobe, and that"
foreign merchants are suffering under the 'thraldom':--
"Well, let me say that no sane, fair-minded man who knows anything"
whatever of his subject would ever dream of accusing the whole
Japanese people of a lack of commercial morality. All this talk
about a cordon being drawn round the treaty ports is rubbish. No
"such barrier exists, save perhaps in the imagination of a few who"
cannot shake off the prejudices and disabilities of the past. The
"idea sounds absurd to me, knowing, as I do know, that all the"
go-ahead firms have been doing their utmost for some time past to
open up connections in the principal cities. Mr. Longford seems to
think that business is conducted in Japan to-day just as it was
"legend in the same style as the one current in novels, which tells"
us that the aristocrats of old families close their doors to rich
"Americans, or like that other story Mrs. Marchmont was talking to us of,"
about the Jewish ladies who were crazy to become Catholics.”
"“I don’t see what you are trying to prove by all this,” said Laura."
“I am trying to prove that all there is underneath distinguished society
"is money, for which reason it doesn’t matter if it is destroyed. The"
"cleverest and finest man, if he has no money, will die of hunger in a"
"corner. Smart society, which thinks itself superior, will never receive"
"him, because being really superior and intelligent is of no value on"
"the market. On the other hand, when it is a question of some very rich"
"brute, he will succeed in being accepted and fêted by the aristocrats,"
"because money has a real value, a quotable value, or I’d better say, it"
is the only thing that has a quotable value.”
“What you are saying isn’t true. A man doesn’t go with the best people
merely because he is rich.”
"“No, certainly; not immediately. There is a preparatory process. He"
"begins by robbing people in some miserable little shop, and feels"
"himself democratic. Then he robs in a bank, and at that period he feels"
that he is a Liberal and begins to experience vaguely aristocratic
"ideas. If business goes splendidly, the aristocratic ideas get"
crystallized. Then he can come to Rome and go into ecstasies over
"all the humbugs of Catholicism; and after that, one is authorized to"
"acknowledge that the religion of our fathers is a beautiful religion,"
"and one finishes by giving a tip to the Pope, and another to Cardinal"
"Verry, so that they will make him Prince of the Ecumenical Council or"
Marquis of the Holy Crusade.”
"that fate which should transform it into a chaos of rotting remains,"
and finally into dust.
"The gates were open, one half of them displaced and lying on the ground"
"at the entrance, while between its bars had grown the grass, which also"
covered the large and empty court-yard.  In the depths of this yard
"stood a low, iron-roofed, smoke-begrimed building.  The house itself"
"was of course unoccupied, but this shed, formerly a blacksmith's forge,"
"was now turned into a ""dosshouse,"" kept by a retired Captain named"
Aristid Fomich Kuvalda.
"In the interior of the dosshouse was a long, wide and grimy board,"
measuring some 28 by 70 feet.  The room was lighted on one side by four
"small square windows, and on the other by a wide door.  The unpainted"
"brick walls were black with smoke, and the ceiling, which was built of"
"timber, was almost black.  In the middle stood a large stove, the"
"furnace of which served as its foundation, and around this stove and"
"along the walls were also long, wide boards, which served as beds for"
"the lodgers.  The walls smelt of smoke, the earthen floor of dampness,"
and the long wide board of rotting rags.
"The place of the proprietor was on the top of the stove, while the"
boards surrounding it were intended for those who were on good terms
with the owner and who were honoured by his friendship.  During the day
"the captain passed most of his time sitting on a kind of bench, made by"
"himself by placing bricks against the wall of the courtyard, or else in"
"the eating house of Egor Vavilovitch, which was opposite the house,"
where he took all his meals and where he also drank vodki.
"Before renting this house, Aristid Kuvalda had kept a registry office"
for servants in the town.  If we look further back into his former
"life, we shall find that he once owned printing works, and previous to"
"the appreciation of the best qualities of the hero: his modesty, his"
"dignity, his reticence, his courage and his constancy: he seems to"
combine all the qualities of the best soldier with those of the best
"civilian, without the more obvious qualities which generally attract"
"first. As for the love-story, we must not _expect_ any child to see"
"its tenderness and beauty, though the individual child may intuitively"
"appreciate these qualities, but it is not what we wish for or work for"
at this period of child-life.
This method could be applied to various stories. I have chosen the _Tin
Soldier_ because of its dramatic qualities and because it is marked off
(probably quite unconsciously on the part of Andersen) into periods
which correspond to the child's development.
In Eugene Field's exquisite little poem of “The Dinkey Bird” we find
"the objects familiar to the child in _unusual_ places, so that some"
imagination is needed to realise that “big red sugar-plums are clinging
to the cliffs beside that sea”; but the introduction of the fantastic
bird and the soothing sound of the Amfalula Tree are new and delightful
"sensations, quite out of the child's personal experience."
Another such instance is to be found in Mrs. W. K. Clifford's story of
"Master Willie. The abnormal behaviour of familiar objects, such as a"
"doll, leads from the ordinary routine to the paths of adventure. This"
"story is to be found in a little book called “Very Short Stories,” a"
most interesting collection for teachers and children.
"We now come to the second element we should seek in material--namely,"
"the element of the unusual, which we have already anticipated in the"
story of the Tin Soldier.
This element is necessary in response to the demand of the child who
"dined quite cheerfully on dry bread and water, if any one would have"
listened to his stories of the wonders of his past life or the yet more
wonderful achievements of his future. He would have sat and spun yarns
"concerning the notches on Killiecrankie at a dyke-back, though he had"
"not tasted food for twenty-four hours, with the utmost composure and"
"relish. But his companions were of another kidney, being all valiant"
"trencher-men--John Mortimer desiring chiefly quantity in his eating,"
"while Etienne, no mean cook himself, desiderated rather variety and"
delicacy in the dishes which were set before him.
"At all events the dinner was a great success, though the Sergeant, who"
"evinced the greatest partiality for Rollo, often reproached him with"
"eating little, or inquired anxiously if the sauce of a certain dish"
"were not to his taste. Rollo, in the height of his argument, would"
"hastily affirm that it was delicious, and be off again in chase of some"
"deed of arms or daring, leaving the Sergeant's _chef-d'oeuvre_"
untasted on his plate.
At this the Sergeant shook his head in private to El Sarria.
"""It will stand in his way, I fear me,"" he said sententiously; ""was there"
ever a notable general yet who had not a fine belly to wag before him
upon horseback? 'Tis as necessary as the cock's feathers in his hat. Now
there is your cut-and-thrust officer who is good for nothing but to be
first in charges and to lead forlorn hopes--this colonel of yours is
just the figure for him. I have seen many a dozen of them get the lead
between their ribs and never regretted it before. But it is a devil's
pity that this young cockerel is not fonder of his dinner. How regardeth
"he the women?"""
"This last question was asked anxiously, yet with some hope. But this"
also El Sarria promptly scattered to the winds.
"appeared before us in a vital form, nothing can really destroy it; it"
"is because things are often given in a blurred, faint light that they"
gradually fade out of our memory. A very keen scientist was deploring
"to me, on one occasion, the fact that stories were told so much in the"
"schools, to the detriment of science, for which she claimed the same"
indestructible element that I recognise in the best-told stories.
"Being very much interested in her point of view, I asked her to tell"
"me, looking back on her school days, what she could remember as"
standing out from other less clear information. After thinking some
"little time over the matter, she said with some embarrassment, but with"
a candour that did her much honour:
"“Well, now I come to think of it, it was the story of Cinderella.”"
"Now, I am not holding any brief for this story in particular. I think"
the reason it was remembered was because of the dramatic form in which
"it was presented to her, which fired her imagination and kept the"
memory alight. I quite realise that a scientific fact might also have
been easily remembered if it was presented in the form of a successful
chemical experiment: but this also has something of the dramatic appeal
and will be remembered on that account.
Sully says: “We cannot understand the fascination of a story for
"children save in remembering that for their young minds, quick to"
"imagine, and unversed in abstract reflection, words are not dead things"
"but _winged_, as the old Greeks called them.”[37]"
The Red Queen (in “Through the Looking-Glass”) was more psychological
than she knew when she made the memorable statement: “When once you've
"_said_ a thing that _fixes_ it, and you must take the consequences.”"
"In Curtin's Introduction to “Myths and Folk Tales of the Russians,” he"
"studied accidental glance which sees so much, I have felt almost sure"
that you were far from satisfied that Trehayne was the man he gave
"himself out to be. I have been useful to you. I have eaten your salt,"
and have served you as faithfully as was consistent with the supreme
Orders by which I direct my action. With you I have run down and
"captured German agents, wretched lumps of dirt, whom I loathe as much"
as you do. Those who have sworn fidelity to this fair country of
"England, and have accepted of her citizenship--things which I have"
never done--and then in fancied security have spied upon their adopted
"Mother, I loathe and spit upon. I have taken the police oath of"
"obedience to my superiors, and I have kept it, but I have never sworn"
"allegiance to His Majesty your King, whom I pray that God may preserve"
"though I am his enemy. To your blunt English mind, untrained in logic,"
my sentiments and actions may lack consistency. But no. Those agents
"whom we have run down, you and I, were traitors--traitors to England."
Of all traitors for whom Hell is hungry the German-born traitor is the
"most devilish. I would not have you think, my friend, that I am at one"
with them. Never while I have been in your pay and service have I had
any communication direct or indirect with any of the naturalised-
"British Prussian scum, who have betrayed your noble generosity. I have"
"taken my Orders from Vienna, I have communicated always direct with"
Vienna. I am an Austrian naval officer. I am no traitor to England.

"Risca looked round the dainty room, his whenever he chose to occupy it,"
"and knew how much, especially of late, it held of Stellamaris. It had"
"been redecorated a short while before, and the colours and the patterns"
and all had been her choice and specification.
"The castle architect, a young and fervent soul called Wratislaw, a"
"member of the Art Workers' Guild, and a friend of Herold's, who had"
"settled in Southcliff-on-Sea, and was building, for the sake of a"
"precarious livelihood, hideous bungalows which made his own heart sick,"
"but his clients' hearts rejoice, had been called in to advise. With"
"Stellamaris, sovereign lady of the house, aged fifteen, he had spent"
hours of stupefied and aesthetic delight. He had brought her armfuls of
"designs, cartloads of illustrated books; and the result of it all was"
"that, with certain other redecorations in the house with which for"
"the moment we have no concern, Risca's room was transformed from"
late-Victorian solidity into early-Georgian elegance. The Adam Brothers
"reigned in ceiling and cornice, and the authentic spirit of Sheraton,"
"thanks to the infatuated enterprise of Wratislaw, pervaded the"
"furniture. Yet, despite Wratislaw, although through him she had spoken,"
the presence of Stellamaris pervaded the room. On the writing-table lay
"a leather-covered blotter, with his initials, J. R., stamped in gold. In"
"desperate answer to a childish question long ago, he had described the"
bedspread on his Parian marble bed in the palace as a thing of rosebuds
and crinkly ribbons tied up in true-lovers' knots. On his bed in
Stella's house lay a spread exquisitely Louis XV in design.
"Risca looked about the room. Yes, everything was Stella. And behold"
in _Shadowings_) also gives a vivid account of his own childish

might be invoked in support of the James-Lange or physiological theory of
"emotion, according to which the element of bodily change in emotion is the"
cause and not the result of the emotion.]
[Footnote 90: This physiological symbolism was clearly apprehended long
ago by Hobbes: 'As anger causeth heat in some parts of the body when we
are awake; so when we sleep the overheating of the same parts causeth
"anger, and raiseth up in the brain the imagination of an enemy. In the"
"same manner as natural kindness, when we are awake, causeth desire and"
"desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so also, too much"
"heat in those parts, while we sleep, raiseth in the brain an imagination"
"of some kindness shown. In sum, our dreams are the reverse of our waking"
"imaginations; the motion, when we are awake, beginning at one end, and"
"when we dream at another' (_Leviathan_, Part 1. ch. 2).]"
"[Footnote 91: 'The pains of disappointment, of anxiety, of unsuccess, of"
"all displeasing emotions,' remarks Mercier (art. 'Consciousness,' Tuke's"
"_Dictionary of Psychological Medicine_), 'are attended by a definite"
feeling of misery which is referred in every case to the epigastrium.' He
"adds that the pleasures of success and good repute, aesthetic enjoyment,"
"etc., are also attended by a definite feeling in the same region. This"
fact indicates the extreme vagueness of organic sensation. There is in
"fact much uncertainty and great difference of opinion as to the nature,"
"and even the existence, of organic sensation; see _e.g._ a careful summary"
"of the chief views by Dr. Elsie Murray, 'Organic Sensation,' _American"
"Journal of Psychology_, July 1909.]"
"[Footnote 92: More than ten years later, the same dreamer, who had"
depression on the stone wall by which we descend to the lower dungeon
"is shown as the spot against which St. Peter's head rested, though our"
guide had just told us that these stairs were not in existence then and
prisoners were let down into the dungeon through the hole in the middle
of the stone floor. Such trifling discrepancies do not seem to trouble
the average Italian mind.
St. Peter and St. Paul are said to have been bound in this prison for
"nine months to a pillar, which is shown here. ""A fountain of excellent"
water beneath the floor of the prison is attributed to the prayers
"of St. Peter, that he might have wherewith to baptize his gaolers,"
"Processus and Martinianus; but, unfortunately for this ecclesiastical"
"tradition, the fountain is described by Plutarch as having existed at"
"the time of Jugurtha's imprisonment"" here, long before the time of St."
Peter.

Cosmo and Damiano as that which burst forth in answer to the prayers of
"Felix IV., that he might have water to baptize his disciples."
[Sidenote: What the Head of St. Paul Did.]
But the most interesting of all the miraculous springs in or around
"Rome are the three fountains, about two miles from the city, where the"
Apostle Paul was executed. When his head was severed from his body it
"bounded from the earth three times, crying out thrice, ""Jesus! Jesus!"
"Jesus!"" A fountain burst from the ground at each of the three spots"
"where the severed head struck. It is asserted, in proof of this origin"
"of the fountains, that the water of the first is still warm, of the"
"second tepid, and of the third cold, but we drank of them one after"
another without being able to detect any difference in temperature. The
apostle's head is shown in bas relief upon the three altars above the
acts (or legislation) we destroy the very tracts we have improved.
"The Indian must ultimately be merged into the body politic, as has been"
"affirmed. But in bringing about this desideratum, it is not necessary to"
crush all happiness out of his life. For fifty years the Indian has
"followed a devious and uncertain trail, in the fond hope that he might"
"reach his journey’s end. If men and women, who through unintentional"
"ignorance have given no heed to the welfare of our red Americans, will"
"interest their Representatives in Congress, and also help to crystallize"
"public opinion against further harmful legislation, it is quite possible"
that the National Commission plan may be carried into effect. After many
"years of study of the subject, I firmly believe that the welfare of the"
Indian depends upon the creation of such a Commission as has been
"indicated—one composed not of those interested in political parties, but"
"on the contrary of competent men who understand Indians and their needs,"
of men who are willing to devote the best years of their lives to
"transforming the rough, uncertain trail along which the Indian has"
"toiled, into a broad highway, upon which the Red Man may safely travel"
to his ultimate destination—the civilized community. And having reached
"the end of his journey, the Indian will live henceforth peacefully, and"
"enjoy to the full the blessings of liberty, equality and justice."

"So far we have dealt only with the negative results of stories, but"
"there are more important effects, and I am persuaded that if we are"
"careful in our choice of stories, and artistic in our presentation"
"(so that the truth is framed, so to speak, in the memory), we can"
unconsciously correct evil tendencies in children which they only
recognise in themselves when they have already criticised them in
the characters of the story. I have sometimes been misunderstood on
"this point, therefore I should like to make it quite clear. I do"
_not_ mean that stories should take the place entirely of moral or
"direct teaching, but that on many occasions they could supplement"
"and strengthen moral teaching, because the dramatic appeal to the"
imagination is quicker than the moral appeal to the conscience. A child
will often resist the latter lest it should make him uncomfortable
or appeal to his personal sense of responsibility: it is often not in
"his power to resist the former, because it has taken possession of him"
before he is aware of it.
"As a concrete example, I offer three verses from a poem entitled “A"
"Ballad for a Boy,” written some twelve years ago by W. Cory, an Eton"
master. The whole poem is to be found in a book of poems known as
“Ionica” (published by George Allen and Co.).
"The poem describes a fight between two ships, the French ship"
_Téméraire_ and the English ship _Quebec_. The English ship was
"destroyed by fire. Farmer, the captain, was killed, and the officers"
taken prisoners:
"“They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;"
"And as the wounded captives passed, each Breton bowed the head."
"Then spoke the French lieutenant, 'Twas the fire that won, not we:"
witness the exhibition.  It was a fine stretch of ground which had been
"chosen—nearly a mile in length, and with several natural obstacles,"
"which had been increased in some cases artificially, to test better the"
strength and skill of horse and rider.  A stream of water with rather
"awkward banks ran across the course in one place, and in another was a"
dip in the ground filled with gorse bushes—a nasty place to get
"entangled in, if the horse could not be persuaded to clear the whole"
thing with a flying leap.  A broken stone wall with a ditch in front was
"another obstacle; and the last was a barrier entirely artificial, made"
"of hurdles and bushes high enough to tax the mettle of any horse, though"
"not absolutely insurmountable. Still it was a formidable object enough,"
"and Grey looked at it critically, walking Don Carlos up and down, to let"
the creature take his own observations with regard to the leap he was to
make.
"""It was here they were busy yesterday, but I could not see all they did."
I was afraid to leave Don Carlos with so many strangers about.  Some of
the grooms with the other horses looked up to mischief. But I heard them
say afterwards that Lord Sandford had not been satisfied with the field
as it was.  He said they must have something that really would be a
"test, or the black stallion and Don Carlos were like to come in"
"together."""
"But now a horn blew gaily, and horsemen were seen approaching from many"
quarters.  In the neighbourhood of the inn all was bustle and
"excitement, whilst from all sides there appeared streams of people"
converging to this spot.  Some fine carriages had been driven out from
"London, with bedecked ladies eager to witness the contest.  Others had"
stayed the night in the neighbourhood to be ready; and all the natives
"of the place who could get a holiday had come to gape at the fine folks,"
and see the grand gentlemen racing their own horses.
The Girl chided him with gentle authority.
"""You keep perfectly still--you mustn't say nothin' 'til you've rested."
"Everythin's all right an' you needn't worry a bit."" But then seeing that"
"he chafed at this, she added: ""Well, then, I'll tell you all there is to"
"know."" And then followed an account of the happenings of that night. It"
"was not a thoroughly truthful tale, for in her narrative she told him"
"only what she thought was necessary and good for him to know, keeping"
the rest to herself. And when she had related all that there was to tell
"she insisted upon his going to sleep again, giving him no opportunity"
"whatsoever to speak, since she left his bedside after drawing the"
curtains.
Unwillingly the man lay back and tried to force himself to be patient;
"but he fretted at the enforced quietude and, as a result, sleep refused"
to come to him. From time to time he could hear the Girl moving
noiselessly about the room. The knowledge that she was there gave him a
"sense of security, and he began to let his thoughts dwell upon her. No"
longer did he doubt but what she was a real influence now; and the
thought had the effect of making him keenly alive to what his life had
"been. It was not a pleasant picture that he looked back upon, now that"
he had caught a glimpse of what life might mean with the Girl at his
side. From the moment that he had taken her in his arms he realised to
"the full that his cherished dream had come true; he realised, also, that"
there was now but one answer to the question of keeping to the oath
"given to his father, and that was that gratitude--for he had guessed"
"rightly, though she had not told him, that she had saved him from"
capture by the Sheriff and his posse--demanded that he should put an end
to his vocation and devote his life henceforth to making her happy.
Once or twice while thus communing with himself he fancied that he heard
"There is still much land available for cocoanut planting, though but"
"little of it is government land. Both coasts are fit for this industry,"
"unlike the banana industry, which thrives only on the Atlantic shore."
"Panama is outside of the hurricane belt, which gives an added advantage"
to the cocoanut planter. Elsewhere in the Caribbean the trees suffer
severely from the high winds.
The lumber of Panama will in time come to be one of its richest assets.
In the dense forests hardwoods of a dozen varieties or more are to be
"found, but as yet the cost of getting it out is prohibitive in most"
sections. Only those forests adjacent to streams are economically
"valuable and such activity as is shown is mainly along the Bayano,"
"Chucunaque, and Tuyra Rivers. The list of woods is almost interminable."
The prospectus of one of the companies with an extended territory on the
"Bayano River notes eighteen varieties of timber, commercially valuable"
on its territory. Among those the names of which are unfamiliar are the
"espavé (sometimes spelled espevé), the cocobolo, the espinosa cedar, the"
zoro and the sangre. All are hard woods serviceable in cabinet making.
The espavé is as hard as mahogany and of similar color and marking. The
trees will run four to five feet thick at the stump with saw timber 60
"to 70 feet in length. Espinosa trees are of the cedar type, growing to"
"enormous size, frequently exceeding 16 feet in circumference. The"
"cocobolo is a hard wood, but without the beauty to fit it for cabinet"
work. The sangre derives its name from its red sap which exudes from a
"gash like blood. It takes a high polish, and is in its general"
characteristics not unlike our cherry.
For the casual tourist the lumber district most easy of access is that
along the Bayano River reached by a motor boat or steam launch in a few
"hours from Panama. The trip is frequently made by pleasure seekers, for"
perhaps nowhere in the world is the beauty of a phosphorescent sea at
"night so marvelously shown, and few places easily found by man show such"
"riser,--also what he usually takes for dinner,--whether he drinks wine"
"or is a total abstainer, and at what hour he retires to rest. All this"
is so INTENSELY interesting to the public! Perhaps he might be inclined
"to give me a few notes of his recent tour in the East, and of course I"
"should be very glad if he will state his opinions on the climate,"
"customs, and governments of the countries through which he has passed."
"It's a great pity this is not his own house,--it is a pretty place and"
"a description of it would read well. Let me see!""--and she"
"meditated,--"" I think I could manage to insert a few lines about this"
"apartment, . . it would be easy to say 'the picturesque library in the"
"house of the Honble. Francis Villiers, where Mr. Alwyn received me,'"
"etc.,--Yes! that would do very well!--very well indeed! I should like"
"to know whether he has a residence of his own anywhere, and if not,"
"whether he intends to take one in London, because in the latter case it"
would be as well to ascertain by whom he intends to have it furnished.
A little discussion on upholstery is so specially fascinating to my
"readers! Then, naturally, I am desirous to learn how the erroneous"
"rumor of his death was first started, . . whether in the course of his"
"travels he met with some serious accident, or illness, which gave rise"
"to the report. Now,""--and she shut her note-book and folded her"
"hands,--""I don't mind waiting an hour or more if necessary,--but I am"
"sure if you will tell Mr. Alwyn who I am, and what I have come for, he"
"will be only too delighted to see me with as little delay as possible."""
"She ceased. Villiers drew a long breath,--his compressed lips parted in"
a slightly sarcastic smile. Squaring his shoulders with that peculiar
pugnacious gesture of his which always indicated to those who knew him
"well that his mind was made up, and that nothing would induce him to"
"alter it, he said in a tone of stiff civility:"
"""I am sorry, madam, . . very sorry! ... but I am compelled to inform"
you that your visit here is entirely useless! Were I to tell my friend
explicit.
At the present recruitment in the Indian Educational Service is made in
England and is practically confined to Englishmen. Such racial
"preference is in my opinion, prejudicial to the interest of education."
"The best man available, English or Indian should be selected"
"impartially, and high scholarship should be the only test."
It has been said that the present standard of Indian Universities is
"not as high as that of British Universities, and that the work done by"
the former is more like that of a sixth form of public schools in
England. It is therefore urged that what is required for an Educational
officer is the capacity to manage classes rather than high scholarship.
I do not agree with these views: (1) there are Universities in Great
Britain whose standards are not higher than ours; I do not think that
the Pass Degree even of Oxford or Cambridge is higher than the
corresponding degree here; (2) the standard of the Indian Universities
is being steadily raised; (3) the standard will depend upon what the men
entrusted with Educational work will make it. For these reasons it is
necessary that the level of scholarship represented by the Indian
Educational Service should be maintained very high.
"In paragraph 83,631 I have stated that even these Indians who have"
distinguished themselves in European Universities have little chance of
entering the higher Educational Service. I should like to add that these
highly qualified Indians need only opportunities to render service which
would greatly advance the cause of higher education. As regards
"graduates of Indian Universities, I have known men among them whose"
works have been highly appreciated. If promising Indian graduates are
"given the opportunity of visiting foreign Universities, I have no doubt"
that they would stand comparison with the best recruits that can be
obtained from the West.
primitive symbolic tendency to objectify the subjective. Men have taken
"out of their own hearts their best feelings and their worst feelings,"
"and have personalised and dramatised them, bowed down to them or stamped"
"on them, unable to hear the voice with which each of their images spoke:"
"'I am thyself.' Our conceptions of religion, of morals, of many of the"
"mightiest phenomena of life, especially the more exceptional phenomena,"
"have grown up under this influence, which still serves to support many"
movements of to-day by some people imagined to be modern.
"Dreaming, as we have seen, is not the sole source of such conceptions."
"But they could scarcely have been found convincing, and possibly could"
"not even have arisen, among races which were wholly devoid of dream"
"experiences. A large part of all progress in psychological knowledge,"
"and, indeed, a large part of civilisation itself, lies in realising that"
"the apparently objective is really subjective, that the angels and demons"
and geniuses of all sorts that once seemed to be external forces taking
possession of feeble and vacant individualities are themselves but modes
of action of marvellously rich and varied personalities. In our dreams we
"are brought back into the magic circle of early culture, and we shrink and"
shudder in the presence of imaginative phantoms that are built up of our
"own thoughts and emotions, and are really our own flesh."

"When, in November, 1917, I passed through the district, the preparing"
"of the canoes was already afoot. All of those, which still could be"
"repaired, had been taken to pieces and were being relashed, recaulked"
"and repainted. In some hamlets, new dug-outs were being scooped. After"
"a few months stay in the Trobriands, I went South again in March, 1918,"
intending to spend some time in the Amphletts. Landing there is always
"difficult, as there are no anchorages near the shore, and it is quite"
impossible to disembark in rough weather at night. I arrived late in a
"small cutter, and had to cruise between Gumasila and Domdom, intending"
to wait till daybreak and then effect a landing. In the middle of
"the night, however, a violent north-westerly squall came down, and"
"making a split in the main-sail, forced us to run before the wind,"
southwards towards Dobu. It was on this night that the native boys
"employed in the boat, saw the mulukwausi flaming up at the head of"
"the mast. The wind dropped before daybreak, and we entered the Lagoon"
"of Sanaroa, in order to repair the sail. During the three days we"
"stopped there, I roamed over the country, climbing its volcanic cones,"
paddling up the creeks and visiting the villages scattered on the
coral plain. Everywhere I saw signs of the approaching departure for
"Boyowa; the natives preparing their canoes on the beach to be loaded,"
collecting food in the gardens and making sago in the jungle. At the
"head of one of the creeks, in the midst of a sago swamp, there was a"
"long, low shelter which serves as a dwelling to Dobuan natives from"
the main Island when they come to gather sago. This swamp was said
to be reserved to a certain community of Tu'utauna.
"Another day I came upon a party of local natives from Sanaroa, who"
"were pounding sago pulp out of a palm, and sluicing it with water. A"
I suppose that he pads them out with little rubber insets. He alters
"his voice, and his figure, and even his height. He can be stiff and"
"upright like a drilled soldier, or loose-jointed and shambling like a"
"tramp. He is a finished artist, and employs the very simplest means."
"He could, I truly believe, deceive his wife or his mother, but he will"
never again deceive me. I am not a specially observant man; still one
"can make a shot at most things when driven to it, and I object to"
"being the subject of Dawson's ribaldry. If you will take my tip, you"
"will be able to spot him as readily as I do now."""
"""Good. I should love to score off Dawson. He is an aggravating beast."""
"""Study his ears,"" said I. ""He cannot alter their chief characters. The"
"lobes of his ears are not loose, like yours or mine or those of most"
men and women; his are attached to the back of his cheekbones. My
"mother had lobes like those, so had the real Roger Tichborne; I"
noticed Dawson's at once. Also at the top fold of his ears he has
"rather a pronounced blob of flesh. This blob, more prominent in some"
"men than in others, is, I believe, a surviving relic of the sharp"
point which adorned the ears of our animal ancestors. Dawson's
ancestor must have been a wolf or a bloodhound. Whenever now I have a
"strange caller who is not far too tall or far too short to be Dawson,"
"if a stranger stops me in the street to ask for a direction, if a"
"porter at a station dashes up to help me with my bag, I go for his"
ears. If the lobes are attached to the cheekbones and there is a
"pronounced blob in the fold at the top, I address the man instantly as"
"Dawson, however impossibly unlike Dawson he may be. I have spotted him"
"twice now since he bowled me out, and he is frightfully savage--especially"
as I won't tell him how the trick is done. He says that it is my duty to
"tell him, and that he will compel me under some of his beloved Defence of"
the Realm Regulations. But the rack could not force me to give away my
"precious secret. Cherish it and use it. You will not tell, for you love"
It must have been somewhat painful for Erasmus that his friend had so
"far surpassed him in power and position, and was now called to bring by"
diplomatic means the solution which he himself would have liked to see
"achieved by ideal harmony, good will and toleration. He had never"
"trusted Aleander, and was more than ever on his guard against him. As a"
"humanist, in spite of brilliant gifts, Aleander was by far Erasmus's"
"inferior, and had never, like him, risen from literature to serious"
theological studies; he had simply prospered in the service of Church
magnates (whom Erasmus had given up early). This man was now invested
with the highest mediating powers.
To what degree of exasperation Erasmus's most violent antagonists at
Louvain had now been reduced is seen from the witty and slightly
malicious account he gives Thomas More of his meeting with Egmondanus
"before the Rector of the university, who wanted to reconcile them. Still"
"things did not look so black as Ulrich von Hutten thought, when he wrote"
"to Erasmus: 'Do you think that you are still safe, now that Luther's"
"books are burned? Fly, and save yourself for us!'"
Ever more emphatic do Erasmus's protestations become that he has nothing
to do with Luther. Long ago he had already requested him not to mention
"his name, and Luther promised it: 'Very well, then, I shall not again"
"refer to you, neither will other good friends, since it troubles you'."
"Ever louder, too, are Erasmus's complaints about the raving of the monks"
"at him, and his demands that the mendicant orders be deprived of the"
right to preach.
In April 1521 comes the moment in the world's history to which
"Christendom has been looking forward: Luther at the Diet of Worms,"
"holding fast to his opinions, confronted by the highest authority in the"
Empire. So great is the rejoicing in Germany that for a moment it may
"appear at Augsburg, stands before the legate Cajetanus and refuses to"
recant. Seething enthusiasm surrounds him. Just about that time Erasmus
"writes to one of Luther's partisans, John Lang, in very favourable terms"
about his work. The theses have pleased everybody. 'I see that the
"monarchy of the Pope at Rome, as it is now, is a pestilence to"
"Christendom, but I do not know if it is expedient to touch that sore"
"openly. That would be a matter for princes, but I fear that these will"
act in concert with the Pope to secure part of the spoils. I do not
understand what possessed Eck to take up arms against Luther.' The
letter did not find its way into any of the collections.
"The year 1519 brought the struggle attending the election of an emperor,"
"after old Maximilian had died in January, and the attempt of the curia"
to regain ground with lenity. Germany was expecting the long-projected
"disputation between Johannes Eck and Andreas Karlstadt which, in truth,"
"would concern Luther. How could Erasmus, who himself was involved that"
"year in so many polemics, have foreseen that the Leipzig disputation,"
which was to lead Luther to the consequence of rejecting the highest
"ecclesiastical authority, would remain of lasting importance in the"
"history of the world, whereas his quarrel with Lee would be forgotten?"
On 28 March 1519 Luther addressed himself personally to Erasmus for the
"first time. 'I speak with you so often, and you with me, Erasmus, our"
ornament and our hope; and we do not know each other as yet.' He
"rejoices to find that Erasmus displeases many, for this he regards as a"
"sign that God has blessed him. Now that his, Luther's, name begins to"
"get known too, a longer silence between them might be wrongly"
"interpreted. 'Therefore, my Erasmus, amiable man, if you think fit,"
"acknowledge also this little brother in Christ, who really admires you"
"and feels friendly disposed towards you, and for the rest would deserve"
"no better, because of his ignorance, than to lie, unknown, buried in a"
corner.'
"we are accustomed to say that they are very backward, and that they"
have remained children for a long time. People are in the habit of
saying strange things.”
Felix Adler says: “Perhaps the chief attraction of Fairy Tales is due
to their representing the child as living in brotherly friendship with
"nature and all creatures. Trees, flowers, animals, wild and tame, even"
the stars are represented as comrades of children. That animals are
only human beings in disguise is an axiom in the Fairy Tales. Animals
"are humanised, that is, the kinship between animal and human life"
is still keenly felt; and this reminds us of those early animistic
interpretations of nature which subsequently led to doctrines of
metempsychosis.”[33]
I think that beyond question the finest animal stories are to be found
"in the Indian Collections, of which I furnish a list in the Appendix."
With regard to the development of the love of nature through the
"telling of the stories, we are confronted with a great difficult in the"
"elementary schools, because so many of the children have never been out"
"of the towns, have never seen a daisy, a blade of grass and scarcely a"
"tree, so that in giving, in form of a story, a beautiful description"
"of scenery, you can make no appeal to the retrospective imagination,"
and only the rarely gifted child will be able to make pictures whilst
"listening to a style which is beyond his everyday use. Nevertheless,"
"once in a way, when the children are in a quiet mood, not eager for"
"action but able to give themselves up to the pure joy of sound, then"
it is possible to give them a beautiful piece of writing in praise of
"Nature, such as the following, taken from _The Divine Adventure_, by"
Fiona Macleod:
“Then he remembered the ancient wisdom of the Gael and came out of the
says:
“I remember well the feeling roused in my mind at the mention or sight
of the name _Lucifer_ during the early years of my life. It stood for
"me as the name of a being stupendous, dreadful in moral deformity,"
"lurid, hideous and mighty. I remember the surprise which, when I had"
"grown somewhat older and began to study Latin, I came upon the name in"
Virgil where it means _light-bringer_--the herald of the Sun.”
Plato has said: “That the End of Education should be the training by
suitable habits of the Instincts of Virtue in the Child.”
"About two thousand years later, Sir Philip Sidney, in his “Defence of"
"Poesy,” says: “The final end of learning is to draw and lead us to so"
"high a perfection as our degenerate souls, made worse by their clay"
"lodgings, can be capable of.”"
And yet it is neither the Greek philosopher nor the Elizabethan poet
that makes the every-day application of these principles; but we have
"a hint of this application from the Pueblo tribe of Indians, of whom"
Lummis tells us the following:
“There is no duty to which a Pueblo child is trained in which he has
to be content with a bare command: Do this. For each he learns a
fairy-tale designed to explain how children first came to know that
"it was right to ‘do this,’ and detailing the sad results that befell"
"those who did otherwise. Some tribes have regular story-tellers, men"
who have devoted a great deal of time to learning the myths and stories
"of their people and who possess, in addition to a good memory, a vivid"
"imagination. The mother sends for one of these, and having prepared a"
"feast for him, she and her little brood, who are curled up near her,"
"await the Fairy Stories of the dreamer, who after his feast and smoke"
Chief among the objections is the clause which would give the United
States authority to seize the vessels in time of war. It is quite
evident that this power might be employed to the complete destruction of
the Fruit Company’s trade; in fact to its practical extinction as a
business concern. A like power existing in England or Germany would not
"be of equal menace to any single company flying the flag of that nation,"
for there the government’s needs could be fully supplied by a proper
apportionment of requisitions for ships among the many companies. But
with the exceedingly restricted merchant marine of the United States the
danger of the enforcement of this right would be an ever-present menace.
It is for this reason that the Fruit Company steamers fly the British
"flag, and the American in Colon may see, as I did one day, nine great"
ocean ships in the port with only one flying the stars and stripes. The
opening of the canal will not wholly remedy this.

THE END OF THE CROCODILE]
"In all respects save the registry of its ships, however, the Fruit"
Company is a thoroughly American concern and to its operations in the
Caribbean is due much of the good feeling toward the United States which
"is observable there. In 1912 it carried 1,113,741 tons of freight, of"
"which 359,686 was general freight, carried for the public in addition"
"to company freight. This is a notable public service, profitable no"
doubt but vital to the interests of the American tropics. It owns or
"holds under leases 852,650 acres, and in 1912 carried to the United"
"States about 25,000,000 bunches of bananas, and 16,000,000 bunches to"
Great Britain and the Continent. Viewed from the standpoint of the
consumer its work certainly has operated to cheapen bananas and to place
them on sale at points where they were never before seen. The banana has
not participated in the high cost of living nor has one company
"though it contained a definitely evolved plot, sent barely a ripple over"
the surface of succeeding authorship. It represents the steadfastness of
the maiden Melibaea against the entreaties of her lover Calisto and the
"much more crafty, indeed almost successful, wiles of the procuress,"
"Celestine. True, the play is dull enough. But if dramatists had been"
"awake to their defects, the value of the new importation from a foreign"
"literature would have been noticed. The years passed, however, without"
"producing imitators, until some time in the years between 1544 and 1551"
"a Latin scholar, reading the plays of Plautus, decided to write a comedy"
"like them. Latin Comedies, both in the original tongue and in"
"translation, had appeared in England in previous years, but only as"
"strayed foreigners. Nicholas Udall, the head master of Eton School,"
"proposed a very different thing, namely, an English comedy which should"
rival in technique the comedies of the Latins. The result was _Ralph
Roister Doister_. He called it an Interlude. Posterity has given it the
title of 'the first regular English comedy'.
"Divided into five acts, with subordinate scenes, this play develops its"
story with deliberate calculated steps. Acts I and II are occupied by
Ralph's vain attempts to soften the heart of Dame Christian Custance by
"gifts and messages. In Act III come complications, double-dealings."
"Matthew Merrygreek plays Ralph false, tortures his love, misreads--by"
"the simple trick of mispunctuation--his letter to the Dame, and thus,"
"under a mask of friendship, sets him further than ever from success."
"Still deeper complexities appear with Act IV, for now arrives, with"
"greetings from Gawin Goodluck, long betrothed to Dame Custance, a"
"certain sea-captain, who, misled by Ralph's confident assurance,"
"misunderstands the relations between the Dame and him, suspects"
"disloyalty, and changes from friendliness to cold aloofness. This, by"
"vexing the lady, brings disaster upon Ralph, whose bold attempt, on the"
"suggestion of Merrygreek, to carry his love off by force is repulsed by"
that Dame's Amazonian band of maid-servants with scuttles and brooms. In
He is a bit of a softy from the look of him. That tender-hearted lot
"are always the most obstinate when asked to give away their pals."""
"""Do you know, Dawson,"" I said, as he went upstairs with me to have a"
"lick and a polish, as he put it--""I am inclined to agree with Cary"
"that you are rather an inhuman beast."""
"My wife, with whom I could exchange no more than a dozen words and a"
"wink or two, gripped the situation and played up to it in the fashion"
which compels the admiration and terror of mere men. Do they humbug
"us, their husbands, as they do the rest of the world on our behalf?"
"She met Dawson as if he were an old family friend, heaped hospitality"
"upon him, and chaffed him blandly as if to entertain a police officer"
with a warrant and handcuffs in his pocket were the best joke in the
"world. ""My husband, Mr. Dawson, needs a holiday very badly, but won't"
take one. He thinks that the war cannot be pursued successfully unless
he looks after it himself. If you would carry him off and keep him
"quiet for a bit, I should be deeply grateful."" She then fell into a"
discussion with Dawson of the most conveniently situated prisons. Mrs.
"Copplestone dismissed Dartmoor and Portland as too bleakly situated,"
but was pleased to approve of Parkhurst in the Isle of Wight--which I
rather fancy is a House of Detention for women. She insisted that the
"climate of the Island was suited to my health, and wrung a promise"
"from Dawson that I should, if possible, be interned there. Dawson's"
manners and conversation surprised me. His homespun origin was
"evident, yet he had developed an easy social style which was neither"
"familiar nor aggressive. We were in his eyes eccentrics, possibly what"
"he would call among his friends ""a bit off,"" and he bore himself"
"towards us accordingly. My small daughter, Jane, to whom he had been"
presented as a colonel of police--little Jane is deeply versed in
"military ranks--took to him at once, and his manner towards her"
confirmed my impression that some vestiges of humanity may still be
because of the extraordinary uses and associations of it within the
last thousand years.
[Sidenote: A Winter Trip to Monza.]
"So, regardless of the wet, cold, foggy weather that we found in"
"Milan, and the rivers of mud and slush that were then doing duty for"
"streets, and the splotches of snow that lay here and there in the"
"forlorn-looking olive orchards, we took the electric tram, which was"
"comfortably heated, and ran out to Monza, a distance of some ten miles."
"When we stepped into the chilly cathedral and looked about us, we could"
"not at first see anybody to show us around, though there were a good"
many poor people saying their prayers there. Evidently the custodians
were not expecting tourists at such a season and in such weather.
"But presently, in an apartment to the left, we found a number of the"
priests warming their hands over a dish of twig coals covered with a
"light layer of white ashes, which they kindly stirred a little to make"
them give forth more heat as they saw us stretch our cold hands also
towards the grateful warmth.
[Sidenote: The Treasury of the Cathedral.]
"When we asked if we could see the Iron Crown, they said we could; but"
"instead of going at once to the chapel in which it is kept, they got a"
"great bag of keys, large keys, thirty-seven in number, as the observant"
"statistician of our party ascertained, and led us into the treasury and"
"unlocked a great number of doors (one of which had seven locks), and"
showed us the costly objects and precious relics above mentioned. We
"were only mildly interested in these--even in the apostolic baskets,"
"the Virgin's veil, and John the Baptist's tooth--partly because we were"
so cold and partly because of our greater interest in the more famous
relic which we had come especially to see.
LAST CHANCES.
At an early hour on Sunday all Kirton seemed astir. The streets were
"alive with thronging people, with banners, with inchoate and still"
"amorphous processions, with vendors of meat, drink, and newspapers."
"According to the official arrangements, the proceedings were not to"
"begin till one o'clock, and, in theory, the forenoon hours were left"
"undisturbed; but, what with the people who were taking part in the"
"demonstration, and those who were going to look on, and those who hoped"
"to suck some profit to themselves out of the day's work, the ordinary"
"duties and observances of a Sunday were largely neglected, and Mr."
"Puttock, passing on his way to chapel at the head of his family, did not"
lack material for reprobation in the temporary superseding of religious
obligations.
"The Governor and his family drove to the Cathedral, according to their"
"custom, Eleanor Scaife having pleaded in vain for leave to walk about"
"the streets instead. Lady Eynesford declined to recognise the occasion,"
and Eleanor had to content herself with stealthy glances to right and
left till the church doors engulfed her. The only absentee was Alicia
"Derosne, and she was not walking about the streets, but sitting under"
"the verandah, with a book unopened on her knees, and her eyes set in"
empty fixedness on the horizon. The luxuriant growth of a southern
"summer filled her nostrils with sweet scents, and the wind, blowing off"
"the sea, tempered the heat to a fresh and balmy warmth; the waves"
"sparkled in the sun, and the world was loud in boast of its own beauty;"
"but poor Alicia, like many a maid before, was wondering how long this"
"wretched life was to last, and how any one was ever happy. Faith bruised"
and trust misplaced blotted out for her the joy of living and the
"exultation of youth. If these things were true, why did the sun shine,"
"and how could the world be merry? If these things were true, for her the"
"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far"
"away from the village. She had but little to bite and less to burn, so"
she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. He skipped and
"leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a"
"cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch"
"to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for"
the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he
"walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he"
"crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O,"
"you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing"
"terribly!"" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the"
"stone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked"
him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his
"shirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite"
"white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ""You"
"fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it"
"had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes"
"cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out"
"in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his"
"jacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had"
"raised itself from the ground on one side. ""Yes, and I'm sure it is"
"because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" said the boy. But when he"
"looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under"
"the stone. ""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one"
"lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."" And he took the"
"chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole"
pile of money. But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top
"of the water. ""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will"
"float,"" said the boy. And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket"
"home with him. He told his mother what had happened to him, that the"
"stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver"
When you are alone in the forest all this life will come and talk to
"you, if you are quiet and understand. There is love deep down in the"
"passionate heart of the flower, as there is in the little quivering"
"honeysucker flitting after his mate, as there was in Romeo long ago."
There is majesty in the huge brown precipice greater than ever looked
from the face of a king. All life is one. The soul that moves within you
when you hear the deer call to each other far above in the misty meadows
of the night is the same soul that moves in everything about you. No
people who have lived much with Nature have failed to descry this. They
"have recognised the life, they have felt the sympathy of the world about"
"them, and to this life they have given names and forms as they would to"
"friends whom they loved. Fairies and goblins, fauns and spirits, these"
are but names and personifications of a real life. But to him who has
"never felt this life, who has never been wooed by the trees and hills,"
"these things are but foolishness, of course."
"To the Burman, not less than to the Greek of long ago, all nature is"
"alive. The forest and the river and the mountains are full of spirits,"
"whom the Burmans call Nats. There are all kinds of Nats, good and bad,"
"great and little, male and female, now living round about us. Some of"
"them live in the trees, especially in the huge fir-tree that shades half"
an acre without the village; or among the fernlike fronds of the
"tamarind; and you will often see beneath such a tree, raised upon poles"
"or nestled in the branches, a little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
perhaps two feet square. You will be told when you ask that this is the
"house of the Tree-Nat. Flowers will be offered sometimes, and a little"
"water or rice maybe, to the Nat, never supposing that he is in need of"
"such things, but as a courteous and graceful thing to do; for it is not"
"safe to offend these Nats, and many of them are very powerful. There is"
"a Nat of whom I know, whose home is in a great tree at the crossing of"
"two roads, and he has a house there built for him, and he is much"
"than what had offered itself elsewhere, may be said to have led to"
his popularity; and by means of his popularity he reacted on his
"readers, stimulating their mental thirst, feeding their hopes, setting"
"before them visions, which when once seen are not easily forgotten,"
"and silently indoctrinating them with nobler ideas, which might"
afterwards be appealed to as first principles.”
If Cardinal Newman could thus maintain the value of Fiction in the
great ecclesiastical movement which has regenerated the Church of
"England, I may claim without apology that the reform in Poor Law"
Administration gained the attention of the public when Dickens made
"“Bumbledom” ridiculous, and that the Court of Chancery was swept"
cleaner by the breezes which were blowing from _Bleak House_. Let any
man run over in his mind the undoubted improvements in social matters
"during the last fifty years, and it will be seen how Fiction has"
assisted in their promotion. Did Charles Reade’s _Hard Cash_ do
nothing to arouse the attention of the public to the condition of the
insane? Did Sir Walter Besant’s novels turn no light on the sins of
"the sweater, or Charles Kingsley’s _Alton Locke_ show no reason for"
legalizing the Trade Union and the reform of the Law of Conspiracy?
"Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe may to-day be forgotten, but the southern"
states of North America would not dispute the influence of Fiction
upon the public mind.
"The fact is that men, who generally read nothing else but newspapers,"
"will read a good novel, and if the book brings before them principles"
"which they have hitherto neglected, they will very often consider"
"those principles again. It is necessary, however, that the novel shall"
appeal to them as being a fair record of the present or the past. They
may as they read it be unable to pronounce on the thesis which is at
"the back of the book, but they will be led to consider and discuss it"
"if the story, as a story, holds them. And it is here that the story"
"luckless Scotchmen, and in the 200 years that have elapsed they have"
clung to the tradition of friendship for the Briton and hatred for the
Spaniard. Dr. Pittier reports having found that Queen Victoria occupied
"in their villages the position of a patron saint, and that they refused"
to believe his assertion that she was dead. His account of the attitude
"of these Indians toward outsiders, recently printed in the National"
"Geographic Magazine, is an authoritative statement on the subject:"
“The often circulated reports of the difficulty of penetrating into the
"territory of the Cuna-Cuna are true only in part”, he says. “The"
"backwoods aborigines, in the valleys of the Bayano and Chucunaque"
"rivers, have nourished to this day their hatred for all strangers,"
especially those of Spanish blood. That feeling is not a reasoned one:
it is the instinctive distrust of the savage for the unknown or
"inexplicable, intensified in this particular case by the tradition of a"
long series of wrongs at the hands of the hated Spaniards.
"“So they feel that isolation is their best policy, and it would not be"
safe for anybody to penetrate into their forests without a strong escort
"and continual watchfulness. Many instances of murders, some confirmed"
"and others only suspected, are on record, and even the natives of the"
San Blas coast are not a little afraid of their brothers of the
mountains.
"“Of late, however, conditions seem to have bettered, owing to a more"
frequent intercourse with the surrounding settlements. A negro of La
"Palma, at the mouth of the Tuyra River, told me of his crossing, some"
"time ago, from the latter place to Chepo, through the Chucunaque and"
"Bayano territories, gathering rubber as he went along with his party. At"
the headwaters of the Canaza River he and his companions were held up by
"the ‘bravos’, who contented themselves with taking away the rubber and"
part of the equipment and then let their prisoners go with the warning
"effort must be made if affairs were to be placed on a better footing,"
and if a protest were to be raised against the cynical criticism in
"which the Reviewers indulged. Consequently, in April 1817, a literary"
periodical called the _Edinburgh Monthly Magazine_ was started by two
"gentlemen of some experience in literary matters, with the assistance"
"of Mr. William Blackwood, an enterprising Edinburgh publisher, whose"
reputation had grown of recent years to considerable dimensions. This
magazine was not a great success: the editors and publisher did not
"agree, and finally Mr. Blackwood purchased the formers' share in it,"
"took over the magazine himself, and, to make matters clear, gave it his"
name; thus in October of the same year the first number of _Blackwood's
Edinburgh Magazine_ appeared. From a quiet and unobtrusive 'Miscellany'
"the magazine developed into a strongly partisan periodical, with a"
"brilliant array of young contributors, determined to oppose the"
"_Edinburgh Review_ régime with all its might, and not afraid to speak"
its mind respecting the literary gods of the day. Every month some one
"came to their ears as Miss Higgins, who had charge of the little"
"group, posed them against an old, overturned dory. ""A perfect"
"type--native--girls----freedom----wild beauty----"" She resented the"
"rotting dory. Vick had leaned against a crimson velvet chair. Why,"
"her hair had not been combed since the morning before, her skirt"
was in tatters where she had torn it climbing into Top Notch; she
"was horribly conscious of her long legs, bare, brown, and bruised."
Sidney found that posing in the morning sun on a beach at Provincetown
was not the lark Vick had declared posing for the great Stuart Gelding
had been. But then Vick had flirted a little with Stuart Gelding and
had always had a cup of tea with him and his wife afterward; these art
students appeared to have forgotten that their models were human with
legs that ached from holding a position and arms that trembled with
very eagerness to move. It was not one bit of fun.
Another series of these pictures in the portico represents the story
"of a sacristan who, coming to pray in this church before day, found it"
"filled with worshippers, and was told by St. Laurence himself that they"
"were the Apostle Peter, the first martyr, Stephen, and other apostles,"
"martyrs and virgins from paradise, and was ordered to go and tell the"
"Pope what he had seen, and bid him come and celebrate a solemn mass."
"The sacristan objected that the Pope would not believe him, and asked"
for some visible sign. Then St. Laurence ungirt his robe and gave him
his girdle. When the Pope was accompanying him back to the basilica
"they met a funeral procession. To test the powers of the girdle, the"
"Pope laid it on the bier, and at once the dead arose and walked."
[Sidenote: The Miracles of St. Dominic.]
That is not the only miracle of resurrection offered to our credulity
by these ecclesiastical legends. The three principal frescoes in the
"chapter house of the church of St. Sisto, recently painted by the"
"Padre Besson, represent three miracles of St. Dominic--in each case of"
raising from the dead--the subjects being a mason who had fallen from
"a scaffold when building this monastery, a child, and the young Lord"
"Napoleone Orsini, who had been thrown from his horse and instantly"
"killed, and who was brought to life by St. Dominic on this spot, as"
is further commemorated by an inscription on the wall. But miracles
were nothing uncommon in the history of the founder of the powerful
"Dominican Order. In the refectory of St. Marco, at Florence, we had"
seen the fine fresco which represents the miraculous provision made
for him and his forty friars at a time of scarcity by two angels. The
refectory in which this miracle took place is at the Church of St.
"Sabina, on the Aventine, in Rome; but there are three other things at"
this church which interested us hardly less than the scene of that
"miracle. One of them is the huge, pumpkin-shaped, black stone, two or"
"three times as big as a man's head, which the devil is said to have"
"necessity of THAT! And, oddly enough, these lists scarcely ever include"
"the name of a poet,--which is the absurdest mistake ever made. A"
liberal education in the highest works of poesy is absolutely necessary
"to the thinking abilities of man. But, Alwyn, YOU need not trouble"
"yourself about what is good for the million and what isn't, . ."
whatever you write is sure to be read NOW--you've got the ear of the
"public,--the 'fair, large ear' of the ass's head which disguises Bottom"
"the Weaver, who frankly says of himself, 'I am such a tender ass, if my"
"hair do but tickle me, I must scratch!'"""
Alwyn smiled. He was thinking of what his Shadow-Self had said on this
"very subject--""A book or poem, to be great, and keep its greatness"
"hereafter, must be judged by the natural instinct of PEOPLES. This"
"world-wide decision has never yet been, and never will be, hastened by"
"any amount of written criticism,--it is the responsive beat of the"
"enormous Pulse of Life that thrills through all mankind, high and low,"
"gentle and simple,--its great throbs are slow and solemnly measured,"
"yet if once it answers to a Poet's touch, that Poet's name is made"
"glorious forever!"" He.. in the character of Sah-luma.. had seemed to"
"utter these sentiments many ages ago,--and now the words repeated"
themselves in his thoughts with a new and deep intensity of meaning.
"""Of course,"" added Villiers suddenly--""you must expect plenty of"
"adverse criticism now, as it is known beyond all doubt that you are"
"alive and able to read what is written concerning you,--but if you once"
"pay attention to critics, you may as well put aside pen altogether, as"
it is the business of these worthies never to be entirely satisfied
"with anything. Even Shelley and Byron, in the critical capacity, abused"
"Keats, till the poor, suffering youth, who promised to be greater then"
"either of them, died of a broken heart as much as disease. This sort of"
"injustice will go on to the end of time, or till men become more"
Christianized than Paul's version of Christianity has ever yet made
"Future,--he was, without knowing it, in the simple, unconsciously"
"perfect attitude of a Soul that is absolutely at one with God, and that"
"thus, in involuntary God-likeness, is only happy in the engendering of"
"happiness. He believed that, with the Divine help, he could do a"
"lasting good for his fellow-men,--and to this cause he was willing to"
sacrifice everything that pertained to his own mere personal advantage.
"But now,--now,--or so he imagined,--he was not to be allowed to pursue"
"his labors of love,--his trial was to end suddenly,--and he, so long"
"banished from his higher heritage, was to be restored to it without"
"delay,--restored and drawn back to the land of perfect loveliness where"
"Edris, his Angel, waited for him, his saint, his queen, his bride!"
"A thrill of ecstatic joy rushed through him,--joy intermingled with an"
almost supernal pain. For he had not as yet said enough to the
"world,--the world of many afflictions,--the little Sorrowful Star"
"covered with toiling, anxious, deluded God-forgetting millions, in"
"every unit of which was a spark of Heavenly flame, a germ of the"
"spiritual essence that makes the angel, if only fostered aright."
"Lost in a deep reverie, his footsteps had led him unconsciously to the"
"Rhine bridge,--paying the customary fee, he walked about half-way"
"across it, and stood for a while listening to the incessant swift rush"
of the river beneath him. Lights twinkled from the boats moored on
"either side,--the moon poured down a wide shower of white beams on the"
"rapid flood,--the city, dusky and dream-like, crowned with the majestic"
"towers of the Dom, looked picturesquely calm and grand--it was a night"
of perfect beauty and wondrous peace. And he was to die!--to die and
"leave all this, the present fairness of the world,--he was to depart,"
"with, as he felt, his message half unspoken,--he was to be made"
"eternally happy, while many of the thousands he left behind were,"
"through ignorance, wilfully electing to be eternally miserable! A"
"great, almost divine longing to save ONE,--only ONE downward drifting"
"befitting manner. A procession was formed, and, to the measured tread"
"of the Earl Marshal of England, Cardinal Vaughan, several archbishops"
"and bishops, and a mixed company of priests and acolytes and a numerous"
"train of household servants and dependents, carrying banners, crosses,"
"crucifixes, censers, lamps, candles, torches, and other ecclesiastical"
"stage paraphernalia, the remains of St. Edmund were borne to their"
"resting-place. All went off well, and at last the curtain fell on"
"the finished play, to the satisfaction of every one. Unfortunately,"
"however, the Pope and all concerned had to reckon with English"
"common-sense and with English love of truth, and it was not very long"
"before it was proved to the world that the bones, like most relics of"
"the kind, were counterfeit--whoever else's bones they were, they were"
"not those of St. Edmund.""[7]"
[Sidenote: The Blood of St. Januarius.]
I had read with cordial approval Mark Twain's animadversions upon the
fraud which is regularly practiced on the people of Naples by the
priests in the Cathedral:
"""In this city of Naples they believe in and support one of the"
wretchedest of all religious impostures one can find in Italy--the
miraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius. Twice a year
"the priests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out"
"this phial of clotted blood, and let them see it slowly dissolve"
and become liquid; and every day for eight days this dismal farce
"is repeated, while the priests go among the crowd and collect money"
for the exhibition. The first day the blood liquefies in forty-seven
"minutes--the church is full then, and time must be allowed the"
collectors to get around; after a while it liquefies a little quicker
"and a little quicker every day, as the houses grow smaller, till on"
"the eighth day, with only a few dozen present to see the miracle, it"
"""Indeed!""--Alwyn's glance swept over him with a faint, cold scorn"
"--""And what religion do the scientific and cultured classes propose to"
"invent as a substitute?"""
"""There's no necessity for any substitute,""--said the gentleman rather"
"impatiently.. For those who want to believe in something supernatural,"
"there are plenty of different ideas afloat, Esoteric Buddhism for"
"example,--and what is called Scientific Religion and Natural"
"Religion,--any, or all, of these are sufficient to gratify the"
"imaginative cravings of the majority, till they have been educated out"
"of imagination altogether:--but, for advanced thinkers, religion is"
"really not required at all."" [Footnote: The world is indebted to Mr."
"Andrew Lang for the newest ""logical"" explanation of the Religious"
"Instinct in Man:--namely, that the very idea of God first arose from"
the terror and amazement of an ape at the sound of the thunder! So
choice and soul-moving a definition of Deity needs no comment!]
"""Nay, I think we must worship SOMETHING!"" retorted Alwyn, a fine satire"
"in his rich voice, ""if it be only SELF!--Self is an excellent"
"deity!--accommodating, and always ready to excuse sin,--why should we"
"not build temples, raise altars, and institute services to the glory"
and honor of SELF?--Perhaps the time is ripe for a public proclamation
"of this creed?--It will be easily propagated, for the beginnings of it"
"are in the heart of every man, and need very little fostering!"""
"His thrilling tone, together with the calm, half-ironical"
"persuasiveness of his manner, sent a sudden hush down the table. Every"
"one turned eagerly toward him,--some amused, some wondering, some"
"admiring, while Villiers felt his heart beating with uncomfortable"
"quickness,--he hated religious discussions, and always avoided them,"
"and now here was Alwyn beginning one, and he the centre of a company of"
"persons who were for the most part avowed agnostics, to whose opinions"
"Before quitting the subject of the relics at Rome, I must give my"
"readers what Hare calls ""the extraordinary history of the manufacture"

"""In the year 1802, while some excavations were going forward in the"
"Catacombs of Priscilla, a sepulchre was discovered containing the"
skeleton of a young female; on the exterior were rudely painted some
of the symbols constantly recurring in these chambers of the dead--an
"anchor, an olive branch (emblems of Hope and Peace), a scourge, two"
"arrows, and a javelin; above them the following inscription, of which"
the beginning and end were destroyed:
"--""LUMENA PAX TE CUM FI""--"
"The remains, reasonably supposed to be those of one of the early"

"We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal."
It's gonna take two seconds to get our-
- Both of you stop.
Blair's right.
"Connor, shut up."
I'll help her.
Riley and I got this.
"Hey, what?"
No.
Right?
Fuck it.
Let's do it.
We're staying together.
Just go find a signal.
Go.
"We'll go, we'll go."
No.
Wait.
The door.
Spirits.
"Oh, no no no."
Connor!
Yeah.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."
"Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out."
"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."
"Blair, just go find a signal, okay."
"We gotta go, we gotta go."
We'll be back.
I don't repeat things.
"And I hope I don't offend you, but I don't respect Korean men too much."
There are some good men though.
"Yeah, I guess."
Take care of your leg.
Hope your script comes out great.
I'm sure you'll do well.
I really like you.
"Yes, good-bye."
Moonsook.
Thank you.
It was under the bed.
"Oh, really?"
When are you going home?
The day after tomorrow.
How about you?
I'm going now.
Hope you think things over well.
"Yes, I will."
I'll be going.
Good-bye.
My car...
We'll push it for you.
"- We'll push, you drive."
"- So I have to get in, right?"
Here we go.
Steer to the left a bit.
- Like this?
- Left.
"Left, like this?"
I think it's getting out!
- Thank you so much.
Excellent!
What's wrong now?
You've suffered internal injuries!
You're joking!
Touch your rib cage.
Does it hurt?
No.
No?
What about this spot?
"Yes, it hurts a bit."
"You've breathing problems, too."
"Yes, how do you know?"
I think you trained much too hard.
I must try to relieve your tension.
You'll be okay when that's done.
Does it hurt?
No!
It doesn't!
What's wrong?
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
It's burning...
Stop it!
It won't hurt.
Have you finished?
Feeling better?
You're great!
Of course.
You dare to hit me?
How many hands you want to use?
You're magnificent!
I'd get the witch hazel.
"And I'd say, ""Witch hazel?"
"""What are you, 90?"
"Get some fucking painkillers."""
"And I'd say, ""Hey, it's an excellent astringent,"
"""and we're out of aspirin."""
"I'd turn the argument into a good, hard, angry fuck."
"Well, that's where we might have a problem."
What do you mean?
I've got... a bit of a problem in the downstairs department.
What?
"You know, downstairs."
What?
!
Where?
!
"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
- My cock doesn't work!
- What?
My cock doesn't work!
Hi...
He's watching us.
"We can't help it, Sid."
No.
"It's OK, isn't it?"
Isn't it?
It's fine.
We're fine.
Fine.
OK?
- I'm fine...
- And dandy...
Get 'em!

"You can't do that, old man."
"Let go, you!"
"Oh, you!"
You bully you!
You great big brute.!
You bully you.!
You brute.!

Come on.

Really!
You men cover the back.
You come with me.
You're under arrest!
"- Marjorie, are you all right?"
"- Yes, I think so."
But where have you been?
Locked in a garage.
Had to dig my way out.
I got here as soon as I got the police.
who cares?
OK.
You're ugly.
You're the ugliest woman of Earth.
Everyone knows it but me.
To me.
You're beautiful.
You don't know me.
When will I know you?
Enough.
I mean...
In two weeks?
A year?
Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No.
I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No.
I'm fine here.
Not me.
I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course.
I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.
Short circuit the control system.
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
Look out.
Get out of my way.
Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
"Come on, we must get him out of here."
Hurry up.
Careful.
Take it easy.
Shit!
Let's go - they've mined the entire dam!
They're running away.
Let's go!
Come on!
The whole place is going to blow up!
"Come on, get over there!"
Get away from there!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Careful.
- Dad!
Dad!
"- What happened, Pablito?"
- I saw men with guns.
- Were they soldiers?
"No, revolutionaries."
They're coming to our village.
- What do they want?
- Let's wait and see.
We are your friends.
I hope you know that.
We'll march on soon.
All we're asking for is provisions and water.
"We'll rest a bit, and then we'll march on."
"My village is poor, but we'll share."
I love these gushing receptions.
Really charming.
"Well, it's going to better use there."
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-we help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"Paige, you started lying to us..."
I didn't lie.
"Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
Do you?
- You lie to us.
You lie.
- Dad!
Stop!
- What are you doing?

- You go behind our backs.
- Stop it!
- Why?

Does this book tell you to do that?

Does it?

Emergency signal from Fred.
What happened last night...
"The French are out of Rochefort, and we're the only English at sea."
We must let the flagship weigh anchor.
We are going for that fire ship.
Beat your drums to quarters.
"- Ponsonby, aim for the fire ship."
"- Yes, sir."
"Come on, every man of you!"
"My God, sir."
Look there.
Bring starboard guns to bear.
Hit her with all you've got.
Steady.
- Fire.
- Fire!
Get the wounded away!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Get this fire out of midship!
Fire party!
Fire!
We'll go under the bows of the fire ship.
Wait!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
- Ease your helm.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Steady.
"Steady she goes, sir."
- Hard to starboard.
"- Hard to starboard, sir."
Stand by with grappling iron.
Now!
He's cute.
I know how to make him feel better.
"No, I know a better way."
Lift him up.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What are you doing this time, Jimmy?"
He's still conscious?
Yes.
Hello.
You'll be fine.
You just gotta get a little bit power.
"Ladies, could you give us a little space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
Here we go.
That's wonderful.
Now we can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you at the lab.
Hello?
"Oh, thank you."
They're Here.
They must have followed you.
I can't...
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
"No, stop!"
Look out for the cow!
"Come on, no, not there!"
please stop.
"No, stop!"
We can't go there yet.
people just aren't ready for you.
That was close.
"We can't go running around like that, okay?"
Look!
That would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
- Then say it!
I want to wear my old dress!
"Oh, dear."
"We'll look for work, even something on the street!"
Why?
Where'd you get that fur?
Where'd you get this?
I ran into an old friend.
- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."
You're not gonna tell me who it was?
I made that up!
Where'd you meet?
On the street?
While I'm risking my neck and showering you with money?
"Get away from me, you tramp!"
You tramp!
Damn you!
Get out of my sight!
I'm out risking my neck and slaving away like crazy!
Franz!
Let me go!
Let go!
This is my home!
Leave me alone!
This is my home!
Open this door!
Just wait until I ―
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
"If she doesn't pay, it comes out of my pocket."
Why call the police?
We'll make her parents pay.
Do you really need the police?
I feel bad for her.
"What, are you willing to pay what she owes?"
"No, but..."
"She won't tell us her address, she's a runaway."
Hey!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey!
He's not coming back.
"He hasn't replied yet, right?"
You were tricked.
Shut up!
He said he's not doing that anymore.
He tells that lie to everyone.
Get your hands off me!
What're you doing here?
Ow...
Let's go.
He went and fought for her.
What about you?
They must be in round two.
Take it easy.
I have to go.
"Does your husband do this to you, too?"
"No, he won't even lay a finger on me."
Sergeant Fujita must be asleep with your kid now.
Don't...
"You're a naughty wife, leaving the kid to your husband."
Turn over the money I only took in this much all day!
How can I?
So what!
?
"Come on, come on"
Turn over the money
Bring it here!
"I've paid the fee everyday, Master"
But business was bad today
Please be patient!
Don't think you can put it off!
Stop!
You bastards
You drink the people's blood!
Let's see how fast you can kill me!
Beat him!
You bully as too much!
"Well, go teach them a lesson!"
Okay!
Use this
Okay
What are you doing?
Let us borrow this for a minute!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Go after you've paid the fees!
Fees?
What fees?
I don't have any money!
"I have a life, though!"
That's enough!
I'll see how hard your bones are!
Hello.
-Hi.
Dude!
Thomas!
How's he doing?
Not so bad.
"There cerebral hematoma, but should to withdraw."
-Will there be consequences?
I had no idea.
I'm not a doctor.
They closed squat.
I know.
"If you want, come in Montrouge."
There are places.
Thank you.
"Here we are, do not worry."
We will avenge you.
Is Pierre here?
"I know 's early, but I see it."
Pierre does not work here.
Yeah?
I'll give you his new address.
I guess he not sit with what detention.
We all have our limits.
"But he seemed love, poor guy."
"Do not bother, you might You may be of help."
I was wondering who posted photos of my investigative files on the Internet.
He is not.
It can not be he said.
But you could be you.
Why would I do?
Because you hate cops.
However...
Knees to chest.
Knees to chest.
You received this cablegram from Robin Masters.
One minute.
"Swimmers, to your mark."
One minute.
"Since your hands appear to be a bit shaky, I'll take the liberty."
Knees to chest.
Knees to chest.
Now bend over.
Bend down.
Take a deep breath.
And up.
""""" All best wishes and good luck."
""""" Everyone here expecting news of your great victory."
"Warmest regards, Robin Masters."""
"Not that he wants you to feel obligated to win, I'm sure."
Thirty seconds.
"Trainers, leave your contestants, please."
Relax.
"Don't worry, Thomas."
You'll do it.
"Good luck, old chap."
Just be cool.
Just be cool.
I only bet the farm.
"On your mark,"
All right.!

"[Man, Indistinct]"
[Horn Honks]
I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.
I can't get any more time.
"- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?"
- You're not gonna get it.
We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car over there.
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"Jimmy, give it up."
Give it up.
It's all over with.
"If there was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew it.
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.
"Walter, listen."
I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I— I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Hey!
Hold— Hold on!
Hold on!
"Break it up, both of you!"
Will you two break it up?
Stop it now.
So I'll call you later.
"Hey, do you mind..."
"uh, driving me home?"
No yoga?
No.
We missed it.
"Um, yeah."
I guess.
"Ok, when did that start and did you know?"
"Well, I mean, I kind of guessed, but..."
Does she know about... you two?
What's there to know?
Hallie should know better.
Seriously.
Anybody that knows you would know that you are so hot for him.
"Becca, I'm not so hot for him."
No.
He's your friend.
And it is so typical of Hallie.
She's a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
It's...
Damn it.
She is a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
"Oh, God!"
"Hallie, it's just frustrating."
It's so much right now.
She doesn't deserve that.
Hallie was there for me when I had that swine flu.
Every time I've broken up with a quasi boyfriend.
And I don't know what I would've done about that stalker if it wasn't for Hallie.
"Here, in my head."
What's your name?
You don't want to tell me!
What about you?
How old are you?
I see.
You're not very talkative!
Are you hungry?
Thirsty?
Good that's a start!
But I would like to hear the sound of your voice.
Maybe you aren't able to speak!
Is that it?
Are you mute?
"Poor wretches, they are mute!"
"Monique, bring them some grenadine."
I understand.
You have to leave.
Let me look at you a while longer.
I'm afraid I may never see you again.
"Listen, I would never betray you."
You can always think of me as a friend!
Are you afraid of those girls?
Cowards.
Coward
You're running away.
You're terrified.
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm going.
I'll bring you back their heads.
Where are they?
- I'm not afraid.
Anybody else?
"No, I don't think so."
Wasn't Bertrand JoyaI with you?
"Yeah, but no..."
Was he there or not?
"He was there in the yard, but he wasn't with us... at the hotel or in the car."
alright.
So when you got there?
He ran away.
And you caught him.
Yeah.
You ran after him?
"Yeah, well Touchy ran, me... with the pick up."
With the pick up?
In the corn?
"Yeah, I've got a bad leg."
So then... you caught him and you brought him back.
What did you do to keep him from running away?
You locked him up?
You aimed the gun at him?
What?
"No, no, we thought that was too dangerous."
Same with locking him up.
We didn't want him to break anything else.
So...
We didn't...
we didn't lock him up.
"In that case, what did you do?"
Did you tie him up?
You tied him up?
You tied him up?
Just like that?
Trust me.
This is it?
What do we do now?
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
No matter what you see... stay in the car...
until I say.
Okay.
Thank you.
Where's your son?
Where's Jasper?
Look.
This is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.
You people killed my wife.
Isn't that enough?
A basic rule of covert ops... is let someone else do your dirty work.
Let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
Oh-
It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.
Move!
Move!
Where's your son?
- What?
You come here to kill me and now-
- I'm not here to kill you.
- That woman out there is.
- Who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
- Where is your son?
- He's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
- Where?
I can't see you.
Come down to the beach and walk to the left.
Left?
Towards the inlet?
"Yeah, turn left and straight on."
Hurry up.
"Okay, be right there."
You told him to walk down that way?
"Yes, in the meantime we should go back to our rooms."
It feels so weird.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
I see nobody here.
Keep on walking to the end of the beach.
All the way to the end?
Yeah.
It's so wonderful.
I'm hearing so much about films from Director Kim.
Keep on walking and you'll see us.
"Alright, wait for me."
Okay.
What is it?
A splinter?
I think so.
I'll poke it out where there's light.
"Yeah, thank you."
Let's tell him that I vomited.
That I got a bad stomachache.
And we had to run to the pharmacist so that's why we missed each other.
Are you worried?
"Okay, we'll do as you say."
On the double!
"Well, at least the search is on."
- Is that everyone?
- One more.
Stiller.
He's bringing the mail from Pasco.
He knows to keep his eyes open.
Got about two hours of light left.
What a mess.
Then let's go down the cliff.
- Why do you do that?
"- We can't make it, that's why."
Those wolves are gonna hang around.
"Anyway, we were dead the minute the engine quit."
- I didn't wanna say anything.
- Why talk that way?
- It's the truth.
- It ain't.
It's what you think'll happen.
- You made a snare and shot a rabbit.
- So what?
I'd rather be trying things than sitting on my butt.
All right.
All right.
Let's go if we're going.
Take what you need.
I was thinking more like a couple of sweaters.
See?
I told you I grew up with boys.
Jesus.
- Do you live by yourself?
"- Yeah, that's right."
Who are you?
I can't see very well.
Shall I read for you?
I'm a cop.
Pardon?
How can I help you?
This fabric isn't so fire resistant.
They're my family.
My blood.
We have to practice thoroughly before the performance.
One tiny mistake leads to a break in the neck and...
She's my eldest daughter.
The kid is my youngest.
My son is on the top.
And the one below is my son-in-law.
Son-in-law?
What can I do to help you?
"From now on, just answer yes or no."
"No explanations, no short answers, no multiple choices."
"Hasn't been that long since this circus opened, right?"
Early this month it...
Answer yes or no.
No.
"It hasn't been long, I see."
So about 4 weeks?
"Well, not that long."
Yes or no!
No.
- About 3 weeks?
- No.
- 2 weeks?
- No.
Now.
"Come on, up the rigging."
Get up!
Come on now!
"Up the rig, there."
Have they died up there?
Keep it moving!
Much better.
You've accomplished wonders with them.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Don't press them too hard.
Twelve minutes 45 seconds to beat.
They'll do it this time.
- Is he badly hurt?
"- Leg broken, sir."
Get him to the surgeon.
- That'll be enough drill for today.
"- Carry on, down below."
- Dismiss the starboard watch!
- Mr. Scott-Padget will you have dinner with me?
- Starboard watch secure.
"- Thank you, sir."
- What about the man injured today?
- Not too good.
I may have to take the leg off.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Scott-Padget asked if he can return to duty.
- You don't like him.
- I've served with him before.
- When?
- In the Beedle.
"Bad ship, that was."
Who is it?
It's Mickey Mouse.
What does he want?
He's come to say good-bye.
What are you waiting for?
I'm a cop.
I don't shoot people in the back.
Another way we're the same.
"No, we're not the same!"
"I uphold the law, and you break it!"
Chang died because ofyou.
I swore I'd get you this time.
"I'm sorry, but I won't let you lock me up."
"Ifyou must take revenge foryour friend, shoot me now."
Don't force me to kill you!
- You'd really kill me?
- I won't let you go this time.
Go ahead.
You can't win all the time.
"Jeffrey, where are you?"
Where is he?
Right in front ofyou.
- Don't take him away.
-Jenny!
Jeffrey's promised me he'll never kill again.
Put that gun down.
"Jenny, put that gun down."
Not unless he leaves us alone.
"I beg you, please, let us go."
I'll never let you arrest him!
Did I kill him?
ls he dead?
I'll force him to fight!
What do you mean?
"If you kill them, how can we tell which faction is superior?"
So you tricked us!
You filthy woman!
You induced me to avoid the archery.
You all go out!
"Sister, what are you doing?"
"Brother, you must not kill them now."
You go away!
"Brother, forget about it!"
Brother!
"Jun-kit, what strike is that?"
Please excuse me!
Come on!
Good strike!
You haven't learned this sword before.
He certainly hasn't!
"Fung-wu, I'll give it back."
You fight better than me!
Take the sword.
Just fight!
You haven't seen this Chin Kang Fist before.
"Brother, stop."
He's changing styles.
I'll see what else they've got!
How about my fist?
You want to learn?
"Brother, are you hurt?"
"It's alright, I haven't hurt him!"
Ridiculous.
Go!
But I'm so close.
Okay.
Do I need the thing to get out?
"Oh, great, you're here."
Let's go down.
Look at this.
"Wow, that's amazing."
Were you able to talk to Patrick about the maintenance?
"Yeah, we spoke this morning."
"Well, it really is amazing."
It just looks so real.
Like this wrapper.
It looks like a real hamburger wrapper.
"- Oh, that wrapper is real."
- What?
Yeah.
I always throw in a few real things.
Kind of cast a glow over the plaster objects.
"You know, kind of bump it all up a notch."
Did you do this at the MoMA show?
"Were there real things in that show, or-"
"Oh, yeah."
Course.
This is mine.
You got it from the staff kitchen.
"No, I made that."
This stuff is really good for your skin.
It has like all these minerals in it.
- Let me see!
- Let mejust finish!
- It doesn't match at all.
- It will.
Do you feel older?
Yes.
So when is your tour starting?
"You know, we actually just had to push it another month."
Our tour manager totally screwed it up.
She got the dates wrong.
"Actually, Cece, who I think you've met."
Oh.
The blonde.
"Yeah, the blonde."
"At the park, and at the show."
Right.
"You... you had a thing with her, right?"
No.
"No, no."
She works with me.
"She's my tour manager, and not into guys."
But what makes you think that I was into her?
The fact that I'm now officially an idiot.
His lesbian tour manager?
Oh.
What's this?
It's a birthday present.
It'll bring you luck.
And I thought you could use a little bit.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
"You're not mad at me, are you?"
No.
"No, it's actually just the opposite."
And that's the problem.
His traces only exist in the past.
Like a ghost hunt.
Ghosts have a soul.
He does not.
"From a technical point of view, A mind is a soul."
"This is not funny, Bishop."
I've seen them kill.
Suicide would be the best option.
"If you're afraid,..."
I get it.
Just put me in the right direction and I go alone.
We must find Cage.
That's not my style.
Not like a hiding place.
Cage is a man!
An old and nasty fighter.
With many weapons.
"He lives four days walking, Inside the death zone."
No human is so crazy.
"I did not say, that is not crazy."
Come.
I know the way
"Hello, guests."
My name is Sara.
"Sorry, my husband is not there."
Will come back later
We wait.
"Cookies, that's milk."
"I can see that, Sara."
Where do you get them?
"I made them, of course."
They try my husband better than his mother's cookies.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
For a few days.
"We've, um..."
[Sighs]
Had this emotional connection for some time... and we just want to see if there is something else there.
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
- Sandra?
- I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm...
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on.
"You, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or... you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter.
- Who is he?
It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do?
Go arrest him?
[Laughs]
Sandra.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do for living?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips for living?
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does your dad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my father was a commander like you."
He died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
Nice.
Where'd you get these things?
- How do I look?
First I gotta know where you got 'em.
I see.
You'd rather look like a tramp than accept something from me.
Take 'em back where you got 'em.
Got that?
Then maybe I should just leave too.
Maybe you should.
"Where'd you get these things, Cilly?"
A girl gave them to me.
I won't ―
I'm telling you:
Watch your step.
"Don't be angry, Franzie."
"None of us are angels, are we?"
Enough!
Let's get down to the bar!
- You really mean it?
- Why not?
Stop pestering it all the time!
And you get out of here with that cigar!
The air's bad enough.
You're nuts!
They've never been in a cage.
They don't understand.
So what's the story?
He wouldn't take the clothes.
"Well, I want Biberkopf, and that's that."
"Well, I won't help."
"I want him, and that's that."
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-gu?
Now what?
Worse than you?
You don't say anything but I hear it.
Go away.
"You can't do it, I'll deal with him myself."
Here he comes.
You are...?
Don't you know me?
How can I not know you?
What's this?
You don't know me but you know her?
You stop.
"We are friends, right?"
- You come with me.
- Where to?
Dicky?
What's this dicky?
Not only at night he's different in day time also.
Actually we are not friends but lovers.
Are we lovers?
I don't believe it.
You must believe it.
How can I?
Was I such a violent guy?
- Remember it?
- Remember it?
How can he remember past with just one scene?
Continue it.
It happened like this then...
When?
"Did you think I forgot everything, right?"
I remember everything.
"What do you remember, sunny?"
The dress says you have.
Oh no!
Oppa!
Welcome.
"Oppa, she said I gained weight."
Did I gain weight?
Does it look like I did?
"I don't know, I can't really tell."
What do you think?
Right.
It's nice.
Shouldn't you be a bit more excited?
Why are you so uninterested?
"He's just like that, don't worry about it."
Here.
The groom's suit!
"Yes, please come this way."
"Don't make any adjustments, I'll lose it by exercising more."
"I'll exercise and starve myself, so don't make any adjustments, okay?"
"If you can't breathe, you'll faint during the ceremony."
"It'll be healed by the wedding, right?"
"Yes, it'll be fine."
Wait.
I can't stand it.
It's old-fashioned.
She's my daughter.
Oh my!
She's beautiful!
I guess.
Ma'am...
She looks like an angel.
How could you have come up with such a phrase?
I love them when they're silly.
"But if they get too silly, they have to come see me."
"- ""Silly""?"
- Mischief.
- Trouble.
- We use gentler terms.
As a policy.
"Well, so what happens when they come see you?"
"Well, we do things a little differently in our program."
The approach is progressive and positive.
"We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids."
"Because 99% of the time, all kids need"
- is a hug.
"- ""A hug""?"
- A squeeze.
"- Well, you squeeze 'em."
- An embrace.
- Oh.
- Oh?
- Well...
- What is it?
- Nothin'.
- Wayne.
- Yeah?
- Speak freely.
"- No, I'd better not."
That's the only way we'll get to know each other.
But do you ever smack 'em?
- Excuse me?
"- Like, give 'em a good whack?"
- I don't follow.
- Do you ever hit the kid?
It was supposed to prevent!
I was supposed to protect them!
I should have expected this!
It was supposed to prevent!
-Enough.
It was supposed to prevent!
It's okay.
You're supposed to stop it!
It's okay.
Okay.
"You're supposed to stop it, Bobby!"
Look at me.
You're a good man.
You're a good man.
"Come on, we have to stand up."
"If Ray came to the road, they will have to hitchhike."
We have to catch him before than catching a ride.
Listen to me.
"When you come to a fork road, turn left ."
This will take you back to the place where you took the family.
I doubt that headed for the highway.
I will go in that direction.
Take this.
I have one in my car.
Bobbi.
-What is it?
Are you in trouble about all this?
I do not know.
I do not give a fuck.
"I'm dying, do you remember?"
What the fuck!
Ti.
Move!
Go!
Go!
- Najim!
"No, wait He's coming."
He's coming.
Stop the car.
- Quickly.
- Come on...
Come on...
Good boy.
Well done.
(GUARD GROANING)
That's not my usual fantasy.
Usually you're wearing latex and a strap on.
"I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humour, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or are you still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
You knew that.
And you fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine yards to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott, you know."
But unfortunately I can only rescue you at the moment.
Lucky me.
Bitch.
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- How many years?
One?
Two?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Partners back each other up.
You have no business telling me how partners should treat each other.
- You had a gun to his head.
- I wasn't going to shoot him.
- I'm trying to solve a murder!
- What murder?
"I hate to tell you this, but you're not a homicide detective any more."
"- 9221, this is base."
Come in.
- Hardy.
We've got another 111.
Northshore.
East of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bow line.
This is Hardy.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Now!
"If the kids have any bad dreams, call this number."
We'll send a counsellor out.
Get the kids home now.
"Kids, come on."
Let's go home.
- Why didn't you question them?
- What for?
- The body was dumped last night.
"Then, we can have... fun afterwards."
Let's do that.
"Enough, okay?"
"I'm really sorry, so let's stop."
I'm a bastard.
"No, I'm an asshole, okay?"
I didn't ask you to apologize to me.
Have I ever done this to you before?
You've done wrong today!
What's wrong with you?
Is that the restaurant you mentioned?
"Yes, it is."
Let's go in.
We'll eat and have a drink.
You must be hungry.
You should eat.
"Let's have a drink, okay?"
Let's go.
Let's have some sushi.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
"- We can sit over there, right?"
- Yes.
- There's three of you?
- Yes.
I thought about it as I was walking.
You're too opportunistic.
Why all the fuss?
You nearly brought tears to my eyes.
What about me that's so opportunistic?
"Frankly, it wasn't tears but disgust."
You were just trying to show me that you're a man.
Say the rest.
I need to hear it.
I love francis more.
What's this?
Open it.
It's blank.
it's nothing.
She let me decide.
"It's odd, isn't it?"
That your mother was the one
To show me what was truly in my heart.
You.
It's you.
It's always been you.
Does this mean you'll marry me?
Yes.
We must protect sebastian.
There are those who will punish him
For reaching for the throne.
Of course.
I'll make sure of it.
I am sorry for the way things have gone.
But the outcome is this.
You need to leave here
And never come back.
"You've reached for the crown,"
And you failed to get it.
You'll be seen by many as a threat.
"The crown was never in my grasp,"
"But I had mary, and it galls you."
I was going to disappear in exile.
"That's your goal now, if you want to survive."
"Yeah, I'm getting there."
Help yourself to as many as you think you deserve.
Help yourself to as many as you think you deserve.
"You're the best, Tel."
"You're the best, Tel."
I mean that.
I mean that.
"You really are a greedy bastard, aren't you?"
"You really are a greedy bastard, aren't you?"
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
You don't like it?
You don't like it?
"No, it's lovely."
"No, it's lovely."
Did I overcook it?
Did I overcook it?
No.
Thanks.
No.
Thanks.
What exactly were you doing today?
What exactly were you doing today?
I was helping Greg pack up his things.
I was helping Greg pack up his things.
He's gonna hitchhike to London or some hippie bullshit.
He's gonna hitchhike to London or some hippie bullshit.
Good riddance.
Good riddance.
(BANG!
I just invented him.
What are you?
A clerk?
- Keep silence!
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, I'm promised to study law."
"Very well, Mr. Dawlish."
"- Ready for inspection, sir."
- Thank you.
The usual beach combings.
It'll take hard work.
They haven't been sworn yet.
What does the surgeon say?
"Ah, Mr. Goss."
"Well, they'll do."
"They'll do very well, sir."
- Excuse me.
I appeal.
- What?
- I'm a gentleman.
- An impostor.
- I questioned him.
"Excuse me, sir."
- Mr. Scott-Padget?
- I must ask you not to turn your back.
"- I apologize, sir."
- My other duties...
"- Until dismissed, your duty is with me."
"Lads, don't think it's the end."
This ship has a fine crew.
Many were pressed like yourselves.
We have every hope of an exciting cruise and rich prizes.
Of course.
"Believe me, I never kill anyone unless I have to."
Well?
- We need...
- The hospital is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
You have 30 seconds.
"After that, we're going to open fire."
Resistance is futile.
I repeat:
Come out with your hands up.
You don't have a chance.
Come out.
"Go, go."
I'll never do what that bastard demands.
Give me a hand grenade.
We might have a chance.
"- Tomás, have you got a smoke bomb?"
- Yes.
Throw it out the door when I give you a sign.
"José, you'll be all right."
They don't know that you're one of us.
- Tell them we took you hostage.
- Thanks for everything you've done.
- Goodbye.
"- Mariá, you can't have a gun battle here."
- Think of the children.
"- They will torture me, if they catch me."
"Tomás, now!"
Let's get out of here.
Fire!
What have you done?
Philip.
I hope that wasn't too bad.
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.
"Oh, hey."
How's it going?
Mmh... good.
We met before.
Er...
I don't think we have.
You sure about that?
Um...
I wanted to tell you I really liked your book.
"Those advance copies really get around, huh?"
"Anyway, the first one's better."
"Um, I haven't read it."
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.
"No, if you were a groupie, you likely would have read both my books."
Are there book groupies?
Author groupies?
"Not many, but yeah."
Hey!
(WHISTLES) Quick thought I just had.
I'm not doing any press for the book at all.
"Readings, interviews."
Nothing.
- You cannot be serious.
"- Oh, quite."
"That's a horrible, horrible idea."
I don't like the idea of being on display.
My mind is made up.
I wanna be left alone.
How long has he been down there?
Not long enough!
Adam...
The auction is about to start.
Christos hasn't turned up
What an idiot.
What's he playing?
You have to run the auction.
Me?
Yes.
Fuck!
Christos!
Are you serious?
Yes!
You're the oldest.
"It has to be a Clios, naturally."
That's the way things are done.
"This night, this gala might affect the situation of every one of us."
Great.
You haven't seen this before.
I don't tnink so.
This is all very impressive.
That's very kind of you.
A vision!
"Oh, forgive me..."
I had a few things I had to tie up.
"Please, not another word."
"So impressive of you, I thought, to hold such an event so soon after your terrible loss."
"I'm sorry, I hope that wasn't..."
"No, not at all!"
You look like you could use a top-up.
Absolutely.
"She drank too much, that's all."
"Oh, yeah?"
What about Marseille?
When will you realize nothing's going on...
Too much garlic...
"Let's give her a few days and then, Shai, you go talk to her."
We stressed her out.
You mean I stressed her out?
- I didn't say that.
- Then why did you look at me?
Butt out.
Who asked you?
You're right.
"- Ricky, what are you doing?"
- Going to have some fun.
How did you know my size?
I asked Ricky.
You're tough on him.
"I didn't tell him to come, and you butt out."
Did he cheat on you?
- Did he hit you?
- Are you crazy?
Then what is it?
"You're just like Aunt Rosa, always hiding things."
"That's right, like the adoption thing."
You even hid it from Morn.
Why can't you share?
- None of your business.
- We can help.
How?
You want to be a surrogate mother?
You're such a hypocrite.
"Whatever you need, Mom."
Whatever you need.
Hey.
How was the pier?
"Okay, I'm not being funny, but there was literally one shop."
Are you serious?
"- I know, right?"
- Yeah.
There are more shops than that... in jail.
"Well, I'm sure you found a way to have fun."
Did Mom seem weird to you?
"Um, not more than usual, but she's fine."
Don't worry.
Well...
"I will be in my room, avoiding risky activities."
So... yeah.
Mom just went off on me and made it clear she doesn't want me to ride.
"- Well, did you talk to her about it?"
- Have you met Mom?
Good point.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway...
"How have you been, Dad?"
How's your time-out going?
It's been pretty quiet.
A little too quiet without you guys.
But tell me about that cute little island you're on.
Did Rosie meet the queen yet?
"The queen, she is in London."
And it's...
It's cool.
I met some new friends.
"And one and two and three, twist."
"A one, two, three."
"Onto the floor, class."
Down you go.
Onto your elbows.
Single leg lift.
Right leg first.
Left leg bent.
Here we go.
And up.
Down.
Up.
Two more.
Get ready to change.
Left leg.
Hold those tummies in.
Enid!
Single leg lift!
"Oh, sorry."
"So, Tubby."
Is he very sad?
What?
What did he look like when you saw him?
He looked like someone finishing off a pasty.
"For frig's sake, Enid, if there's any havoc caused, you've caused it."
Dithering and faffing about.
You never sort anything out!
"And everyone's favourite, the bicycle."
"Summer will come, let's get ready for those bikinis!"
# I am clear on the fear that has led up to where I am now
# Ie feeble and foolish and fed up and lost as to how
"# I can move from the safe and the timid, the fearful, the tepid"
"- What, screw with you?"
Because I can.
You're my son.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't be 15 minutes early like you are.
I have an actual job I go to.
"- Collecting disability, I'm sure, is not as time-consuming as whatever you're doing."
Do you two need a minute?
I can come back.
No.
It's fine.
"What are you having, Dad?"
I'm buying.
I'll have a couple of scrambled.
Is that all?
You don't want bacon?
You love bacon.
Get bacon.
He loves bacon.
Get him some bacon.
Rye toast.
Right?
And I'll have scrambled egg whites and avocado.
Thank you.
Avocado?
Is that what you eat with your lawyer friends?
Avocado.
- I'll be right back.
Why do we...
"Can we just, like, try to have a normal conversation of some kind?"
I'm not starting anything.
- Fine.
Where are you guys going?
Don't you want to play anymore?
Was it something I said?
Sheesh.
"I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living."
So how do you do it?
Ever hear of just being good?
I make it a daily practice.
- I practice being the best.
- At cards?
And other things.
"Well, you'll have to tell me about it, someplace I can hear you."
I have a room.
I have a suite.
You win.
Watch those.
She's in.
Nice pad for a cruise line employee.
I'm an independent contractor.
Better perks.
"Now, where were we?"
You move fast.
- Life's short.
- I have a feeling...
I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite.
Why waste the night talking about other women?
I like you.
I like champagne.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be my guest.
I caught you...
Putting on lipstick.
Bye-bye.
"Doctor, this is an emergency."
This man has been shot.
Come on in.
Let's have a look at you.
Here you go.
Let's get some of these things off so we can take a look at it.
Easy...
There.
Now get up here on the table.
Alright.
Now turn a little bit.
Let me take a look at this.
When did this happen?
Just a little while ago on the street.
Hm-hmm.
You know I'm gonna have to report this to the police.
You know who did it?
"A sniper, I think."
"Hand me a shot, please."
"Sniper, huh?"
Is it serious?
"Well, if you mean are you gonna die?"
I don't think so.
"You know, one of the greatest dangers arising from a gunshot wound is infection, but... they have a cure for that now."
This just came out.
I've had some very dramatic results with it.
What's it called?
Penicillin.
There we are.
My forceps.
Does that hurt?
Give it back to the women.
"Oh, thanks very much."
Little chap.
You're looking much better today.
Come on!
- Did you hear what that idiot asked of me?
"- No, what?"
- I wasn't allowed to take any holiday...
- Prisoners!
They're escaping!
Quickly!
- We must get away!
- What about John?
Better him than us.
Stop!
"Stop, or I'll shoot!"
"Come on, let's get away from here."
"Damn, it won't open!"
- The parcel has arrived.
- OK.
Let's have a look over there.
They're in there.
- Why didn't the capo come along?
- The town is crawling with militia.
- This is Smithy.
- Good work.
Thank you.
"For you, no effort was too great."
A tanker is going to take you out of town.
- The north would be too dangerous.
- I don't care about north or south.
- All I want is to fight Ramírez.
Have you had a nice day?
"Oh, what's this ***"
"Thank you, Nana."
It's so good to be here with you.
This place is so so acceptable.
Aha!
I got it.
I got the job!
We can definitely move out.
"Yeah, I know."
"I know, I was pretty speechless myself at first, but then I thought ""Hey, come on!"
"You know this was just a matter of time."""
I am...
a manager.
Right.
"Well, this is calls for a celebration."
Let's see.
"Would you like a go, Samuel?"
"No, ma-maybe not go too mad."
So we're going to have to throw ourselves into the house hunting.
"You'll be good at that, eh, Becky?"
"Well, not too far away I hope."
"We'll still be seeing you, won't we?"
Yeah.
"I mean yeah, of course."
You'll come to Sunday lunch?
Yeah.
"Yeah, when we can."
Alright.
I've not been on Facebook for four and a half months.
It is time for a status update methinks.
"Won't be strange, dear?"
Enjoying yourself?
Don't be stupid.
This is work.
So flirting with girls is part of your job?
Seeing you grinning makes me want to puke.
Are you getting jealous?
You must be joking.
"Well, cut it out."
"You'll eat, right?"
"Hey, aren't you going to take my order?"
Leave it to me.
"Fine, then."
Reminds me of when we met.
"Just like now, you were quietly eating the kimchi meatloaf I made."
Was I?
Yeah.
You ate it and told me it was like your mom's cooking.
"Oh, I remember."
"You cook so well, I'm sure your restaurant will do well."
So good luck.
But not Korean food.
What?
My restaurant... will serve soba and sake.
You can make soba?
It'll take time.
So you'll have to work extra hard.
Hena.
Are we... breaking up?
Don't talk about that.
"Yeah, this really is good."
Your meatloaf really is the best.
Want some?
Yeah we're good we're just here working on our calves.
Hey Drew.
- Hey hi...
Who was that?
Oh I know... that's a...
That's a client Jill!
Got back off!
Yeah right that's what it is!
Every single...
Jill called her engagement a match made in heaven.
Watching them squabble about wedding cakes and the medicinal benefits of anal sex
I couldn't help but think that Heaven has a strange sense of humor.
I'll call you later OK.
Ok.
- Ok.
Come on Bowie.
Bowie?
Terrible name.
Listen I want to try it...
Its just one little...
We can't even go hiking...
Just one time.
No!
You know that camera looks very good on you.
Aww you think?
So what are you going to do with these pictures?
I don't know.
Maybe sell them on the internet.
Make some money off your ass.
Album cover my man.
I'm telling you.
Want some?
So you've got a bodyguard.
But it can't be you.
"Yes, it's me."
"That seems funny, doesn't it... you and the 12 temptations?"
Sure.
I laughed my head off.
"Well, here i am."
"Well, now, that's just fine."
Let me see.
You can... you can go to the photograph gallery with me.
What?
I have an appointment there at 4:00.
That... that's-that's- that's-just a minute.
One second.
Just a little more light.
"Ah, that's fine."
"Oh, the hands... just put the hands out over on that."
Just relax a little bit.
Give me a little smile.
That's right.
"Hold it just like that, and i'll take one more look."
Oh... i've got it.
"Oh, that is beautiful!"
"Oh, that's so exquisite!"
Ain't you think she looks just like a...
like a... ain't you think so?
Maybe you can see something through that thing that i can't see.
"Well, go ahead."
"Look, look!"
"Oh, so soft... hey, you can't take this."
It's upside down.
"Oh, no."
Welcome home.
Is that a friend?
Welcome home...?
This ship belongs to Mother.
Ohh...
How do you do?
Make yourself at home.
Thank you...
Thanks for the tea.
You're lucky to spend so much time in foreign countries!
Not really.
I'd rather live like you.
What do you mean?
"You probably fight on the front lines for world peace, don't you?"
Yeah.
For world peace...
How did you know that?
Oh... no...
Y-you...!
Yes.
You're right.
You're the one responsible for the kidnappings at our school.
I knew the Dangaioh pilots were disguising themselves as students at Ho'o Academy.
My cell phone...!
We didn't know who it belonged to.
What about the other girls?
Don't worry.
They're precious goods.
I wouldn't harm them.
Goods...?
But you're special...
What are you going to do with me?
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you for meeting me.
I didn't know I had a choice.
I want to take you somewhere.
"You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today."
"You know, like, I could have tests and stuff."
Do you have a test today?
- No.
- Okay.
"Well, then, come on."
Come in!
Christ.
Did I order you?
No.
Mary did.
She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean.
Said you had somewhere to be later.
"I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view."
"Hello, Angel."
It's Annie.
And you look exactly like I thought you would.
Dashing.
Depraved.
"Okay, that's enough standing."
Come on.
"Now, sit."
Stay.
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.
I don't want it.
Are you serious?
Seriously.
Seriously.
I'm glad you think it's funny. making money.
We want you to throw a fight.
I said no.
One thing led to another.
It ended up with me smashing the guy's head in. offered me a deal. they'd set me up with a new life somewhere.
this is somewhere all right.
I fight once in a while.
It stops me going out of my mind and gives me a bit of spare cash.
the Feds don't give you any money?
man.
the fucking assholes-- they literally give me just enough to survive.
That's why I took your deal.
sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
Well... it's good.
We are on.
And the money?
Open book.
Who knows?
000.
But there is one thing.
what's that?
You're fighting Victor.
Do you really have to do this?
Yeah.
I don't want any part of it.
Forget about that shit.
Focus on the job at hand.
Come on.
"Put it down, put it down."
- Let it go.
Put it down.
- I'm taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't work with this guy.
You can't work with me?
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
"I've been here for eight years, and you're just another untalented pretty face."
"- Billy, calm down."
- Untalented?
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up!
"It has nothing to do with you, you moron!"
"Billy, I've warned you before about your attitude."
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
"No, no, fired?"
"Wait, no, don't fire him."
"Look, see, I'm moving it."
I'm moving the cable.
Get him out of here.
"- Stan, don't do this."
"Please, not now?"
"- Come on, I'm sorry."
"- It's too late, Billy."
Chris makes me happy.
That's it.
I'm not taking it.
Okay.
All right.
"Nice, y'all!"
That's the way!
That's the way!
Good teamwork!
You all need to call it!
"Watch that hole in the center, okay?"
You all need to pick that up.
"Hey, time out!"
Time out.
"It's looking great, girls."
They're double blocking me every time.
That's okay.
"No, they've figured out our move."
"No, they did not."
"Now, don't you act like this is luck."
This is not luck.
You all are doing a great job.
We are kind of lucky 'cause their star hitter's out sick.
TAMl:
"No, you all are playing a great game."
You're playing a great game.
I want you to keep it up.
"I want you to keep it simple and remember, you are playing this game and you are winning this game because of your teamwork."
You are a team.
You work together.
"And you, you just focus on that Riggins."
You slam it down his throat.
I did not say anything.
"No, we are not allowed to say."
He said not to talk assignment.
Thi What did he say?
"No, no ..."
Nonsense!
I do not believe it.
- To think about how to get out of here ..
- Thi-thin mouth!
Damn.
He told me to ...
I can not do what I asked.
You must stop this.
"No, no, please!"
"- Room, microphone ..."
Move!
- Are you sick!
If you do not see us or hear us ...
This will end the game.
Do not trust anyone but yourself.
"Sitting or hit you, you fool!"
Duties ...
I can not do.
You know what to say to me?
To kill anyone when you ask me.
Do not you understand?
"Do not want to kill us, want to punish us"
Do you think it will be a loved membiarakan If you follow the rules?
- Are you an idiot Dave.
- Are you crazy?
We can not do anything with it.
We must do what we were told.
You call me a bear?
!
Relax...
See that he doesn't move.
Sit down there!
"What's up, sir?"
Do you know him?
Who is he?
I could tell you.
But you won't believe me.
"Of course, I will!"
He's Laxmi's husband.
Her husband?
!
No!
I can't believe that!
But you just said you would!
He says his name is Banwari.
And you said her husband's name was Durgaprasad!
"Have I told you that, too?"
Are there two husbands then?
Not two husbands.
The husband has two names.
Laxmi fondly addresses Durgaprasad as Banwarilal.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.
"He's down, he's bleeding, and you gotta get there."
"But there's lights, right?"
"All over the city, red lights."
You go through the red lights.
"Sure, you fire up the roof, you wail, you go through the red lights."
That's S.L.
Hello.
"Yes, I'm Babette."
So are we going?
Are we staying?
"No, we have to go."
"Fine, okay."
Good.
If you're looking for me.
I'll be here.
Bye.
Where did you pick up the little one?
Blonde angel.
She just appeared.
How come that doesn't happen to me?
You are too pretty.
Should I make myself ugly or what?
Disguise yourself.
Take a look at this.
You know what this looked like before?
No idea.
I do.
What do we do now?
Do you want me to retrieve the file?
"If you ask me, It was a Halloween prank by a couple of kids from the tattoo shop."
"From earth, the sun and the moon appear to be the same size."
Is it coincidental or physical necessity?
This is good.
"So tell me, what kind of quiz show is this?"
Sauerbruch...
Who would be interested in that?
I don't want to discuss it with you now.
Made right.
- Made right?
- Orders from the fleet.
Take your hands off me.
You mutinous filth!
Don't think you can soon be forgiven.
- It's not easy.
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
I would advise you to say no more.
You're compounding the offence!
You're in it with them!
Your friends will be dealt with.
"When their lordships hear what I have to say, you're done."
You're under arrest.
You've done for us all.
What's it matter?
You all wanted him dead.
You're as bad as him.
"And between you, you've finished all of us."
Give me a knife!
Get back!
"We had everything, and he took it from us!"
- Let's go.
- While the fog's thick.
"They're right, Vizard."
I want no sound.
We're gonna weigh anchor and make sail.
- Weigh anchor.
- Quiet now.
Anchor aweigh!
Set the courses!
Course west-sou'west.
"- I'm so frustrated, Claire."
"Give him an ""I want sex"" look."
He'll think something's in my eye.
You have to generate heat.
"Sometimes, I swear he feels it."
Men aren't that bright.
It's easy.
"Be subtle, mysterious, seductive."
"Subtle, mysterious, seductive?"
Why don't men come with instructions?
- More coffee?
- Thanks.
My tickets just arrived.
My first lecture is in Paris on the 24th.
I leave Saturday.
- Do you want an English muffin?
"- No, thanks."
- I'm off.
I have an early class.
- All right.
Have a nice day.
"- Oh, by the way..."
- Mmm?
Would saying now that I want sex tonight be enough of a warning?
Or should we wait till you come back from Europe?
"Yeah, that's better."
"No, no..."
That's fine.
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.
Have a nice day.
- Have you ever tried making love?
"I was doing it in her sleep, but you woke her up."
I did wrap the blade in silk.
She's not hurting too much.
Come!
Do you want to finish the job?
Mary...
I love her.
And me.
- Do you love me?
"- Léo, yes!"
"Speaking of which, she told me again that I made love to her like nobody else."
Then she told me that it wasn't important.
"My father, my mother, you."
Love.
"The same feet, the same toes,"
the same footprints.
Footprints change with the sole of your shoes.
"The mud without marks, that's me."
You're cold.
You're warm.
You're hot.
You burn.
You kill.
Do you want to finish me?
Don't piss about!
"Take off your sneakers, so they think we aren't here."
I won't give her up to anybody.
No.
She belongs to me.
"If God made us, he would have made us different."
The rats have made off.
I'm offering you quiet on the Western front!
I certainly didn't lay a hand on her.
Ok.
Sorry.
Ok.
Step together.
*** together.
"Right, left, and turn!"
And pose.
I know what you're doing.
What?
Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?
Listening to a little live music?
"Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't..."
Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?
- Great show.
- You were awesome!
"It was amazing, really."
But we have to go.
We do?
We do.
"Good job, man."
- What'd you think?
- It was really good.
"Come on, you're a musician."
You actually know what you're talking about.
- Bring it.
- Uh... ok.
"Um, your energy was really good."
"The songs are good, but, um, I don't know."
"I don't think they were being articulated as well as they could be, I guess."
I know we're not as tight as middle school honors band.
You guys used to play together?
"Now, I'm asking you for the last time."
Who were they?
"Now, you're not going to eat until you talk, so you may as well talk now."
"Now listen, Johnny, here."
Listen to me.
"Now, you tell me who those other fellows were and I'll let you go, see?"
"Come on, who were they, huh?"
Who were they?
- Lock him up.
- Mighty cold for this kid in there.
"Well, maybe it'll freeze him into talking."
Okay.
Come on.
I'm gonna find out who those other kids were if it's the last thing I do.
"All right, kid."
Come on.
Get out of there.
You got enough.
Go get your chart and report to work detail.
- I'll try and get you some grub later on.
- Thank you.
Wrap this around you.
I know you don't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
"Here you are, kid."
Of course I've thought about it.
It's all I think about!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Or have you just thought about yourself?
Do you think that this is good for him?
That kid is gonna hate us if he has to grow up listening to us fight all day long.
"So that's it, then."
What about me?
- Am I just so easy to walk away from?
"- Lisa, I love you."
Don't you fucking say that to me!
"You have no idea what love is, Chris!"
Lisa.
Listen.
We have a problem and we have to face it.
"Oh, you're right, Chris."
You are absolutely right.
"Get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!"
You know what?
"If you want to go, go."
I release you.
Go be free.
"But don't you ever expect to see me or your child ever again, ever!"
"Lisa, stop it."
"Jesus, stop it."
Just go.
Please.
Go.
- You're staying at a motel?
"- No, it's a hotel."
And it's really very nice.
You wish to bury your fiancé?
Go there and find him.
I will wait while you dig.
(FLIES BUZZING)
This is the journey your father has sent you on.
No.
This is where it ends.
Your old life is over now.
"You have only a new one, with me."
Do you desire it?
"If not, I will leave you here, to lie with him."
Make your choice.
Tahir...
No.
Please just wait.
Don't.
Please...
Choose.
STONEBRIDGE:
Here.
"Pull back here, aim, pull the trigger."
Yeah?
You're not afraid I might use this on you?
"If you can find your daughter without me, go ahead."
He's doing what?
Get me satellite surveillance on a 50-mile grid around the exchange point.
Where's Scott?
SINCLAIR:
I've had to bring him back to Khartoum.
That bloody journalist woman.
He took a bullet to the spleen.
He's lost a lot of blood.
- Three.
- Okay.
"Sorry to ask this right after we ate, but did you sleep with that girl, Sunhee?"
No.
Then why'd she stare me down?
Did you two talk?
That's none of your business.
Did you have sex?
Just tell me the truth.
Tell me.
I'm just curious.
I didn't.
I told you I saw everything.
She really just came in and left.
"Plus, she's married."
And I really do not see her as a woman at all.
I'm serious.
So stop talking this nonsense.
"- Ouch, it hurts."
- Why are you lying to me?
Why are you being like this?
I interviewed her because she resembled you.
"I was missing you so much, but you weren't here."
So I just interviewed anyone.
We don't look alike.
And you know how she looks at me?
She got this contempt in her eyes.
Why would she?
She means nothing to me.
She's just nice.
"Actually, I feel sorry for her."
"Go on, and what else?"
He...
- ( jackhammer rattling )
- God damn.
How much longer?
( horns honking )
"Oh, fuck, according to Waze, an hour."
Fucking hour?
It's a quarter of a mile.
"Dude, welcome to Miami construction."
Should we call Wayne and tell him we're gonna be late?
No.
"Fuck, no."
Not a fucking chance.
"( sighs ) Well, what about Vern?"
"We should call him, right?"
Give him the good news?
"No, fuck that."
Let that motherfucker sweat it out
- like I'm fucking sweating it out.
- ( sighs )
- Fuck!
Let's go!
- ( horn honks )
"- Should we be doing this, Spence?"
- Doing what?
"This, fucking any of this, poking the bear."
"I mean, look at all the stress it's causing both of us."
- Are you stressed?
- Am I?
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
"My psoriasis, I can feel it fucking festering."
"It moves around the body, you know."
Dear Max
I'm thinking of you.
And I'm writing you some things that I can't tell you.
Can't you still?
Did you realize that it's not the same now?
We don't love each other anymore.
That's what the letter said?
Nothing else?
Did it say something about me?
Yes.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Can't you say those things about me?
You've never wanted to know them.
Well now I do.
What do they matter now?
!
To me they do!
Tell me!
Stop it!
You're hurting me!
Then tell me!
You're nuts!
That's what you think about me?
No.
That would be so easy!
"Besides, you'd take that as a compliment!"
I don't want to say what I think of you because it doesn't matter anymore!
Would you like to live in the countryside?
Always.
I'd stay here.
I couldn't get used to it.
I don't know no Paula.
What's this?
What's this thing here?
"You're ill, Mr. Biberkopf."
Your head and arm were injured.
I want outta here.
I have my work!
I have things to do!
Soon.
What's going on here?
What's wrong with me?
I have to get your particulars.
"You don't mind, do you?"
Let's see.
You were run over on May 12 on the Eberswalderstrasse.
Name:
Franz Biberkopf.
Auto accident.
"Did you step in front of the car, or what?"
"No, no."
Watch closely.
I'll demonstrate once more.
Here's the perfect rubber band for a gentleman.
"It won't snap, split or break."
Made from the very best materials.
The whole family could hang from this rubber band.
"Pull that end, young man."
Harder!
It won't bounce back like a bad check!
So you're not married.
No children either?
Sorry ― dumb question.
- I am good.
I am at home.
But I am going out after some time.
Where are you?
"What do you mean, where are you?"
I am busy arranging for your party.
What rubbish!
When did I say to throw a bash for me?
- You didn't say.
But I thought I should give you a farewell party before you leave.
I don't know when we will meet again.
"Karan, you are trying to entice me?"
"Sweetheart, I am not enticing you."
I like you.
I love you.
And you know?
It's not a crime to love.
"Karan, you know it very well that I don't have time.."
..for useless things like love.
"I am focused on my career, man."
That's why I am leaving Jaipur and going to Mumbai.
Okay.
Be focused.
Make your career.
But reach the party by 9 o'clock.
I have called all our friends.
"I am not too sure, Karan."
I will ask my mom and inform you.
Okay?
No asking.
I don't care.
You have to come.
Get back!
"Move, move, get out of the way!"
What's going on?
They're under the ground!
Look out!
They're under the ground!
"All units, all units, be advised."
Air support en route to Pine Street Park.
Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.
Bomb squad on scene.
"Oh, this does not look good."
You were actually near where...
"Yeah, no, it was just right there."
Was it over here?
- The south side.
- Okay.
It was just huge.
- You saw it yourself?
- Yes.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.
An I.E.D. maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
Holy crap...
It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past, there were multiple occasions."
He's not finished yet.
So you know this case?
Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth, but it was never found."
Politics took care of that.
Same goes for flags.
He doesn't even weave them.
"Still, he designs them."
"He's part of the process as geopolitics, seamtresses."
"No more, no less."
So artists are vessels?
He asked me to be his assistant.
- Doing it?
- I don't know.
It's a tough decision.
Afghanistan is far.
Make it to Nepal?
Kabul was the end of that trip.
We had to get back.
Why?
Is it a secret?
"I brought my drawings... to the editors of ""Parapluie. """
"They have a band called ""Fille Qui Mousse""."
They want collages for their light show.
Waste of time.
Isn't there better to do?
Like what?
Like your paintings.
"You're starting out, like me."
You have progress to make.
I don't have much time.
I prefer to draw.
You're wrong.
I preferred your paintings.
Will you show them to me?
I'd rather not.
"Die, asshole."
"Oh, Ilia, that feels good."
Then I'll make you feel even better.
"Ilia, can't we have sex today?"
You know it's against the rules.
"If we do it, I'd be fired."
Then I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.
"I don't want that, but..."
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Feel good?
Feel good?
Feel good?
I'm gonna come!
"Come, I'm coming too!"
I'm coming!
Ilia.
It's perfume.
I hope you like it.
"I've been with lots of delivery girls, but no one's been as genuine as you."
Service tells you a lot about a girl.
"If you don't mind, will you go out with me?"
I'm sorry.
Of course...
"I'm an idiot, what was I thinking?"
I'm going home to Korea.
I can't take this.
"No, please take it."
"It's my first gift to a girl, ever."
"I talked with the clerk, wondering what you'd like."
"That itself was fun, my heart was bouncing."
My heart was bouncing.
"Thanks, Mum, but it's okay."
"No, really."
I want to go to McDonald's.
"You know, I'm not really hungry."
Come on.
Are you telling me you couldn't murder a Big Mac?
Mum!
"Okay, another time."
Any time.
"I'll be around a while, you know."
By the following Christmas things were back to normal.
Before you came...
Every man is an island.
And I stand by that.
"But clearly, some men are part of island chains."
Below the surface of the ocean they're actually connected.
"So you're going to marry my mum, then?"
Don't know.
Why?
You think she's up for it?
- I used to want him to marry my mum.
- You serious?
Yeah.
But that was when she was depressed and I was desperate.
"Thanks, mate."
Cheers.
How do you use this blender-thing?
You don't.
I used to think two wasn't enough.
Christ.
Now there were loads of people.
And that was great.
"We just told you we,re not!"
Not unhappy at all?
"I mean, it,s not always easy, but -"
"So you,re not unhappy."
Sometimes.
What do I check?
"I don,t know."
"Put ,slightly unhappy, if you want."
"I don,t want anything."
"It,s up to you."
What do you want?
"She doesn,t know and neither do I!"
"Don,t check anything!"
Fine.
"Then we,re done."
"Good, we,re done."
"Let,s have a drink."
How about having a drink with us?
Lights!
Are you allowed during work hours?
"It,s not that."
"We,re way behind schedule."
Whatever you Iike.
Our door is always open.
Thanks.
Another time.
"Listen, we were wondering:"
How did you end up working here?
"- You think it,s weird?"
"- I,m not criticizing."
"It,s just... you dissect people, examine them, manipulate them."
"We don,t manipulate anyone."
Why?
I guess there were some complaints that your eyes were more interesting to watch than the lead performance.
Ohh.
"I'm really sorry, honey."
"Oh, it stinks."
"(Sighs) Oh, my God."
I can't believe we're not in the play.
"Uh, yeah, well..."
That's not exactly true.
So we are doing the play?
"No, we're not."
So we're off the play.
"No, no."
That's not it.
So we're on the play.
- We're not.
- We're not?
Right.
We're not.
What?
Your mom's in.
You're out.
Just say it.
"Thank you, Mike."
I was getting there!
What?
"But you're gonna quit, right?"
"Well, quitting is certainly something that I could do, although I am the strongest voice of all the Ozians... (Sighs) And it is for charity, but if you really want me to quit, then I--"
I want you to quit.
"Okay, well, let's not jump into any rash decisions."
"Just sleep on it, and if you still want me to quit in the morning, I will."
I want you to quit.
It opens up the room.
It can breathe.
Does it get you money?
You want it?
"Here, I'll give you the fucking money."
"If you want more, you can go down and tear some off the wall."
No.
I don't want your money.
I don't need it.
But I do need a door.
So I could close it behind me.
I thought you'd like it.
I do like it.
In some way I do like it.
It's dreary.
Of course.
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you prisoners of starvation!"
"Forjustice thunders condemnation,"
It is the eruption of the end!
Is this what you were thinking?
"- Okay, that's enough!"
You'll sing for me.
I'm not finished yet.
You're still singing for me.
- I have to ask Franz first.
You need written permission?
I'll think about it.
Don't take so long.
He found some chicks that aren't too bad either.
They're taller than you too.
Go.
Move.
Come on.
They went this way.
You sure?
"Birds fly away from danger, predators."
Dawkins is making a fast pace.
"He's snapping branches, he's kicking rocks."
"The Apapanes didn't like it, one of them sounded the alarm call, off they went."
Down here.
Come on.
"Please, can we stop and have some water real quick?"
All right.
One sip and then we go.
"Come on, come on, come on."
They stopped here.
"No, don't do that."
Molokai's rainforest's got pathogenic microbes in the water that'll put a man down in an hour.
"Judging from those tracks you found, looks like they drank from it."
They won't get much further.
"Come on, Tarzan, now we got an advantage."
Who told you to stop?
"- Please, something's wrong."
"Come on, move."
- We don't feel...
- Move.
Move.
I can't get a clear shot.
Dawkins.
Come on.
Come on.
Move.
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
I know he was planning on pulling an all-nighter so he's probably still in the sack.
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
"This only works when they're scared of you, remember?"
Jack-off.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
- Combo.
"- Yo, what's up?"
You seen Badger?
"Don't you cover for him, bitch."
"I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer."
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
Got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
That's good then.
Excellent.
I'll stay for a few more weeks for the peace and quiet.
We'll take the next boat.
"If you'd been really ill, I wouldn't have told you anything."
This is why I'm here.
He's in Holland for a week.
"Good morning, Mr Haverman."
"Morning, sir."
Here you are.
Your morning portion.
The doctor says you'd better stay in bed.
"Yes, I understand, nurse."
Thank you.
"Later, after the visitor will have left."
Don't be too long.
You have to be fit for the cure.
Busybody.
That's what I'm ripping those assholes of the insurance company off for.
450 guilders a day.
-462.50.
What?
-I work in insurance.
"Oh, yes."
I know where he is.
And what he's doing this week.
It's Niels for sure.
I have to tell you something.
It's such an old case.
"Back then, you swore we'd liquidate him."
I'm not well.
It's been so long.
"If you feel hungry, you can take it out and eat."
That's a good idea!
Master.
Come on.
Good!
"Thank you, master."
"Come on, don't mention it."
"Shit, I've stuffed my ring too."
"Foon, can you get my ring back for me?"
"Sure, master."
"This is chicken leg, my ring is still inside."
Not this one?
"Oh, it's full!"
"Master, would you mind looking for it yourself?"
Alright.
He's taking my bag!
"As it's stipulated by court, although it's not his wish to be baptized, we still welcome him to join God's family."
Let him go.
Why a woman's baptismal time is so short...
But a man's baptismal time is so long?
Why did you fight?
Your nose bleeds!
I didn't beat him.
None of his business!
Look!
I hate blonde!
I think it's acceptable!
Damn you!
Put all the dominos back.
As well as my mahjong too.
"And the chair and table, all set!"
What?
All right.
If it's the truth.
It's all right.
She said... she had a dream she was pregnant.
I know this.
"Have you, um, have you seen the original?"
No.
It's in the National Galley.
"It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
"But, ah, I'm drawn to these images."
Why?
"Looking for reassurance, I suppose."
Have you found it?
No.
But I keep going back to look.
Just in case.
"So, um, what am I supposed to do about this Paul Fordyce?"
I'll let the police know and you should talk to them.
I can get them to pick you up from here if you like?
"Oh, no."
I'll be OK.
Silly boy.
I had a chat with the pathologist.
They're doing quite well.
What do you mean?
They're connecting you with three murders.
Don't get all hu_.
"It's the truth, isn't it?"
"We, or rather you, left a messier trail than I hoped we would."
- No.
"Well, how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female.
Ellia?
Get out of the way.
"No, please."
Don't shoot.
She's not what you think.
"She is my daughter,"
she means you no harm.
She's a wraith.
"Maybe so, but she's different."
I swear to you.
Let me guess-- wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
"Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you."
It's all right.
Father...
"No, I won't let them hurt you."
I raised her as my own.
"You live here, together?"
This was part of a mine before the last culling.
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
"Gee, I wonder why."
The villagers told us there was a wraith in the forest.
It came here in a crashed ship 10 years ago.
10 years ago?
"No, I'm not coming, I'm going to the fields."
"Come on, get in..."
No. I'm going to the farm.
"- Come on, I'll bring you back."
- No.
Why haven't you got out?
"Go on, get out."
Take the wheel.
Give my colleagues the keys.
Don't forget.
"Will he make it, doctor?"
"Yes, he just needed oxygen."
A jab and a respirator will put him right.
We've sent him to town.
Oxygen will save him.
- Where are you going?
- Down there.
There's a sick woman.
Perhaps you could see her.
All right.
- Do you mind?
"- No, no problem."
It's a miracle he survived.
He was lucky.
The stone got stuck before it struck his head.
Then some stones gave way.
"He was trapped, as if he was in a tiny cell."
He needed oxygen.
"If he gets oxygen, he'll pull through all right."
He was covered in dirt.
"""lf my guardian angel is hhe one I know,"
"""he'll prohech glass from shone."""
That's lovely.
Yes.
Alicia's loving it.
"Lovely, because from death emerges life."
From the male emerges the female.
Of course.
From the earth emerges...
The...
The... tree?
No.
From the earth emerges...
The... flowers?
No.
The ethereal.
"The ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly."
Of course.
And I've got the music.
By Penderesky.
"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths,"
I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now.
You're going to flip out.
"Alicia, my dear, farewell."
Oh... dear...
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."
Though you look gorgeous.
"""Trenches"" must be made."
He was here just now!
You'll be dead if I catch you
This is such a small place
Where can he hide?
I'm here!
"You bastard, you bastard!"
I'm so mad!
"Gao, how come you're so slow?"
I'm coming!
Coming!
You will have it for sure
"Y es, I'll be right there!"
"Gentlemen, take your time!"
Coming!
That way please!
"Gentlemen, have some tea"
What would you like?
"Whatever is good here, we'll take it!"
"Y es, yes, will be right here!"
Hurry up!
Just get whatever dishes here
"Anyway, we can eat as much as we want"
When we get to the home of Thunderstorm!
What're you rushing at?
Brother Y an is really smart
He can turn the home of Thunderstorm ...to be his own camp
What about Shi Zhengzong?
That coward
Of course he won't dare to fight back!
"Come, a toast!"
What happened?
You messed up again!
"Oh, fun."
Unless you don't want me to go.
Are you asking my permission?
"No,"
- you-you just seem like you...
"- No, no."
Go.
Have fun.
Enjoy yourself.
Okay.
Good.
- Good.
- Good.
"Look, take a break from work later, come visit me."
You gotta eat.
Maybe I will.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Dad, Scott brought these sandwiches over as a little peace offering."
"You know, for screwing up your deal."
Wasn't that nice?
"Well, let's see..."
Sandwiches... millions of dollars.
"Sandwiches, millions of dollars..."
He also brought pickles.
"Our biggest client just fired us because that deal fell through, thanks to this idiot."
"Hey, you know, there's no need for name calling."
"This is my place of business, pal."
I can call you Roberta if I want to.
- What the hell is that?
- My cell phone.
Listen to that.
Even his phone ring pisses me off.
- See you next trip.
"- All supplies aboard, sir."
- Thank you.
Parade the recruits.
- Parade recruits!
- On deck.
"Look lively, will you?"
"Come on, come on."
Fall in at the end of the lines.
- Where are you going?
- I must see the captain.
Get in that line.
Recruits ready for inspection.
"One wants to be put ashore, sir."
- I brought him myself.
He's a fraud.
- I'm as good as...
My antecedents are as honourable as your own.
- What's your name?
- Percival Palliser Wagstaffe.
- Are you related to Admiral Wagstaffe?
- He's a distant cousin.
He would speak for you?
How well do you know him?
- Intimately.
Often.
- You visit him?
"You claim that, do you?"
Do you also claim to be a madman?
- To visit someone who doesn't exist...
- Not exist?
My cousin?
I order you!
I order you!
You broke it!
You broke my sword!
"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane."
You dare to defy me!
You've got a lot to learn about everything.
I'll fix you!
You cheated!
You haven't played the game right.
I'll show you!
[ Woman's Voice ] Trelane!
No!
No!
You said I could have this planet.
[ Man's Voice ] This has gone far enough.
But you always stop me when I'm having fun.
You're disobedient and cruel.
We've told you before.
"Time to come in now, Trelane."
"I don't want to come in, and I won't."
"I'm a general, and I won't listen to you."
"Enough, Trelane."
Come along.
But why?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just playing.
We said come along.
But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.
This is not studying them.
"If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them."
"Aw, but I was winning."
Nita Caglar?
This is the name she spoke.
A Kurdish girl.
Okay.
She works a little for me.
"Without a permit visa, but that shit, I'm helping people."
How old is she?
15.
"A friend of his daughter, perhaps?"
Zana lives in Sweden with his mother.
What does this have to do with it?
When was the last time you saw her?
Six months ago.
Where is she?
She ran away from home.
Reported her as missing.
Why did she do it?
How should I know?
She contacted?
-I Would say is yes.
"If I do not get hysterical, does not mean I do not care."
Perhaps you do not have children.
Then I'll tell you something.
They are like a part of you.
But you can not make them be better.
"So if there is something more, take me to the police station."
One more thing.
I never liked cops.
No one died?
That's great!
Have you managed to track down the girl?
Let's wait for the experts.
"Lately, he's taken in two disciples and taught them kung-fu"
"They're not bad, I hear!"
Okay-find a way to get him here!
"We'll try him, and kill him if necessary"
This jade nine-dragon cup is our heirloom
Emperor Chien Lung liked it very much
Very nice
How nice for a common fellow to use it!
Come on-bottoms up!
"Please have some tea, sir"
A toast to you!
"Fine, fine..."
We'll drink until we're drunk!
Right-have some more!
Some more!
"No, no-that's dangerous!"
It's best not to drink too much
"Come on, have a drink!"
Have a drink!
"No, no..."
You've had a lot-l'll help you inside
Who says I'm drunk?
I'm no drunk!
What's this?
Playing for keeps?
Right-l wasn't your life for keeps
"Oh, no."
Master's falling-down drunk!
Don't stay here
We've got to find a way to save him!
Can we do it?
Yes-with this!
"How'd you like to help me do some good, serve up a little karmic justice?"
–Joe...
"–Hey, 20 bucks says we bust him on a felony before nightfall."
These assholes could win a lottery and still not keep their noses clean.
See that little prick?
"He got one over on me, man."
–You know that ain't right.
"–Yes, I know it's not right."
–Then here we go.
–Lookee here!
–Jesus Christ.
–Bitch that made me rich!
"You thought it'd be fun to beat on me like a punk nigga now, huh?"
–Who's the nigga now?
–Hey!
Step back!
Yeah.
Here.
Go get yourself some new gear on me.
"Go back to your party, burn out whatever brain cells you got left."
"Come on, bitch."
Hit me!
I could use another couple million.
–Put the camera down.
–Come on.
Show's just startin'.
"Hey, let go of him!"
Let go!
–Back off!
–That's all right.
I'll just buy me a new one.
"Hey, what's this?"
There's no time.
"Gemma, run, please, go!"
Fuck.
She could... s-she could've cut us free.
"Tools, weapons."
We-we could have fought.
We could have run away.
"You can't run anywhere, babe."
"You did well, Luke."
You showed guts.
"Oh, you keep it."
You're in the family now.
I trust you with it.
- What if someone finds out?
"- Trust me, Luke."
We're some distance above the law.
Once this is all over... we can just disappear.
Lie low while my father's people deal with these loose ends.
Your father knows about this?
This whole business has shamed him more than anyone else.
My duty was clear.
Restore family honour by any means necessary.
- What?
- I knew he had my back.
He doesn't want to lose another son.
"Did you send the postcard, El?"
No.
- Did you?
- No.
Glad we got that cleared up.
This is the last leg.
You're almost there.
"- Take him forward, put him under guard."
- Jones.
Another flogging.
Pass the word:
We do a full tryout tomorrow at eight bells.
First Lieutenant said keep a sharp lookout to starboard.
"You men on gun three, jump to it!"
Station two marines in the after well deck at six bells.
- Steer east-nor'east.
"- Aye, aye."
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
"- Yes, sir."
- Have you noticed anything?
"- Noticed what, sir?"
A number of small things.
Like a man shouting without a sound.
"- I don't know what you mean, sir."
- All right.
He saw you do it.
- Why did you?
- That's the signal.
Three cheers.
"- Next time, be careful."
- When are we gonna do it?
- The real thing?
- You'll be told.
We did what we said.
We join the fleet in Corsica with something to show.
A fully-pledged ship.
Ready for action.
Not a single bloody ship.
Nothing in the harbor.
You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
- You were saving that money to go to Europe.
- It's going to better use there.
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-We help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"- Paige, you started lying to us."
- I didn't lie.
"- Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
- Do you?
- Lie...
Lying...
- Stop!
What are you doing?
You go behind our backs.
Why?
Does this book tell you to do that?
- Philip.
- Does it?
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
Emergency signal from Fred.
What happened last night...
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
I talked with Eva.
- You saw her?
She asked me to tell you that you were not responsible.
She would have broken down anyway.
She hated being a prostitute.
even a medical one.
You were just a catalyzer.
It's not your fault.
You're lying.
- Excuse me?
She would never have said that.
It's not true.
Globale told you to calm me down.
You're totally paranoiac.
I must find her.
Where is she?
Why do you need to know?
You know what will happen if you go outside.
Yes.
I won't be a B8 anymore.
I won't be handicapped and Globale will lose its contract.
They pay you.
So you have no interest in my going outside.
Look.
We all want you to get better.
to go outside.
But gradually.
I want to find her!
Remember two days ago?
You almost died.
Was it fun?
You want to try it again?
Everything's near a beach.
"- Okay, then Tallahassee it is."
- Tallahassee it is.
Are you sure?
Is this... what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
Keeps the time.
(Crow caws)
You have somewhere to be?
"We can mark watches, take turns sleeping."
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
I'll take first shift.
I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I've been through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
Charming... my husband... he used to wake me.
"When I cried out, he'd light a candle."
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um... why don't you try... to sleep?
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"-Tomorrow, Iet's all go there and see."
-Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a Iong time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide."""
"""We are two eIopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
Something's weird.
An old lady from somewhere came to visit Grandma.
So what?
Why are you laughing?
I'm sorry.
"This sounds silly, but I was just thinking..."
How could I marry someone that I've never even...
You know...
Oh.
Kissed.
There's one thing I have to say.
I promised your sister I wouldn't.
"You love Claire, too?"
You just slept with her?
- You want to?
- I don't even know her.
It's about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...
I think that's kind of great.
- I thought you'd be upset.
- Why?
You picked me.
"Actually, I found you through this charming woman on TV..."
"Well, well, well..."
Ha...
So?
Gregory just proposed to me.
Do you need a Valium?
"I know you don't respect my opinion, but I don't trust him."
"I mean, where's the attraction?"
He's not attracted to me.
He doesn't want sex.
He wants to be companions.
What sane person would agree to that kind of marriage?
It's not natural.
Let's go!
Follow me to a place.
Where?
Don't ask!
Just follow me.
- No way!
"- In case the baby is born, didn't you think about how miserable its life will be?"
You can not keep this baby!
- But what will happened to you?
- I'd rather be prisoned.
Absolutely not!
- I can not ruin your life!
- Shu Yawang!
"I will be prisoned, for 7 or 8 years at most."
"If you keep the baby, you will ruin the life of three person!"
"You, me, and this baby!"
I knew you would come.
"Qu Weiran, if just I'm not a soldier,"
I would have killed you.
Good then.
"When you kill me, Shu Yawang's unborn baby will be the bastard."
You bastard!
Good.
Kill me.
Go kill me.
Go away.
"Qu Weiran, live longer."
Make sure you do.
"Once you start a happy life,"
I will come to make sure you never can do it.
It is raining.
What date is it?
You...
[Giggling]
"- Oh, my poor boy!"
"- Why do you say that, Doctor?"
"Well, it just occurred to me:"
You must be under tremendous emotional strain:
Strain?
No:
Why?
"Because when that simulacrum of Wilma was destroyed, well, you lost the Goral of your dreams, didn't you?"
The Goral of your dreams!
You lost her!
[All Groaning And Laughing]
All Things Pass
Darling.
Darling.
Dorien.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
"Even if it's the last thing I'll do, Niels is a dead man."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
I won't turn in my weapon.
Never.
Will you take the garbage bags out?
"-Yes, darling."
"It's not easy is it, old man?"
But I did keep up with you!
Worthless scrolls.
Where's the treasure?
I think you're looking at it.
That's right.
Solon himself said the Treasure of Atlantis has the power to command men's minds.
"Of course, books."
No.
It can't be true.
The Treasure of Atlantis... is knowledge.
There has to be more.
No!
You're destroying the scrolls!
Get away you stupid old fool.
I want treasure.
We gotta go.
But all this knowledge.
We can't let it be destroyed.
"Kelly, come on!"
"Come on, Kelly!"
Forget that.
"Well, that's our only way out."
Maybe we can tap into a little geothermal power of our own.
Geothermal power?
Professor.
Yes?
Stuff your jacket into one of those pipes.
Put a rock on top of it.
"Kelly, stand by the Torch."
"Well, whatever you've got in mind, MacGyver, hurry."
"Stand back, professor."
"All right, Kelly, hit it."
"Shut it off, Kelly."
"She did the same, too."
She said she loved me but betrayed me since I got sick.
Rotten bitches.
Dirty bitches.
All sluts like you should be wiped out for this country and society.
I'm doing a good deed for making a just society.
I'm a servant of pure justice.
I'm Wonder Woman.
15 minutes left!
Hurry up!
Why are you so slow?
Then carry her instead!
We have no time!
What'll you do if something happens to her?
Hey!
Wake up!
Please wake up!
Are you alright?
Where's Mr. Hong?
You shouldn't be here.
Hurry and run!
I was misunderstood because of you.
"Wait, why are you giving it to her?"
If she eats his liver...
We've waited for a thousand years!
How could you do that?
"Dad, one of us has to sacrifice because of him!"
Right.
I've lived long enough.
Take care of the youngest.
We have no time.
Hurry and start.
They earn their living over three months.
"In winter, they sit around drinking tea."
There's not a lot to do in winter.
"Apparently, they're not that idle!"
"No, they do nothing."
They sit around the stove for warmth.
They spend evenings together.
Certain produce is sown in winter...
And harvested in summer.
I don't know.
Your harvest will soon be ripe.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
How many children do you have?
Nine.
"Well done, nine children!"
Yes.
How many girls and how many boys?
Five girls and four boys.
"See, you're not idle!"
May God preserve them.
Thank you.
You don't want to get up?
We have to get up?
You don't want to?
is there any news?
"News, but not what you think."
But there is something.
She didn't eat the soup sent by Mrs Hatcher and Mrs Terayn.
Meaning what?
Meaning...
Hold the line.
That's... pretty damn well.
"So, when you say you want a partner..."
"Yeah, that's not exactly true."
I don't want a partner.
Ah.
I want you as my partner.
I've heard good things.
I want to find out if they're true.
"If they're good, they're definitely true."
What scares you most?
Don't think.
Just answer.
Bees.
You know what scares me?
Mediocrity.
"Safe choices, hedged bets, a willingness to settle for the easy and familiar."
"I would really like to take back ""bees."""
Geez.
Married?
I didn't even know you were dating.
'Cause it's none of your business.
You don't tell me when you're screwing your stalker.
"Hey, careful."
They're starting to get too small.
"Oh, right."
Mr. big balls.
"I'm just saying, they're gonna dry out when you fry them."
I'm baking them.
"Oh, you're killing me."
"So, uh, how'd you get the kids not to tell me?"
Really?
The never mentioned Ollie?
Such good intentions...
Hey!
Don't you care what happens to your friend?
!
Don't underestimate me!
It's resonating with him.
You had it.
Professor Mayzel.
and seal off this block!
Bastard!
I think there is a meaning in the fact that the ark is in this area.
that no other mountain around was suitable for?
If the legend of the first flood was caused by the ark then the true power of the ark may be the ability to control the magnetic field.
This is it.
it is unknown territory.
We don't know what will happen.
Fine by me.
let's go.
Die!
Die!
no!
Damn!
Jean!
Jean?
Ominae what did you do with that brat?
I heard he's headed for the ark.
Dr. Mayzel and his assistant are hostages.
That should be taken care of first.
Jean.
quickly..!
Ominae!
Save those two by all means.
"If Vlad wants his crazy Mexican, he should go after him."
It's pissing me off.
The last girl is off with a client.
"Down, down, down!"
He's gonna get a blow-job here.
"Fuck, he must be desperate to get a woman here."
What do you care?
You don't come here on holiday.
You're right.
I forgot that you were an expert.
You're out of line.
"Fuck, you're becoming a pain, Gilou."
- We can't say anything any more.
- Don't worry.
You'll soon be rid of me.
And Laure?
Tell me it doesn't hurt to leave her.
"Me, I would understand, but Laure?"
"Go ahead, say it."
Say it!
They're moving.
Gilou to Laure.
"The guy is going away with the girl, what do we do?"
We follow?
"No, we wait."
They're done.
Let's go.
Why don't they come back?
Are you sure the pimps didn't pick them up?
They must have picked them up somewhere else.
"We'll come back tonight, we've got to stay on their back."
"Everybody, get some sleep."
- l don't know anything.
- Not even the shake?
That's the first time I've heard of it.
- Would you like to dance?
- Are those sandwiches good?
Excellent.
"But if you want to dance, go ahead."
"Come on, what are you afraid of?"
I don't know what to do with my feet.
"No one else knows any better, don't be silly!"
But they know I can't dance.
You're not a little boy.
We're already in the ninth form.
"We are, but I don't know how to."
What does that matter.
Do you think anyone knows?
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.
"No one knows, they just jump around."
"Come on, what harm can it do?"
"If I don't know how to dance, I won't."
Excuse me. I'll tidy myself up a bit.
My wife...
- What is it?
- Come in!
Come in!
This is my wife.
"If you don't mind, I'll change."
"I'll take this T-shirt off, it reminds me..."
"This way, please."
They've come about...
- l don't know what.
- Your son.
Some other time.
- You're here this afternoon?
- Yes.
Then come and see us.
I'm always here.
I'm often here at night too.
I'm an old hand here.
If you need anything...
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
- So long.
Mr.Roncero...
Good morning.
- Shall I get Dr.Vega?
"- No, carry on with your work."
"The other day, going through my papers,"
I found some notes I took the day you came to see me.
I'd written down a topic to discuss on your second visit.
A visit that never took place.
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
I go on long-term disability.
At 75% pay.
"And then do what, shay?"
I fish off Navy pier for the next 20 years?
It's dumping gas!
- Get a hose on there!
- Go!
You're going in there?
You need to get back behind the lines.
"Mouch, get this kid safe."
I'm not gonna pretend like I don't remember peeling you off the floor after that woman broke your heart.
I know.
I just always thought she was the one.
Come on!
Get down!
[Children cheering]
When can we go back inside?
"We have to check with the gas company, ma'am."
And they'll tell you when it's safe.
"Ms. Simpson, I was looking for Leonard to get the keys to the shed."
No one's seen him.
"Oh, God."
"Everyone, stop."
We're going back in.
[Dramatic music]
?
Leonard!
Down here?
Call out!
You guys smell anything?
Are we sure they cut off the gas lines?
"Oh, I shut it down myself."
Good.
Perhaps there's still time for you to see things
With a clear mind.
"I've wanted to be with you as well,"
But there is trouble at home.
Scotland is in peril.
"The english, I know."
It's worse.
Our country is on the knife's edge
Of falling into protestantism.
And we are catholic rulers.
"You need France, a catholic country, at your side now."
"Marry its next king,"
And the protestants will scurry into the darkness.
Marry francis.
Not some bastard who someday might be king.
His name is sebastian.
Has the same ring to it.
"Well, I have no choice"
"But to support you,"
As I rule scotland but you are
Actually its queen.
And my daughter.
So headstrong.
So loving.
So you'll be patient?
Yes.
Mary.
Are you all right?
Is all well with your mother?
Yes.
"She's just as I remember her,"
She can be.
We will see.
"You are more attracted by the comical gendre,... than by the dramatic."
By the master of erotica.
Back in your dress.
"You have a great future ""behind'."
-What actress?
-More.
All of you!
Leave a photo with my secretary.
"-Thank you, maestro."
-Thanks.
We will keep a picture of yourself.
"-Thanks, maestro!"
-Thanks.
Thank you miss.
I told him that was exceptional.
Thanking you too.
"Here it is, I recommend it."
"- Archive ""A""?"
-How did you guess?
What are you doing tonight?
As I said.
I am going to the movies with my boyfriend.
You expect to get it outside of yourself?
I see what you're getting at!
But why?
"Because it won't let you go, before first telling you something about yourself."
Anything?
What?
Something or the other.
An adventure for example.
I could show you around the country.
We'd always be together.
"If I could live here, I wouldn't have to rent the place in town."
You didn't sell yourself well as a prospective roommate.
- What do you mean?
- You should know!
Gerd is still looking for new ski instructors.
- I don't want to.
- Why not?
- I have enough to do.
- You could earn a lot more.
I earn just as much with the translations.
"""Forest Ranger's Love""..."
"""Hour of Desire."""
You'd be a great ski instructor.
But I don't want to.
Ridiculous!
- What?
- Your attitude.
You never try anything new.
- What'll I tell Gerd?
- What about?
- Your refusal.
Where did you get that idea anyway?
- I told him.
- What?
For your sake.
You'd earn twice as much.
"Thanks, but I'm grown up."
"Oh, yeah?"
Don't you ever want to achieve anything?
You can talk!
"Good, plenty of rocks around."
"Good morning, daddy!"
So the young 'uns are up already.
"A beautiful good morning, miller."
Good morning...
wait...my cap... wait!
"'Morning, master."
How do we go about it?
Only a couple of sacks...
"You'll manage those on your own, Furface."
Johann can clean the dung out of the goat-shed.
- Dung?
Me?
- Dung.
Such swarms of them!
"Our boys'll fight like lions, your Highness."
- They had tough training.
- Our boys'll be killed.
We're far outnumbered!
They'll beat us just with their turbans!
Where're you from?
"From far away, Bohemia."
Bavorov.
Really?
My wife comes from Netolice.
"That's quite close, across the wood."
D'you think we can make them run?
How dare you doubt our victory!
It looks like my tough training did no good.
I'll show you!
Lock him up!
You won't forget me in a hurry.
- Go ahead.
- Short and sweet.
"I want half the money, or i'll have you arrested, and might even do it on the air, live."
- Imagine the ratings.
"- I'd like to see you try, asshole."
- You're gonna see me.
"- I'll kill you, I swear to God!"
- I'm gonna kill you!
- You treacherous little bitch!
You got one week to get your shit together.
- You listening?
I want the money.
- [Door Slams]
Okay.
Okay.
"Okay, let's do a little math."
"You want 20 percent, Dale wants half a million, and Dick wants half of everything."
"I don't have a calculator, but it seems I'm in debt again!"
Dale's money comes out of your share.
He's your friend.
- Not my friend.
He's his friend.
- I hardly know the man.
Who cares?
It's all fucking moot now.
The only thing that's moot to me is the Dick Simmons issue.
"You get a toothache, you pull the tooth."
What does that mean?
- Let's kill the son of a bitch.
"- Oh, God!"
- [Crystal] Yes!
- No!
I won it last night at his casino.
You owed him this much money?
- Double it.
- Harry!
- Don't start with me.
- You need to get a grip on this.
How does a man who spends all his time fighting the bad guys get into so much trouble with his own side?
Hmm?
"- Thank you, Rich."
- Pleasure.
Here.
"Look, um..."
There's something else.
What?
Will you have a look at this?
"(LAUGHS) I didn't take you as the bangle type, Harry, but then jewelry creeps up on the best of us."
- Where did you get this?
- It's hard to explain.
A woman?
- You dark horse!
Take it off.
- I can't.
"- Well, let me try."
- I've tried.
It won't come off.
"Well, how did you get it on in the first place?"
- I haven't a baldy.
"- Wow, that must have been some night."
Right...
- I have no idea what this is.
- Really?
Or where it comes from or how old it is.
It doesn't come up that often.
Maybe it's the neighborhood.
T om.
-Larry.
-Wow.
"Well, it's not the battery."
"In the morning, I'll check the fuel line for you, the alternator, the pump."
"You know, it could be your plugs are worn down."
I'll replace them for you in the morning.
"In the meantime, uh... could I give you a ride home?"
"Um, no, I can walk."
"So, what do you think?"
Can you help him?
I'd much rather do something for you.
"Well, what could you do for me?"
"Well, it seems like you've forgotten just about everything."
"Well, I remember the basics..."
but it's...
I'm not concerned about myself.
It's Frank I'm worried about.
"You know, it's just not that important to me anymore."
Poor man.
Look at that woman.
"Oh, my God."
Her top is so low.
And her skirt is so high.
That is bad.
It is.
"It's very, very bad."
"Are you, uh... what I think you are?"
"Well, I'm not the public health nurse."
Would you...
And since when ?
"Well, here's the kicker."
She disappeared 5 years ago.
5 years ?
Jesus-Christ !
"My brother went missing, too."
When he was 5 years old and... we've never seen him again.
It's hard on those that left behind.
you know.
"You've been missing for a really long time, Gemma."
Where have you been ?
Were you with someone ?
Did someone take you?
Were you hold against your will ?
You can tell me.
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
Were you held?
Can you tell me where you've been?
Not just me.
I'm not the only one.
There are more.
More?
I mean how many?
What are we supposed to do about that?
Tread carefully.
The last thing we want to do is to freak her out.
We'll do just one piece of information at a time.
"No, this is massive."
You know maybe Pru was right.
Maybe we need to get the cops in on this.
"- Tell Danny, at least."
"Well, you sirs show no patriotism."
Fine english fabrics!
"Fine english fabrics, Mr Biberkopf!"
I'd rather hope so!
I could never fool myself.
Stop tickling me!
I'll have someone pick my rags up later.
Mieze!
Look!
Be astonished!
- You look very fine!
- Look at me!
Clothes make the man!
- Now it's your turn!
- No no no!
Oh come on!
"Business is going well so we can afford decent clothes, can't we?"
- You'll get your money!
Goodbye.
- I hope so.
Goodbye Mr Biberkopf.
2 bottles of sparkling wine!
Where is the party?
- Knew it!
"- Just some ""celebrities""."
"No, I already told you I won't come along."
I'm not dressed accordingly.
It's your choice.
"Guys like us, looking fine."
I'm not gonna let Franz walk all over me.
"Just watch out for him, he might cause trouble for us with his money-spending habit"
He's an amateur!
- A sadist?
Yeah.
I will take that.
Ohh.
"Sorry I got annoyed, but [clears throat] you were interrogating me."
I just want to know what's going on in your life.
"Yeah, and then get mad about the parts you don't like."
Some guy I've never fucking heard of is taking you to the Getty.
You're wearing expensive lingerie.
"All I have is expensive lingerie, Jay."
Who else are you sleeping with?
"I mean, should I be wearing a condom?"
- Excuse me?
- Are you fucking this guy?
Don't talk to me like I'm at your gym.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
That was crass.
Are you fucking this gentleman?
- Ugh.
"- ""Ugh."""
You're a pain in my ass.
- Oh?
- Uh-huh.
His name is Paul.
We lived together for five years.
The house is his.
"And, no, I'm not fucking him."
He's just paying for you?
No.
Just the house.
And he's taking you to gala events.
"Here look, Fuk (winter melon)."
Fuck!
What kind of person are you?
Are you talking to me?
I'm talking about that guy.
What kind of person?
Are you talking to me?
I'm talking about that guy.
A person whose personality like that shouldn't live long.
Oh you also mean that guy?
I meant you!
"""Speak English like a native"""
Oh gosh!
Hey what is with you?
Don't get any closer.
I will poke and blind you.
It's not worth it.
You like it rough?
I'm going to take that interview so I can go get Kaya back.
You have to teach me.
Ask your daddy to teach you then.
Aren't you mixed?
Hey!
My dad is French.
He fled back to his country before I could walk.
You can study with some other teacher.
"No, I can't."
You taught Kaya so you have to teach me.
"You saw your cut-out standee, right?"
So will you teach me?
Sure
One on one?
"I mean, it was his flute that..."
You've the filthiest mouth!
"Ah, lay off, Kay, will you?"
I'm being harassed!
You just move!
"Look, do you want to keep it?"
What do you mean?
Do you want to...
He wants to know do you want an abortion?
I do not!
There's no way I'm having an abortion!
"Good, you're right!"
You definitely won't tell us who it is?
No!
Sorry.
"Well, there's no more to be said, is there?"
She's obviously made her mind up.
A man needs a pint after all that.
Hang on a second.
"Yes, love?"
Is that all?
What do you mean?
It's a terrible... the neighbors!
Do you care what the neighbors think?
"Yes, I do."
"Sure, the O'Neill young ones are after having kids."
The pair of them.
And the Bells would be the same... except they don't have any daughters... but you know what I mean.
Tara O'Neill had her baby for Paddy Bell.
Of course she did.
So fuck the neighbors.
"You coming for a drink, Sharon?"
Undoubtedly edward mace.
We have to leave before he gets here.
"There's precious little time,"
He could be outside already.
Why are you helping us
Against your own people?
I have my reasons.
I don't want your help.
(da veiga:)I know you find this
"Hard to believe, andreas,"
But I am trying to save your life.
Maybe we could continue this elsewhere.
[âª] [machine gun fire]
You set us up.
[machine gun fire]
Give me the dagger and the scabbard.
No!
(da veiga:)mace will have orders to take the contents
Of the case.
He will not leave without them.
I'm sure I can convince him
That you escaped.
What good are they to us
If we're dead?
"(andreas:)no, don't believe him."
He's lying.
He always lies.
Andreas!
No!
Third man's got the case.
[gun shots]
It's da veiga's son.
"OK, Number Two."
Right.
Go!
"OK, Number Three."
"Stand by, Number Three."
Ready.
Go!
Look at mine.
"Oh, the silly, clumsy clot."
"OK, Number Five."
They're not a bad bunch.
I've seen worse.
Gardner!
From now on I'm in business strictly with you.
"Nothing like an old, established firm."
Heavy.
Hm.
How about a drink tonight?
I might be able to manage...
Have a nice trip?
You didn't have to push me.
"No offence, just trying to help."
I don't need that kind of help.
What makes you such a ruddy hero?
It just ain't natural.
If he puts his hands on me again I'll brain him.
How about that drink?
"Thank you, but this firm doesn't mix business with pleasure."
"Gentlemen, we don't know one another very well yet."
This morning you start your training and we can start to find out.
Now for myself.
"Information, I'm a professional soldier."
Enough!
That's enough!
"If he doesn't remember you Joy, It only means... that his lost of memory is centered on the times you were together."
Is that why he can't remember me?
.
How long will this amnesia last?
.
Will he get his memory back?
.
"We can never tell right now, there are instances when the memories come back after a few weeks or months."
"But in some cases, the memory doesn't come back anymore."
But how is that?
I'm his wife.
Treat him like your patient.
I'll be out later.
"Come on, let's go there."
How are you feeling Migs?
.
How are you feeling Migs?
.
Who exactly are you?
.
I'm Joy.
I'm your wife.
I don't remember anything.
There are so many things I can't remember.
Son?
.
"Mom, what's happening?"
.
"Joy, can I talk to Migs for a while?"
.
No.
But we had aorai agreement.
"I me,he promised to pay me back."
With interest.
"I mean,I maxed out all of my cards, so you better findhat money."
What was he like the last time you saw him?
He was sweet.
We made love right before he left.
Use a condom?
I'm on the pill.
We were engaged.
"Abs,can dna still be recovered from lance corporal finn's skivvies?"
It would take the cooperation of weather and protection.
"He was wrapped in plastic and it's been cold,so... there's a decent chance."
"Well,run the tests."
We'll do a cheek swab on his fianc?
s.
"Wait,did you say ""fianc?"
s?
""" Like plural?"
Kinky.
- Is that it?
"- For now,iri."
I need to follow you home and pickp his belongings.
I want them back when james returns.
He's dead.
He can't return.
"Look,I know he's not dead."
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.
no.
Agent lee.
I'm gonna go see if I can get some answers out of her.
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!
Talking to locals is the best way to get information!
"You guys should be doing it, too."
That's a great idea.
We split up.
"That way, we find her twice as fast."
"Shane, with me."
"We shouldn't split up, we should stay together."
"Listen, Dave, time is of the essence, okay, and if we don't find her, here's what else."
"We meet back at the exit in, like, an hour, okay?"
Come on.
Let's go.
"Jason, there's a ton of people here."
"If we split up, we're gonna..."
Stay with Joey.
This place rocks.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm trying to have a good time.
I'm trying to have a party going on.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We gotta find Trudy.
I don't want to get into this.
"Come on, buddy."
"What, are you dying to be part of the new singles scene?"
Look at all these people.
"They're running around, they're..."
"Come on, Nami."
What's wrong?
No!
OK. I understand.
What happens is nothing to do with me!
Nothing whatsoever.
Who could do this?
Is she a porn model?
That can't be allowed.
I'm wondering what I should do as her supervisor.
There's no need for you to take responsibility in this case.
She's just a slut.
Yes.
It can't be tolerated.
Trust is very important in this industry.
Lay her off.
Of course.
"She looked nice, though."
Come with me.
No.
You're working at the department store?
Have you been following me?
What's wrong?
Has something happened to you?
Stop talking as if you're a friend.
Take this umbrella.
You should go home now.
I just wanted to apologize for having followed you like this.
I didn't intend to do anything like that.
Leave me alone.
I've had just about enough of it.
Please be quiet.
Rashad!
What'd they say?
She's there.
We're getting her exact location now.
Good.
Have my men dump him into the ocean.
"Uh, okay, whoa."
Whoa.
You can't just dump him.
I'm involved now.
"His body washes up on South Beach, there's gonna be an investigation, an autopsy."
It won't take long before those drugs are traced back to me.
What do I care?
It's not my problem.
Let me at least just take the body back to the hospital.
We'll dump it in the incinerator.
Nobody will know.
"But we got to move fast, 'cause security comes on at 4:00."
You got the information you needed.
Let us take care of this.
"Mr. Hamady, you saved my life."
It's the least I could do.
Fine.
Take him.
I'm done here.
Jesse!
How long has it been?
Four minutes.
Four minutes?
We're cutting it pretty close.
Come on.
Let's get out of here before Jabbar sees us.
-It's warming.
-I'm just going to the bathroom.
"We are the first from our galaxy, to enjoy this feeling."
An uplifting feeling.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Nature will do you good.
I will arrive after you...
Don't lose your temper.
You know it's bad.
"You'll take a rest, everything will be like before."
"My little bunny will go to a nice forest,"
"snuggle down, yes, snuggle down..."
"Tell me, why don't you follow the program?"
"Who's the lady, Doctor?"
What have you done now?
"Yirinka, please!"
These are only friends.
Yirinka!
Never get married doctor.
It's terrible!
Yirinka...
Enough!
"Guys, I surrender!"
I'm a goner.
Look at me.
I don't sleep.
I wanted to sleep with the lady!
"That is, get married!"
"And getting married, doctor, does it relate somehow to reproduction?"
Go away.
Go away!
Just fucking hit me!
"- Get out of here, you pussy!"
"- Yes, ma'am."
Here.
"Yes, ""yes, ma'am."""
"Now, get out of here... pussy."
Here you go.
"You want to sing something, Adam?"
- [Sobs] No.
- No.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
- It's okay.
"- Adam, come on."
- I feel stupid.
"No, we're gonna ge- we'll dry you off."
"- I know, he's very dumb."
- I feel stupid!
Let's go to the bathroom.
Come on.
"I would have DDT'd that dude, but I pulled my back this morning... farting."
I farted really hard.
"I don't know about fighting anymore, you know?"
"If you hit somebody, and you kill them by accident, you're flying con air."
You couldn't have fought that dude.
You're guarding all the Molsons.
I had to guard the Molsons.
"If Jillian wouldn't have been such a fight hog, we would have scared that dude something no-nonsense."
He was intimidated.
- What was that?
- He was intimidated at first.
"Guys, come on."
We got punked.
"Oi, don't start."
"Mom, you're the one who wanted us here."
"Listen, you're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all."
What kind of people are these?
-What do you want me to do?
-Do?
What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?
Did you know what they were like?
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.
Stay out?
"Daddy never went out at all, Ma!"
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now?
You don't know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends!
Dad!
Will you leave him out of this?
He's suffered enough.
The man hasn't been able to digest a decent meal in six weeks.
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?
We were worried to death!
A married man does not stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal.
She's right!
"What's wrong with you, Henry?"
What kind of person are you?
- I think it's strange.
Do you know how weird that makes me feel?
"A lesbian dream, and he's staring at me like I should include him."
I can't even fantasize in private.
Mom said you've been seeing someone steady.
Is he cute?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?
Excuse me.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Alone.
Can you believe this weather?
"It's almost April, and it's still cold."
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?
"It'll sound strange, but..."
Is Claire happy?
"I mean, do you think she's happy?"
"Yes, I think she is."
Why?
I'm being silly.
"I'm a first-time husband, I guess."
"If she doesn't wake up and tell me she's ecstatic, I worry."
"Imagine, I have you to thank for the fact that we're married."
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.
- Don't do that.
- What?
What am I doing?
"You don't even know, do you?"
And I never left.
Yeah.
"You know, I understand."
You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.
"But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?"
I fell in love.
- Oh.
- Yep.
- Corvette?
- No.
I fell in love with this.
Whoa.
Look at that.
"Look, they're drivin' right by."
They don't even know what they're missing!
"Well, it didn't used to be that way."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist."
Really?
Yeah.
"Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way."
How do you mean?
The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.
"It moved with the land, you know?"
"It rose, it fell, it curved."
- Mornin'!
"- Nice day, huh?"
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.
They drove on it to have a great time.
"Well, what happened?"
The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's a miracle it's still here.
The guys forgot it and didn't lock the car.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You're kind.
"Here, even if your car's gold, no one will touch it."
"Opposite the school, the students are curious."
It's best to lock it.
All right.
Are you in telecommunications?
Telecommunications?
Yes.
This place is a world of communication.
Why're you here?
"Yes, that's obvious."
I've never seen a woman serve before.
Where did you spring from?
What?
"You have parents, don't you?"
Who served your father his tea?
My mother.
Why say you've never seen such a thing?
All women serve.
They have three trades:
"by day, they're workers. ln the evening, they serve and at night they work."
Except for your mother.
Thanks all the same!
I've told you time and again not to park here.
Park next to the engineer.
"When you start it up, you pollute the cafe."
Color me impressed.
This mode's got some serious power.
I'll say.
Let's turn this guy black and blue.
[all grunt] [growls] What?
I'm seeing red.
"Red rangers, it's time to get fired up."
"[grunting] [groaning] [groaning] At least it took five teams to beat me. [argus] If these setbacks continue,"
The prince will lose his mind.
Something must be done.
Leave it to me.
I've been working on something big.
It's a waste to use it on this little planet.
Consider this a test.
[grunts]
Maximizer.
Watch.
We no longer need zombats.
And we can enlarge more than one monster at a time.
[all] Huh? They're doing it without zombats.
Now they can grow four at once?
[alarm signal] That'll be Gosei.
[Gosei] Rangers.
You can see the aliens have new capabilities.
But you have some too.
"Along with your new powers, come new zords and a special skyship."
Summon them.
Thanks.
We're on it.
Summon skyship.
Wow.
Sweet ride.
Take care of Jean!
How is it?
I see.
Hey!
The door is open.
The Doc..?
Probably inside the ark.
Why aren't you following them?
Well...
Look at that.
Light doesn't even penetrate it.
I've never seen or heard of such a thing.
This is the center of Noah.
This is Noah's control panel.
let's begin.
Are you alright?
Take care.
Professor.
The shield upon Noah is now undone.
Professor.
Yes.
It's..!
It's wonderful!
while arms reductions are progressing over the world the focus of our attentions is on environmental issues.
global warming... all of these problems can be solved.
Macdougal!
Our country must always be the leader of the free world.
So we wanted to obtain this by any means.
Why does the Pentagon have to have this?
they could end up destroying their own country.
What is your real purpose in all this?
Is it dead?
Then...
I'll go with someone else.
Don't forget to pick me up!
Didn't you say that you don't like movie?
"I did, but I didn't say I will not go!"
Xiaotian!
- Has the class over?
"- Yes, why are you here ?"
Didn't you say you have no vacation?
The brigade dispatched us here to borrow equipment.
"I just want too see you, so I asked for one day off."
But I have to report the task at 7 a.m tomorrow.
It just one night?
Many things you can do in one night!
Well...
"The key car, it's for you."
"There is some clothes for change, too."
"Inside the packet of clothes, you'll find something you need!"
What is it?
I'm feeling uneasy to tell it!
Isn't it distracting?
It is.
You may take that off.
- Xiamu...
- It's 6 p.m.
"Yes, it is."
6 p.m?
Sorry!
Sorry!
I forgot.
Come here immediately!
I can't go now.
"Let's go, Master!"
Let's go
Now you've offended Master Yeh!
Do you understand!
?
"This is his land, and the lease is up!"
To be able to keep doing business here I flatter him when I can
Now you've made trouble for me get out!
Get out!
Out!
Didn't you hear me?
Out!
Yes-out!
Out!
"Go, or I'll lie you up and send you to Mr.Yeh to be beaten!"
Best beat you to death to save trouble!
I told you so many times not to bother him!
It just goes in one ear and out the other!
Just pick up your wages and get out!
Yu-lu!
Here's 30 dumplings for the road
Please talk to Boss.
We can't leave!
Why not?
We stayed here for someone
That's right!
You'll just waste your time by staying
"No-where there's a will, there's a way!"
I won't ever agree!
What?
You won't let us study kung-fu?
You mean you stayed for Master Chang?
"- No, you can't."
I'm staying.
"All right, on one condition."
That you play uncle.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
So long.
- Uncle Mike.
- Uncle Mike.
"- So long, Uncle Mike."
"- So long, Uncle Mike."
- Happy?
- You know I am.
How happy?
"Well, you can't get much happier than that."
Come on.
In the town of Hamelin Many years ago
The citizens were crying out A tearful tale of woe
"""Rats, rats, rats!"
They chase the dogs And kill the cats
"Rats, rats, rats!"
"They build their nest In our Sunday hats"""
The citizens of Hamelin
Were frantic with despair
They gnashed their teeth And stamped their feet
And shouted to the mayor
"""Rats, rats, rats!"""
"The people cried ""We've gotta get rid of the rats"
"Gotta get rid of the rats In Hamelin town"""
Rats!
Rats!
"Sifu, Mousy's a good man."
Please let him be your student.
Mousy!
The injuries weakened his legs.
Your injuries are unique.
I'll have to give you a unique treatment.
How unique?
Your heart has been displaced.
I'll have to open your chest to heal you.
We'll open your ribcage and adjust the position of your heart.
We'll then close your ribcage and sew you up.
Then you'll be better.
He can handle it.
"Sifu Wong, is this knife suitable?"
Just about.
Hold him down!
I'm OK!
I'm OK now!
Come back.
Pay your respects to Marshal.
I'm known for being magnanimous.
"We're like brothers, and none of his ideas worked."
Forfeit for you.
"Sifu Wong, hey..."
Go and stand guard.
"- Sifu Wong, we're going."
- Glad you came.
Take your time.
We're on our way.
♪ It's such a joy to be entertained
♪ We'd be invited to more dinners...
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
"You're just jealous, Peku."
"You're a fucking tease, bitch!"
I'll tell everyone not to talk to you.
You're a traitor!
And you can donate this virginity barometer to the nuns!
Can't you just wear women's clothes?
This is so embarrassing.
You're the one going through people's grocery bags!
How do I look?
-Like a pervert dying to get laid.
Dad...
"You didn't have to, honey..."
I'll fight for you.
You picked these in the yard.
I rang your doorbell.
I brought you flowers.
Tore them from the ground.
I worked!
"I humiliated myself for you, Marjukka."
-Oh boy...
You're insatiable!
"I've got something better in sight, you stupid monkey!"
"You've got a guy here, I can smell it."
Go or I'll ask your Mom to get you.
Tell him to come out.
Hello.
Garbage Jesse!
"This won't do, Jesse."
You're far too crazy.
And lemma hates you.
I'm beginning to understand why.
L---
When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You fuckin' piece of shit!
"Die, you motherfucker!"
Look at me!
Look into my fuckin' eyes.
Die!
No more mummy wife from now on.
Your eyebrows are going to be attached to here soon.
Then you'll be a monster.
"I'm warning you, this is really the end."
I feel like death.
"When you're sleeping next to a mummy, you yourself feel like you're dead."
Do you know how scary it is to see a mummy moving around at night?
Do you have nothing else to talk about?
I'm only saying it because it's us three.
Why are you still wearing that?
Is there still some bruising?
People will find out.
Stop it.
And the kids?
"They're here, they wanted to take a look at some things."
My husband's almost here as well.
The guest has arrived.
I'm not late.
I'm five minutes early.
I just got here as well.
Hello.
Hello.
Take that off.
"Right, shall I?"
Why is it so hot?
I'll be taking this off.
Sure.
She's got a sty in her eye.
She didn't want you to see it so she got surgery.
Oh...
This color!
"Oppa, pretty, right?"
She's given her statement.
Read it.
Shiv brought me to Kurukshetra... which is 142 kilometres from Delhi... and raped me in this car.
Enough.
I'll handle it from here.
Heard that.
Anything that you say anything that you don't say... will definitely be used against you.
Ayushman you don't know...
You don't know that rape is a serious crime.
No bail and along prison sentence.
You'll live like a dog get that.
You're trying to trap me in this.
Dimple's lying.
- You know...
- Who's lying?
She's lying.
Will a decent girl defame herself?
Did she bring you here?
Did she bring you here?
You didn't bring her.
She... drugged the water.
She made you drink it.
She got you unconscious.
Listen boy.
It's all about facts and figures.
You were stuck on her figure.
And the fact is... that you're a bloody rapist.
Understand.
Come out.
Ayushman what are you doing?
Come on.
Ayushman this is wrong.
"so Yawang, you have to be happy!"
Yawang!
Yawang.
You will never know that my basic wish was
just to admire the paradise together with you.
I think we will see each other in the next life.
"At that time,"
I'll be waiting for you!
"At that time, if you don't come,"
I will stay young!
"At that time, you would not loose me again."

"Hey, Esther, how're you doing?"
Want a jelly bean?
"Oh, some of these are wet."
That's weird.
They should all be wet.
I'm going to go boil my hand.
MASON:
There's nothing to be scared of.
Just relax and go with what feels right.
CLARK:
This is all too much at once.
You can't deny your feelings.
[whispers]:
It's not that easy.
Ours is a forbidden love.
No chicks.
"Yeah, like you'd know what to do with one, you virgin!"
I know more than you!
Are you forgetting about that fox at the lake I boned all last summer?
How come we never met her?
I told you she died of leukemia.
Last time you said it was polio.
"Polio is a gateway disease to leukemia, stupid."
"Hey, look, Claire's here."
"Oh, she's so fine."
"Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?"
I blew my shot with her.
She was just about to touch it when my stupid brother boner-blocked me.
I'll never get laid.
"Hey, you know, I heard about this loose girl that goes to Roberto Clemente High."
She asks you to come to her house for a free haircut.
And then she fucks you.
"Well, that's something."
What's her name?
- I don't know.
Haircut Girl?
- That's no help!
"Oh, fuck it."
I'm gonna go talk to Claire.
"- No, you're not."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Watch me.
I will not die a virgin.
Ow!
My dick!
"Goddamn it, Maureen."
Don't sit like that.
Don't get sore.
"Oh, I'm not sore."
I suppose it's natural for a chap to be a bit edgy before his first jump.
Is it?
Everybody is.
"It's nothing to do with, well, being frightened, you know?"
That's interesting.
"There, now you can stop worrying and relax."
It's a special I keep on one side.
It's the best chute I ever packed.
Good.
I wouldn't like to have to repack it on the way down.
"Hey, what's your name?"
Gardner.
What Gardner?
Just Gardner.
Working girls don't have Christian names.
I haven't seen you around.
I don't get around.
"Oh, officer material?"
I said we work here.
"On your way, Mr Maple Leaf."
"Left, right, left, right..."
Squad halt!
"One, two."
Fall out.
"Take the ropes, Corporal Dawes."
"All right, who's going to have the first go?"
No ugly rush now.
All right.
We'll have to pick out volunteers for the first stick.
"Canada, suppose you show us how it's done?"
- Stop walking around on your leg.
- I'm fine.
What do we do next?
Just tell me what we do now.
Timetable updated.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
Is there a problem?
- No.
"- Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
This drilling is driving me nuts.
I wanna find David and Meredith.
You sure no one else could be in here?
- What?
- Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
- Think they got what they came for?
- Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
- Malaysia.
I was in the area.
- Kramer.
- Just drive.
All right.
"Now you listen, and you listen good."
I know who you are.
You're the scofflaw.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.
"It's me, Cosmo."
"All right, so it's me."
So what?
You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day?
Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.
"- I can't sleep, I tell you."
I can't sleep.
"- Of course you can't, you poor sap."
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
So you've been living this secret by yourself?
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.
I wanted to tell somebody.
"- Help me, Kramer."
Help me.
"- All right, I'm gonna help you."
"I'll try some on, we'll see how they look."
It's just hair.
Ever see what that looks like in the back?
You got natural curls on the bottom and that big phoney mat coming down on top of it.
Then the next thing I knew he had me pinned up against the wall.
It's OK.
Take your time.
He said he had a knife.
"And that if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd kill me."
And he told me to open the door.
And...
I was so scared I couldn't find my keys.
"You're doing really well, Lucy."
He got really angry and... he ripped the back of my dress.
With a knife.
And... he started touching me.
This car horn started beeping.
And he just grabbed my bag and ran off.
And...
I heard the cab pull away.
Can you describe the cab?
"It was green, I think."
Maybe blue.
Did you see his face?
Only for a second or two.
Anything else you can remember at all?
Something that sticks in your mind?
He had these trainers on.
They were white with a blue stripe.
And one of them had orange paint splashed on the toe.
It was on the right foot.
OK.
You've done really well.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Right, if you'll excuse us."
Looks like the fiance is off the hook.
The house was gone.
It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay here a little longer.
It's comfortable.
"Well, depends on your definition of comfort."
"I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here."
"It's not for me, it's for you."
Is it?
-Can you get me some lemonade?
-I'll see if there's some around.
-How'd you sleep?
-I don't know.
Whatever you hit me with took me down.
I feel fucking drugged.
"Yeah, well, you were drugged."
-I don't like downers.
-You weren't liking the uppers either.
Yeah.
-I told you not to call my house.
"-Look, I had to contact your family."
You're underage.
That's the law.
My mom's gonna kick my ass.
"I mean, she's freaking now."
But she's gonna torch my fucking ass when I get out of here.
Why are things so wrong with your mom?
I don't know.
You seem like you do.
"She just doesn't get me, all right?"
"She's in my face about my grades, my hair, my friends, tattoos."
All this other shit.
You know?
I can't do nothing right.
"Alright, buy it at four."
I'll try.
You knew something.
"Well, I told you."
It was too late when you told me.
If I'd had the pleasure of knowing you before.
Do you think he's going to get it at four?
"No, but it's a good buy at five."
I couldn't get it.
"Alright, buy it at five."
"I'm sorry, it's going to six."
Buy it at six.
I won't buy it at all.
Cancel the order.
You mustn't get mad just because you missed a good buy.
Who gave you this tip?
I specialize in tips.
Give me your card.
I'm afraid I don't have one with me.
But I'll be happy to call you when I get the next tip.
I usually don't do this.
"I'll call you, Mrs. Ryan."
"And if you're not in, I'll leave the message with your husband."
"I have no husband, I am a widow."
Who was your husband?
Peter Ryan.
Peter Ryan!
Did you know him?
"Everybody knew Peter Ryan, the financial wizard."
We were married in Europe.
He brought me to this country.
A short while after he died.
"Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France."
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant!
You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- (GUNSHOT)
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded.
- We'll hold the king as hostage.
We'll shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you.
- My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
GIRL:
Beautiful!
BOTH:
Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, Excellency."
- Claudette.
Ah.
Velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, Claudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
That's great.
What are you going to do... break every lamp in the house?
No.
Take the bulbs out.
You need some light?
You creep.
- Just lay down!
- No!
Listen to me!
"You want to be raped... strangled, and drowned in a bath of your own blood?"
If you want to keep your ass alive... you're gonna have to help me.
You better be strong.
Strong like you?
Let go!
Don't test me.
Why did you come here?
You better get some sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
I got to go.
"Someday that dam you built's going to break, detective."
What you got there?
Soap.
It's from the hospital.
"Surgical, antibacterial."
"She saw him there last night, right?"
She smells the same weird soap.
So you're going to bring her in... for a detergical lineup... like some kind of goddamn commercial?
What the hell are you doing?
Anyone at the Byzantine churches recognize the drawing?
"Hallstrom, Crowe's on 501."
Joe.
Hallstrom.
they tried eminent domain then screwing with our water.
somebody poisoned our dogs.
those trucks...
Who knows.
Maybe.
look at 'em.
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains shucking their cloned-up super corn.
too.
Why do people eat it?
They don't.
They drink it.
Corn syrup.
It's in those drinks that everyone's having... whatever.
Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day.
Mine still are.
Those are for breakaway roping.
Those are for barrel racing and right here is for pole bending.
third place.
but my dad makes me.
Do you want to listen?
Do you like it?
you can take it for tonight and I'll get it back from you in the morning.
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.
Should hold it.
Yeah.
Till next time.
Thanks.
how long has your girl been like that?
Huh?
Mute.
since the beginning.
Mmm.
One must be careful.
I check everyone who get into my car.
But with you there's no doubt.
Married?
-Yes.
Is your wife waiting there?
No.
Well...
We're going to my friend's place.
That's good.
It has a great ambience.
It's separated.
In the middle of the field.
I congratulate you.
You're a lucky man.
And why isn't your wife coming?
"Actually, we've been living separated for a long time."
Now that's a coincidence.
Give me five!
I'm separated too.
Watch out!
Don't be afraid.
I know these roads by heart.
How long has it been from your separation?
I'm free since 3 years ago.
Excuse me for talking like this but to me it was like freedom.
My wife thought I'd discuss who keeps the children.
I told her she could keep them forever.
I've never seen any of them since then.
Good God!
"What an ease, what a beautiful life!"
There was a moment... in which I thought of killing her.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, what could possibly make you upset in a paradise like this, right?"
"He could find a way, trust me."
But stick around.
He shouldn't be that long.
"Besides, seeing you will make him feel better."
"Ah, well, I doubt that."
- You got that whole lease thing.
"- Right, right, right."
"Welcome, Kisan."
"I'm Charles Greane, assistant general manager."
- Great to have you.
- Indeed.
Appreciate it.
"What up, man?"
You ready to make us look good?
"Yeah, man, better than you already look."
- And you a handsome man.
- ( chuckles ) My dude.
"Hey, hey, hey."
You dandelions gonna run some drills or you gonna stand there circle jerking?
"Man, I was born to run, Coach."
You know that.
- My man make you say Bo looks slow.
- ( snaps fingers )
Why are we still talking?
You should be running.
Lace them the fuck up.
"Come on, I'll show you the locker room."
Let's go.
- Right.
- ( phone buzzing )
I found about the courier by hacking into
My father's computer a couple of days ago.
When?
Two days ago.
Then I called you.
When did you hack into his computer?
Sydney.
Two days ago.
Everything I'm telling you
"Is the truth, I swear."
So your father's still alive?
Yes.
And I would do anything
To bring him down.
"(courier:)this is not my fault, da veiga."
You saw me.
I followed instructions.
Somebody compromised our security.
"What, you going to tell the council?"
Obviously one of our dikes needs plugging.
Did you get a good look at
The person with fox and bailey?
I could pick him out a line-up.
Do you want me to go track them down?
[gun shots]
No.
Thank you.
You know what this means?
"Yeah, we're in it up to our eyeballs."
Karen was right.
(syd:)it was coincidence.
(nigel:) was it?
Whoever took that wallet was about the most stupid sneak thief in the world.
Why do you say that?
Because the risks are to great and the reward is too small.
"I always say that if you're going to steal at all, steal in a way that will be admired."
"Let's get out of here, hm?"
Where will we go?
Anywhere.
I know the perfect place.
First time I've ever been in a subway.
What a fascinating experience.
Everybody who comes here wants to ride in the subway.
You'll get over it.
"Say, what about those abc's you were telling me about?"
We'll get to that.
This is where I live.
What kind of a district is this?
See for yourself.
You know Park Avenue is only three blocks away?
But I'll never make it.
"You know, I think I'm gonna like you."
You won't tire my mind.
I might wear it out my way.
Go on in.
It's safe.
Thanks.
Fix yourself a drink.
Fix me one too.
What'll you have?
Bourbon.
How?
Straight.
Okay.
It's over!
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Let him in.
Thank you.
"No, wait."
Let me talk to her again.
Jenna.
Open up.
Michael's not here.
He's outside with your dad.
Jenna.
Have you got something to say for yourself?
"I don't know, I'm..."
I panicked.
I got scared.
"Well, that's a very compelling argument."
You won't have any trouble convincing her of that.
What the fuck were you thinking?
Did you just get bored?
"- No, I'm just an idiot."
"- On that much, we're agreed."
"I love her, Stephen."
I realize now I love her more than I will ever love anybody else.
Stop talking about love.
Every asshole in the world says he loves somebody.
- It means nothing.
- But it's true.
It still doesn't mean anything.
What you feel only matters to you.
"It's what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters."
It's the only thing that counts.
"And you did do this thing, right?"
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Fine with me.
"Tony, stay with McGee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smelled like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dirt, sweat... and sandalwood."
ZIVA:
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant, so I used yours."
"No, you didn't."
"Yeah, we're partners."
What's the big deal?
A hair!
TONY:
"Come on, you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ground radar techs didn't show till dawn.
McGee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very Brokeback Mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."""
How romantic.I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well, I can show it to you on my new phone it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
ZIVA:
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
Not really.
- Here.
Then divide it up!
I'll make piles!
It doesn't work out this time either.
"Ah, here!"
No big green ones?
"- None, really?"
"- No, really."
It's just that green is good for the eyes.
"Wait, I can't count it."
... eighty... ninety and two fifties.
- Two fifties and ninety is...
- Two fifties for each...
Wait!
"You must do something with this, it's torn//falling to pieces, soon we won't have anything to play from."
"Look, there's something here!"
I knew it.
Good to see.
That's super.
It'll save us.
It's the first time that's happened!
Such a good job!
Yes!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- A terrible thing's happened to us.
- And what's that?
We were sewing a dress for Mi?
"ka for a party on Saturday, we wanted to hurry it up, so we thought we'd do it ourselves."
"Put it on, so that we can see..."
"She cut it out, got it ready, and now we need to be rescued."
This for a party?
So many dogs!
- I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
- All right.
This is gonna hurt.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"- Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
- Okay.
"- Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
- The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
- Talking about what?
"- Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"- Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
- I don't know.
She sounded so happy...
But you were seen no where.
I kept telling her we should leave the city.
But she did not listen.
She was confident that you would come back... and asked me to wait.
How many days do we give excuses?
The moneylenders have kidnapped my daughter.
They are threatening to kill my daughter
If we don't clear all our debts.
What do you mean?
I want my daughter back.
Alive.
Alive.
- Sir...
Please get up.
Please.
Don't cry.
We will rescue Deepa for sure.
They are very dangerous people.
If we go to the police...
They will not think twice to kill my daughter.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Give me a day's time.
Please.
Come.
Have a seat.
How much do you owe them now?
Going to have your morning coffee with Sadhana?
I have to invite my close friend.
I will be able to meet him only if I go now.
So...
Bye.
Careful.
Don't worry;
I know my cousin's greed all to well.
He won't let that land slip away.
Fourteen thousand and three shekels!
Eighteen thousand shekels!
you can't afford it.
but he doesn't. want to see how you get yourself out of it.
Eighteen thousand shekels going once!
eighteen thousand shekels going twice!
And eighteen thousand going...
Eighteen thousand and one!
Boaz?
your charity has no end.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
I'll bear any burden.
Your worries will be my own.
I've been blessed by your care.
for you are my home.
and stone only make a dwelling.
It's you that makes this house a home.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
Heaven smiles on us both;
for you are my home. ( end song)
Good morning.
You're up early.
You have no principles.
You're just like us.
"And you're selfish, too."
"You've gone nuts, haven't you?"
Just eat your fish.
"Moonsook, you have a lovely face."
Thank you.
My face is rather big.
Wish I could cut some off.
"No, you have a lovely face."
"You're drunk already, aren't you?"
"Yeah, a little bit."
"Moonsook, what makes you sad?"
"My father, maybe."
We don't see each other anymore.
Her father is a famous composer.
He's written many well-known songs.
"Now, I hate him the most."
But I'm also very sorry about it.
He's given me so much love.
"Every weekend, he'd take only me on his travels."
"He was like an octopus, wrapping me from behind in that closed grip, squeezing me and not letting go."
He worries about me more than I do myself.
But does that make sense?
It makes my skin crawl.
That's why she studied abroad.
To run away from him.
"Hey, you crying?"
Need this?
No thanks.
My tears are clean.
I have a question.
How?
I killed the people that fucked me.
"That's it, if you fuck me you'll die."
"Come on, baby!"
"No, it's true!"
It's not true.
I'm serious.
I'm serious too.
Hey you!
How many people want me see me fuck Margaret and not die?
It's too much Adrian
Lay off!
There's something very strange going on here.
I'm going to leave.
Right there's something strange going on here.
I bet you 300$ that I can fuck Margaret and not die.
Of course she won't die.
But I'm not sure watching you fuck is worth 300$.
But it sure sounds interesting.
I'd like to watch but I'm not sure Margaret's in the mood.
Adrian!
"You should stay away from me, I'm a killer."
"You like to fuck, baby, better than anything in the world."
I don't want you!
Why not?
Because I'm killing all the people that I fuck.
"You kill me bitch, that's the joke of all time."
Adrian...
Leave me alone.
You like it honey?
You like it...
"Don't do it, Adrian."
Jesus Christ!
"Hold on, darling."
"911, there's been an accident."
Yes.
You okay?
"You didn't see it, did you?"
Seewhat?
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
John.
There's something wrong with me.
It's called a glioblastoma.
It's a temporal lobe tumor.
"According to the doctor, it's extremely rare."
"600,000 gets this thing."
Did they say it was a result ofthe accident?
"No, it turns out... that it's been there a while."
There's nothing else they can do?
"No, no."
"They did the surgery, and they couldn't get it all out, so they'll... keep her on the chemo... as long as her strength holds out."
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.
Good.
That's good.
Two weeks ago... we were house hunting.
One day you're just driving along in your car and the universe... just points at you and says...
"""Ah, there you are, a happy couple."
I've been looking for you.
"I've been looking for you""."
I'm sorry.
For what?
For all of this.
"Bu next time you're staying, all of you."
Bye.
- Have a good night.
Come on you guys.
I don't mean to be rude but Can I get an autograph?
Oh yeah sure.
Thanks.
I'm a big fan.
Thank you.
Wow that is... a lot of tequila.
I'm just letting you know now that tequila and I are a wild mix.
Things might get silly.
All right but only if you do a wrap around.
"Go like this,"
I'm not going to let you put your penis n my ass either.
"It's an out hole, not an in hole."
Why are you being such a prude?
I'm not being a prude.
I'm just not a porn star OK!
You wanna announce our lake of sex in front of everybody?
I've just got the wedding on my mind.
Oh what a surprise.
You haven't had any input BTW.
"BTW, Jesus."
It's because I work and I don't sit at home eating chips and dip and obsess over the wedding.
What?
It is disgusting what you are doing.
You're a pig.
I'm a pig?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you guys Ok?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"I don't know whose day's been worse, yours or mine."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You?
I never thought I'd see something like that.
It's different when they roll in on a gurney.
"Yeah, but you stepped up."
That's all that counts.
I did my job.
At least we saved one of them.
- So I heard she gave an ID.
- Partial one.
I filled in some details.
"What, you saw the guys?"
A glimpse as they drove off.
"- They were black, huh?"
- I think so.
You think so?
"Well, it was quick, you know?"
But- And I only saw one of them.
So that's why the cops are picking up brothers all over town.
I told them what I saw.
"What you saw, or what you thought you saw?"
"I was trying to help, Greg."
Can't you see you fed right into what they always wanna jump to?
"Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but that's on the cops, not me."
It's all part of the same thing.
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"- So, what, now I'm a racist?"
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
Thank you.
Do you remember the day my grandmother died?
Jenna?
Remember how they let me in so that I could kiss her goodbye?
"There was this pain in my heart that day that I had never felt before,"
and that I've never felt again until now.
I feel like I'm mourning the death of the single most important thing in my life.
Us.
"But we're not dead, Jenna."
"We're not dead, baby."
We just have to go back.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.
Please love me enough to let us go back to the way things were.
"I don't think I can, Michael."
"Well, then, we'll start something new, but we have to try, right?"
How can we not try?
Jenna?
Jenna?
Western grip?
Western grip?
Correct.
Just like holding hands.
Holding hands?
Like this?
- I don't know how.
- I don't know how.
Yamete kudasai.
Ah?
Please stop doing that.
- Can't hear you.
"- Me, too."
- Good!
So that's the end of it.
"A few weeks ago, the beast was circling the village."
Farm animals and pets were going missing.
I tracked it to this area.
It's between two farms.
Prime hunting ground.
Good job.
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah.
See that tree over there?
Yeah.
Go and stand under it and leave me alone.
- What?
- Just trying to imagine what you were like when you were my age.
You must have worn a lot of black.
Here.
Don't break anything.
"So, what's the deal with you and Kyle?"
"He needed someone to put him on camera,"
I needed an extra-ordinary graduation film to kick-start my career.
We sort of found each other.
- So you two are...?
- For a bit.
Then Kyle...
"Well, I mean he decided that work was..."
"Great, let's share life stories while my camera battery drains."
"Kyle, your public's waiting."
"So, Kyle, tell us what's going on."
This is Shannon Kelly.
Hi.
The kind he always gets from the office.
Okay.
"I'll be right back, okay?"
Why is the door locked?
Sorry.
Reflex.
Hey.
That was the man who shot Haskell.
- Who was?
- The messenger who was just here.
- What'd he bring you?
"- You're joking, right?"
No.
It was him.
That was his helmet and his jacket.
"I'm sorry, I'm not following."
Ils there a reason an assassin would be delivering packages to me at home?
"He was here, so you tell me."
"III will take this as some kind of a reaction to the trauma of what you saw, and I will ask you..."
Did you see the man's face at the shooting?
No.
- Did you see it today?
"- No, he was wearing a helmet."
Was there something distinctive about that helmet or that jacket which tells you it was the same man?
No.
There wasn't.
"Okay, then."
Do you feel better?
Yeah.
"So, what was the delivery?"
"From the office, some files."
Why?
"- No, I wouldn't dare put anyone out."
"The ambulance won't be here for two hours, shall we grab some grub?"
"Here, you buy what you like!"
"Cigarettes, candy..."
But there was no fog in Budapest.
What was the name of your mental hospital again?
Will you remember my bros' names?
I'm so sorry... it's my head... hurts...
"Beauty, fitness, sickness, women!"
That's my cousin's name...
"Whatever, all of them whores."
Except one!
Dig it?
"""Clog""!"
Here you have to buy!
"And to buy, you have to pay!"
Enjoy it?
"Snap, rush, touchdown!"
"Here, they shield everything in the same way."
"Their women, their armchairs, their money, their paintings."
"They're so wary, and rightly so."
Now we're fisting!
- Glitz and glamor...
"- Come on, Prince!"
Like some shit?
Have it!
Choke on it!
See that!
"Fisticuffs, huh?"
Do you think I look snazzy enough?
"My partings, my nails... my feet?"
My earrings.
"I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader."
Get them all out of here.
"Come on, get out of here."
On your feet.
Hold them there.
"Naik, detail eight men for escort duty."
Bring them here on the double.
"Listen, you."
What became of Burgess sahib?
"- Come on, spit it out."
"- He can speak, but he won't."
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
"You never saw one of these things before, did you?"
"It's for growing daisies, isn't it?"
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
"- No, sahib."
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No.
Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
"By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling."
Never mind the second chorus.
Come on.
"Party, form a square!"
"Under cover, everybody!"
Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
Nobody in this town will pick him up.
Why?
"Well, 'cause everyone in town is here."
Quaint.
I like that.
What?
"Well, that was nice."
What was that for?
You're different from any guy I've ever met.
"When you talk to me, you look in my eyes, and..."
And what?
"When I hear your voice, it sounds really smart, and that makes me feel special."
"Me, too."
"So, any time you're ready to open up, I'm ready to listen."
I blame you.
What?
I blame you.
"I only kept this job to take care of you, you and the..."
"And the, the..."
Kids?
"Yeah, the kids."
I was just a bag boy who didn't have sense enough to leave.
And now that's what I am for the rest of my life.
"Oh, Alan, what you do for a living is only a little of what you are."
It's not mostly what you are.
"Well, then what am I, mostly?"
Mostly...
You are a person that I love a whole lot.
And I want you to be happy.
"Well, right now I am not happy settling for what I am."
What the hell are we looking at?
George...
'Cause I'm gonna drop truth bombs.
You know how pissed off I was when U S Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight-up mentally ill.
Sure.
I got mental-health issues.
Sure.
"Well, you know, who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Miss Maroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't think you'd like it, 'cause we work a lot of hours and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like risky."
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"""Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."""
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
I am serious!
"You are not my type, and... we are not suitable each other, and..."
I... don't like girl with big face!
Mr...
Mr. Chen!
I'm not talking about you.
Who did this?
Who put these porn photos inside my book?
"These are not mine, Sir!"
Really not mine!
Not mine!
It hurts!
"Sir, those are not mine really!"
I'm innocent!
Yawang!
- Yawang.
- Yes...
Do you want to earn some pocket money?
Money?
"Yes, of course!"
What should I do?
- Be a private tutor.
- For whom?
His name is Xiamu.
His father was my best friend.
"When he was 4, his father lost everything in business and committed suicide!"
"His mother could not stand the pressure from creditors, and hung herself!"
Most unfortunately little Xiamu witnessed this.
Since then he has rarely talked and become withdrawn.
"By being his private tutor, you may help this kid."
It looks like real one!
Don't be stingy!
A place to return to.
"""I'm home."""
"Yes, ""I'm home."""
Welcome home.
Two days ago we got a transfer request.
A graduate of the shaolin school of martial Arts.
currently a member of the lacrosse team.
The team requested permission to join the league.
apparently they have a new coach.
The beach volley team requests permission for an overseas tour.
Destination:
Australia.
First kneel down.
Hold the stick at an angle of 45to your body.
"Then, with one smooth movement..."
Don't rely just on force.
flow like water.
"Rin, this is fun!"
These are the basics of Shaolin Kung Fu.
Come for a sec.
What?
Standing Zen!
Don't do anything.
Alright!
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force ejects the ball like a bullet.
The lower body is also important.
Its muscles control the speed.
This is Kung Fu.
"Alright, Minmin."
Give it a try.
OK.
"What you think we're, stupid?"
Yes !
Same me to you!
"Oh, can you believe him?"
"Look at here , Daze."
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.
Be your best in my new signature dress.
"Let them know you mean business at the disco or in the boardroom , with the amazing versatility of the premier piece in my high-end line of super stylish couture ."
"Who is better than you, girl ?"
Oh man !
How much is it ?
About 300 bucks.
How do you know ?
"I know, because Stacy Cold Pepper has got one and everybody was talking about it."
Let's get us ours'.
We can't.
Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe ..."
What?
"Again , Vi ?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
We got it.
But...
He said it was an easy gig.
right?
Yea.
"Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me , Daisy."
"Expected that boys have a lock electronics to be opened, then put it on directories to open the safe."
- Have a little risked.
- I do not know what to say.
Vault walls have a thickness three meters.
The hottest man is the key.
They found the alarm device against fire and emiþãtoarele.
They found the van.
Fire.
Where is it?
Where do you think?
Where is Jem?
"Maybe on the way here, and stopped someone set fire to houses, or to rob a liquor store."
I have no idea.
I started we take hostages?
"No, not we."
You wanted to talk with this fucker?
Speaking of the devil ...
Have you succeeded?
- Lost?
- We have a problem.
- What?
- Look.
And what if.
What?
Let me see.
- Phooey!
- Have you seen the address?
Trash it stands at four streets away from here.
"Yes, and I know where we are, Gloans."
Damn!
You'll see the bastards  on the street every day?
- I saw nothing.
OK.
Bye.
Is that my phone?
Is it Charles?
"It was Charles, wasn't it?"
Yes!
Yes.
Oh!
What?
I was...
Really looking forward to that call.
Aren't you going to Amaar's press conference?
No.
Like they're waiting for me.
"Ah, how long do you think we have to wait for the mayor?"
We should just go ahead and get this thing started.
Oh!
"Remember, you are doing something amazing for the community, and you're going to be great!"
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Don't bring up the chicken.
"Good evening, residents of Mercy."
"Tonight, I stand before you, a man of faith, a man with a vision!"
A man with a purpose.
A man who is going to build a mosque in Mercy!
"It'll be our own mosque,"
No different than the mosque that we have in the church.
"If it's no different, then why do you need to build it?"
"Well, I had a vision."
That's how it all started.
"Well, not really a vision, more like a sign!"
You'll have your old moniker again and I'll choose a Lady for your mansion.
Three full moons?
When she lays eyes on me she'll forget Henry and throw herself in my arms.
Just think of all the hardship in store for you!
The hard work will kill you.
That witch foretold deeds worthy of my heroic ancestors.
I'll earn the favours of the lady of my head.
Lady?
ls the girl worth it?
So many high-born ladies were ready to care for you.
But there's only one Elisa.
You'll have to walk the rest of the way... and such a way!
"No more la French, now you're a commoner."
And you must walk like this...
I see.
Like this?
"That's it, your Grace."
Like a folk hero!
What's that?
Damned dog!
What's that?
Crazy swans... help...
Murder!
Shot in the back!
"She's high and dry, poor thing."
Whatcher doing?
"Not water, no!"
It's water she needs!
Help!
Somebody's coming!
"Horrible monster, go away!"
What are you doing?
"I should have seen coming, and I didn't."
Do you want to talk about it?
"No, I don't."
I'll...
I'll be fine.
"Well, I just got some news that we should have seen coming but didn't, and it's not good."
What is it?
We've just been subpoenaed to testify against Louis.
♪♪
What's that?
Moo shu pork and fried rice.
"The way I treated you before,"
I wasn't sure if you'd eaten yet.
- Harvey...
- And I was thinking that maybe we could eat while I tell you that I'm sorry and that I told Donna.
- You told her?
- Yes.
You were right.
"I needed to tell her, and it was unfair to her, and it was unfair to you."
- I never said that.
"- No, but you meant it."
"Harvey, if you're not careful, you're gonna become a full-fledged outstanding boyfriend."
Boyfriend?
Boyfriend.
Then I'll try not to be careful.
Come in.
"By the way, how did she take it?"
She was fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Turned out she already knew.
"Well, I'm glad you told her."
(both chuckle)
Good luck.
Isler needs you.
He's not gonna let you go that easily.
"Yeah, well, if he doesn't, I'm screwed."
(sighs)
Well good luck.
(sighs)
What-what are the police doing here?
"Oh, it's no big deal-- they're just here in case"
Darrell shows up before you leave.
But how does he know that we're leaving?
"Oh, a little birdie might've told him."
What?
"Look, Melody... you don't have to worry about him anymore, I promise."
"Why, what are you gonna do?"
What needs to be done.
(engine roaring)
"All right, you stay here."
You put Tucker in the car.
"I'll be right back, all right?"
"What's going on, huh?"
"They're arresting you, Darrell."
"Hey, what're you doing?"
Get off me.
LASALLE:
I did a background search.
You got outstanding warrants in Texas.
"That, plus assaulting a federal officer, you'll be going away for a long time."
"(grunting) Settle down, hands behind your back!"
"This ain't right, okay?"
You can't do this to me.
When my snitches get killed.
Those fuckers give me a giant hard-on.
"Some get laid, others freeze!"
We're on the wrong team.
"No, that's his last fuck."
We'll hump again.
You sure?
Big Luc to Fat Ass.
"Mercedes wagon, local plates, 4 men on board."
It's headed your way.
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.
I nabbed him for a holdup 1 0 years ago.
A mean fucker.
I don't know the others.
Said and Jamel Attia.
I say it's for tomorrow.
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.
They'll fire at us.
We may lose them to avoid bloodshed.
What do you suggest?
"We hit 'em at night, and gun down the lot of them."
What about our ethics code?
I've wiped my ass with that for years.
They killed 9 men.
9 families call me every week hoping I'll have good news at last.
I owe it to them.
It obsesses me.
"Stay home, let Vrinks deal with it."
I've worked 2 years on this case.
It's my collar as much as anyone's.
"OK, but you'll be back-up."
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.
No one hikes around here.
- Phillip.
- No.
Don't worry.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"Open up the back for me, please."
Sure.
"Heel, bud."
Jesus.
That smell is worse than the shit it covers up.
Have a good night.
You too.
Good boy.
We're S.E.A.L.S.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
"If you had taught him how to load that thing, there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge."
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We'd all be dead...
Five minutes.
"Shooters, you're gonna get a magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds."
A magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds.
All ready on the firing line!
All ready on the firing line!
"Shooters, make ready!"
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Unload!
I wouldn't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex.
Just like him!
Don't say things about my father.
He was wonderful.
- Wonderful!
- And good to you.
"- You told me that, so don't blame him."
- Wonderful and good.
That's what I told you?
"Well, I lied."
I lied because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
- Then why did you marry him?
- I didn't!
He didn't marry me because he had a wife.
"- You don't mean that, Mother."
- I do mean it.
- Don't you understand?
- No.
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison.
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
"She looks so, so... ."
Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
"A few days' care, and she'll be out of it."
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And Connie just because it happened in your house, don't think any of it was your fault."
Somehow I do.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
Let me think about it.
"You know what tomorrow is, don't you?"
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
"-Still believe this is a dream, do you?"
-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
"Yes, yes."
But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS)
"I must be, then."
I'll miss you when I wake up.
(PLAYING TRUMPET)
Who will step forth to be champion for the White Queen?
That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.
I'll do it.
"-No, me."
"-No, me."
"No other slayer, nohow."
"If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead."
"Alice, you cannot live your life to please others."
"The choice must be yours, because when you step out to face that creature,"
you will step out alone.
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears.
Put it into third!
Watch what you're doing!
"Brake, brake!"
The middle pedal!
Goubi's piece of soil.
"Over there, I see a large room with tiled floors."
The kitchen here.
"There, the laundry."
And our bedroom up there.
Then there's...
There's something else.
What's that?
Well now...
"As far as looking after the animals ...bringing in fodder, cutting timber is concerned I think that because you'd have ME, you're doing the right thing."
But as for the other things...
For the other things...
You can leave it to me.
Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
"What are these, bitch cuffs?"
- Hold still.
"- My hand, man!"
I said hold still!
Cadillac Kligman.
Six Million Dollar Man.
Six pins in his leg and a bunch of screws loosing his head.
And I was hoping for a slow day.
I'll get started on the paperwork.
Better get him out of here.
Have fun.
What the hell are you doing?
That's my desk!
What's in a name?
"One must serve tea, after all!"
Don't lie!
Shut up!
It's because of you that he got into trouble.
Where'd he get the 5000 Rupees he paid your surety from?
Speak the truth!
Where did the 5000 Rupees come from?
I wish I had.
They caught me putting back the money!
You should've told them that you're putting the money back!
They didn't let me speak!
They chased me and I ran!
But this job is not for you!
"Ajob is a job, after all!"
I only have to earn my living.
Yes.
I miss the respect I got as a chef.
Forget it!
I was sick of the hotel-life anyway.
I'm thinking of joining the movies now.
"Get me a role, will you?"
"If I become a star, I will soon join politics."
I could even become a minister soon after.
"You want to act, don't you?"
Of course!
"""Killing two birds with one stone"""
Wonderful!
That's a great title for a film!
"I play the stone, all right."
Who are the birds?
You will play both the roles.
"It was awful and it was terrible and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back.
"Although the Charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
"No, I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I woke up.
"Yeah, that's right."
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy.
Mercy?
Please.
"Said Puss, with his last dying breath."
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower."
"Oh, my goodness."
Why would I do that?
"And right behind you, there was danger."
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed.
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
It was packing heat and it wanted revenge!
I want revenge!
The donkey... ran.
Look.
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.
Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions.
Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things.
"The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home."
"You bet it does, mister."
"Save your voices, gentlemen."
They're coming here to your rescue.
You tormenting fiend.
"- You're so sure, aren't you?"
- Quite sure.
It is my plan.
Two come to rescue one... then the others follow.
Lay it on me.
Chicken and mung bean noodle salad.
[Giggling] [Chuckling]
"""Mung beans."" [Laughs]"
They do it to me every time.
"Well, I can't wait to see what the oyster sauce does."
"Oh, that's a really ancient reference."
- Here.
- [Sighs]
Alex.
What are you thinking?
I don't wanna go home tonight.
I think you probably have to.
No.
All I have to do is decide to pay the consequences.
- And?
We are moving.
What do you mean?
The factory is cutting back.
There is no work for Rolf.
He got offered a position as a mechanic in Notodden.
And I got a job at the bag factory there.
What does Lise say to this?
Does she want to go?
- We need money.
"- Yes of course, I'm sorry."
We leave this Friday.
- Friday?
What about the concert?
"- No, it..."
We were supposed to go together.
"I'm going to see if we can postpone it, so that Lise can go to the concert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, I'm just being stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about Friday?
Do you know anyone who can postpone the shipment?
- Yes.
"Do it by tomorrow, then we'll postpone until Sunday."
"- Excuse me, Sir."
- Tronstad.
- Have you got a minute?
"- Yes, what can I do for you?"
How sure are we?
How far down the line are they with the bomb?
Any new information I haven't got?
"Well, we're never sure."
I have to find the way to touch the hearts of people.
"What does your heart say, sire?"
Carlos?
Mr. Lloyd?
But look at it as well.
It's beautiful.
It comes from the solar storm.
"Sire, there are no flights."
"No, I understand, Carlos."
But we have an escape plan.
Explain yourself.
The Sea Mermaids.
The Sirens of what?
And action.
No action.
Look.
"Sir, please."
Second shot.
"Sire, I can not take the responsibility of this farce."
"I understand, Ludovic."
Now focus on her femininity.
It is madness.
We can not do it.
"- I agree, but it was decided."
"We have no other choice, now or never again."
"But Sire, we can not leave without protocol and security."
"In fact, Sire, it is undeniable that there are dangers."
"The dangers are everywhere, always."
- But Mr. Lloyd will not come with us.
"Mr. Lloyd is the architect of our escape, Louise."
It is very creative.
"- He comes with us, with the camera."
"Seigaku regular, second year student, Kaidou Kaoru."
You'd better not regret.
You will lose.
What did you say.
Well he looks quite cute.
He's really good!
"You alright, senpai?"
Such beautiful spinning ball...
It's my first time seeing something like that.
"Hey, hey, hey, ah Kaidou?"
Who's he playing with?
That must be the transfer student Ryuzaki-sensei was talking about.
"Heh, you can even spin the ball into such an angle."
Snake shot.
Game Kaidou.
One love.
Court change.
So it'll be like this.
"If it continues like this, he will..."
My reaction is getting slower.
I can't be losing to this chibi?
This is a match of perseverance.
I won't lose.
Heh...
This person even knows the Snake.
"That is a Buggy Whip shot, right."
It's quite difficult to use since this is my first time trying it.
First time?
"Senpai, you sure are sweating a lot."
You'll wet that uniform.
The weather's so hot yet you're dressed so weirdly.
It's not over.
"""This ain't no beach or park."" ""l'm resting! "" l said."
"They pull me in, they start giving me all kinds of questions."
"You know, this and that."
"""What are you going to tell us, tough guy?"" l says, ""My usual."
Zero.
"Nothing."""
"""Why tell you?"" The fuck."
"He says, ""No, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy."""
"I said, ""All right, I'll tell ya something, go fuck your mother."""
"You saw the paper, Anthony."
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
This big prick again.
"He says, ""What do you want to tell me now, tough guy?"""
"I said, ""Bing, what are you doing here?"
"I thought I told you to go fuck your mother."""
I thought he was gonna shit.
The fuckers.
"Me, I wish I was big just once."
Funny.
You're really funny.
"What do you mean, I'm funny?"
"It's funny, you know. lt's a good story."
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
"It's just, you know."
You're just funny.
"You know, the way you tell the story and everything."
Funny how?
"I mean, what's funny about it?"
"-Tommy, you got it all wrong."
Not quite sure I get your meaning.
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.
"- It's killing me, literally."
I'm dying.
"- Here, have a cookie."
"No, I'm cool."
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.
We used to sleep together all the time.
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.
"It wasn't all the time, but it happened."
I know I'm not just making this up.
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?
"Honestly, we may not have the best insight."
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
He's right.
The signals are totally different.
"Like, here."
"Here's ""I wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two, three."
"That's it, three seconds or more, it's on."
"And here's ""I don't wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two..."
"- Nope, thanks for playing, move along."
- It's that simple.
- Yes.
Have you got something to tell me?
"Yes, I would advise you to get out of here."
- How many of them were there?
- Eight.
- Too bad that Carrasco wasn't there.
- That girl out there is also one of them.
"- Coronel, I'm in the militia."
- Calm down.
You mustn't get excited.
I know him.
It's true.
He was here before the guerrilleros occupied the hospital.
His name is Gutiérrez.
"- You were lucky, my friend."
"- Yes, but if you hadn't come..."
You're not supposed to talk so much.
Be quiet.
This is José Grenada.
He worked on the dam.
They seem to treat their prisoners quite well.
Did you hear them talk about their leader Carrasco on your way here?
Think carefully.
You must have heard something.
Very well.
I will never tell a bastard like you anything.
Never!
What are you waiting for?
Keep calm.
Don't panic.
Nothing's happened.
What have you done?
The internal bleeding dance!
- I could sure use some help too.
"- You got it, partner!"
- Move!
I want the fat one!
"- They're all fat, Biatch!"
"Say mister, you got any other leads on where I can get some more bullets?"
"The other place got into a crime scene, long story."
"Just do some thinkin' on it, okay?"
Are you expectin' anybody else?
Are you sure?
It might be back up for Donnie's crew.
"Maybe they're supposed to call in, you know, like we do."
Why didn't they just come right in like everybody else has?
"I don't know, who the hell he is, I'm out of bullets again."
I'll get it.
What?
Wait but...
what if Donnie's other guys?
- I know what they'll do.
- I thought you wanted us to kill you.
You jealous?
- Kinda.
- Now take the fire escape.
I'll stall.
Otherwise they're gonna kill us all today after see what happened in here.
Go!
- You should come too!
"- No, no, I shouldn't."
This way I buy you some time.
Go!
Please.
Poor guy.
Anybody told Meuller?
No.
None of the guys wanted to break it to him.
Wait till he hears it.
"Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be Pete."
"For the last time, are you coming in with us or not?"
"I told ya no, and I mean no."
"Oh, you're stir-nuts."
He don't know what he's saying.
"Aw, come on, Frank, get wise to yourself."
"Lay off, Red."
Will you lay off?
Stacey's on the outside.
I'm sure he's working for me.
I'll take my chance that way.
"Tough luck, kid."
[MACHINERY RATTLING]
Jiggers.
"Meuller, you can't beat this joint!"
You have no chance!
Let me go!
"Meuller, why ain't you at work?"
Get back to your machine.
[SPITS]
Get over agin that wall.
I'm gonna bury you in the Hole.
You hear what I told ya?
Get over agin that wall.
So you're the guy that wouldn't let Lassiter go to the hospital?
"I'll put you where he is, if you don't keep away from me."
And you're the guy that made him fall and busted his back!
You're not wearing them?
"Difficult, considering... was it you?"
Earrings?
Tip of the iceberg...
Why tonight?
"Because, to have a fiancé who is 50% shit is too much."
Why me?
Because tonight...
I'm loaded!
"And you, do you know how to weigh or measure love?"
What are you staring at?
Your buttons.
They're all... wrong.
"I mean, you're beautiful."
Takes a lot of work.
"Courtesans yes, maids no!"
- Got a taste for it?
- Haven't we eaten?
- Was it you?
"- No, it's me."
Then strip.
"So, are you disturbing the peace?"
It's only André.
on the table!
"Time's up, oldtimer!"
You'll never make another omlet from bad eggs then snitch like you did to my father!
"These empire chairs, bit shoddy aren't they?"
Just like all empires!
Anybody moves and he gets it deeper.
You little punk!
I'll crush you as I...
"You started living the high life too soon, Joseph Venom."
On the contrary.
Come with me.
We will take the air in the garden.
I'm taking care of her.
We woke up painful memories to you.
You are very alone in this house.
Don't you have relatives?
No.
Friends?
"I'm here, now."
I am very careful.
Attentive to your eyes.
My eyes?
"Yes, they are so young, so clear."
"And yet, I guess all they have seen recently that they should not have seen."
Smile at me.
I am convinced you will soon find your brother.
Believe me.
"What can I say, Sir?"
Your words are helping me in an unexpected way.
Probably you already suffered greatly in your own flesh.
The suffering of others can not but interest a man like me.
Your dedication affects me greatly.
"It is limitless, know it."
"Nanteuil, we will take our leave."
"Don't bother to lead us out, Miss."
We'll let you know soon.
"Goodbye, sir."
Goodbye.
Count on me.
And good luck.
He is ...well...
You're spending millions on him.
- Cunning!
He's using Jai
Jai knows where he's headed.
"He's focussed, he's ambitious"
What do you want to do with your life?
What I want to do?
I want to beat you
"For me, that will be a happy day."
- Don't get sentimental
Who can beat you?
"My loan, please."
Get lost
You won't marry me without a dowry?
Goodness!
Help me... someone help
What's going on?
- Let's take a look
She's the one who fooled Om
"Watch, I'll give her a taste of fun!"
Right at the wedding altar!
How dare you ask for dowry?
"What happened, lady?"
I had To run away from my wedding
My fiance's father is greedy!
"At the eleventh hour, he demanded a million from my father!"
"No, only 800,000 800,000...?"
"- Okay, 400,000 will do"
"And the sad part is, he kept mum"
"Don't cry, come with me."
Oh no... no...
Come with me.
- Attaboy.
- When we got married... it was supposed to be for better or worse.
"Only I gave the better, and you gave the worse."
What are you gonna do about it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it.
Laverne!
I'm washing my hands of both of you!
You're rotten to the core!
You deserve each other!
"Sign it ""John Hancock."" It's my Declaration of Independence."
Okay!
That's wonderful.
At last you're a free man.
- You got your whole life ahead of you.
- I'm a free man!
- Right.
- I'm also an idiot.
- What do you mean?
"- There's just one hitch, and it lasts six years."
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I went to the colonel and had him swear me in.
"You mean, after all he said..."
Colonel Potter swore you in anyway?
"Yeah, yeah."
He even welcomed me aboard.
"Oh, I'm so stupid!"
What have I done?
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be all right.
You just relax and let hotter heads prevail.
I don't believe this.
- Chopin will provide an accompaniment.
- Delighted.
We'll play the parts and you will enjoy this tribute from your grateful geniuses.
The style's a bit precious.
Do you mind if I rewrite it?
- Not at all.
We'll have a horse sent in.
- (MARIE GIGGLES)
What is the subject of your play?
- Noah and the flood.
- (LAUGHS) How appropriate!
GEORGE:
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never end?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
I hate those things.
Can I see that?
You don't remember them because you didn't write them!
I can't remember them because they're shit!
(ARGUING)
"Ah, children."
You are wanted in the theatre.
Now!
There you are!
You must hurry.
Hurry up!
Get into your costumes!
I am as excited as if it were an opening night at the Comedie Francaise.
- You rode over in all this rain!
- A new play!
This is a real treat!
"In all of them, you attack him first."
But I had to!
He's a psychopath!
"- I killed him, and..."
- Go on.
"I mean, not him, but it's hard to explain."
That man is going to attack me again!
"I don't mean to offend you or make you uncomfortable, but, oh,"
- do you know what a nigga moment is?
- Of course.
"Thank God for them, or I wouldn't have a job."
"But an n-word moment, as you put it, does not excuse you from obeying the law."
"So if this is an n-word moment, Mr. Freeman, my advice is, do not be an n-word."
"Oh, hi, guys."
What are you doing up?
"I, uh, got into a little fender bender."
"I'm okay... just a little, uh..."
"Granddad, you got your ass beat again!"
"I mean, anybody can lose once or twice, but granddad stay losing!"
What?
!
You know what happened?
!
Do we know what happened?
!
Everybody knows what happened!
I caught the last half of it on the live stream!
"Oh, no!"
Why me?
!
Why?
!
And your... pathetic tantrums threaten us all.
Hmm?
This is not me accepting.
This room here on the left will be your room.
"On the right, take note, is the bathroom, if you need to wee-wee or something else."
"Now, this here is your room."
Isn't that fantastic?
I think there is a game of Buckaroo downstairs.
One of the other guests must have left it behind.
- Bucka-fucking-roo?
- Yes.
It's a fantastic game for two to eight players.
"Oh, for... forget it."
I was just trying to think of things to keep you occupied.
I can keep myself occupied.
"Oh, God, you're a teenage boy."
Of course you can.
- Hello!
- Shit a brick!
Don't you knock?
"Oh, no, I don't have to."
Being dead has some perks.
Not with me.
I don't want ghosts popping up all over the place.
It freaks me out.
You're a 46-year-old vampire who dresses like a child.
Don't call her freaky.
Up.
"Anyway, just, er... came to see how you boys are getting on."
Uh.
Badly.
Ah.
Doesn't chemistry mean anything?
"Try to understand, please."
- Relax!
- I'll kill her.
Move...
Move...
Stay there.
I swear I'm going to kill her.
"What have you done, Shiv?"
He will kill you.
"Wait, did you kidnap me or did I kidnap you?"
I don't understand.
- Oh my!
- What happened?
Uncle and auntie.
- What?
"- Hello, uncle."
"I seek your blessings, aunty."
How are you doing?
Did you see what she was about to do?
"Ultimately, I had to explain it to her that she cannot marry him."
"And auntie, after using my body, how could she..."
"Don't be stupid, Shiv."
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Just a second, aunty."
You didn't jump into the pool but you jumped into the sea!
You know you are the first heroine..
..to go and plank herself in the villain's den?
And I am looking for you like a hero turned monkey...
And that b**tard is coming after my tail with a match in his hand.
Shiv...
You can't smoke here.
Did she talk to you that day?
Yes.
"Or rather, I talked."
About what?
My own business.
Did she mention me?
"To be honest, Lydia hadn't mentioned you in a long time."
This is all my fault.
No.
It was my fault.
This song gave me goose bumps.
"Marco, I've always wanted to ask you."
"Why did you cry the night I met you, after you killed the snake?"
It brought back a lot of memories.
What memories?
"Years ago, I had to kill another snake."
We were in Africa.
She had the same phobia as you.
"She was waiting outside the tent, terrified,"
"defenseless, and totally naked."
She saw the snake while we were sleeping.
Was she the one for whom you slept on the couch?
I hate that woman.
- I haven't seen her in years.
- Even worse.
What can I do to make you forget her?
Exactly what you're doing.
You were fast asleep so we didn't wake you.
Is Dr.Vega here?
He'll be in his office.
I saw him arrive.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Do you want to go get a drink?
"- No, I'd better not."
- Want to grab a bite to eat?
"- No, I'm not hungry."
- Want me to take you home?
- Okay.
"- Good to see you, Henry."
"- But Greg, you said..."
"Bye, Henry."
"- Candy, don't leave."
- That was great.
I thought you were gonna stay.
"Well, we're done."
Is my shoe here?
"Well, Candy, I still have feelings for you."
But I dumped you for another man.
How could you still have feelings for me?
"- Besides, I'm still sort of with Paul."
- I thought that was over.
"Well, he was cheating on me."
I guess I wanted to feel better about myself before I see him tomorrow night.
That's why you're here?
"Well, yeah."
"Look, you were always such a nice guy, but let's face it, we have nothing in common except sex and the fact that you idolize me."
I really do care for you.
Really.
I just can't wind up with you.
Can I call you sometime?
What for?
"- Rose, are you going, or what?"
That's the reason why they hate me.
Petreius:
Why do you stay with me?
Why don't you simply leave me to my solitude?
"Because I love you, like my own son."
You love me?
Like your son?
"I love you, too!"
Where are you?
I can live with the election of Claudius Tiberius but he must restore all our privileges.
Don't worry.
Claudius will do anything we want.
But we still didn't solve one problem:...
Who is going to kill Caligula?
And how will it happen?
I'll take care of this problem.
I know who is going to kill Caligula.
Who will kill that monster!
Checkmate.
What news of marathon?
Will Greece be saved?
The Persian sun will pass.
my brave heart.
"Stop it, Daddy, stop it."
"Hey, Dad, come on upstairs and we can play my new electronic game I bought."
"Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy."
"Oh, come on."
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?
"- Well, I just don't."
mom could play with us.
All right.
Do your ears.
One at a time.
"Okay, bend your heads over, shake them out with your fingers."
Put your hands above your head.
Hands out in front of you.
Over.
Move those fingers.
Reach down and lift up your nut sack.
"Drop your nut sacks, and skin back your dick."
Turn around.
"One foot at a time, pick it up and wiggle the toes."
Other foot.
"Bend over, grab your ass, spread your cheeks and give me two good coughs."
(MEN COUGHING)
Stand right there.
julie:
You're like two people.
Inmate Montoya Santana?
One is like a kid.
Doesn't know how to dance.
Step this way.
Doesn't know how to make love.
That's the one I cared about.
Step inside.
But the other one...
The other one I hate.
"Τhe one who knows, the one who has his rap down, who knows how to run drugs."
Who kills people!
SANΤANA:
"Until now, I would've thought it a sign of weakness to even listen to what you said to me that night."
But I see that you were right.
Eh?
Aw!
Christ!
A dead sheep?
Hm.
Not strictly Russian ?
", but certainly can't live on crusts and straps."
So I'm going to roll it up and make him some bowl.
Lucky fellow.
"Well perhaps your sister would like to start feeding me too, unless of course you actually found me some work."
So.
Baker's outlined for the Dunkirk film.
You read it?
It rattles along better rather than one might've expected.
Johnnie's escaped from the steel thrust of the German war machine.
The rescue of the dog...
Here boy!
Here!
No.
"No, no, no."
Not you Ceres.
Because it all depends on who they are planning to cast as Rose.
Uncle Frank.
A shipwreck of a man.
Sad!
Six times looks older.
"Your role is not to be snared at, Ambrose."
"Gratuitous, experience, maturity."
We all have a part to play in defeating Hitler.
Not this part.
It's a corpse role!
He's dead before the end of act 3.
"All tourists, all registered with that stupid odd jobs app."
"Oh, yeah?"
Wow.
"God, that's crazy."
"Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you, it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper."
"Okay, okay."
Alright.
"- Well, if your story's true..."
- Cooper.
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?
How'd you know where I am?
"It's a games company, I looked up the address."
"Yeah, really?"
"No, no, no, no."
How'd you find me here?
This place.
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?
"Yeah, with your GPS on your phone."
Find My Friends.
Find My Friends?
"That would've worked, but they took my phone."
"And it's in a building, like, a mile away."
"So, yeah, nice try."
That's right.
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity that!
"Look, all I'm saying is that"
"I think that you could've come up with a better story, it could have been funny or..."
"Okay, alright, don't be pissed."
Do you ever wonder how your bank account got hacked?
So you admit it's me.
Just tell me what you have.
The dead whiz kids... they all had one more thing in common other than their talents.
Otto.
He found a pattern.
They all applied to Seattle State University.
Kevin Whitfield apply?
Just like all the others.
You gonna talk to their admissions officer?
- Yeah.
I am.
- Good.
Take me with you.
The only other person that knows as much about this case as you is me.
"You came to me once, for help."
"I saw where it was going, I told you to drop it."
"And you did, and I just..."
Watched that eat away at you.
I was there.
I know it's you.
But if I say it out loud it means I'm either crazy or it's true.
You just said it out loud.
[Sighs shakil]
"Gracie and Helen, you don't tell them."
I do when it's time.
"Let's solve this case, Duval."
"When we get there, I do the questioning."
You don't talk.
They were so rare.
Each of them.
I remember some of their essays.
Who could want to take these lives?
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
Hey!
How about a drink for you and your men?
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
"Listen, ""Herr Mac""."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
Freulein Ravenwood.
Let me show you what I am used to.
Nick!
Take your lousy hands off!
wait..
I.. can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that...wait..
I'll tell you everything.
Yes.
I know you will.
Let here go!
...Whiskey?
"Shoot them, Shoot them both."
My medallion!
"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
"Boy, you're something!"
Yeah?
I'll tell you what.
"Until I get back my five thousand dollars, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
I'm your goddamn partner!
What good is your word?
What's he gonna do now?
He's lost everything he had.
"No great amount of money, Patricia."
"Oh, it isn't the money, father."
He had dreams.
"They're gone, perhaps... perhaps even his faith in himself."
- Everything.
- But the boys is young.
I'll think of something.
- I'll find a way to help him.
"- Oh, don't talk to me."
I don't wanna hear any more alibis.
I don't wanna see you.
"Oh, I didn't mean that."
I don't know what I mean.
"Well, I understand."
I-I have failed you.
- But if I could make amends..
"- Oh, what could you do?"
I might be able to arrange backing.
So he could go on with his production.
"Father, where would you get any money?"
I'll get it... someplace.
[ship horn blowing]
"Jason, when is the captain going to marry her?"
As soon as we're upon the high seas.
- You have the license?
- Right here in my pocket.
"Though I understand, we won't need it."
"While we are waiting, couldn't we go some place and snuggle?"
Snuggle?
What do you think?
"I think that before we get there, the victim will be up and gone."
"No, I beg of you, give her the medication."
They're painkillers.
"Two tablets in the morning and two at night, dissolved in water."
You said two in the morning and two at night?
Yes.
"When you go to the chemist's, you have to be very determined or they won't give you everything."
is it hard to come by?
That's not the issue.
Chemists are like that.
"She's suffering, poor thing."
We can't do anything.
Let her take this and sleep.
"Doctor, what's wrong with her?"
"Oh, excuse me a second."
Speak louder. it's windy.
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.
How do you know?
"I said, how do you know?"
I can't hear.
Speak louder.
We were cut off.
"You were saying, doctor..."
What's wrong with her?
"Nothing, she's just old and weak."
She's just a bag of bones and she's not very well at all.
Old age is a terrible illness.
"Yes, but there are worse illnesses."
Death...
- Death?
No.
- I don't want it then.
- You bought it fair and square.
"But you said it was mouth painted, when really it was hand painted..."
- Calm down.
- Please get him out.
- I want my money back.
"- No, let's go."
Oh yes!
I'll just take your blanket then.
"- Frank, everyone's napping."
- Off we go.
- What's this?
- The mouth painter's blanket.
"- It's a bedspread, Frank."
- Why are you taking her blanket?
- Anything this thick is a blanket.
- It's too coarse to be a blanket.
- There's a bedspread and a blanket.
- Give me back my blanket.
- I need something to bargain with.
"- Look, I'll give you 1,000 for this."
"- Come on, she's a pensioner..."
- It's a matter of principle.
What an old con artist.
The nerve!
"We're helping a brain dead woman, all focused on that,   and old Granny Grab-All is just waiting for some sucker."
- She's just an old woman.
- I'm going to call my lawyer.
- Isn't that a bit extreme?
- Not the slightest.
Fraud is a legal matter.
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.
[BEN CLAPPING]
Great class.
We ran into each other.
You came to my class.
I had no idea this was your class.
You called to ask me if this was my class.
"No, you never called back."
Because you told me not to call you if it was my class.
It was.
- No.
We just ran into each other.
- Okay.
We're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
BEN:
Exactly.
Do you want a swim?
Sure.
"You know, I was just thinking why can't we be friends?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?"
"I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?"
I hear you.
I mean am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
Right.
Or has an insane smile?
Or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
[BEN CHUCKLES]
"- Did you just say ""dry hump""?"
- Yeah.
BEN:
Where's that smile for the crowd?
- Beautiful.
- Use your arms.
Steady waist.
She has a knack for it.
She got it from you.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Gather round for the extraordinary debut of the world's youngest tightrope walker.
Maria!
Please talk to them Barbuda.
"Forget it, Foguinho."
No time for changes now.
The act hasn't been announced yet.
- But we're set on it.
- You can change your minds.
"Can't you see the place is packed, Barbuda?"
They're all here to see our act.
"Come on, Marcelo."
- He can't make you do this.
"- Don't go, Marcia."
- Is Maria in this?
"- Of course not, she's out."
"It's time, Marcelo."
"We'll be watching from the front row, okay?"
Come on.
I'll never leave the circus again.
I'll be with you.
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls."
Keep your hearts in check.
"At last, we have come to our finest attraction."
The incredible tightrope walker couple:
Marcia and Marcelo!
It's better to sell them than to eat them.
You're a degenerate.
All of Naples is degenerate.
Why did you bring me here?
So I can feel as degenerate as you?
We didn't start this war.
We don't sell our bodies for a pack of cigarettes.
A pack of cigarettes?
"Maam, what will you give me for that?"
Right.
With this and a pack of cigarretes I can get bread... for a large family.
Would you like some maam?
- Here
- Thank you.
- I brought you here because...
- Because everyone can be cruel.
- Are we even now?
- Yes.
- Do you need anything else from me?
"- No, no."
Jimmy?
What did I do to you?
It's not my fault if things didn't go well for you today.
"What's wrong with you, Jimmy?"
- Here.
- What's that?
Try it.
"Here, like this."
Are you crazy?
I already have hair.
Did you bring this filthy thing from the US?
"No, not at all."
"I have something to show you,"
"I just don't know if you'll be able to handle it, that's all."
I'm fed up with your mysteries.
I'm tired.
"Nathan, it'll take five minutes of your time, no more."
And then I'm out of here.
You'll never see me again.
I give you my word.
- You give me your word?
- Yes.
I give you my word.
"You know who I am, you know where I work, you're a lawyer."
"If I do anything wrong, anything at all which..."
It wouldn't take you five minutes to blow my career out of the water.
"Nathan, believe me, it's important."
You have to see it.
I swear.
It's important.
Come with me.
Five minutes.
10 minutes... no more.
And then...
I'm gone.
You brought me here just to tell me this?
What the hell does it mean?
Or is that all part of the message?
You come out with these little riddles of yours and expect me to...
"You see that guy, the kid in the orange jacket?"
Do you see him?
"Yeah, I see him."
So what?
Name of Dennis.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be in...
The End.
That wasn't me!
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ha ha.
Ask anyone!
"Okay, then."
Why don't we start by asking...
your conscience!
Aah!
"Uh, now who's cheatin'?"
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Yeah, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man, that was an accident."
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that!
- Is it?
"Okay, okay."
That's... that's just the wind.
Donkey!
"And apparently, it knows my name!"
Or we get lost seriously the great feast of the white city.
You are the only ...
And you have not done anything ...
Leon?
It is the prince of the idiots!
"I had to do it during his sleep, but thou hast thou awakened."
I wrapped the blade in the silk but she does not suffer.
"Courage, come."
Want to finish?
"- Marie, I love her."
- And to me ...
- Do you love me?
"- Yes, certainly."
Right.
He told me that no other he love like me.
And then I said that was not important.
"My father, my mother, you ..."
"I'amore ... the same foot, the same toes,"
Ie the same footsteps.
The footsteps are dependent on the soles.
The mud without trace.
It's me.
"You have the cold, six warm,"
"six warm burn,"
kill.
I want to finish now?
Do not make the idiot.
"Take off your shoes, so think that we are no longer here."
Do not give to anyone.
"No, it's mine."
If we had done God we would have made ... otherwise.
Mickey!
- I'm gonna cut.
- Prep the area.
Here we go...
Tube!
We have an airway.
"I was looking for rings, trying to butter up her parents."
"I just called them, by the way."
They're going to be here in the morning.
Hard to imagine.
Losing your partner like that.
Yeah.
"So, Dallas."
It's a great opportunity.
You got all kinds of opportunities here.
- A state of the art facility.
"- Come on, you're a surgeon."
All you need is a sharp knife and some thread.
"""State of the art""!"
You're not going there for any opportunity.
- You're following a fella.
- I'm not following a...
Peter and I are going together.
Whatever gets you through the night.
"You know, she..."
She told me in the doorway of a Portuguese bakery in Montreal.
She was in love with a woman.
"And she was happy, you know?"
"I mean she was crying when she told me, but she was happy."
"Took a lot of guts, falling in love like that."
You guys stayed friends?
"Yeah, mostly."
Mostly.
"No, thank you."
"You don't want to touch the consecrated objects, do you?"
"Step back, please."
The train is about to leave.
Come on.
- I've calculated ten minutes to the refinery.
- Excellent.
I hope the train won't be late.
"All right, my dear chaplain."
Let's go.
"Hey, Padre Julio!"
How long have you been back?
What a surprise!
Are you going to keep us company?
Tell us a funny story.
- Will this wagon blow up as well?
"- Well, the bomb is close to it."
"Come on, we're about to leave."
I'm really glad to see you again.
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, and you?"
"- Same old, same old."
- Take my hand.
- This is Padre Alonso.
- Pleased to meet you.
Why don't you sit down?
What happened to Padre Aginaldo?
The poor chap has appendicitis.
We had him taken to Puerto Silas.
That's why the bishop sent Padre Alonso.
- I'm going with him to show him the area.
- I'm sorry to hear about Padre Aginaldo.
"Oh, the police station said he would be here."
You've just missed him.
Oh.
Are you OK?
"Um, maybe you could help."
"Um, do you think we could talk inside?"
Sure.
It might be nothing.
We had this guy hanging around the garden centre.
"Elly, our receptionist, saw him across the road two days before Henry Elliot was killed."
Did you confront him?
"To be honest, um, I was afraid."
"Ah, I know him."
"He's this guy I was at college with, we did the same philosophy course."
This bloke called Paul Fordyce.
Paul Fordyce?
Yes.
Do you know him?
The police are already questioning him.
"What, in connection with these murders?"
"I thought he was weird, but not a killer."
I can't talk about the case.
You'll have to talk to the police.
You don't think he's after me?
"Well, I don't know."
"Ah, can you think of any reason why he might be?"
No!
"Ah, I, I hope not."
I haven't seen him since college.
I didn't have you down as an academic.
"No, I, I'm not."
Which is why I left.
This is hard.
It doesn't have to be.
I just think the most important thing for you is going to be let him do the talking.
Right.
"Okay, you're right."
I got it.
I got it this time.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me.
That was better.
I am not cut out for this one-night stand thing.
It's not for everybody.
"I mean, I know it seems silly to you, Matthew, but I just wish somebody would notice me."
"Not as a mom or as a carpool captain, but as a woman."
Do you know how long it took me to do this to my hair?
A minute?
No.
"A long, long time."
"God, this is impossible."
"Come on, let's get out of here."
I'm never going to meet anybody in a grocery store.
"You met someone, didn't you?"
"Yeah, we had a moment over by the goat milk."
I think she's into me.
I'll see you at home.
Are you done with that cart?
"Hey, knock yourself out."
Wow.
"I don't want to embarrass you, but your hair is really pretty."
It must take you a long time to make it do that.
You're in a good mood.
"So once a week, I can have BBQ with my brother."
"Or order a large pizza, or have raw fish."
He's so happy.
I have the dates.
"Yesterday, Mother and Hyang Gi's mother got the dates somewhere."
-When is it?
-Last Saturday of next month.
At Hyang Gi's pension.
Ok.
I would be lying if I say congratulations.
I won't congratulate you.
So today was our break up day.
That's too bad.
"Had I known, I wouldn't have gotten lost."
I wasted all that time.
I see why you got angry.
I knew something was wrong.
I practiced this moment way too many times in my bed.
I guess practicing helps.
You told me that we won't be able to get past this fall.
It's ok.
It's much better than I thought it would be.
"It's like, ""It's finally come."" Something like that?"
Good for you.
You're so ok.
I told you that I practiced.
Don't smile.
I don't want to see you smile.
You want me to cry?
"No, no, I can't do that."
You want me to cry my eyeballs out?
And maybe faint?
"Well, he needs me."
You have your law and...
I have mine.
"Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can."
You need medical attention.
Take the canoe.
"It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on."
Will you come with us?
"No, I'll stay here and work the mine."
"When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found."
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
"Would you, Buck?"
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
"Oh, Jack, put your arms around me."
"Well, I'll be seeing you."
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids.
After that it's clear sailing.
"Good-bye, Thornton."
And God bless you.
"Good-bye, Blake."
"Good-bye, Jack."
"Good-bye, Claire."
"It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?"
"It's all right, boy."
Yeah Sir?
"I am going to tease her, you beat me."
With hand or with leg?
With leg.
With left or with right leg?
Whatever just beat me!
Whatever just beat me!
"With both leg, or i will kill you i am going to tease her."
Coming?
My room or yours?
What?
"Hey listen, come!"
"Sorry, i am not that type of person."
Even i m not that type of women.
Don't you have brother or father?
"Why you are showing attitude, see its off season, i will give you 50°/° off."
The girl is teasing Papa.
Come...
someone help!
Come... someone help!
Okay whatever you say i will do.
"Okay whatever you will give me, i will take it."
You don't have manners you are teasing the person who is like your mother?
No... no...
he is not teasing me... beat me hard.
What are you doing he is my customer.
"Why you are not beating me, ., come-on do it."
"Leave him, he is my customer."
Why you are beating him?
He was teasing a women.
Women?
He was teasing a women!
I think it's not a good idea.
-What do you mean?
-Maybe I call you.
But I don't think so.
-You didn't like it?
-I like it very much.
"But, Tony, come on."
"You're a nice guy, but I got my own problems."
I don't want all the time prop you up.
"What, are you fucking kidding me?"
-What you doing?
-I didn't expect you so soon.
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.
Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.
Driven out to deep left field!
"Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!"
See ya!
An opposite-field home run....
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
Have a bite.
"Look out, here he comes!"
Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'II be right down."
"You had to throw it out, didn't you?"
"Of all the junk in here, you had to throw out the one cask of wine to be shot to pieces?"
Well done.

ATHOS:
Cadets!
Time to go!
Grimaud certainly left his mark on you.
"Getting caught unarmed and unawares, doesn't sound like you?"
A mistake I will not make again.
We ride hard.
(CADETS URGING HORSE)
It's eight hours until dark and what is it?
Four shot balls left.
"Eight hours, four shot balls, not the most encouraging number."
"Besides, they're not going to let us live until dark."

- That would just be stupid.
(GUNSHOTS)

- (GUNSHOT) - (MAN GROANS)
Come on.
Come on.

The last thing they're expecting is for one of us to go out that door.
(LAUGHS)
Because that would be suicide.

PORTHOS:
I always know who you are.
It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
Take the pills.
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.
He doesn't listen to me.
I know a damn speciation when I see one.
A what?
a young one.
There are forces trying to kill them.
Forces?
They want help.
forces.
It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
they want you.
that's how fucking stupid they are.
They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty. a long time.
There are no new mutants.
Understand?
Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years.
Not anywhere.
You always thought we were part of God's plan.
But maybe...
Maybe we were God's mistake.
What a disappointment you are.
When I found you you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.
Hooked on barbiturates.
You were an animal.
But we took you in.
I gave you a family.
And they're gone now.
Logan.
"Well, it depends on the size of the bottle and the size of the ship, to be honest."
"The way you have to, you have to force the ship through,"
SHIP through.
Can I use the toilet?
"That's probably not a question for me, right?"
"He's speaking to you, right?"
So...
Of course you can.
I can put shit in a bottle.
"Dermot, what the hell are you doing?"
!
"What do you mean, Dermot?"
!
What?
What's going on here?
!
"Sister, one second."
"Elsie, what are you talking about, don't blow cover yet."
It's time to blow cover.
"You've almost ruined it, you just fell asleep by eating one of those fucking chocolates, you idiot!"
I couldn't help it.
"Do you stand up, or are you going to sit down?"
I'll stand up.
"OK, ready?"
Let's blow this case wide open.
I've lost all control of my body.
"I'm so sorry, Elsie's had a..."
"It's all right, like, why is she calling you Dermot, right?"
"Well, what happened, she's, like I say, she's not..."
"Well, I'm no woman!"
What?
"I'm DI Sleet, from..."
"If it's one of your games, I want it to stop."
Stop being paranoid.
You don't have to be poor to have good intentions.
There are people with money and ideals.
- Really?
I'd like to meet one.
"- Hello, Jacob."
Give me a break.
You never had any ideals.
I could be rude about your ideals and we could go on and on.
- We could go on being rude...
- Then tell me what he wants.
He doesn't care about the orphanage or humanitarian work.
It's bad business.
What does he want?
I don't know what he wants to do with the orphanage and Anna.
"I don't understand it, Jacob."
Then let me ask you a different way:
Do you know something I don't?
"No, Jacob, I know nothing."
That's all I wanted to know.
- May I offer you a cup of coffee?
- No thanks.
- Dare I offer you a glass of wine?
- Only if you've got enough.
Right.
Dare I ask how you've been?
The last twenty years?
They've been a bit up and down.
And you?
I've been fine.
Also a bit hectic.
Absurd?
"The spirits of my ancestors are with me always, Sam."
Are you calling them absurd?
"No, absolutely not, sir."
I meant no disrespect.
It's just...
"Either way, it's bad luck to gamble under the same roof as a restless spirit."
Good-bye.
Let's go.
Mr. Wu?
Wow.
Looks like your ace just folded.
Gotta hand it to Monica.
What?
Even death can't keep that bitch from ruining my life.
"Hey, check that out."
Camera R29.
It keeps flicking on and off.
Maybe it's a monitor problem.
Can you switch the feed?
Yep.
"Nope, looks like it's the camera."
Isn't that about where Monica flew off the...
"What, you think maybe her ghost is trying to communicate with us?"
Like Morse code?
"Short, short, long..."
"That's ""Mike."""
"Short, long, long, long...""Is."""
"""Mike is going to die."""
That's very funny.
"Whoo, yeah."
- Why don't you go check it out?
I want you to go back in the kitchen and stay there till I tell you to come out.
"That way, in case they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
And then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
(PLAYING HARMONICA)
"Byron, is that the road you went down?"
"Look, don't go in there fucking around."
"In and out, you got me?"
Now what do you think I'm going to do?
"Don't worry about it, all right?"
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
(WATER RUNNING)
(CAR APPROACHING)
You got it straight?
You got it straight?
Yeah.
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
"It'll be a few minutes, Ray."
I got to pack my stuff up.
What the hell are you going to pack?
All you had was that little old goddamn purse.
"It won't be long, you all come on in."
Shit.
I'm going to be right back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
"Man, she better not have bought any fucking clothes."
How much she got to pack?
"Come on, come on."
"Be careful, honey, I love you."
Give me that.
Wait for me.
Miss Carrol!
"Hello, kids."
No wonder this school is losing money.
Everybody late every morning.
Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs.
"Yes, and that goes for you girls, too."
"Anybody would think I had nothing else to do, but nothing."
One would.
"Miss Anderson, good morning."
"If you're late again, you'll be fired, too."
That's final.
I have nothing more to say.
That's good.
"- Is that you, Mabel?"
- I don't know.
"Tell me, is it?"
- Kind of sounds like you.
- That's a load off my mind.
I'm never sure these days.
- Did you see a young...
- Visitors make the pupils self-conscious.
"Would you mind waiting a second, please?"
"- That's no if, Gus!"
- Supposed to be pretty good!
He won the intercollegiate a couple years ago?
I never seen a college Joe yet take a belt on the kisser!
!
without phoning his mother!
"He's a good man, but I'll take him!"
I can feel it!
"Linda, pick any wine."
It can even be a wine he knows.
Any wine?
"If you can get one wine right, just one, you win the whole competition."
"In fact, you could pick a wine he had last night."
I'll still know it before he does.
"Ooh, bonus round."
"Whoever says what it is first, wins."
What's the point?
"You can do this, Bobby."
"No, I can't."
"Look at me, Bobby."
I-I can't.
Yes you can.
I have a blindfold on.
"Well, you can do the mystery wine."
"All right, fine."
Pour it.
At least I'll get drunk-ish.
"That's it, Bobby."
"Hey, look what's coming around the mountain."
The train.
"Just kidding about the mountain, uh, but the train is..."
remember that song?
Uh-oh.
"Guys, she's coming back faster."
This only happens when the train's running behind schedule or this one time when they ran out of rosé and things got weird.
It's starting to look kind of like a real train now.
"Like fast, and dangerous."
We could just get a cab.
"Oh, look, there's Ethan."
He's headed toward the Juice Caboose!
Did you ever see me not backing you up?
I always back you up.
Why do you think I started with these intensive courses?
Ask me why?
I'm telling you I'll make an album for you.
- Really?
"- Of course, it's real."
- Promise?
- I promise.
"Ooh, look who's here."
"Yes, Mert. 3012 Mert."
Rafet.
"Actually, 69 Rafet."
What are we doing here?
"We'll leave, professor."
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you see?
I've been thinking of giving Rafet a nickname for a long time.
"- 69 Rafet is super, professor."
- Give me that camera.
You take this camera and get lost.
Close the door too.
Photo...
What are you doing?
Sinan... the camera...
What do you guys want?
What are you doing here?
"Well, would you believe me if I said we were just passing by?"
What are you doing here?
"We were just checking the inventory here, and I felt hot in the jacket."
"To do, you know, the warehouse is stuffy."
"We, Rafet and I, will be married soon and build a happy house."
I'll just take it between us as who gets who first.
"That's how it's gonna be, then."
There won't be no more cows stolen.
"Not from the Wood River Cattle Company... the Bar-Three Cattle Company, or the Haley Cattle Company."
Consider that my last word on the matter.
"Come on, boys, let's have an auction."
"You know, I got a weird feeling."
"Yo, me too."
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
"That you, Horn?"
You coming in here after me?
Giddap!
Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there.
Come on.
"Let him stop first, then give him slack."
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there.
You got him.
"Yeah, he's a good horse."
You go ahead... ride him around a little bit and tire him out.
Keep his head up.
"If you keep his head up, he ain't gonna buck."
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
"All right, you go ahead and take the rough off of him."
I'll come back after he's quieted down and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm with this horse?
It's like he was a figment of my imagination.
PHILIP:
I'm fairly certain I'm not welcome here.
Ding-ding-ding.
It's late.
I've been sitting here waiting to make a scene for hours.
What do you want?
I'm very lonely.
That's unfortunate.
I don't like teaching creative writing as much as I assumed I would.
"Well, you're a cruel, miserable person, so it makes sense you'd end up in a miserable situation."
What happened to my desk?
That's my bonus desk.
- Nobody at the school likes me.
- Nobody here likes you.
I think I might resign and come home.
(MUMBLING) You don't live here.
You live upstate.
"No, I don't want that to be my home."
It's lonely and sad and the faculty have turned on me.
Boo-hoo!
The last few weeks have been so hard for you.
Whose cat is this?
It's my cat.
- We don't have a cat.
- Apparently I do.
"Oh, look, see?"
There it is.
"Come here, big boy."
This is Gadzookey.
"Gadzookey, meet Philip."
Don't get attached.
"This isn't working, Allan."
"You are always so distant, so concerned with climbing the ladder."
"For us, Syd."
It was always for us.
I believe you.
I do.
"But somewhere along the line, you actually forgot about me."
"I mean, look at us."
We don't even fight with passion anymore.
"The hot and cold I can take, but this numbness in between..."
So does that make this all okay?
"No, it doesn't make it okay."
But don't pretend like I'm the only one with secrets.
Look at your face.
You think I actually believe that was an accident?
"No, I just was trying to get ahead, Syd."
That's all I've ever done.
"Well, maybe trying to get ahead, you just fell behind."
Okay.
I'll go...
I'll go get a hotel.
"Allan, wait..."
"Can I get a J D straight up, please?"
Big night ahead?
Epic.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Can I get another one?
"Preferably in a bigger glass, if you don't mind."
"That's the biggest glass I got, sir."
I guess I'll be keeping you busy then tonight.
If you have the meetings in the evening... nobody wants to come out.
Everybody's just so afraid.
It's a question of what you people really want to do.
Do you want this community or what?
"Ted, I realize that we are the community."
That's right.
Nothing's going to happen until we do what I said.
Are you down with o.p.p.?
You know me.
I really do understand that.
We just can't go around...
Let's cross the street.
Put your hand down.
"- Hey, man."
- You want this?
What for?
I ain't crossing' the street for nobody.
"Leave me alone, Maxine."
"- Dad, come on."
"- Ted, don't be crazy."
- Are you scared?
"- Yeah, I'm scared."
I don't have to prove nothing to nobody.
"I want to see a hero, I'll rent Rambo."
"You go ahead on, then."
We got to get these young people involved in this.
What did I just say?
I said give me the green.
"You lucky that didn't break, old man."
"See you later, old man."
Don't see me later.
"See me now, punk... 'cause I ain't crossin' no street."
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll tryto find out.
See you Saturday.
Did you find out anything?
"Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
"This one time, he didn't want to drink out of my latte."
Oh!
"We're doing a good thing, saving Lana from this scumbag."
"Yeah, but, which one of us is going to save her?"
Now I'm wondering if you're a racist.
"No, come on."
You know what?
"No, we can't do this."
Remember what happened the last time we competed over a girl?
"Okay, first, we need to go to a place that has money."
"Yeah, then we need to go to a place that has pants."
Yeah.
You know what?
You are absolutely right.
"From now on, we will only hit on girls whose boyfriends are not in the hospital."
Yeah.
Classy.
- Is Dr. Lonsdale coming?
"- No, he said you should handle it."
"Okay, well, that's, like, three babies."
That seems like plenty.
"They're quintuplets, doctor."
There's two more.
Are you (Bleep) Kidding me?
This has seen better days.
"Hey, sexy."
We got to talk.
Things are getting out of hand at work.
I delivered quintuplets.
I hope.
"I mean, I didn't really actually count them at the end."
Congratulations!
You can see the different strings unifying the dimensions.
The gravitational infinities canceling each other out.
You see them.
"Right, Dr. Bryar?"
You see them because you have the tools.
Your mind is that tool.
"- He's one of them, Ted."
One of them.
- Shut up!
It's going on too long.
I'm going in.
"And I have to believe that if you put your mind to it, you'll realize that only you can make Leo stop."
You can make him stop by understanding him.
By understanding that he is a liar and he only wants bad things for you.
"- I need to believe that, Dr. Bryar."
"- I said kill him, Ted!"
I had to.
He was going to kill us.
I had to.
God forgive me.
We need an ambulance.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's a little late for all that.
You going to the hospital?
I'm going to ride in with the psychiatrist.
See you over there.
- She going to be all right?
- Yeah.
I think so.
"Gideon, will you tell him that I don't need to go to the hospital?"
Who's the lucky one?
"Let me do it, Hoffy."
You want to go?
No.
I just want to draw.
"Okay, draw."
"Suppose we call this my tag, I'll take him out."
"No volunteers, Price."
I said we're all in on it.
You guys elected me Security.
"The way things have been going I guess I've done a poor job, and I wanna make up for it."
- That asking too much?
- We've all done a poor job-.
I still say this is my tag.
"Any objections, Hoffy?"
"- Any objections, men?"
-Not from me.
- He can have it.
-Who are we to argue with a hero?
"- How about me latching on, Price?"
-Three is a crowd especially if you've got to cut through wire.
Let's have the wire cutters.
- Are the civilian clothes ready?
-Coming up.
Get to work on the trap door.
"What do you say, Hoffy?"
We hit the air-raid trenches then cut out back of Barracks 9.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is.
In the water tank.
Good spot.
They will pay anything to prevent it.
This is the first step towards my becoming
The most powerful man in the world.
"Ids, please."

- Where to?
"- Andy's place, know it?"
"Yeah, sure."
I know where everything is.

- [man] fourth and market.
- That one.
- Hop in.

- [Alfred bleats] - it has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
- What do you think?
What once was good is always good.
Then maybe we should translate in the meantime.
Is that possible?
"What do you mean, possible?"
"I mean, why don't you translate it?"
I need to think about it.
What do you say?
"I said, I'd think about it."
I have to get back to the theater.
I'm sorry this visit was so short.
"Bye, Goni."
- Bye.
I don't believe a word you say.
What?
You think I'll never get out of here.
So you come with this gesture of yours.
You just came to insult me.
"- Yitzhak, don't be ridiculous."
You liar!
Just like the last time.
"Daddy, calm down."
Drink.
Drink.
I brought your licorice.
I don't want licorice and any chocolate from that snake.
He's doing it because he feels bad.
- He feels fine.
"You're acting like an idiot, but do as you like."
"You cried in the middle of the play when I got beaten in ""The Fiddle""."
So what?
You were four and you were howling.
The cast stopped the play until Mommy took you backstage so you'd see I was okay.
You're the murderer the whole empire is out looking for!
"Well, then."
I will go and prepare your dinner now.
The count was really depressed.
Do you suppose he feels responsible?
Is this really a good idea?
Is what?
"Well, the count, he most likely thinks of her as-"
"Yes, he seems to like her!"
And you don't care?

Is there something wrong with that?

Hold on!

I should've minded my own business!

Where are you going?
To find Radu.
You mustn't!
"Out of my way, Terran!"
Why are you so adamant?
!
Eh?
Is there something wrong with me finding Radu and keeping him from assassinating Her Majesty?
!
Your Lordship!
Are you suggesting I want the empress to be assassinated?
!
I'm just...
"I'm just some deplorable, blood-starved monster to you, anyway!"
That's not true!
They never take their eyes off it.
I heard your man telling you it was full of old documents.
"Well, that's not so."
"You see, a lot of documents is a lot of paper."
And paper's heavy.
But they lift that box as if it's as light as a feather... sir.
"Take him out, Tongue."
"- What's French for ""keep out"", Harris?"
"- Défense d'entrer, sir."
Right.

Yea.

Why is that colonel chasing you?
He's chasing you

"No, they're after you."
Why?

Why?
Because that chest is full of papers and the colonel is a great reader?
That's why?

Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.

It doesn't matter.

She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad.
Diane.
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.
what?
what?
Who asked you anything?
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.
what?
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What is this world coming to?
prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
They'll drive Sharon spare.
That's a weed there.
Look.
"She belched there, inside with the telly."
Kimberley asked her if she was gonna have the baby.
I don't know.
"It's hard to believe you can get so much shite... out of only one dog, isn't it?"
- Dessie?
- Huh?
Do you not think we should tell the girls... what Sharon did was wrong?
What?
I don't mean turn them against her or anything...
"Or the baby, remember."
"- Yes, I know that."
But...
- What?
I think we should tell them.
"Without, you know..."
I think we should tell them... that it's better to be married if you're pregnant.
"Jeez, they're a bit young, aren't they?"
"I mean, Lisa, maybe."
You'll need a shears for that.
What were you thinking of telling them?
Do you think we should?
"Whatever you think yourself, Kay."
I'm only their da.
They'll laugh at me.

# All those dreams that were never on view
# We'll reveal
# All we felt that we didn't deserve
# Hand in hand we can summon the nerve
# To feel love
# And give love
# Till those dreams
# Come true
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Ah... #
Can I borrow your phone.
I have to make a call.
"Shit, someone's coming."
"Shit, they're shooting."
No ...
Henning ...
What are you ...
Henning?
Do not tell anyone.
"I'm not gay, you know?"
You heard something that seemed shots?
"No, not really."
I could not hear anything with the helmet.
We were wondering if Henning had not killed.
Four members of Ferrymen were murdered tonight.
"One of them was my informant,"
- ...
I'm arresting you on suspicion
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!
"You do not have to say anything, but if you do not mention..."
Agh!
Help!
(SHRIEKS) Help!
What did I do?
Didn't find any drugs!
"Search me, I don't take drugs."
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?
- (MOBILE BUZZES)
- Can you shut up for one second?
- I'm clean!
I'm clean!
I'm clean!
- Justin.
Did you get a beat on that DNA?
"Er, yeah."
"Cameron Pell, artist."
"Well, failed artist."
A history of mental illness?
No.
The man's got serious issues.
Five years back he was arrested for gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.
"He's burst in wearing a clown mask, slashed a load of paintings with a flensing knife."
"When they tried to throw him out, he's gone completely Tonto."
Cut up two doormen.
Lucky to escape an attempted murder charge.
- Right.
"No, no, no."
"It's...it's just that the caption at the end's going to be, ""He's not listening, but the enemy might be""."
It's a joke for women who think their husbands never pay attention.
"So if you start answering, you know, the captions won't make sense."
I wrote it!
The scenario?
I'll be in my dressing room... if anyone needs me.
Everybody take 10.
Save the lights.
Banished from the set?
What in God's name possessed you?
The actor was ruining the script.
Of course he was!
He is an actor.
What's this?
Penance?
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
"With more free time, I should like to do more work."
I simply don't know what to do.
You good with your hands?
I think so.
Yes.
Have you thought about factory work?
"And the version without the lines, please."
Whatever we used footage for carrots.
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
An appetite like his father!
He's eatin' us out the house.
"James is going to want your attention, too, with his reading."
I'll have him work on it.
You promise.
"Promise me, I mean it."
"They have children, as he is alive."
Children?
You see them years beyond their union?
Yes.
Use this to save yourself.
Tell henry you've had a change of heart.
That you won't stand in the way of their union.
This has gone so far beyond me standing in the way of anything.
I am convicted of adultery!
Of treason!
Mary is with sebastian.
And my son francis...
Has returned to court.
You are brave to come to me with this.
"Because if I can't convince mary to wed francis,"
"If I can't undo your mistakes, I will lose my head."
But not before I watch you burned to death.
I promise you that.
Catherine:
Francis!
Mother.
"Ah, it's true!"
You're back!
"Oh, thank god."
They tell me father's out hunting pheasant
Beyond the south keep.
"I'm going to find him,"
"Get him to see reason,"
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
It wasn't night and we weren't standing.
Hey-oh!
That didn't happen.
You're right.
It didn't.
You just winked.
"No, I didn't."
You just did it again!
"Look, bottom line:"
I need you to proxy bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat."
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
That was you.
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"T-To hook up with a girl,"
I have to connect with her at least a little.
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me with the subject line ""Food for thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
"You didn't tell them what it was about, did you?"
No.
I swear to you I wouldn't tell anyone.
"This is bad, Max."
I got to go.
"Can I have a lemonade, please?"
Shh...
How well do you know your boyfriend?
You all right?
Not so good.
Why won't you let me assign you some protection?
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You must need something or you wouldn't be here.
I need to know if this is Sara's blood.
Where this come from?
"I'll tell you, if it's hers."
How long is it gonna take?
You can use my phone to call your father.
Not right now.
"He's worried sick, Marcy."
You should think about it.
Got a call from Judge Rainer.
He wants to stop by.
No.
"It's not about the confirmation, Senator."
He wants to stop by as a friend.
You think right now I give a damn about Wallace Rainer?
"Jeffrey, that hearing isn't till the day after tomorrow."
If there's something you're not telling me...
All right.
This afternoon.
He's got ten minutes.
How?
The edema affected her brain.
You understanding?
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, even talking to the radio."
You should have called me the minute it happened.
"Regular hospital not gonna put up with adema, so we give her a shot bring her here till the doctors, they fix up her leg."
Then we take her right out.
"2 or 3 months, she's out, good as new."
Miss...
Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Are you a relative?
I'm her brother.
He's her son.
Just a minute.
[Woman sobbing]
"You know, it's funny..."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist now on park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of..."
"You go in, dimmie."
I wait for you outside.
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
I'm so sorry...
"No, no, no."
Come along.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
"Father, I wanna talk."
Let me out.
Goodbye.
Tell me of this Isabel Porter.
- She is weak... timid.
Narcissistically concerned with petty trivialities.
Unable to express her true self.
- And do you wish to return to your life as Isabel?
- No.
I have to forget I was ever such a vapid creature.
- Very good.
You are tabula rasa incarnate.
Do you understand the significance of what we've achieved?
"- Yes, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
- You are ready for your new identity.
"- Hello, good man."
"I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but is Mr. Baxter in?"
- No.
I'm sorry.
He's out.
"Was he expecting you, Mr..."
"- No, sir."
I was in the area and thought I'd call on him.
- My apologies.
Perhaps you could call on him another time?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
"- My sweet, pretty wife."
"Dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?"
- More.
Your Faith doubts you.
- Then God bless you.
"If I trust my employees, it's their duty to uphold my trust."
And not break it.
It's your duty to live up to my trust.
I understand.
It's simple.
"If I take care of people, they should also take care of me."
Of course.
So I guess.
A hand searches for another hand.
I hope you understand what I am saying.
I will see you in the office.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Bye.
"Sir, newspaper is here."
Keep it in the car.
You are the only one that can handle this.
Okay.
The officer was shot several times.
The wounded officer's condition would be serious.
Hello?
We have no money for the restaurant.
We can not meet you.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you back.
Despite the heavy night and morning in Gothenburg -
- The police management There are no comments.
But Police Chief Lena Tornell -
- Holds a press conference about the events.
"Vijay approves 200,000."
- Have you heard anything?
"- No, but anyone knows where he is."
Do you think Brian killed Caleb?
"No, of course not."
But...
I washed it.
What?
Brian's shirt.
There was a lot of blood.
I asked him if it was from the fight.
He wouldn't answer me.
I got scared.
He was acting so crazy.
I didn't know what to do.
I washed it.
I'm so sorry.
Doesn't look good for our shirtless wonder.
"His alibi is definitely shaky, but we also cannot ignore the fact that she washed his bloody shirt."
"- Ah, to be young and in love."
- Huh!
"McGee, any surveillance video from near the crime scene yet?"
"No, but I got something else."
Come here.
"It's about Michael Thomas, and it's not good."
As if Gibbs isn't in a tough enough place with the director.
Turns out that Michael has a record.
As a juvenile.
I got a hit on a charge in Maryland from 1996.
- Records were sealed.
- Come on.
"Let's not panic, okay?"
Kids do stupid stuff.
May not mean anything.
"Well, it depends on the charge."
Next!
"This is Choi Duk-soon, the wife of one Hwang Man-keun of Willowville."
What is her crime?
"Well, if I should explain..."
You slut!
"Your husband is alive and well, and you bump bellies with another man?"
How could you!
Don't just stand there!
Get her husband out of here!
Let go of me!
Let go!
"Hang them, Magistrate!"
They both deserve to be hanged!
"Sir, what should I do?"
Do whatever you want!
You can punish her according to the law or hang her like her husband said!
"Pardon, sir?"
Hustle!
You'll never catch up to the barbarians at this pace!
The Six Camps is no longer the front.
And the front is where warriors belong.
Why am I here like a pathetic fool?
Here you go.
Enjoy your food!
Rice cakes?
"Yes, it's a special treat for our grand opening!"
"Good luck with the business, Innkeeper."
Thank you!
"Wow, something smells good!"
When did this place open up?
I can go for a drink right now.
Why don't we stop in?
"Well, that could be good."
You've always liked art.
"So you'd study graphic design, that sort of thing?"
"Uh, maybe a bit, but..."
"Yeah, uh..."
I think that whatSarah wants to do is to be an artist.
"You know, the, uh..."
"And the thing is, she's good."
"You know, we went to her art class today."
To an art class?
Yeah.
She did this.
"Yeah, it's lovely."
But drawing is... a hobby.
It's not a career.
"Marjorie, don't."
Don't why?
It's true.
How many artists do you know who make a living?
Who aren't forced to waitress or clean houses?
"Mom, there's more to life than money, actually."
I know that's really hard for you to understand.
Sarah.
"Come on, Tom, you agree with me."
"I don't, actually."
It's Sarah's life.
And I don't think that shutting this down is the right thing.
Really?
Since when?
What?
Do you know what your dad told me last night?
"He said it killed him, waking up every morning, knowing that his daughter was living on the streets and throwing away her whole life."
- Indeed.
Magnificent.
I've never liked the smell of books.
"The dust, perhaps."
I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.
I shall have it knocked down to make place for a Grecian temple.
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?
"Too expensive, and we do not need four bedrooms."
We can share.
This one.
Then.
We have only 500 a year.
I'll send out more inquiries today.
"Pardon my intrusion, but I think I have found what you're looking for."
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.
We'll have to enlarge it.
Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.
"Forgive me, do you by any chance have a reliable atlas?"
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.
My sister tells me it is in South America.
No!
"No, she's quite wrong."
I believe it is in Belgium.
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.
"- The Volga, which starts in..."
- In Vladivostok.
And ends in...
- Wimbledon.
News of
The queen's death...
And this.
News from the vatican.
"If this letter confirms sebastian's legitimization,"
It should take away any reservations
"You have about a bastard at your side instead of a king,"
As bash will be king one day.
"If it denies his legitimization,"
How could bash blame you for returning to francis?
I know you think you love them both.
"While that may be true,"
I argue that you love one more.
I am afraid.
Open it.
Now you're free
To go to the man you love.
I can't marry you.
"Yes, you can."
Don't let your mother put ideas in your head
"About my ability to protect you, because I will be king."
We can force the pope's hand.
I know that.
"With me,"
You are free and wild.
"You can be who you are,"
And I will always put you first.
"Please, don't."
Say that you love me.
"Say it to me once, because I know that you do."
"I love you, I do."
Say it.
See you.
Is there anything that you want to do before you go away?
No.
I don't think so.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven."
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
"Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation a but deliver us from evil."
Amen.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Beto, give me a glass of water."
I'm very tired.
"Right away, madam."
I have a surprise for you.
The house is not sold.
"No, it's not that."
But don't worry.
Here's some money.
So you and another person can live comfortably.
I want to thank you for all these years you took care of the house.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Lupe?
Can you come to the house?
Right now.
But come in through the back door because the driver is here and he might see you.
Yes.
Okay.
Hurry!
Here.
"Yeah, my way was hard to find"
Can't sell your soul for peace of mind
I hate these plates.
"Oh, look, honey."
We got a food processor.
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
A blender.
"Took a world of trouble,"
Took a world of tears
Took a long time to get back here
"Hey, it's me."
"I, uh..."
I thought we should talk.
"Well... actually, I..."
I don't know.
Always had more dogs than bones
I could never wear those clothes
It's a dark victory
Told us you were satisfied
But it never came across
"Square one, my slate is clear"
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
It took a world of trouble
It took a world of tears
It took a long time...
I brought my computer.
I thought I'd get some work done while she's napping.
"Oh, she's a big napper."
"You'll have plenty of time, but you have to get her down by 2:00 or else..."
Or else what?
She turns into a monster?
Kinda.
But...
"I see other freelancers, they don't work this hard."
For normal freelance people that is true.
But I feel I can do more.
So why do I... have to be like other normal people?
I think your rash not going away has nothing to do with your job.
Make sure you take the bedtime pill.
I did.
"If you did, you'd be complaining about being sleepy."
Shit!
What do you think?
See!
It's okay.
It's as good as if you did it.
"Actually, Jerd is like you 5-6 years ago."
"People are saying he is Yoon 2, you know?"
So why did you ask me to come?
Wasting my time.
Adidas Japan.
I'll do it!
"Shit doc, I'm sorry."
That was automatic.
Good.
You get to work on an international brand finally.
I know you've been dying for this.
You know how hard it was to land this?
I need your best this time.
What's up with you?
Are you possessed?
"No, I was just thinking if I had anything else to do?"
"If you do, make sure to clear your schedule."
Make sure this is your first priority.
"I knew Paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead."
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me"
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until I can get things straightened out."
Karen!
Fuck!
"- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
- I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
That was worth $60.000!
I need that money!
That's all we got!
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to.
They were going to find it!
- They would have never found it!
"- They would have, I swear to you!"
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
- They would have found it.
"- Why did you do that, Karen?"
"Oh, my God!"
- I had to do it.
"Look, we know that she and the guy"
"Were getting real serious, right?"
"Well, maybe she got jealous about something."
[Mutters with mouth full]
Maybe she had somebody jumping.
Mm-mm.
No.
I don't think she's involved.
RICHARD:
Why not?
"She has a pretty face, sweet smile."
"Look, I don't pretend to know the answers."
I'm just trying to figure out the problem.
I'll tell you one thing though...
I want to know everything there
Is to know about that dog.
[Faint radio chatter]
"Now, tell me how you're doing."
I don't know.
Rotten.
Confused.
There's a whole nightmare going on all around me.
I'm starting to see a doctor.
One of those that Mother went to.
"Is that a good idea, uh, all the memories and all?"
Guess I trust him.
One of the few I really trusted.
OTIS:
I wish we could have some good news for you.
We don't have much of it yet.
Seems like with that boy we're just... any little thing
Will be of help.
And?
"Anselmo said, ""No subway stop no BankExchange."""
- And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner but we need BankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy it's politically expedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
"I'm talking about a 60-story building that will employ 3,000 people."
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George Frank Anselmo's in there.
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
You take that one.
Uh--
"Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc."
"Burbank, CA"
Up your oars!
Jump to it!
Press gang muster on the jetty.
I shall return to Defiant in three hours.
- We'll have the crew ready to serve.
"- Thank you, Mr. Scott-Padget."
Press gang!
Stop him!
Catch him!
Don't let him get away!
- Press gangs are busy tonight.
"- Yes, probably ours."
We're a few men short.
"Well, a few dozen."
Things get worse.
The English sailor's lost his taste for fighting.
Maybe he's lost taste for the conditions in which he fights.
- Must have discipline.
- His Majesty's Navy uses a heavy hand.
"At times, perhaps too heavy."
"Apart from finer feelings, it could be dangerous."
The lower deck's like a prison.
"No freedom, irregular pay, and food that even rats won't touch."
- I speak out of turn.
"- True, every word."
We've enough trouble without provocation.
"Still, that's for the Admiralty to settle."
I just picked up our little man and thought we'd drop by for a visit.
I've been trying to get Fen interested in food.
She shows a passing interest in oatmeal.
- (Fen grunting) - (Murdoch):
Any other changes?
"She's still making the gestures, but I haven't been able to decipher any pattern."
It certainly doesn't match any sign language that I can find.
(Murdoch):
Perhaps it is just random.
- (baby babbling)
"- Hello, Roland."
Am I ignoring you?
(Julia chuckling)
- Oh!
- The nanny says that
- we are to feed him more often.
- Hahaha!
"- He's hardly underfed, William."
"- I agree, but she insists."
There.
No?
"See, you're not even hungry."
(Fen grunting)
"Do you see that, William?"
(Fen grunting)
You like the baby?
- You want to see the baby?
- (Fen grunting)
"I think she's more interested in you, William."
Pa!
- She's speaking.
- Paaa!
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.
Can we be of service?
Chief?
"Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved."
How may I be of service?
Sonny!
"Yes, detective?"
Calvin's fine!
Save me!
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V. I. K. I. ' s prisoner.
I don ' t understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.
That's true.
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.
"Did she, Sonny?"
No.
He said I had to promise.
Promise to do one favor for him.
He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.
He made me swear.
Then he told you to kill him.
He said it was what I was made for.
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.
The first bread crumb.
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.
Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.
"Are you going to arrest me, detective?"
I can go home by myself.
You had beer earlier...
How can I neglect a kid that's been drinking?
I've only had this much alcohol!
Teacher Gil...
Are you naive?
Do you think that was the first time I've had alcohol in my life?
"Anyways, I have no choice but to feel responsible."
"Since you're my student, Kang Gyung Joon."
And...
I'm sorry...
For making you pretend to be my fiance.
And...
Thanks.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Since you found this for me.
And if you're grateful...
Fill this up for me.
This face costs more when I take the bus.
And do something about the clothes too!
I feel like it's going to rip if I flex too hard.
And this back here keeps eating my pants!
You're right...
We can't leave my Yoon Jae like this.
-Let's go.
-To buy clothes?
No.
To Yoon Jae's house to get clothes.
Honey...
Doesn't Yoon Jae seem like he's changed a little?
He doesn't seem to mind his manners...
And he also doesn't seem uncomfortable around us...
It was my mom's.
Isn't she going to miss it?
She died before I was born.
I don't think that's possible.
"She died exactly when I was born, to the minute."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
You can turn around now.
What's this?
Did some rich guy give it to you?
Is it worth a million bucks?
No.
"Oh, did your mom give it to you, and then she died, and that's all you have to remember her by?"
No.
I stole it.
Oh.
T oo bad it's empty.
T oo bad you don't have a guy to put in your locket.
"A guy with a house, a job, a car, credit cards... and a son."
"Yeah, I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work."
"Well, what am I trying to do?"
You want me to go out with your dad.
"No, I don't."
That's good.
I want you to marry my dad.
Let me explain.
I never mix business with pleasure.
I'm not talking about pleasure.
I'm talking about you marrying my dad.
But people like your dad don't marry women like me.
Well...
"I told him what you did, and he didn't mind."
I told the truth.
"Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds."
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
"Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it."
"Don't do it, boss."
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
"I think you make one big mistake, mister."
"But, well, we go outside."
- Thornton's crazy!
"- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!"
- Ten-to-one he can't!
- It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
"- Gee, boss, he can't do it."
He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman.
"Oh, all right."
Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
A hundred yards.!
"still, I am content."
I've seen you at last.
And I am delighted to find you're not a man at all.

"My poor lady, you are a wreck."
I am a resurrected wreck.
Move over.

"Citizen Maurice, the prisoner is ready for execution."
"Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France."
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant!
You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- (gunshot)
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded.
- We'II hold the king as hostage.
We'II shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you.
- My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
(girl) beautiful!
[Man] A penny for your thoughts.
I'm thinking about the - the store we had - about your father.
- Yeah?
- But I don't remember him very well.
I remember you were a little boy... and you printed your name on the sidewalk.
"- Yeah, I did that."
- I remember that.
We used to keep the store open till 12:00 at night.
"Well, that was many, many years ago."
"Well, your father was still doing it."
But he stopped doing it.
He stopped doing that about 10 years before you sold it.
And Goodman or Goldman - What was his name?
He used to come around.
He
- He lost his business.
- I don't know.
- His son broke up his business.
- Hmm.
I don't remember that.
- He used to come every night and talk to your- to your father  [Coughs]
- After we closed the store.
- Yeah?
- They used to sit down and talk.
I don't know who you're talking about.
"- Well, you don't remember."
I remember.
- I don't remember.
"""Goldman"" or ""Goodman"" was his name."
Don't remember that story.
Do you remember working in real estate?
"Oh, yeah."
Booze?
Take off your hand.
"I get you house, a girl for company, and now you want booze..."
What do you think of me?
You look like my boyhood friend who ran away.
Get on to the bike dude.
"Hey dude, this place is so colorful."
Who are these muscleman?
These are bouncers.
Then what about him?
- I am their boss.
- What?
He looks like a baby lizard!
Let's run away before he spits.
Order please.
A light beer for me.
"Sir, what about you?"
"First, get me two large, one lime cordial and some ice cubes."
Quick.
- Will that fill you enough dude?
- I shall order more later.
"- Sir, side dish?"
"-Get me scrambled egg, salted green peas, 75 gm mixture, a pack of Ravi's pickle"
- Sorry sir.
Ravi's pickle is not available in such a big bar?
I can't believe it!
It's such a shame!
"- Grilled chicken, Tandoori chicken, Chilly chicken"
- OK sir.
-You shall order the rest later right?
"-You are absolutely right, dude."
You greedy monster!
- Benvolio!
Welcome.
And with Verona's news?
I do bring news.
It's true.
Then spit it out.
How does my lady?
Is my father well?
How does my Juliet?
"See, I ask it twice."
Then I must answer once... to say the worst.
Her body sleeps among the Capulets... in the great monument that marks their fame.
Juliet is dead?
Only her mortal part.
Her soul lives on in heaven's blessed care.
You know this or you heard a story told?
I saw her laid inside her kindred's vault.
"That done, I came as quick as I could find a horse to bring me."
"Pardon me, cousin... that I come with a tale so full of grief."
And it is so?
Then I must hurry.
Jack!
I beg you give yourself some time.
You must be riven with a savage grief and need a while to calm your raging thoughts.
"Cousin, you're deceived."
I know my mind.
Are there no letters to me from the friar?
"No, my good lord."
No matter.
Go with Jack.
Get fresh water for your horse.
I'll meet you by the city gates.
Neither does this.
Neither does this.

"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.

You volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated.
You need to get back to a child.

Haven't you been taking care of her?
I don't have too much money.
What about all the money that I gave you to hold for me?
I bought all these things.
I haven't been able to sell many of them.
It may interest you to know that some time ago
I heard that mother was starving in a little town called Podesin.
I couldn't get money even for myself.
Where's Zina?
Have you been taking care of her like I asked?
Yes.
"Well, at least I can thank you for that."
You're going to have to sell some of this stuff.
I need the money.
I'm going to marry Zina.
Where is she?
Zina!
They said you were killed in a German camp.
Did Gerry tell you that too?
Yes.
Gerry told me you were dead.
Well...
I'm glad I'm here to dispute that.
I married Gerry.
I'm his wife.
You didn't even have to tell me.
Mother always said that you were the one with brains.
I was the dreamer.
I was the dreamer they took to the Nazi prison.
"I loved you, Zina."

They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for the person controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
I tested it on myself.

What if I'm losing it again?
What happened today?
I got an up-close look into the mind of a man
"I was convinced was a murderer, but all the evidence says otherwise."
Every explanation comes up in his favor.
Maybe he's innocent.
Maybe.
I've always been good at spotting guilt.
Haven't always been good at spotting innocence.
"Hey, hey."
You're not that guy.
"You're home with me, with your daughter."

That's not true.
"The other day, we had that long conversation about stamps."
"About how the price always goes up, but never goes down."
- Did you wanna revisit that?
- You know what I'm talking about.
You and Christine got divorced and it's kind of like we did too.
"But, whatever."
I guess I'm the jerk for even caring.

It was my fault that we were abducted.

"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."

"Jesus enters the temple, it's filled with merchants..."
"He flips the tables over, and says:"
"My house shall be a place of worship, but you've turned it into death pit."
"Okay, you want to attract more guests, right?"
"Generally, yes."
But who would want to come here?
Let me worry about that for now.
Do you two need a priest now or what?

Where did you go so I can take her somewhere else?
Last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me.
Exactly.
Wait.
What do you mean?
You want your relationship to stand on its own.
-Right.
"-Well, that's what I meant."
Okay. I thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her.
"Alan, I would never do that."
"Well, thank you."
I don't have to.

No.
"Because if you did, you could eat the toast."

"Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later."
Where you going?
-Out for dinner.
-With who?
"Jake, look, I think-- l think you're old enough to know that your dad's not just a dad."
What does that mean?
"Okay, we need to get you to a doctor right now and get that thing checked out."
I'm not going to a doctor for a cat scratch.
"Listen, your life could be in danger."
That's ridiculous.
- Juliette.
- I'm tired of this.
You don't understand what she is.
What?
"What is she, Nick?"
"She's an attractive, successful woman."
You saved her life once.
I don't know what it is you have against her now.
What is it that you're not telling me?
Do you have some kind of relationship with her?
- No.
- Then what is it?
"She's a witch, okay?"
"You're going to need to try a little harder, Nick."
What?
Does she ride a broom?
Because I distinctly remember her getting into a BMW.
"You don't know what's going on here, Juliette."
Then isn't it about time you tell me?
You're going to the doctor.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor till you tell me why you're acting so crazy."

Okay.

"Yeah, the truth would be nice."

"Poverty, pain, sorrow and troubles."

It's called a car.
It is the most numerous creature on the planet.
A car is used for moving from place to place.
The meaning of this moving is unknown.
"A car is noisy, comfortable... and gives off an intensive stench."
"Despite this, people live in perfect harmony with this creature."
They remove various obstacles from it's path... and build for it huge structures which are called highways.

There will be no more true revolution.
"Now do not you move more, understand?"
Sorveglialo.
Save me ... take me ... where you want ... where you want ... where you want ...

"Dear asshole, have you unlocked the safe?"
How brave of you!
No.
But why?
Are they doing this to spite him?
Could be.
Why?
Maybe they don't want him to be strong.
I'll tell him he has to be strong.
I'll hide in there and they won't find me and I'll spend Saturday with him.
"No, we won't go in now."
"We brought him his things, we'll give it to the guard at the entrance."
I want the guard to tell Daddy that I came to see him and to give him a kiss.
I'll write him a note.
"You're the witch and I'm the prince, okay?"
The princess too.
"You're the princess too, okay."
"No, you're the prince and princess, I'm the witch and all the guards."
Then the prince came.
"- Look, look."
"Hi, Alex."
I can't get a hold of you.
"I left you messages at the theater and at home, you haven't called me back, so I'm trying again."
Please call me back.
It's Ora.
Thank you.
"So, my child?"
I know what you're going through.
It's as if we're losing the ground beneath us.
Dear God.
Do you need money?
"There, there."
"Dinner is ready, and stop with your secrets."
"You're not alone, so stop whispering."
what?
What the fuck?
That's my car!
Stop!
Stop the car!
"Stop, you bastard!"
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Stop!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Let me go!
Over there he should be in the car
Hey!
There!
"an unidentified man has been arrested in connection with the recent ritual murder of a local high school honor student The suspect is hospitalized in critical condition with severe, self-inflicted acid burns over his face and torso making it impossible so far for authorities to determine his identity..."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States:"
Ronald Reagan!
Excuse me!
I'm looking for my father.
Is he a patient here...?
Yeah...
They... brought him in The police did.
...Oh...
I see...
Do you know where he is...?
"He's... he's on the tenth floor, sweetie..."
But it's restricted...
"- why don't I call them, tell them you're here..?"
"- Oh, no -- that's okay..."
Lift to the side of the arm.
"Bend your knee, exert force using the waist, thus lowering the center of gravity."
"Try again, okay?"
Hey.
Can't you be more gentle?
Practicing on it now.
Where exactly are you looking at?
Acting in such a perverted manner.
Pervert?
I'm really speechless.
"I'll see you on Thanksgiving, you set a date."
Tell me honestly...
"It's your first kiss, right?"
What did you say?
Are you not speaking formally anymore?
"Listening to the President's introduction, it seems you're younger than me."
Instructors should teach students to be honorable.
But it did not work.
Dr. Lee.
I'm not sure...
"You saw it, right?"
Completely defeated.
What defeated?
She fell on her own account.
She tripped that's why she fell.
I thought you flipped her.
Come don't pretend you're in pain.
Hurry get up.
I'm not pretending to be in pain.
Dr. Lee.
"At that time, that woman."
Where is she?
It's said!
To put the wife to take care...
Are Ogami-sama's orders.
Even if he says so....
Hotoke-san is praying for mercy.
Don't worry.
Ogami-sama will give us a quick answer...
I'm sure it will send us armed troops.
Help!
Well...
In this town... there's nothing left to take.
In that case we shouldn't be helping wandering samurais...
That demon... could be a white bear?
"No, its 10 feet tall, and it's a red big monster, demon like."
A monster...
We are begging you to help us.
"Exterminate the demon, please!"
"Since then, that demon, night after night keeps coming..."
"Kidnaps young girls, and destroys everything,"
"Already in this town, that's the only girl left."
We are not able to hold that girl any longer.
There's nothing to do.
No one can match with that thing...
Kao!
"O-samurai-sama, I beg you!"
"In the name of God and Buddah, we depend on you, Samurai-sama."
A bear!
There's nothing to do... nothing to do...
A demon came.
Save me... please...
Gambo?
( gunbo )
- How did I get here?
"Oh, easily."
"I tore a hole into the fabric of your dimension with my Interplanar Portal Pal, patent pending."
"- Pretty sweet, eh?"
- What are you doing?
We're gonna eat your brain!
"Now, now, now, there will be plenty of time for brain-eating after we conquer Earth."
[Wails]
"And to conquer said Earth, I will need an invincible army."
A million superhuman soldiers marching to the tune of my big drum.
"Which is why I shall clone the mighty, blue Tick!"
- Clone the Tick?
"- Oh, yes."
Your superhero friend has all the attributes I require.
"Incredible strength, nigh invulnerability, and a teeny-tiny little brain."
Eat brain!
Lmagine a legion of Ticks at my command.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, yes!"
"And when my army is complete,"
I will rule the world!
And eat lots of brains!
"Fresh, tasty brains!"
[Both laugh]
[Door handle clicks]
Oh.
Ahem.
"Uh, are we bothering you?"
No.
I just wanted some munchies.
- My roommate.
- [Munching]
"I just figured, you know, if you can't beat 'em I'm like a big shark."
Shark.
Yeah?
I stop swimming and die.
"Oi, come on!"
Hey!
C'mon!
# If I should fall from grace with God Where no doctor can relieve me
# If I'm buried beneath the sod But the angels won't receive me
"# Let me go, boys Let me go, boys"
# Let me go down in the mud Where the rivers all run dry
# This land was always ours Was the proud land of our fathers
# It belongs to us and them Not to any of the others
"# Let them go, boys Let them go, boys"
# Let them go down in the mud Where the rivers all run dry
I should've come up before.
"Paul, have you got the keys?"
"- You're not going yet, are you?"
- Yeah.
Better get some sleep.
We've both got a big day tomorrow.
Don't tell me you've forgotten our little arrangement.
I'll see you at six minutes past ten.
All right?
- Goodnight.
It was great.
- Thank you.
Sweet dreams.
"Tommy, wait."
- I can't do it.
- Course you can.
- A deal's a deal.
The guy is sitting at a table with Paul Anka and he goes light?
"I was wondering if you have an address, phone number, last name."
He robbed one of our guests.
"Oh, you gotta be- Oh, I am so sorry."
"No, it's not your fault, but I was just wondering if maybe you could help me find him."
He was just a fill-in.
He was referred to me by one of my clients.
"You know Pomona, dancer at the Rhino?"
"No, Stan, I don't."
You don't?
She was here just yesterday.
"I don't know her, but maybe you can tell me a little bit about her."
She lives in Henderson.
I got her in zero coupon bonds.
She just got herself a new Mustang convertible.
I want to-
"And for what it's worth, if you ever see her, uh, they're real."
Whoa.
I want an address.
All right.
"You got it, boss."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Thank you.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- I want that man fired.
- I'm not sure we can do that.
Says who?
Fired for what?
He's cost this hotel a lot of money.
Let me tell you about something that'll cost a lot more.
It's called a wrongful termination suit.
He hoped that I may help you fill it some how.
How are you going to do that?
I'm an interior decorator.
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
He said that was your choice.
That you had described exactly who you wanted.
So you work for him?
No.
Mr. sawamato is my god-father.
"So who is he, Vic?"
We don't know yet.
Don't know yet?
"That's very impressive, Vic."
"We're spread a little thin right now, dino."
"Yeah, right."
Shit.
What's this I hear about you and carmine settling down?
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"A house, what like this house?"
"No, not like this."
What's wrong with this house?
"Oh come on, huh?"
I don't need anything big.
What the fuck does need have to do with it?
Do you think I need fourteen bedrooms?
Do you think I need eight rooms to take a shit in?
"Christ Vic, if all I had was what I needed,"
I would be living in a cardboard box with a fucking blow up doll.
What did you wanna tell me before?
Doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do.
Finding excuses.
"Well, I won't do it anymore."
- You told Serena you love me.
- Serena heard wrong.
"Last year, you told Nate."
"This year, you told Serena."
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is Gossip Girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip Girl can be right about you all she wants.
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
"Chuck Bass, I love you."
"I love you so much, it consumes me."
I love you.
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me.
"That everything we've done, all the gossip and the lies, and the hurt will have been for something."
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Put your hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
Let me search you.
I am an inspector who gets angry very quickly.
Sometimes even I get scared of my anger.
What are you holding?
A jacket?
Let me search the jacket.
Perfume in the jacket?
Turn around!
I had come to see what you do at the Academy!
You are so busy that you didn't even go to meet Mother?
You didn't even telephone her?
Mother is furious at you.
But what can I do?
"So much of drills, studies... I have to study so much."
Such big books!
Sometimes I read through the nights.
The drills too are so backbreaking.
You don't realize how much of hard work is involved in this.
- Your timing is indeed ridiculous.
- Why?
What happened?
I am trying to create a good impression.
- lf my mother gets to know...
- l don't understand.
Brother!
She's Pooja and he's my brother!
"So she's your fat book, is it?"
I don't find her too fat!
What about your studies for the whole of nights?
"You must be finding it hard, don't you?"
We just proved that she didn't shoot herself.
"Come on, Melvin."
"If she committed suicide, the gun would have been down there."
It's not.
So someone shot her.
"Damn it, Melvin."
Will you give it up?
You've got no evidence and no motive.
She was pregnant.
Pregnant?
That's right.
And we both know who the father was.
[ Laughs ] [ Groans ]
"Oh, come on, Greg."
"Ah, I'm just a little off today."
"Hey, Melvin, Lyle."
"Can you believe it, Melvin?"
First time I beat the kid since he was 1 6.
Must be the cold.
[ Chuckles ]
I've got your check up at the office.
Looks like we'll have snow for the funeral.
I can't bury her until I finish the investigation.
Melvin thinks she was murdered.
Murdered?
You said she committed suicide.
"No, I found a bullet hole in her left temple right here."
So the poor kid shot herself.
Why would anybody want to kill Hilla?
Maybe because she was pregnant.
"Of course, that probably doesn't come as any big news to you, does it, Greg?"
How did he know she was telling the truth?
No idea.
Is there any employee named Deepa?
No one here.
Any news of a suicide due to debts?
"Deepa, say hello to my father-in-law."
Lets go.
Varun.
"Varun, look at me."
I have never seen you so down.
Please don't be like this.
"You won't understand, Sadhana."
Forget it.
Don't say that!
I know you very well.
We have been friends for 7 years now.
I know how you'd feel even without you telling it to me.
And in the same way...
I hope you can understand how I'm feeling.
Varun.
Shall we lodge a police complaint?
"No, dad."
It will create more problems.
"Damodharan, from Chetpet, and his family, commits suicide owing to mounting pressure from debts."
"Damodharan, his wife Pushpa, and 14-year-old son Aravindh... committed suicide by consuming poison today."
The police are investigating the incident.
The locked house...
Mom.
Look at me.
Please.
Mom.
I don't like to see you being upset because of me.
Getting back your vision is a big thing.
A bottle of soda was shot tragically.
I don't want our school to have a reputation.
"Like yours, you mean?"
"Everyone knows there are, like, fifty guns in school at any given moment."
And the fact that they haven't gone off before shows you...
what a totally safe place this is.
Give it a rest.
Geez!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
No one is going to get shot I promise you.
Who would write a note like that?
Everybody writes notes like that.
We write notes like that.
"Yeah, but we write notes that are true."
- This isn't true?
- Rayanne!
We barely made out.
You haven't been telling people--
"Oh, Angela, come on."
Hey Rickie!
I wouldn't blab about your personal life. I promise you.
What are you looking at?
- What happened to your shirt?
- Oh nothing.
- lt got caught on the fence outside.
"- So, can you believe all this?"
- Did you see anything?
- No. I was in English.
Maybe I should get a gun.
What do you mean English?
You were supposed to be in social studies.
It was.
"You're a smart man, Detective, smarter man than I."
Why do you think you have nothing on us?
Because there's nothing to be had
When I killed Sid...
I looked him in the eye and I told him that he was going to die.
So just tell me the truth.
You do realize that we can still charge you for accessory.
Confessing won't change that.
"Oh, I'm prepared to accept whatever the punishment may be."
"If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead."
Tell me there was pento in the needle.
There was.
Watered down pento.
Hmm.
"I don't understand the game, Mary."
The only crime that Mary's guilty of is trying to protect me.
"Save me, really."
She can't help herself.
It's just what she does.
"We're not the same, you and I."
You sell drugs to addicts.
You murdered Sid.
You came after my daughter!
You're not a healer.
You create pain.
"I don't like games, Mary."
Police!
Put the weapon down!
"Mary, you okay?"
Mary?
I need something to stop the bleeding.
"Well, um, we're meeting for breakfast."
"So, maybe we'll get into some of that."
It just seems a little strange that he's suddenly here now.
"Yeah, I get that, but come on, you remember how good he was before he left, right?"
I'm just...
I'm trying to focus on that. (CHUCKLES)
"Mmm... actually, I kinda remember him being a little off."
He wasn't off.
"What do you mean ""off""?"
"He was damaged, Emma."
"I wouldn't have used that word when we were little, but he was damaged."
- When Brandon James killed all of his...
"- He went through a lot, okay?"
We should definitely be able to understand that.
And maybe he's better now.
People can recover.
"Em, he just left you without any explanation."
What about that?
You should be careful.
Yeah.
"Okay, I shouldn't have called you."
"- Wait, are you pissed at me?"
"- Um, I'll see you later."
"(KNOCKING) Hey, sleepyhead!"
I've been texting you since dawn.
Ready to check the storage unit?
"Let's go, go, go!"
"Yeah, just give me one sec, okay?"
One second.
Meet me out front.
Thank you.
"This place is, uh, nice."
The half you don't need.
Alright.
Alright.
I'd miss you.
I miss you more than I can say.
You've to take this.
Keep going.
Mrs.Cole!
?
Watch yourself there.
Mrs.Cole?
Hm?
I thought you was under it.
I was in the office...hmm.
I might have to borrow clothes.
Talk to the costumes mistress.
But don't be surprised is she tetchy.
Parachute line took the roof off studio 4 last night.
And have Panzer division uniforms ruined.
They are saying it was the worst night to air bombing yet.
Nothing left of Wimbledon apparently.
The props master hasn't turned up and the best-boy is in the hospital and no one knows where the group is.
So we are having to make do with whatever we can get.
There'll be tears before bedtime.
Mark my words.
"Can we save that lamp till we roll, please?"
Sorry Mr.Hilliard.
More?
Much more.
This man hasn't had a bath since last time we fell off the boat.
Change of plans.
Tool seat from Uncle Frank's meety to fetch Tony windy propeller.
You have many fine qualities.
"You are big and strong... full of life, mischief."
I have always feel positive towards you.
"You should see yourself now... in the shadows there, with the smoke all around you."
You're beautiful.
You remind me of that movie star....
-Irina is beautiful.
-Greta Garbo.
-May I help you?
-Yeah.
"Brad to reception, your 1:00 client is here."
You'll call me later?
No phone calls for the first two weeks.
House rules.
I'll write.
I was thinking of keeping a journal anyway.
"Get it published, maybe, under my pen name."
Congratulations.
"You got here, dude."
That's the hardest part.
I'm going to have to search your bag.
"-Cigarettes are Okay, right?"
-Cigarettes are fine.
They're encouraged for patients who smoke.
"But, Chris, no chocolate allowed."
No caffeine or substances containing caffeine.
All set?
"-I love you, baby."
"-I love you, too."
When's Bill coming back?
Next week.
I'll be busy for a few days... but I'll see you when I can.
Did he kiss you?
No.
"That's kind of sweet, actually."
Hi.
This is Cindy.
This is a spectrum analyzer.
It makes graphic representations of the music.
Watch.
- Who's the girl?
- Rose Morgan.
Henry Fine is a professor in anthropology.
"Beautiful music, isn't it?"
Beautiful atmosphere.
I enjoyed that.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.
"- Oh, my pleasure."
Why don't you come up to my apartment?
I want to give you a copy of my book.
I'd love that.
"Your book, I mean."
Not to come up to your apartment.
"But, Rose, I'm inviting you up."
"If you like this kind of music, I have some wonderful CDs, but they're also in my apartment."
"Greg, I have to be honest with you."
I'm a bit out of practice with this.
"Rose, I want you to feel comfortable."
That's very important to me.
I want to tell you up front.
I'm not interested in sex.
- You're not?
"- No, and it has nothing to do with you."
It has to do with what you were talking about in your class.
Quite possibly in her death.
"That's fascinating, sir."
You've got quite a way of putting things.
Especially about Mrs. Daley.
"Let me ask you, sir."
Could you maybe tell me more about her?
Not much.
But you're right.
"About what, sir?"
What you're thinking.
I was lying before.
I didn't like Claire very much.
I haven't for years.
Which doesn't mean to say
"I wasrt shocked by the news of her death, I was."
"And I was still a little bit shook up when you first walked in, so I said whatever sounded right to a detective."
Some other detective.
Not you.
Please sit down.
"Properties, a glass for the Lieutenant, please."
MAN:
"Yes, sir."
"You had me absolutely fooled, sir."
Really?
Scout's honor.
Even after you asked a few questions around the set?
Thank you.
"Our fights, Claire's and mine, werert always discreet."
"And some of them were overheard, I believe."
You must have been told by the crew.
You know how people talk.
"Yes, I do."
The letter wouldn't be at Crescent Beach.
Maybe not.
"While I'm at the club, I want Martinelli at police headquarters."
- l don't see the connection.
- Nobody can without opening the back of your car.
The trunk compartment.
Louis Ord's body's back there.
- How long you been driving?
- l didn't see the signal.
- lt was my f ault.
- Let's see your driver's license.
I just told her something that startled her.
It must be here. I know it is.
"It better be, unless you want to come along to the station house."
- lt isn't here. lt just isn't here.
- Keep your head.
I guess we're hooked.
She must have left it in some other bag.
That's the standard answer.
Can we stop by the mayor's office?
We got a date with His Honour.
"He's your pal, I suppose."
"No, but he told me that if I got Mrs. Chandler there by 4:00, he'd marry us."
That's what I'd just told her when we went through that stop signal.
is that a f act?
And I hardly know him.
Okay.
Get along with you.
"Hey, wait a minute!"
"- What did you say, lady?"
- l said yes.
That was close.
"Yeah, but you didn't."
I should have.
But you didn't.
How did you know?
I knew this girl Vicki.
"She, uh..."
"She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck."
She started acting crazy.
"You know, weird, and it seemed like drugs but then you showed me those articles."
And then I saw your face and how it changed that night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Look.
"You know you can't tell anyone, right?"
Who would believe me?
You'd be surprised.
Why didn't you?
Kill me?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
Like what?
Lost.
Why would you confront me about it?
Why would you risk it?
"Because if it was true, maybe..."
Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because I want you to turn me.

Previously on The Vampire Diaries...
"For over a century, I have lived in secret until now."
"I know the risk, but I have to know her."
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"Anna, your face?"
There's something I want to ask you about.
"Sure, yeah."
So this girl...
- Saffron.
- Such a pretty name.
And you like her?
So what problem?
"I had a fiancée... not so long ago, and it did not end well for me."
The heart is strong muscle.
It spring back.
You ready for the love again.
"Yeah, but I don't know if this is the kind of woman that..."
"Come, Mr. Heller, you handsome man."
Don't.
I know how people see me.
But this Saffron make you feel good.
Yeah.
She makes me want to... be nice.
I think you have good luck with this girl.
"If there's any way we could see the room before paying for it... um, we just want to make sure the room is up to our standards."
We don't usually let people see the rooms before they check in.
"I guess they just don't want us here, babe."
"You want to carry me over the threshold, too?"
"Yeah, you wish."
Let's hurry this up.
Are you coming out anytime this year?
"Crap, I think we're out of hot water."
"Hey, man, you want to use this?"
Eat shit!
"Hello, Alice."
"Hello, Ava."
We decided against it.
"I was only waiting to take Miss, uh, Miss what's-her-name home."
Or maybe she doesn't want you to take her home.
Silly of her if she doesn't 'cause I'm a pretty nice fella and I think she's divine.
'Get out of here before I throw you out.'
"- Oh, you're gonna get tough?"
"- Yes, I'm gonna get tough."
"- Well, start something."
- That's just what I'm gonna do.
[grunts]
'I'll drag you out of here by the neck.'
Let go off my throat.
Let go.
Let go off me.
Let go.
"Well, fancy meeting you here."
- What...
- Shh.
[knocking]
"Hello, partner."
"""Breathes there the man with soul so dead"
"""who never to himself hath said."
"You're an angel."""
That gives me an idea.
I'm gonna write a little song about you someday.
[clattering]
"Now, that's hardly a friendly attitude."
Do you have to annoy me?
"I just dropped around to tell you I'll be back tomorrow night, and the following night and each consecutive night for an interminable period."
I hope you enjoy the new show.
This is my last night.
Leaving us?
Tch-tch-tch.
I'm... not...?
Rest assured.
You won't have a thing to worry about.
"It is unfortunate but, another one of our students disappeared last night."
We have requested the help of the authorities who now are conducting a thorough investigation.
I'd like to ask all you students to be on the alert...
"All the ones who've disappeared were athletes, right?"
Yes.
"Yesterday, it was the captain of the tennis team."
You might be the next target of the kidnappers.
That's ridiculous!
"When you have that look in your eye, I know you're scheming."
Uh-uh.
Who's planning to capture the kidnappers?
See.
You are!
"Why, the shy little guy's waiting for her?"
Huh?
For who?
Do you plan to get her alone by saying...
"""It's a little dangerous, so shall I walk you home? """
"No, uh... but..."
"What, were you going to invite me along?"
"Sorry, but I have other plans."
See ya!
Go straight home!
Shall we go?
Uh-hmm...
Straight home...
Yeah.
Sure.
You kidnappers...!
Thank you.
"Thanks, thank you."
"Well, what did Ernie say?"
"He get you fired, or what?"
"No, he thought I was funny, and he likes my look, and wants me to come in and audition for a guest role on one of his sitcoms next week."
- [laughing] Hey!
- [squeals]
- It's the fucking book!
- All right!
- It's the book!
- Holy crap!

Right here.
Oh.
[chuckles]
I'm such a jelly head.
[chuckles]
You sure you can't come tonight?
[kisses]
I'll blow you on the bus.
[sighs]
It's tempting.
I gotta sort out all this agent shit here before the buzz dies down.
You got a lot of hell on your plate.
MAN:
"What are we doing here, Ray?"
This man needs help.
Are you just gonna sit there while he bleeds to death?
"Nothing you do is going to change anything about what happened to you, Mr Morrison."
What are you talking about?
That man in the woods when you were eight.
The one that took you in that shed.
He wasn't from another planet.
He was just mean and crazy.
You shut up about that.
"You're just going to hurt more people, that's all."
It's not going to make what happened to you go away.
Shut up!
- LISA:
Allie...
"- It would be easier, wouldn't it?"
Blame it on them.
They came down and took you.
You stop it.
It's a lot scarier to think that the monsters might be us.
Shut up!
- Ray!
- You shut up right now!
Ray!
She doesn't mean it!
She's a little kid.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
DOROTHY:
"One day, you're gonna stand in front of the Lord, and you're gonna have to explain what happened here today."
You are gonna have to explain.
Hey.
Speaking Japanese
speaking Japanese you should have bought American.
Speaking Japanese
"hey, guys how's it going?"
Come on in.
Right this way.
So you guys want to hear a joke?
So there is this little boy.
He finds a welders mask.
"Get out of the Van, fucker, slowly."
Let's go jerk off.
So the kid is walking down the street and this old mans pulls over and offers him a ride.
"Come on, Mike, not that joke, Jesus."
That joke is older than fire.
That joke is older than fire.
"So the old man leans over and says, so have you ever heard of falatio?"
And the kid says no.
So they drive another mile or two.
"The guy leans over and says, hey, have you ever head of sodomy?"
"The kid rips off his mask and says, look man, I'm not a welder."
I guess you had to be there.
"Ok, OK, now let's see the Booty."
Let's see what he got here.
"Fully automatic, who did the conversions?"
Right.
Never mind.
That's it.
"That's the ticket, come on."
"Get down, get down."
"Take it, take it!"
Shoot him!
Sometimes.
"Yeah, you get to move around, change of scenery, meet new people."
Well...
I never thought of it that way.
You seem like a real people person.
Oh.
Outgoing.
Not like me.
No?
Thanks.
I bet you're really good at it.
"Well, there's only one way to find out."
"Boy, am I glad to hear you say that... because it's the one subject he's having trouble with."
You think you could fit him in?
"""Him?"""
Frank.
Frank?
Are you kidding?
At his age?
"Well, I'm afraid if he doesn't learn it now, he's never going to."
"You know, I would teach him myself, but I'm way out of practice."
Ah!
Oh.
Um...
"You know, you should never have to practice."
"Well, that's easy for you to say."
You're a professional.
"But for us laymen, if you don't use it, you lose it."
"Well, how long has it been, you know, since you... used it?"
Oh...
"I use it a little bit every day, you know-- the bank, the grocery store-- but it, you know..."
"It's probably been a good ten, 15 years since I was any good at it, you know."
I thought you'd learned that lesson when you lost your daughter.
She made it as far as the tunnels before she was shot.
No!
So much tragedy for one man to bear... and now your foolishness has condemned another innocent woman.
Take the others back for questioning.
I'll interrogate this one myself.
No!
I won't let you hurt her!
Caylem!
Ralkana... he said you'd been shot.
"He was lying to you, Father."
I'm all right.
And your mother?
She's fine.
She was so happy to get your letters.
She wanted me to tell you something.
She forgives you.
We both do.
My sweet girl.
Captain.
I'm coming.
No one will forget what he did here today.
I'll make sure of that.
Chakotay to Transporter Room 2.
Do we have them?
"We're all back, Commander."
Take us out of here.
Gladly.
"Lieutenant, you heard her."
"The warp drive is functioning normally, and we'll have the main deflector back on line tomorrow."
"Yes, thank you, Mr. Kim."
"Captain, are you all right?"
No matter what happens in life don't let their be any rift in your friendship.
- Promise?
- Promise!
I promise too!
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
What have you ordered for?
Aam...
late...
Omlette!
But why are you talking of eating?
Didn't you go home?
Your mother must have fed you to your heart's content!
Couldn't you have brought some food for me too?
I don't eat the stale food of this place.
- l feed it to the customers.
- What?
- Did you meet your brother?
"- No, I am on my way."
Come along?
I have to visit the shrine today.
- Gosh!
I had forgotten!
- Did you see?
"He forgot, he says!"
"Some day, he will forget his friend for his brother's sake."
- Such things happen.
- How can you say that?
What will you do if you are required to choose between...
- ...your friend and brother?
- l will tell you what to do!
If you talk like this I will break the heads of both of you.
- Stay out of this.
- No.
The government does watch us.
You got microwaves and satellites.
"I'm with you, man."
- Do not agitate him.
- Screw you.
"Dr. Bryar, answer the phone."
My old man used to have tracking devices in his cars.
"He said it's for theft, but it's so he can find out where I go."
And what about personal recordings in televisions?
You don't think someone's monitoring everything you watch?
You know how many patents are issued for devices to monitor people?
"Look it up, man."
"Here he comes, Ted."
He's the agent who's playing the hero.
"Answer the phone, Ted."
- Stop this.
It isn't going to help.
- What the hell do you know?
"Ted, he doesn't know what he's talking about."
- He's just a kid.
- Who you calling a kid?
Sit down!
"Oh, now you're going to tell me what to do?"
He'd only have one gun if you weren't here.
"- I'm with you, man."
"- He's not with us, Ted."
He's not with us at all.
"Answer the phone, Dr. Bryar."
It's the Higher Authority.
"They're coming for you, Ted."
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love!
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
The One With The Birthing Video
How do you guys like living together?
-It's been good.
-Yeah.
-Except he's so uptight about crumbs.
-There was a drumstick in the couch.
I'm not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just, crumbs attract mice and mice leave droppings."
And that's how the plague started.
If you wanna relive that again... .
"Mice didn't start the plague, rats did."
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
"Oh, good God, Ross."
Come on.
It's not much farther.
We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind.
What?
- We have arrived.
- Arrived where?
You are without shame.
"Sookie, you do not have to do this."
What do you mean?
"Feeding my girls, making them happy."
I love doing this.
"Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt."
- It makes me feel guilty.
- Eating can help drown that.
"Yeah, eat."
I'm gonna eat.
"Can the help sit at the table, too?"
As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories.
What's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?
He's not much of a morning person.
"Now say, 'I can't believe I ate the whole thing. '"
It takes him about an hour to become Jackson.
"- Hey, I had a good idea for the wedding."
- Cool.
Instead of wrapped Jordan almonds things at every place setting...
- what if we wrap up a few Aspirin?
- Aspirin?
For the morning-after hangovers.
- That's funny.
- 'Cause Jordan almonds are so done.
"Jackson, what do you think?"
Aspirin over almonds?
What else can I want?
Only the table was missing.
and it is provided now
Don't you like the table?
I don't want a table.
I want my freedom
You expect too much from a barbarian
My dear
He kicked.
Did you feel that?
Yes
Can he hear us?
You can speak.
I guess he hears
What's his name?
First he should born.
Then we will decide
Mihrimah Sultan will get cold.
With your permission I'll bring something for her from inside
"Yes, her hands are cold"
We can go inside if you are cold
But it is so nice here
"Go upstairs, get in the room on the right."
There's a shawl on a box there
What are you doing here?
I was looking for the shawl.
But it is not here
You silly.
Did I tell you to get in here?
"Forgive me, I didn't know"
I wonder why my Sultana hired you
Obviously your mind doesn't work
"- hey, baby."
- hi.
"hope you don't mind, but i charged a few things on your account."
"- [sighs] hey, wink."
can i have a sec?
- yeah.
"- hi, wink."
- hey. [chuckles] hit... and run.
"- i don't know, cind."
we got to watch the spending.
and these scratchers?
"- well, what if we won, though?"
- and donkey soap?
"- no, it's supposed to be really good for your face."
cleopatra used it.
"wayne, you have your whole college fund to fall back on."
[chuckles] come on.
- my mama and daddy saved up that money so i could have a life outside of the trailer park.
"- well, what's wrong with the trailer park?"
- nothing.
"- do you love me, or don't you?"
- of course i do.
that's why i'm still here.
"- well, if you're still here, then let's make the most of it, right?"
can you do me a favor before you get off?
- what?
"- [sighs] apparently, the kids should eat more than just cheez whiz."
can you pick up some food?
thank you.
you're the best.
- [sighs] [drops clipboard]
"- [gasps] [chuckling] oh, my... oh, my rock goodness!"
"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if she was trying to."
She'd better before that Pearl Danvers makes a tramp out of him.
"Lay off, will you?"
I'm through with that dame.
I was out with her to tell her goodbye.
- Yeah?
What did she say when you told her?
"- She said, ""Goodbye."
"Call me up soon. """
"Shame on you guys, wasting your time in idle chatter."
Look at Joe over there.
"Hey, Dombrowski."
"What do you got there, a honyock back scratcher?"
A slide rule to figure out these stress formulas.
What's that got to do with running a lathe?
Nothing.
It's to do with designing one.
Aw.
"Running a lathe ain't good enough for you, huh?"
Now you gotta learn how to design one.
"It ain't your time he's wasting, is it?"
His going to school don't hurt you.
"No, he's always got his nose in a book."
"Well, it's his nose, ain't it?"
And a plenty big one at that.
"- Hey, Cliff, why don't you stop?"
"Hello, fellas."
How are you?
"Hello, Tommy."
I got news for you.
- This came from the division super.
Ahem.
I'm just trying to be normal for once but you ruin everything!
You fucking live to fucking embarrass me!
You don't need any help with that!
Whoring yourself!
No... because I learned from the very best
"Why you never strike me as the jealous type, Irina."
How dare you!
What?
She was crying.
I just sat next to her.
She's my daughter!
I don't want you anywhere near her.
"Oh, what makes you so upset?"
You were never the most trivialist mother.
It doesn't suit you.
I think you should leave.
"I'd like that very much, Jakob."
Leave?
"Yes, leave."
I'm sorry for our misunderstanding.
"Beautiful piece of work, kindly donated by Lorenzo Quid... with the added bonus that he will personally hand deliver it to your home!"
and maybe stay for dinner.
"Ezcellent, let's start the bidding at 90."
Do I have any advances on 90?
"So, any advances on 90?"
"Thank you, Madame!"
Do I see 95?
Why did you do that?
What?
Dominique...
I didn't do.
You know what I mean.
Turn around. [all] Super mega final strike.
[all] Super mega star burst. [all] Fire. [grunting] Yes.
"Super mega rangers, that's a super mega win. [Gia] Wow."
It's back to normal.
[Emma] Yeah.
Oh look.
[Emma] Everything looks great.
How is everything?
"Oh, uh, almost back to normal."
Now all we need is a teacher.
Where's Mr. Burley?
Yeah...
Let me take care of that.
Mr. Burley?
Mr. Burley!
Are you okay?
I'm good.
But my crypto-zoological prizes must be saved.
Here.
Let me help you with that.
Phew.
"Thank you, Noah."
How can I ever repay you?
You can get out there and start teaching again.
Your students need you.
Hey.
Mr. Burley.
"Around this time last year, I asked the question, which species will outlast all others?"
"One particular student said that if humans work together, they can achieve anything."
You all proved that to be true.
I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.
"It's very clear that when faced with great adversity, the human spirit will always prevail."
College for five kids won't be cheap.
We're having three.
It won't matter if you're not around for the honeymoon.
I'll be around.
It's gonna be the best years of our lives.
- Just five more spins.
- Three.
"Okay, we've found them."
- You see anything?
- Besides two scoundrels in love?
"No, but they might have something off-site."
I'm gonna go toss their room.
Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit's foot or adjusting a magic girdle.
Red 23.
- Careful!
- Stop yelling!
- Start listening!
- I'm so running over your toes.
- Just get it straight.
Not like that!
- Okay!
- Can you close the door?
- Got it.
You know what?
"Pull all the Dodgson files, would you?"
"And anything that's got a listed cross-reference, like Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll."
- What are you still standing here for?
- I'm not your girl Friday.
What kept you?
Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat you keep promising to fix.
What's this?
- This is why I called you.
How did you get here so soon?
Hannah!
I just left from the broker's office.
My driver knows all the shortcuts in New York.
I must say I didn't expect you that soon.
Neither did your secretary.
"Stephanie, dear, you may leave now."
The stock is up to eight and three eighths.
I've made $120.000 so far.
Good for you.
You need me.
Maybe you need me even more.
Is that your husband?
Yes.
Was that painted before or after he died?
Six months he sat for that.
Maybe that's what killed him.
You are a wicked man.
"Tell me, where did you learn the market so thoroughly?"
I studied in Europe.
How would you like to make $12.000 cash immediately?
I would love to.
What do I have to do for it?
Just write me a check for $20.000.
Do you really think I'm an idiot?
"Look, I will sell you four thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at $5 a share."
The stock is selling at 8 dollars.
You make three points.
That's roughly $3.000 less commission.
It's a gift.
Why will you do that?
Well... let's say it's because you appeal to me.
I guess.
"Professor, let's see the medallion."
"Have you got an idea, MacGyver?"
"Well, if the cult took the Torch out of the Ark, maybe they built a bigger, better one."
But where is it?
I think we're in it.
Are you suggesting that this entire chamber is a giant Ark?
This could be the key.
Then we need to find a keyhole.
Maybe not.
The Torch of Truth.
It's more magnificent than I ever imagined.
Wait a minute.
Just wait.
I guess it's all right.
You're wrong.
"These caves are full of unpleasant surprises,"
I'm afraid.
"Lord Cleeve, at your service."
"I owe you a debt of thanks, Mr. MacGyver."
"And you too, Miss Carson."
"Now, if you'd mind just handing over the Torch to my partner."
Partner?
"I'm truly sorry, MacGyver."
"I don't like this, Cleeve."
You promised not to hurt them.
"I wouldn't dream of it, but we can hardly have them following us, now can we?"
I trusted you.
"How can you do this, Atticus?"
You're not a criminal.
We have what we came for.
Let's get out of here.
"No, you are, Charles."
This was all your idea.
"- Well, what should I tell him?"
- I thought my lack of words said it all.
- But Kisan was great.
- Don't care.
I don't want him.
- Why the hell not?
"- 'Cause I don't trust him, that's why."
"And you don't need to know what I'm gonna do, Charles, till after I do it."
"So, you don't trust Kisan, you don't trust Berg, and you don't trust me, for that matter."
"All the same now, Charles, but I'm talking about the player."
This ain't all about you.
When are you gonna realize that?
"Man, this is fucked."
You're gonna put politics over performance?
You're gonna stand here and let your ego keep us from getting a player of Kisan's caliber?
"- Do you know what subtext is, Charles?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Good, then go fuck yourself."
And that is about you.
( man chattering )
- ( door closes )
- T!
"T, where are you at?"
T!
- ( line ringing ) - ( phone ringing )
"- Yo, what's up?"
"- Yo, where are you at, man?"
- I'm at the house.
- Then why didn't you answer me?
I just did!
My phone has a clock.
And they subsist on a diet...
- of pointlessly weird combinations.
- Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber-jalapeño egg cream."
- Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta get going.
"- Right, okay."
"Then, later, at a club in Chinatown... somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair... some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
How old does she think you are?
So were you in Vietnam?
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot.
She likes old guys.
Don't judge me!
"Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, thi..."
I swear.
This is what all the 20-year-olds look like.
"I wanna thank you for your service to this nation, Private."
- Colonel.
- Oh.
- I gotta end this.
- Shit!
- I didn't send the postcard!
If Chris says he didnt send the postcard then he didn't send the fucking postcard
End of discussion.
All of us are in deep shit here.
All of us.
"Now let's focus on getting out of here, okay?"
Now keep twisting at your tape.
Gaffer's strong but it stretches.
One of us might be able to work a hand free.
So tell me about the party.
- Whatcha wanna know?
- Did you see Felix there?
"Yeah, I-I saw him."
Did you talk to him?
Did he seem all right to you?
"He was good, you know?"
He was fine.
Chris mentioned something with Gemma.
"Uh, Felix fancied her."
"I told him to go for it, you know."
"I said, end of the term, anything goes."
- You think she was out of his league.
- No way!
"He just needed to be confident, 'cause that's what the girls like."
Just a bit of confidence.
So you sold him drugs?
"It was just a couple of lines, I swear, I was just trying to help."
That was en error of judgement.
"I'm just a ""party guy."""
"Gemma, there's a workbench just a few feet behind you."
There's a drawer.
It was for you.
I've been trying to call you.
"I just had,like,the most amazing stream of consciousness right now."
"I'm gonna write us a rock opera, you know,that we could,like,sing together."
"How we met and how we made love,and it... it's like..."
# The sky was opened... #
I can't sing.
And that's okay.
God.
It's like every time
"- that I see you,I,I,I..."
- Johnny.
I'm just so into you.
God!
You know what?
"I want to,like,get tattoos together and drink each other's blood."
We need to break up.
- No.
"- Johnny, you asked me to give another week."
I gave it another week four times.
- It's not working.
"- No,it's working."
"Okay,it,it's,it's just working so well that you just can't see it, and that,like,terrifies you,man."
"Look,we're in different places."
You want to drink my blood.
"I want to go have margaritas and,like see a movie or something."
I can't take all the emotion and crying.
And on my birthday.
Uh...
I'm so sorry.
You didn't remember my birthday?
!
I'm sure of it.
When?
"- Why, have faith, ladies."
Hold fast.
Look at this.
It's for the Women's Institute.
"Oh, yes?"
"Oh, it does sound good."
Mr Farrow?
Mr Farrow.
What's this?
"Women of Great Paxford, join us for a harvest of blackberries for the purpose of making jam."
"""For the purpose of making jam."" Why not just say, ""to make jam""?"
They know how to make it sound better.
Bollocks.
- Unlike you.
This will be a small part of our planned contribution to the nation's food supply in the event of war and a re-launch of the village Women's Institute following its recent closure.
ALL welcome.
"""All"" in capital letters."
What do you reckon?
"- What, baking cakes and arranging flowers?"
It's not for me.
- This doesn't mention cakes or flowers.
"But it does say ""all"" in capital letters."
Not for me.
You should go... for the purpose of getting out more.
"Leave it, Stanley, all right."
Move out...
- Right.
When The Saints Go Marching In
"♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in"
"♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in"
I left my hand phone in your car.
Please take it out for me before you continue what you were doing.
What are you saying?
Ah...
I shouldn't have called for you.
I bet he'll file a complaint.
"You should leave, go."
The car is actually just over there.
I saw my phone in there.
So unlucky!
My hand phone.
"Oh, Oh... my replacement driver job!"
My money... my money...
Hospital?
Did you directly see him collect the money?
He didn't give bribes in front of me.
I only heard.
How much was it?
"Of course, millions."
Millions?
How many millions?
It is all written down in a manual.
"Since he's cautious, he always writes it down."
He's so cautious.
Manual?
What?
What is she doing?
"Please I beg you to do the operation, doctor."
"Today, I just earned money to pay the Hospital."
I hope you can understand my difficulties.
Why must we perform a surgery on a comatose patient?
-=Stent Surgery: stent implantation=- To do such an operation requires a huge amount of money.
Oh!
"Well, get yourself a drink."
You need a drink.
"Well, I shouldn't, probably."
"I've already taken, like, all kinds of strange things before coming over here, so I don't know."
"- Good, you'll be able..."
- You look very put together.
You handle your things well.
"I do handle them well, but..."
"I'm speaking of allergy medicine in this case, 'cause upstate really fucks with me."
"All right, have yourself..."
"All right, have yourself a merry little Christmas."
I'll be right back.
- Good to see you.
- It's an honour.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
What are you doing in here?
- They said they want you to come back.
- You fucked up.
- Huh?
- Get back in there.
I could have made that transaction in two minutes when I was your age.
Twice a week.
Fucking get back in there.
"Well, it's my understanding that was a different time."
"Women were, you know..."
looser then.
Also much more impressed by authors.
"Yeah, authors like me."
Get in!
Could you be deflecting right now?
Not very effectively.
"What do you want me to say, Sheldon?"
I want you to talk about how you're feeling.
Do you want to hold the baby or not?
Yes.
"I know what you're doing, Violet."
It's not gonna work.
I'm not doing ything.
Look at this guy.
Do you mind watching him?
I could really use a shower.
"It's not gonna work, Violet."
I'm a professional psychiatrist.
You're not gonna confuse me with a baby.
And I think you have my ears.
I'm sorry about that.
"Yeah, I am."
No.
"No, no."
She told you?
"No, no, she can't take the blame for this, please."
"Can you give us a moment, please?"
Thank you.
"No, what are they gonna do to her?"
They're gonna try to get her some help.
Don't you think we've tried?
"Michelle, I understand the urge to lie, to protect your family, but we couldn't let you say that it was your fault when it wasn't."
But it is.
It is my fault.
"I was on drugs when I was pregnant with her, for the first couple of months, before I knew I was carrying her."
Michelle...
But El Nino has to concentrate.
He's got no time for other worries.
I won't give him any.
"But tell him to stop by the house and get his things, or to tell me where to send them."
Send them to my place.
He can tell me himself.
I have nothing to do with you.
"Here, you can leave when you want."
- Good evening.
- Whiskey on the rocks.
- Which glass do you prefer?
- The tall one.
"Excuse me, could I speak to you for a moment, please?"
Forget it.
"When something's over, it's over."
Excuse me.
What were you saying?
"Could I have a word with you, please?"
"If you take me to Madrid, we could talk on the way."
I'd be delighted.
Let's go.
Who named you Lydia?
My father.
It was like sealing your fate.
"He always wanted to be a bullfighter, but he stayed a banderillero."
"He was the one who supported me the most, but he died a year ago."
I'm sorry.
"""El Pais"" wants me to do a profile on you for their Sunday issue."
Do you write on bullfighting?
Your name isn't familiar.
To be honest I know nothing about it.
So why are you here?
- Now your turn.
- I Arthur.
I can't argue with that.
[Screams]
"Is that you, Arthur?"
- Yes!
- No need for raised voices.
"Look, Tick, there's this obscene monster who lives next door and wants to clone you and take over the world."
Are you sure you're the real Arthur?
"Oh, come on!"
"Tick, please let me go."
"- It's locked, Tick."
"- Stand back, Arthur."
I'll take care of the door.
Merciful heavens!
Too late!
Too late!
Too late!
Too late!
Euch!
[Whimpers] What horror is this?
"[Thrakkorzog] So, mighty Tick, at last we meet."
It's nice to finally get to know the neighbors.
"I am Thrakkorzog, evil ruler of Dimension 14 B."
Allow me to introduce your successor.
I was a bit worried at first.
"I mean, he is a little mucus-intensive, but you work with what you've got."
"Enough prattle, villain."
"I don't mind a little science, but no one mucks around with the Tick's membranes."
Prepare for swift justice!
Oh-ho!
"So, foul gelatin, you would do battle with the nose of your birth?"
Don't move.
You're not going to shoot me.
Tell me something else about myself.
"I swear that I will, but not now."
"(Machine gun fire, screams)"
-Silence!
Up against the wall.
"(SALVADOR) Finally, Espínola."
-Relax.
Outside is taken care of.
and I will sort this out in a jiffy.
"Let's see, do any of them speak Spanish?"
"-Yes, this one."
"Well listen carefully, because this is the last time I'll say it,"
"I have 100 more men in the hallways, and all your comrades are dead, so surrender and we will treat you with honor."
Do you understand?
-And you understanding this?
"No, it's not going to be over that easily."
"Diego, wake up."
Diego.
-Silence!
We will never surrender.
We only follow orders from the Führer.
That can be arranged.
Remove your aim from my boss or I'll shorten him by a head
(ANGUSTIAS) Wake up.
We have to warn Ernesto quickly.
Fine.
Someone translate.
I'll do it.
-Perfect.
Tell him to return to Montserrat.
"Cancel your plans for tonight, we're going to keep watch on the whores and catch Niko."
"- Laure, can I talk to you?"
- I don't have time.
Wait!
Stop being angry at me.
"- I'm an honest guy, you know me."
- Really?
You call going behind my back honest?
I didn't go behind your back.
I had an agreement with Bremont so he wouldn't shut down your career and Aubert's.
"He's the one who's after you, Laure, not me."
What?
"- Oh, yes."
"I don't know what you did to him, but he doesn't like you very much."
"Get them now, we're going to start."
Excuse me.
Could you tell Jérôme I'd like to see him?
- I'll be in the changing room.
"- OK, I'll tell him."
What are you doing here?
I came to see the youth worker.
- You've got my money?
- Let me go.
Wait.
"I want my share, you fucker."
Son of a bitch.
You're not entitled to anything.
You chickened out.
"Without me you wouldn't have had the key to the office,"
"- so I want my money, or I'll kill you."
- Get lost!
"Don't show up here unless you have the money, got it?"
(both) Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, excellency."
- CIaudette.
Ah.
velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, CIaudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
I will leave you in peace.
"Oh, no. (giggles)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
"One, two."
"(piano transcription of Beethoven's ""Symphony No.6 in F"")"
"You're a fine shot, sir."
I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?
"She doesn't need your protection, by God."
Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.
"""One warm word from you and I Iive."
"One brutal word and I die."""
"""It doesn't matter, for I am not afraid of death any more."""
"""I have already visited the beyond in your music."""

- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
No...
No!

"Evan, Evan, what are you doing?"
Stop it!

[AVERY] She's having a seizure.
[AVERY] Put something in her mouth.
"No, never do that to someone who's having a seizure - you'll hurt her."
She's going to hurt herself!
[LING] She's unconscious.
She can't feel anything.

hi
Can I talk to him?
He can't actually talk... alright .
Paul!
What is it?
- They've taken him!
He's come and taken him!
"Oh, he has him now!"
I'll never see him again!
And he'll tell him everything!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to call Washington.
The police?
No!
"It'll get in the papers, and wherever he is, he'll see it!"
He'll show it to him!
All we've been trying to hide!
Washington has known all along about you and Paul.
They've had to.
It's their business.
"But I swear to you, they'll keep this thing absolutely quiet."
"When I tell them to, it will break in every paper in the country."
"It will be hard for him, but I think that boy has enough spirit to outlive anything."
"Spin around, Sonny."
That's the ol' kid.
"Getting hot, Paulsy walsie?"
"How about a nice, cool drink of ice water?"
"You wouldn't give me the sandwich, you won't give me the water."
You heard that?
I guess that told you!
"I don't know whose kid he is, but he's as game as a pit dog!"
"That's throwing it in there, kid!"
"Whoever his old man is, he ought to be proud of him!"
"Come on, Curly."
What are we waiting for?
Mr. Assanai why are you back?
I thought you got better.
I miss you.
So I thought I'd visit.
Yeah?
Room 5 please.
Number 117.
"That day if I thought of you only as a patient, I wouldn't have felt anything."
"But being that we're friends,"
I felt sad.
So I hoped that you're feeling well.
And I wouldn't have to see you again.
"I'm feeling well, doc."
I just wanted to see you again.
There is one thing I wanted to tell you.
But I didn't get to tell you.
"When you told me to go to the beach,"
I really went there.
I never thought I'd want to sit and watch the sunset.
But you told me to.
So I watched it that day.
"Honestly, seeing the sunset was a waste of time, but that day I don't know why, I..."
I sat there for hours.
That day I felt like
I could breathe easily.
And I was happy.
Just like every time I see you.
"Thank you very much, doctor."
I thought you said you were feeling well.
I hope next month we won't see each other again.
FEDERALPROSECUTOR SAMELLISIS WIDELYEXPECTED
- Is that one of those...
- Yeah.
I wasn't here when everything went down
"Between Artie and MacPherson, but I know it was bad."
Here.
"Yeah, this feels right."
Yeah.
It must've been bad.
"I mean, all that stuff with Ogawa."
Giving Dickinson the file.
He wanted more than the sword.
He wanted to mess us up as a team.
It worked.
"Well, I don't know how to work with him right now."
The thing about Artie is that he's lost
A lot of people in his life--including agents.
So now he just shuts everybody out.
It's a defense mechanism.
That's not an excuse.
It's not a reason to keep secrets as compulsively as he does.
It's not meant to be an excuse.
Just an explanation.
"Artie acts like he doesn't care,"
But he does--about you both--a lot.
And that scares him.
"Well, I guess he needs to work that out, doesn't he?"
"You know, just because he lost people,"
It doesn't make us expendable.
I'm not a red shirt.
I'm not.
She's upset because I don't communicate.
"Did she not notice the word ""secret"""
Yeah?

"No, we ain't."
Glad to see you get it.

"As far as I know, the job's still open."
They'll fill it the way they always have.
Move the best man up.
"Well who would you say the best man is, Tommy?"
Heh-heh.
"Kid, if they ask me, I'll have to tell them you're all pretty good."
Ha-ha.
You know darn well I'm better than pretty good.
Sure.
You're the guy that wrote those books Dombrowski's always studying.
"There's one for you, wise guy."
"Hey, there she blows."
Let's go back.
"Till Monday, I'm still the best man."
"Yes, sir, Mr. Smith."
"Hey, you big ape, you."
Get in there.
Tommy was kidding.
You've been here longer than the rest.
You can run this shop as well as you run that drill press.

I'm gonna come back to you.
You promise?
Promise.
Spring cleaning- a curious ritual.
Nicole said it meant time to rid ourselves of things we didn't need anymore.
The first step is reflection.
What's worth keeping?
What's lost its value and can be given away?
"For some, the choice is easy."
"For others, much more difficult."
Wow!
Getting rid of all that.
"Actually, I've gone through, and..."
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.
"Oh, Kyle, you don't have to, but... a lot of this stuff has seen its best day."
Look at this t-shirt.
"It's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded."
I wore this the first time Stephen took me to work with him.
Well... this one's torn.
I ripped it playing basketball with Josh.

- The girl wouldn't have the wherewithal to do that.
- Exactly.
"But then, what about the bite marks?"
"Well, the victim got too close to her."
"As you discovered, Fen reacts violently when approached."
Indeed she does.
So the victim and the girl were involved in an altercation.
Or Travis set her on him.
"Either way, Travis stabbed him and then tried to cover it up."
But why?
"Any news from the victim, Crabtree?"
"Nothing yet, sir, but I've widened my search, sent out a province-wide description."

What is it?
"I picked something different, to see if you like it."
You hardly ever play with your toys!
This old lady is yours.
"When you feel like hearing a story, she will tell you one."
We can get people as presents?
She is the greatest storyteller around.
Don't you like stories?
"When you're tired of reading, just say ""tell me"", and she will."
Isn't that great?
Talk to my grandchild.
Hello.
How do they call you?
The Storytelling Lady.
"Grandma, you can buy people?"

"- Depends, I guess."
Are there people stores?
"There's no such thing, my angel."
So how did you-
You're impossible when you get something in your head!

I heard about your life being targeted.
Chief Yamamoto in Tokyo has been worried about you.
How hasty of you to run away from the hospital and to use Arcam's private jet.
Here.
It's the latest in armored muscle suits.
It's made partly of fibers of a metal called Omihalcon.
That battle suit was created by mixing metal Omihalcon fibers with an artificial muscle structure that is resistant to both heat and pressure.
It enables the user to draw more than 30 times as much power as is normally used.
how long has it been since we've taken any vacation?
was about two years ago.
This is a fighting knife also made of Omihalcon.
With a knuckle guard!
What's this?
Arm pad with wire anchor.
with a strong climbing claw.
Wow.
What do you mean?

That Hunda and his rabble are becoming more than just a nuisance.
"Well, the teleport audio system seems to be working all right."
"Orac, how do the sensors check?"
The sensors are clear.

What did you do?
What any skilled technician does with solid-state circuitry.

It's probably one of the relay triggers.

"Joseph, have you ever told a lie?"
"-Yes, sir."
-Big ones or little ones?
Some little ones and some medium ones.
"You'd lie to save your sister from prison, wouldn't you?"
"-Yes, sir."
-A big lie?
-The biggest lie you ever heard.
-I object!
Sustained.
Yeah?
Yeah.
"Uh, he's sick in the hospital."
We just come by to water his plants and look after the place for him.
Hospital?
Is it serious?
"Uh, yeah, it's pretty serious."
They're still trying to figure out what he has.
Damn.

It's good you guys are looking after the place.
Yeah.

"No, dude."
We're over here tonight because we're not in the photo from last night.
It's that simple.
"Well, it's not like fate decided it."
"Presumably, we made decisions yesterday that made us end up here today."
"All right, my brain just kinda melted a bit."
What was the original question?
"The question is, if you could choose something to show up in the next photo, anything, what would you choose to see?"
I'm a little ashamed at how good it felt to buy this dress.
Back to the question.
Easy.
I want a pile of money so big that I'm fuckin' buried in it.

Can you tell me what happened?
You don't know?
"Well, you didn't leave a note."
No.

"You said you were going to do it, Riley."
You promised you would leave the guy no hope!
What are you talking about?
I dumped him this morning.
I can't help it if the guy doesn't want to let me go.
You were supposed to close the door!
"Instead, you did what you always do."
You left it wide open.
I don't know if I left it wide open.
Maybe I left it open a tiny little crack.
A crack is just as bad!
Why couldn't you just close it?
"I mean, what is so hard about closing the door on a relationship you don't even want?"
I don't know.
I guess maybe it scares me.
Something scares you?
"Okay, look, it's really hard for me to talk about feelings, so if we are gonna talk about this, you have to make a dumb face."
What?
!
Just do it.
Oh.
Mm.
Oh!
Love is a thief and stealing your heart tonight.
"And you give it to me, giving me all of you."
Your all I see...
You're all I want it to be.
I love you.
"Wow, he is good."
"I know, right?"
He looks so different.
I don't think he's as clean as he used to be.
Clean?
He's got that whole grungy working for him.
You can say that again.
Hey Jill where's Drew tonight?
Oh he had a movie screening and then he's going out with the guys
Is he excited about the whole engagement?
Yes he's so excited.
"And I decided that I don't want a long engagement so we set a date, September."
Ohhhhhh
That's great.
Don't you think that's a little quick?
Ah no Hallie I don't.
I'm pushing 30 Ok.
You just tell me how it feels when you get here.
I'm 25 Jill it's not like you're 108.
Count me out on this one.
My agent told me never to divulge my real age.
So I can't partake in the conversation either.
And you both smell like desperate whores
Thank you all for coming thank you very much.
Hey.
You made it huh?
That was incredible.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Ms. Moroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it."
"'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I like risky.
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
All of 'em.
"Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
"Karl Robe, you say?"
Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to Us Weekly.
"Hey, Lemon."
You like karaoke?
I know a joint.
"No, no, I-- I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
I'll take you.
"I was ready to earn an academy award nomination trying to mask my horror over how badly it sucked, but it's actually pretty decent."
"Thanks, bro."
You mind if I take a crack at it?
"Yeah, knock yourself out, bro."
All right.
"Holy shit, you got skills."
"* Left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality * dude, you go to be in my band, bro."
- That was sick.
"- Count me in, bro."
"- Holy shit, bro."
- What are you guys called?
- Hot lunch.
"- Count me out, bro."
- What?
- Hot lunch?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
"You know what a hot lunch is, right?"
"Yeah, like salisbury steak, like taco tuesday."
"No, no, it's not like salisbury steak."
It's like a euphemism for a sexual term.
It's like when you're doing a chick and she takes a dump on you.
- No way.
- Yes way.Like a cleveland steamer.
- What's that?
- Same thing.
"Dude, I guess I'm never gonna go to cleveland."
I gotta take a piss.
"Sean, are you all right, dude?"
Yeah.
He don't look too good.
"You think I should, like, make him some tea or something?"
I love you and won't allow it.
"You say you love me, but talk about allowing me to leave!"
Things between men and women will not change.
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him.
He's fine!
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!
Over!
At this moment I feel no love for you at all.
"I never thought that would ever happen, but it has."
Kay...
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why don't you take the kids back to their room?
"-Michael, you haven't heard me."
"-Kay, what do you want from me?"
"Do you expect me to let you go, to let you take my children from me?"
Don't you know me?
Don't you know that that's an impossibility?
That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening?
Don't you know that?
Kay...
"In time, you'll feel differently."
You'll be glad I stopped you now.
I know that.
I know you blame me for losing the baby.
Yes.
I know what that meant to you.
I want the boss.
"""Tattooing"" in Japanese..."
Take it nice and slow!
You lied to me.
All your questions about Lynn's tattoo.
She was killed for her tattoo.
What about you?
Did you tell me the truth?
I thought there were 12 Hiromitsus.
I wish it were so.
You were together?
You and Hiromitsu.
I loved him.
So much I didn't care that love meant something different to him.
We were so happy.
Until his masterpiece was finished.
He lost interest in me.
He lost interest in everything.
In life as well.
He killed himself.
Attained absolute perfection.
And left me behind with a wound that won't heal.
"Ironically, I'm the only thing that's left of him."
So Lynn Wilson knew about your tattoo?
"Of course, but she swore never to tell anyone about it."
Before ending up in Gunzel's basement.
Gunzel most likely knew about her tattoo and whoever else worked with him.
"Irezumi, too."
Who else knows about it?
Your family?
Your lover?
No one.
Mumbai!
Mumbai suited me well.
"There are ample beautiful, charming women here."
There are a Iot of colourful beauties visible at the beach!
These colonies are made on top of gold and silver!
film celebrities reside in these lanes and by lanes.
This is heaven forthose who have money with them.
The one who is pauper drifts around!
The earnings and living here is worth millions.
The destiny here is with millions!
The one who comes here never returns.
This is not a city but a shackle.
"When I came to this place, my Iife changed!"
Mum..
Mum..
Mumbai!
Mumbai suited me well.
Mum..
Mum..
Mumbai!
Mumbai suited me well.
There are tall buildings.
But there is no place to stay.
There are so many roads.
But there is no place to walk.
"Dont talk about food, water is sold here."
"AII the land is sold, now they are selling the sky."
Money is everyones parents.
Money is God!
people are running afterthe money!
Entire life is spent away in queues.
Look how low a human has gone down to survive.
"When you think what might happen to the one you love, of course it's a downer."
Or did Kiefer say something to you before our dispatch?
You dying scares me the most.
"Hey, c'mon!"
What?
!
"Welp, I'm off to fetch water."
We're off to the woods to gather some firewood.
What about the tents?
"Take care of it while we're out, okay?"
"Ah, it's so nice and clear out today, huh?"
"Good luck, Ryner!"
Then I guess I'll get an afternoon nap.
Ryner...
"Ryner, would you run away with me?"
"Come on, come with me."
Not with Sion.
With me...
What are you talking about?
"I care for you, Ryner."
I've always cared for you.
"Even though it was hopeless, I couldn't help falling for you."
"Ryner, you don't like me, do you?"
"Oh, come off it, Kiefer."
Joking around at a time like this?
"Yeah, you're right."
I guess I can't have anything.
"- No, I didn't mean..."
"- Even so, I didn't want you to die."
"I'm sorry, Ryner."
I couldn't protect you.
I offer up this contract to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps within the atmosphere!
I was thinking ifyou could talk...
- No.
"No way, Mr Daaga."
Vijay is a police officer.
And I am a lawyer.
It has happened many times before.
"He has arrested many criminals, and I have freed them."
But our friendship still prevails because he hasn't questioned me about my profession.
Nor I have interfered in his work.
And...
"Think ofthe devil, and here he is!"
We must leave.
Where were you all these days?
-Right here.
Shall we play a set?
ARer them.-l have taken one more case ofyours.
Balwant's.
You arrested him.
You are on to it?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
But his chances are grim.
- We'll see that in court.
Why did you take up this case?
-Come on!
It's my profession.
You know he's a first rate criminal.
Still you... lt's not for us to decide if he is guilty or decent.
Let the court decided over it.
You won't improve.
My client Mr Balwant Singh works for Roshan Electricals.
"On the 15th he was on his way to the bank to deposit 25,OOO in the company's account."
Take your mind off it.
"Think about something else, something nice."
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Anything nice.
How about that boy up in Seattle?
There ain't no boy in Seattle.
- There isn't?
- I made that up.
- Why did you do that?
- How should I know?
I don't know half the reasons I do things.
The only boyfriend I ever had banged me on the floor of a caboose in a Western Pacific rail yard.
- Watch your language.
- That is the right language.
Sure wasn't love.
He promised he would take me to Reno.
But he lied.
Then my father found out about it and there was this big scandal.
He decided to get me out of town as fast as he could.
That's why I was in the mail plane in the middle of winter.
That was OK because they didn't want to see me.
I didn't want to see them either.
"Don't cry, Tillie, you're not the type."
"- Yes, I am."
- Sh...
Underneath.
You're the one that called me a jinx.
"Yeah, but I took that back, didn't I?"
My father...
My father told me I was spoiled merchandise.
- That I was ruined for life.
"Well, it, uh, it pays the bills."
"Nah, you guys just read a bunch of crap from cards, right?"
"Cold in the east, a storm right."
It looks like rain.
Aah!
It's more complicated than that.
Let me askyou
- I'm trying to plan my birthday in a couple of months.
Can you tell me if it's going to be a nice day?
"Oh, right, hey, nice meeting you."
Always great to know a fan.
Your name was?
- Dale.
- Dale.
- Yeah.
- The thug?
"So, Russ, i just want to apologize about the last time we spoke."
I wasn't really feeling good.
I was feeling sort of vulnerable.
"I had fear issues come up, being arrested and all."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Plus, I was drinking, which I'm really not supposed to do, you know, on the medication."
"- Oh, I see."
- Can I have some of these?
"- Yeah, go ahead."
"- You know, it wasn't a good moment."
I just wanted to make an amends.
"Hey, listen, don't you worry."
"The truth is, I should be apologizing to you."
"I was gonna call about the $10,000, but the station got so busy."
"Don't worry about the ten grand, Russell."
- It's water under the bridge.
Yeah.
FITZGERALD:
Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?
It's 33 now.
"They were my men, Fitzgerald."
I know how many I lost.
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.
GLASS:
We have to set the boat loose.
"If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver."
Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.
ANDERSON:
On foot?
It'll be winter before we get there.
"Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses."
Ain't no posts that far over!
"Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake."
The Ree ain't that stupid.
"We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak."
Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.
Ain't nobody talking to you.
Who'd listen to you anyway?
Can't find your way out of your breeches to take a shit.
All I'm saying is Camp Rhulen is just up the way.
We can hole up there.
We walk.
"Yeah, I'm sure we will."
Wish my dad was a doctor.
Then he could've bought me a captain's job.
"What do we do, eh?"
Pray these pelts ain't rotten if we ever get back here?
- Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
_
(sportscaster speaking indistinctly)
"(chattering, shouting indistinctly)"
- Look at him.
- Just... behaving as if nothing ever happened.
"The best relationship he's ever had is over, and he's just sitting there eating hot wings."
And I'll bet you Colleen is just drowning in tequila right now.
That's not racist.
"No, no, Latinos can swim."
Do we know what happened?
"Yeah, it's the same thing that always happens."
"He meets somebody great, they want a commitment, he freaks out, and then he dumps them, like an idiot."
Yeah.
And he told you that?
"No, he told me to mind my own business."
Wow.
Rude.
Oh.
(Jen clears throat)
"Hey, honey, uh, what has Matt told you about the breakup?"
Oh.
"You know, I wish I could tell you, but can't... bro code."
"Yeah, you don't remember, do you?"
"Uh, maybe he said he was sad."
JEN:
Mm-hmm.
Or fine or maybe happy.
You're a good listener.
Thanks.
"(indistinct shouting, cheering)"
"You know, it's still too soon to really know how you feel."
Let's give it another day.
I want you to quit.
"Let's be super, super sure."
"(Man over PA) Frankie, you have a call on line one."
Sue wants you to quit.
It was settled then.
I was just gonna have to quit.
Why do I have to quit?
Just 'cause Sue has stupid crazy eyes?
Maybe I don't wanna quit.
So don't quit.
"Yeah, sure."
Right.
"I won't quit, and then I'll be the worst mother in the world."
Ohh!
"You know, it's not fair."
"I'm really loving it, Mike."
"The people there are so nice to me, and I get to wear these pretty costumes, and they bring me tea."
Nothing has made me this happy in years.
No offense taken.
(Sighs) And they like my voice.
"The last time I sang in the car, the kids threw cheetos at me."
Wow.
Must have really hated it to give up cheetos.
Ohh.
Why do I always have to make the sacrifice just 'cause I'm the mom?
"Frankie, you work hard."
"If you've found something that makes you happy, you should stick with it."
"I know, right?"
And she's not a kid anymore.
"If Sue's upset, well, that's life."
You gotta leave quick!
Where to?
This is my home!
"No, it is dangerous!"
You have to leave!
Jimmy!
"Come, come!"
"DO you hear me, Colonel?"
I want all men of the 5th... shaved and in full uniform helping the civilians.
"Avoiding panic, putting out fires..."
"I want them to swallow lava, if need be."
And I want it all documented!
Did you hear me?
"Films, photos, radio, the whole operation!"
You may leave!
They're everywhere in Naples.
Impossible not to find.
They said that the Vesuvius hadn't had an eruption in 50 years.
This is historic!
"Right, Bob..."
"Right, boys."
"Here, in San Sebastiano... at the basis of the volcano."
All vehicles on duty now!
What are the orders?
"All land and air crews at work... in civilian rescue, madam!"
Aren't you afraid?
Fear... the only thing I'm afraid of is human stupidity.
"Because, unlike everything in the world, it knows no bounds."
How men can be idiots.
Is this the end of the world?
What is this?
"Don't be afraid, it's nothing."
Well...
"Well, Mr Diamonds said, ""Hey, go take the afternoon off."
"""Take a few hours off."
"You deserve it."""
You know what that's called?
It's called esteem.
Esteem for loyalty.
"I mean, I don't..."
"I don't need time off, cos anything could happen when I'm not covering his back."
"He could be talking to other bodyguards, for instance."
"Yeah, right?"
"I mean, I'm not concerned as such, I'm not concerned, because, well, I'm..."
"I'm that guy, that one-in-a-thousand kind of a guy."
I'm that guy that will go the distance.
I will go all the way.
They no respect for the dead!
"They no respect for nothing, Michelangelo!"
"Dorothy, Bonnie, they pass on!"
Poor babies.
They just babies!
Like you!
"My daughter, yesterday night, she say she see what you doing on internet."
She say she see me speaking!
"She say, ""Mum, you are famous!"""
But I do not want to be famous!
I want to be invisible!
Invisible!
So you stop now.
"Right now, Michelangelo!"
"Child, you go home."
Please!
Pray to lord for souls of dead!
I'm not from earth.
The people looking for me are getting close.
They also are not from earth.
-What do you...
What do you mean you're not from earth?
I don't...
"- Listen, I care about you deeply."
- Then why are you telling me?
- To protect you.
"-Uh... your ...association with me, I fear I'm putting you in danger as well."
-Danger?
How can you... how can you expect me to believe this?
"Please, just... make me understand."
-Alyssa... there are things... there are worlds outside of this one you have no idea of.
And I am from one of these worlds.
I knew I would never see her again.
I was devastated.
But we are more connected than I even imagined.
She could hear my thoughts.
She could feel my pain in losing her.
-You were... telepathically linked?
-Yes.
Without my intention.
It just happened.
"Soon, we found each other again, and we left together, heading west."
- Then what happened?
- My worst fear.
They found us.
"I managed to get away unharmed, but she was not so fortunate."
-So you're saying that she's...
- Dead?
No.
(SNORTING)
Why don't you put some clothes on?
(SNORTING)
I told you to put some clothes on.
"Ray, you know those people are dead."
Those people are dead.
No shit.
And you were there.
Don't forget that.
"I told you to put some goddamned clothes on, didn't I?"
RAY:
"You know, we got enough of this shit to last us till 1995."
We got enough to last us till we get to Houston.
We're not selling all this shit.
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.
"I'm going back to Chicago, man."
I don't give a fuck what you do.
PLUTO:
It don't make no sense riding up and down a road.
RAY:
What the hell you think is going to happen?
We're going to get in trouble?
"Besides, I was planning on selling some to them country sons of bitches in Arkansas."
I don't like this Arkansas shit.
We're going to be in and out.
We're not building a goddamn house.
"It's not a problem, Pluto."
What you worried about?
What the fuck do you think?
"I don't get you, baby."
Why don't you loosen up and have some fun?
Why don't you get high with Ray and me?
"And now, you may spend the rest of your trip enjoying the island."
"Please feel free to make Eden into your own, personal Sandals."
Yes.
"And now, jet skis!"
"Yes, yes!"
Yes!
"Hey, hey, what's happening?"
I sure miss you guys.
I miss you so much.
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws!
We get to eat all the candy we want!
"Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready!"
Come on!
We're waiting on you!
Give us one second with the kids.
We'll be there in a minute.
Go ahead and start.
"Well, listen, when we get back next weekend, we'll go to Medieval Times and we'll get some big drumsticks and lots of meat."
- Yes!
"And we're gonna be doing a lot more of that fun stuff, guys, so get ready, okay?"
"I'm gonna take you to the school parking lot, we'll do some donuts."
Yeah!
Donuts!
"All right, I love you."
"Love you, too."
Here's Grandpa Jim Jim.
All right.
Enjoy your last few days.
"Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor and not give them candy every time they ask?"
You ought to be thanking me.
I'm here at this home store returning some of the stuff that you had on that house list.
"Okay, thanks so much."
"Yesterday, I was unemployed."
"Today, I guess I'm retired."
"That makes two of us, brother."
"But in a stunning development this morning, the lottery commissioner suspended all payment to Captain Stottlemeyer after it was revealed that Stottlemeyer has known and worked with Natalie Teeger, the newly hired lotto ball girl."
There is a news conference...
He said we cheated.
Why?
Just because you know the Captain?
I...
I mean...
Okay.
"It looks bad, but it's not impossible."
No.
It's not just that.
They said they have proof.
They checked the equipment.
There was something wrong with the machine.
It was rigged.
Rigged?
They said I'm going to jail.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry I said I quit."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
You have to help me.
Yeah.
"Good morning, Miss Teeger, Captain."
"You and your friend, Mr. Monk, wanted to see what evidence we had?"
Yeah.
"Well, here it is."
"Before we begin, is there anything you want to say to the lottery commissioner?"
Yep.
-I can take care of him.
This is our house!
This is your gift for me on our wedding.
"You know, we have a privacy here."
It's near my workplace so I can check up on you during my break.
Raya also promised that she'll look after you when I'm on duty.
"Migs, you're my husband."
I will serve you.
I'll do everything for your memory to come back.
"Migs, I need you."
I want to go home.
When are you taking me home?
You don't have to do this.
I'm your wife.
"I love you so much, Migs."
It'll just worsen the situation.
He thinks you are his girlfriend.
"Ara, I'm scared."
But I'm scared of giving my whole heart again.
"Knowing that one day, his memory will come back."
Joy is his wife.
But you're the one he loves right now.
I badly want to love him even if I know it's wrong.
But it's hard to get hurt.
Will you get my bag please?
It really has a different appeal.
Daddy's so proud of her because...
So that's why you dad was in a Hummer when I saw him in Toronto.
What are you doing there?
.
It's work.
I have an exhibit to stage for my client next week.
-Satisfied?
-That satchel has a false lid.
"Go on, look."
Somebody put those there.
I am innocent.
"Well, I am afraid we are left no choice."
"J.D., will you assist me in escorting Mrs. Standish to the jail?"
"Ezra, she's your mother."
EZRA:
"Now, you'll have to forgive the appearance..."
... butthemaidquit.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.
"I'm cruel, only that I may be kind, mother."
"After all, you should know better than to steal."
"You know, perhaps some time spent behind bars will be instructional."
Preston Wingo put those cuffs links in my bag.
He's blackmailing me.
"Now, why on Earth would he wanna do that?"
MAUDE:
It's none of your business.
"Come on, judge wants us to ride."
"Well, sleep tight."
Don't let the... .
"Well, you know the rest."
What appears to be the trouble?
chris:
This boy just brought us a message from Judge Travis.
He's over in Eagle Bend trying a colored man for murder.
They're too het up for a fair trial.
Judge wants us to bring the prisoner back.
-All of us?
-Yeah.
He's in... (BLENDER BUZZING) ...The kitchen.
- But talking to him's not gonna be easy.
- Why?
"Walter, we have company."
"Oh, hello, Agent Dunham."
"Walter, hey."
I need you to tell me what you know about the man we call the Observer.
You once referred to him as your friend.
Seems he may have kidnapped a woman.
They called it the Strawberry Supreme.
PETER:
His favorite ice-cream store shut down.
He made me wait in line with him for four hours to get one last milkshake.
They have a secret ingredient.
"It's mundane, but it's..."
"Oh, it's sublime."
And I'm trying to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory senses to try to re-create it.
Walter.
Can you come with me?
OLIVIA:
We've recorded him at over three dozen Fringe events.
- Do you remember him?
WALTER:
Of course.
But there's nothing more than I've told you before.
Peter and I were in a car crash.
In a frozen lake.
When I was a boy.
"We were drowning, and he dove in and saved us."
But you say he's kidnapped a woman?
We think he may have.
Why?
"There was a note saying ""learn to respect""."
"Hey, beautiful."
"Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
"Yes, to Lézaro Cardenas."
How long is it going to take?
Okay.
Bye.
How much money do you think the old lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
- I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"- On the roof, madam."
Fixing some dampness.
Do you have the mail?
"- Yes, madam."
"Do you like living here, Beto?"
Yes.
"I'm used to it, after so many years of being here."
I don't know what's going to happen when it's sold or rented.
Do you think there are many people living like you?
No!
"Being indoors is very hard, now I am used to it."
But the first days I felt it was very hard.
Even the people who come to see the house ask me:
"""Isn't it scary?"" No, I tell them."
I don't hear the noises any more.
I'm used to the strange noises.
I'll come on Wednesday to pick you up to go to the market.
A woman was kidnapped by her ex in California.
He broke a window and pulled the pregnant girl out.
The victim's nephew helped him and went with them.
New Mexico license number Nora Edward 2-4-5.
Apparently the vehicle is recently purchased.
There are no warrants and there's no current registration available.
10-4.
Could you check the teletype boards for the last couple of days?
Seem to recall a teletype from California.
"A male and female black, and a male white wanted for a couple of murders."
"Speed up, Ray."
You'll make him suspicious.
"Speed up, slow down..."
Make up your fucking mind!
Have you found that teletype yet?
"Still looking, 5-42."
10-4.
5-42.
I'm going to go ahead and pull them on over.
(SIREN WAILING)
RAY:
Fuck!
What are we going to do?
I'll blow his goddamn head off.
PLUTO:
We're gonna pull over.
We're going to be cool.
We're going to play it by ear.
We're not going to kill him unless we have to.
(SIREN WAILS)
We're not going to be stupid.
See your license and registration?
Hi.
It's you again.
"You've got a California license, and New Mexico plates and registration."
Abby and I were getting along so well.
You should stay longer.
"- You know, she would love it."
- I'm sorry.
"Thank you, John."
"I can catch a cab out here, right?"
I'm off in a couple of minutes.
I'll drive you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Dr. Kovac.
Dr. Meyers.
Please.
"So, what brings you here?"
Dr. Weaver.
She told me to come.
"Well, why do you suppose she wanted us to meet?"
- You tell me.
"- Well, that's not quite how it works."
"Hey, you' re a doctor."
"Someone comes to me with a problem, I tell them how to fix it, so..."
- Let's start with you telling me-
- My problem?
What's on your mind?
My family died during the war in Croatia.
So I came to America.
"I had a relationship with someone I cared about, which I then ruined."
So I started to look for the answers in the wrong places.
"You know, like sex, drinking, living fast."
"I killed a patient I should have saved, then I almost killed a medical student in a car crash, so- Woke up one morning and everything I thought I had was gone."
Gone or broken.
"So, what do you have for that?"
You destroyed the logs
Only the bark is scratched
The inside is still intact
You savages!
How many times do I have to tell you?
What?
You wanna fight?
The paths are slippery because of rain
He nearly lost his life slipping down a slope
Where is your log?
Slipped into the ravine
Slipped?
Do you know how expensive it is?
Pihu!
Yoshimura!
Chief Mouna...
Sir Yoshimura?
You're looking at me at such a disrespectful angle
Aren't you afraid of being stabbed blind?
Who do you think you are?
You're not the boss here in Mehebu
I am!
You will not get paid today
The precious logs are destroyed
Do it again and you'll have to pay for the loss
- Keep working!
- With what?
We get nothing from working for you
What do you want us to pay with?
Pihu!
"- Chief Mouna, he..."
- I saw it
"Oh, no."
Is that blood?
Or wine?
"Wait, blood or wine?"
Blood or wine?
"Uh, that's wine."
That's blood.
We had fun last night.
"Uh, why are you wearing my wedding dress?"
It was the only way to keep you from putting it on again.
"Whoa, why am I sore?"
Did we get drunk and do Pilates?
"No, we did jump in that guy's convertible, and you missed."
"Oh, I was wrong."
That is blood.
"Whoa, I sent some texts I am going to regret."
Who is Johan?
I was texting all night with some guy named Johan.
I gotta go home and rehydrate so I can cry.
"No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't go, no."
"You're single, I'm single, our day is free, right?"
"We could go to spin class, or biking, or horseback riding..."
Wh... why do you hate my vagina?
"Ah, all right, just let me get out of this blood-soaked wedding dress."
And that is not the first time I've said that sentence.
"Okay, so that's Johan."
He's bleeding too.
Ah.
Surprise!
I got us an alarm system.
"Yeah, that's an awesome thing to do to a guy who just got mugged."
Scare him in his own house.
- Countdown to show time.
- Yeah.
"- Wait, seriously."
- Look at your little face.
Are you sure?
"This is for posterity, you know."
Okay.
"Anyway, here's my face."
- There's Ari's face.
- I love...
"This is why I love Norah and Caroline, because they love each other."
- It's very sweet.
- We love each other.
That's a cool shot.
It is rare that you get real female...
True female friendship in movies right now.
"Because usually what we get is, sort of, mean girl behavior."
- Yeah.
- It's so true.
"Even, you know..."
"- I'm sorry, you go."
"- No, you go."
"No, I was just gonna say that with Tris, too I feel like even though she come..."
"In certain moments, she comes across as being like you know, antagonistic to Norah or whatever."
But she's just as vulnerable as Norah and Caroline and just wants to be...
- She's human.
"...accepted, like everybody else."
- That's pathetic.
- She does...
It's not like they're never gonna see each other.
"I mean, they all go to school together."
"Caroline and Tris are friends, sort of."
- Stay close to your sets.!
- Oh!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!
You're not gonna die!
Relax!
Keep shooting!
Think of my Emmy!
"Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"
Monkeys.
Fix this damn thing.
Whoo!
Hammond seems to be...
"Bill, Wendy, can you see this?"
Hammond is leading the pursuit in a giant game of ring-around-the-rosy.
"Jack, you anti-hero, if you're going to get away, get away now."
"Bill, this is really ridiculous."
"It's pretty clear now that this guy, Jack Hammond... is just toying with the police."
I hope they put him away for a long time.
- You are dead serious about going with me?
- Serious as a heart attack.
"You are absolutely, positively, 100% sure about this?"
I have never been more sure about anything in my entire life.
- We'll be fugitives.
- Sounds exciting.
- You won't be Natalie Voss anymore.
- Who the hell is she anyway?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But you're going to give up everything for me?
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm doing it for me too.
Why won't you give him the money?
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy""?"
I don't see how that would....
I guess it wouldn't be a good idea.
I guess it would be better just to put me in jail and forget about your five-year-old son.
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
Everything's real cool.
"Ray, where are you calling from?"
What's the name of the gas station?
"Ray, you missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
You turn right at this place called Cothern's Bait Shop.
There's a little road there.
"You're not far, baby."
Just about ten minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
"Is that the road, Byron?"
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?
"When they arrive, get them in the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, talk to them."
Let them see everything is okay.
Then stay in the kitchen until I say to come out.
"Then if they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
Then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
Is that the road you took?
Don't go in there fucking around.
In and out.
You got me?
The Treasure of Atlantis lies somewhere in that crater.
Looks inviting.
"The last time they had a major eruption, it destroyed half the island, along with Atlantis."
Beautiful.
Simon?
Simon!
"Oh, God, no."
This is Cleeve's doing.
"He has a concussion, possibly a subdural hematoma."
"I can do more when we get him to a hospital in Athens, but he's too weak to move."
All I can do now is make him comfortable.
"Well, don't worry."
I'll stay with him.
(speaks in Greek)
(speaks in Greek)
Looks like he's going to be all right.
And the doctor's going to stay with him until he's well enough to be moved.
But all the maps and the charts of the volcano have gone.
Damn.
Cleeve and Zavros are probably in the crater by now.
"Tonight the planets align, and they'll steal the treasure."
And it's all my fault.
I wish I'd never heard of Atlantis.
That's weird.
What?
The lid.
It's not magnetic.
How can that be?
"Well, I don't know."
W-what are you doing?
"Trust me, professor, trust me."
It's platinum.
"Enjoy your meal, everyone."
Enjoy your meal.
Calm down.
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included nonviolence?
I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Well, be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
(SCOFFS)
You don't understand us at all.
TRIS:
"No, I do understand you."
I understand that you think you can stay out of this.
But you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
FOUR:
"Tris, Tris... (INHALES DEEPLY)"
FOUR:
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can leave.
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
I will not be a party to violence.
FOUR:
And no one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
One what?
That's right.
She's Supermac 88.
"Salute her, 99!"
How come everybody's more senior to me?
"Dumplings, you're..."
"Dad, where's your sense of history?"
Many heros place righteousness above family.
I shouldn't have give birth to you!
Tell them to drop their arms!
Don't mind me.
"For the Emperor, get the 'Beast'!"
If all Chinese were like you.
Where would we be today?
How can we fight one another?
When we're faced with a common enemy?
"If you can kill your own people, go right ahead."
What's the matter?
We want to become women!
We could easily run out of men!
Why don't you give me a chance to become woman too?
Father!
This story is getting too female chauvinistic!
Can I have the Formula now?
Get rid of them!
I'll give this to the American for you.
"My mission is completed, I'll go wherever you go."
"Yoyo, you can't come with me!"
Why not?
Because I've promised him.
Him?
I feel sorry for you too!
"Robin, thanks for coming to see me off!"
- I expect Malaparte knows for sure...
Thank you.
- How much is it?
- Ten liras.
Thank you.
"Yes, understood."
Alright.
Thank you.
"Wow, a Renaissance banquet... in the middle of the Second World War."
"Thanks to my modest contribution, we should be able to avoid... those terrible meat rations and canned pineapple."
ldiot!
"What are you doing, Sergeant?"
"Excuse me Captain, but Private Prewitt... had a regrettable case of Mussolini's revenge."
And it was sudden!
"Right, continue, Sergeant."
But get out of there!
Damn it!
"Stop, there are landmines!"
They'll be killed!
"My god, Prewitt!"
Let me see.
- Are you a medic?
"- No, but I know what to do."
Then get your hands off him!
Give me something to cover him with.
"Why waste time on that, Captain?"
- We have to get him to the hospital!
- There have been many cases like this.
"If we move him, he'll have a cruel death before we get him to the hospital."
"If we make him comfortable, the pain will pass."
- He'll die in his sleep.
- Like a dog!
I'm not doing it either.
Kenny?
[mumbles]
"All right, we promised."
We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.
I swear.
[mumbles]
"Okay, good."
What happened?
I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
I tried.
Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
You didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was the wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and democratic west side.
"East side, west side, whatever side you're on as long as we care about each other we can still have some fun"
"Oh, man."
[singing]
"Oh, good kids."
God!
This's sucks!
"Do you feel like maybe you l-l-loosing her, S-Stan?"
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
Maybe you should just talk to her.
"You know, a little conversation."
Tell her what you feel.
"Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burning in sky, do you like--"
Stop!
"Excuse me, you've got a tag here."
I can't get it.
Where the fuck is my eyelash collar?
I get so mad.
These stupid people...
Here it is!
We're gonna do it this time!
We're gonna...
I think maybe we should get back out there.
We've got some time left.
They won't be finished for a while.
I'm gonna sew you out.
It's hideous out there.
I can't take it anymore.
I just walked off.
"I don't feel well, Paul."
I just wanna go home and cuddle off with you.
"Okay, I'II..."
- I'm gonna get your car.
- You're so sweet to me.
- I had a great time the other day.
- Me too!
I loved working with you at the shoot.
And I think we make great walking partners
- We should consider the marathon.
"- Listen, Jocelyn..."
I think you are amazing... and I loved... that walk with you as well... and I loved hanging out with you on the shoot... and God only knows I'm always so happy when I see your face...
I think we make great friends...
But...
Resin is a little pissed off because that I see so much of you... and I realized that...
I just hope I wasn't giving you the wrong idea.
No.
Thank you ...wonderful to be here.
Excuse me...
"Wow, you could have made an effort, Georgie."
Kill me now.
Hey!
"Oh, hey!"
Funny little dress.
"Such a little bitch, though."
"Ok, who wants to get high?"
"That's not very much for 3, is it?"
"Uh, we're gonna do blowbacks."
Blowbacks?
"What, what?"
Blowbacks.
What is that?
Who's got a light?
I've got a light.
"Thank you, thank you!"
Thank you for coming.
Everyone...
Thank you for supporting the Foundation.
"As you all know well, this auction is part of the Clios heritage."
And we are so glad to see the same familiar faces every year.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you and of course, we thank Georgina for the pleasure of this beautiful location, which is very dear to my heart."
Let's celebrate our beloved Constantine by having a good time tonight.
"Adele LeTissiet, leading light of the international opera scene."
Georgie?
Is everything...
Georgie?
What is this?
Is this live?
"Oh, my God, you are fucking hardcore!"
That was a close one.
Too close.
The little tramp!
"Ah, she's better than I thought."
"Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure."
"Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles."
Triton's daughter will be mine' And then I'll make him writhe.
I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook!
Eric?
If I may say... far better than any dream girl is one offlesh and blood... one warm and caring and right before your eyes.
Ariel!
"Ariel, wake up!"
Wake up!
I just heard the news!
"Congratulations, kiddo, we did it!"
Ooh.
What is this idiot babbling about?
"Right, as ifyou two didn't know, huh?"
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince... gettin' himself hitched this afternoon'
"You know, he's getting married."
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!
"Well, now, Eric."
It appears that I was mistaken.
"This mystery maiden ofyours does, in fact, exist."
A-And she is lovely.
"Congratulations, my dear."
We wish to be married as soon as possible.
"Oh, yes, ofcourse, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know."
"This afternoon, Grimsby."
Turn around.
MacPherson is alive and he's loose somewhere in the world.
- Stopping MacPherson is not your job!
- My what?
Protecting the world happens to be my job!
And right now that is being threatened by an insane ex-Warehouse agent who is competing for artifacts that belong right out there.
Mrs. Frederic said that she will handle it.
I can do it.
He ran a sword through your chest.
- I'm all right.
- You could have died.
"Please just let Mrs. Frederic handle it, okay?"
This?
"This is your job, Artie."
And you're not doing it.
"You have Pete, Myka, and Claudia spread out through the Warehouse taking inventory for you day after day."
"- Meanwhile, all..."
"- Meanwhile, these things are piling up."
"Yes, they are."
I'm pretty hard to kill.
Really?
Really?
You want some of this?
Nice one.
Did not see that coming.
- Playing with yourself again?
- One game.
A quickie.
We got time.
"Besides, none of this stuff's going anywhere."
"Right, buddy?"
"Okay, this stuff is dangerous, all right?"
"Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man!"
- Louis!
- Ow.
- What are you doing?
"- Well, I was just, uh..."
"- I'm sorry, madame."
- [Huffs]
"You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom."
Something in the way of a tour.
"[Chuckles] I'm sorry, Grim."
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about.
You need to get out.
- Do something.
Have a life.
- Shh!
- Get your mind off...
"- Easy, Grim, easy."
"It's not a bad idea, if she's interested."
"Well, what do ya say?"
Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
Wonderful!
"Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate."
"- [Max barks] - [Whistles] Come here, boy."
- [Barks] - [Eric growls]
"This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life."
"I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady."
"Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you."
"Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best."
"You gotta bat your eyes, like this."
"You gotta pucker up your lips, like this."
Hmm.
DuBois.
DuBois.
It's a French name.
"It means ""woods,"" and blanche means ""white""  so the two together mean ""white woods""  like an orchard in spring."
You can remember it by that if you care to.
"You are stella's sister, are you not?"
Yes.
stella is my precious little sister.
I call her little in spite of the fact that she's somewhat older than I am.
"Oh, just slightly."
Less than a year.
will you do something for me?
Sure.
"Yes, what?"
I bought this adorable little paper lantern at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.
Put it over the light bulb.
"will you, please?"
I'd be glad to.
I can't stand a naked light bulb any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action.
"well, I guess we strike you as being a pretty rough bunch."
I'm very adaptable to circumstances.
"well, that's a good way to be."
-You're not--?
-Married?
"Oh, no."
"No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher."
"You may be a schoolteacher, but you're certainly not an old maid."
"Why, thank you, sir."
I appreciate your gallantry.
So you're in the teaching profession.
Yes.
-Yes.
No kid of mine is going to hand me any lip!
I didn't sweat half my life in a steel box to come out and get this from you!
You're Joe!
"Joe Krozac, jr., Understand?"
And you and I are going back to that dame -your mother-
"She'll tell you that I'm your father from first to last, understand ?"
- Yes.
- You gonna behave ?
Sure.
"Sure, I am."
Come on.
We got to get out of this.
Dig in under.
That's what you do with a haystack.
Did you leave any money for the eggs?
"Boy, you sure got funny ideas."
But you and I are going to get along all right.
We won't have any more beefs on each other.
I hope not.
'Cause you got brains.
"You know, I like brains around me."
"Your angle on digging last night, you know?"
"And this fire, with the poles and everything-"
Where did you learn that kind of stuff?
From dads.
"You see, he taught me all about camping out like this."
"You see, we went on a camp hike last month-"
"Come on, come on."
Let's get moving.
- We had a race to see who could-
"- Come on, come on."
"catch the most fish, and he caught 20 bass and pickerel, and that only made-"
- Or he wanted us...
"- Oh, man."
I remember that.
- He made me...
I smelled something.
- Everyone had to do it.
- We all had to do it.
- That's so right.
"And then, like, there were times where in the bathroom scene you were like, ""Girls, it's a great opportunity for like bathroom humor."""
"- Oh, my God."
"- And we were all like, ""What?"""
It was 5 in the morning and the three of us looked at you:
"""No, we're not gonna do that."""
I think it's relatable to an audience to witness someone else smell something bad.
"- Oh, God."
- It is.
Think about it.
I remember talking to you about this when you're like:
"""Why is it my instinct to make someone else smell something bad?"""
Right.
"And then inevitably somebody says, ""Here, smell this."""
Speaking of smelly things.
- How did you feel about this foot...
"- Oh, God."
- Nice one.
"- Oh, Alexis' foot, doesn't..."
- She's an extremely pleasant...
"- That's her real foot, right?"
- That's a stunt foot.
- Right.
"- No, that's really Alexis' foot."
- That's an Alexis foot.
We don't have time.
HENRY:
We should take the time.
"If we're going to be in a relationship, we want to get off to a good start."
You know what?
Why don't we just hang out here?
Do you like board games?
"Henry, I really want to see the movie."
The 7:30 movie.
"What you want, Dylan, is very important to me."
But what your parents want is just as important.
Good man.
Nice to get some respect.
You sleep on the bed.
Let the girls sleep on these.
"Okay, I'm sure they won't mind."
Thank you so much for letting them come over.
Letting them?
"Honey, this is your house, too, and your friends are always welcome here."
I'm so happy you made some friends.
I know how lonely you've been.
"Yeah, my old friends kind of abandoned me."
"Ah, who needs them?"
You're a darling girl.
You're smart and you're a lot of fun.
You girls have a good time tonight.
"Now, I've got pizzas and salad, there's some fruit, popcorn, cookies."
There's some leftover chicken.
I can make some flautas and guacamole.
Whatever you want.
I think the pizza and the salad will be enough.
Thank you so much.
Where do you hail from?
Suburban narcotics squad.
Sick of smashing syringes?
You could say that.
"Klein is sulking, stay with him."
Don't chat with the enemy.
We're enemies?
"bri/OCU, it's an old rivalry."
- Aren't we a big family?
- So they say.
She's private property.
Klein's?
Who else?
How could you be pals with him?
He wasn't always like this.
Their names?
Winterstein.
Bruno and Rolf.
The one who did me was Bruno.
Christo warned me:
"""Your big mouth will get you in trouble."""
Now it has.
"7 vans in 1 8 months 9 conveyors slaughtered, and a 2 million Euro booty."
The Ministry of the lnterior sent us a memo.
"Asking us, and I quote:"
"""to tackle the problem head on"
"""and neutralize the criminals"
"""who've derided our forces for too long."""
"""Too long"" is bad!"
"Means we've been around for too long, doing nothing!"
As of today you're on duty 24 hours a day!
"Drop your personal problems, don't laze on Sundays, go out and nab that gang of fuckers before they strike for the 8th time!"
"Before that, I was living here in Trnje for 30 years."
I know every house and street.
I kept knocking at the doors around to ask.
I'm sentimentally attached to this area.
So I decided to try my luck in Paromlinska street.
"So, this is how you came to me?"
People decide to rent their room after they've been suggested to do so.
I thought you were the one.
I don't know.
You have confused me.
Maybe I should tell you something about myself?
I'm retired for disability.
I was a land surveyor.
I could pay as much as you want.
I can make money in another way.
"Leave it, that's not..."
"I'm peaceful, too."
I don't play cards or bring women home.
I don't even drink or smoke.
"I'm mostly out, I even eat there."
"- That's ok, but I don't know..."
It is so suddenly.
"Understand me, I can't just do it right away."
You don't have to decide immediately.
I'll come in a day or two.
You think about it.
Ok?
- I don't know...
"Well, day or two, that would be fine."
Good.
"So, there is a chance, eh?"
"See you in a couple of days, then."
Who's going to bed?
"Uh, you are, tough guy."
- Come on.
- Ow!
Ow!
Child abuse!
Child abuse!
"Oh, you think that's child abuse?"
You haven't even...
How about that?
What about that?
What about one of these?
"Stand still, you little booger."
Ugh!
"I'm telling you, just give me the big knife and this will all be over."
"Harriet, dear, you have taken a tomato sandwich to school with you..."
With mayonnaise.
...with mayonnaise every day for that past five years.
Don't you want a little variety?
Nope.
Not even cream cheese with olive?
Yum-yum-yum!
Or how about pastrami?
Roast beef?
"How about the fancy cucumber kind, with the crust cut off?"
"Mom, I can't help it if I know what I like."
And I know that I like tomato.
After school spy route...
Hong Fat's Food Emporium
"Holy cats, a veggie thief."
This must be investigated thoroughly.
"Frankie, you took the truck last week."
"Well, then, do it."
Only this time it's for life.
I'll make sure of it.
"You were never gonna set me free, were you?"
"Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've only cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks from upstairs.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela that's her name she's gonna be down here dancing a cumbia on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
Sorry.
Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows..."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where there's shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
Is that why you're here?
Yeah.
I left him.
Poor guy.
He messed up.
Stupid guy.
"Well, I like to think of myself as the easygoing type but..."
"Well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
Boys!
Are special in theyr own way!
Girls!
Are special like the birthday
And always we dancing and singing alone here he comes [sings] [sings] [sings]
Who the hell is that?
That's Braden Gueermo.
We
Sings and dances better than anybody.
He's already seen HM3 over a hundred times.
Everyone is special in their own--
Special in their own way
"Let it out, party people"
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Yeah.
"I guess, we better check that movie out."
[singing]
This-- is cool?
[singing]
This is cool?
"We are really getting old, you guys."
[singing]
It says that DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and they did 80 millions in opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out guys."
"If this is much cool today, I'm done."
I no longer have any connections with this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing this."
That'll be my signal to go for the shotgun.
I'll try not to fire.
You know how adrenaline can be.
"Yeah, well, you won't get a shot off, but thanks for the concern."
You just worry about making it all look good for the camera and making sure you're alone.
I'll be alone.
Katie:
What I told you about Amanda's mother is true.
Her name was Alice.
She was my friend.
What I did not tell you was she was a grifter.
"After she died,"
Amanda moved in with Marius and me.
"A few months later, Marius... found another partner and took off."
"He'd say it was because I lost focus, but..."
I think it was because of the way he grew up.
He didn't like the idea of a kid-around life.
"Anyway, I got off the grift."
I met you.
And I never saw him again.
I swear to God I never saw him again until he showed up here a few days ago.
You could be conning me right now.
"No, no."
No.
Don't touch me.
Don't...
But...
I swear to you that this... is real.
Okay?
You are what... is important to me.
"Listen, Pedro, I love you."
"You know what's real right now, honey?"
- Isn't that true?
"- Yes, it's-- it's correct, but I-"
- I'm deeply...ashamed.
"So you get angry, and you take revenge."
That's what you do.
"You did it to a woman that you loved, and now you're doing it to the company that fired you."
- That's not a question.
- No.
Here's the question.
"Yes or no, the model on the blueprints that you were just talking about, did any of them have the Borns Tech name or any identifying markings on them?"
"Not that I know of, no."
They could have been made by anybody.
"I mean, for all we know, they could be Ryan Larson's design."
"I mean, yes, but that-- that wouldn't be feasible."
Yes.
I suppose so.
Nothing further.
[street noises]
[footsteps]
Hi.
I went by your office.
"I saw your stuff was still there, so I figured you might have come up here."
Clever of me.
Here.
It's liberating to do the wrong thing sometimes.
Most of the time.
What generation of feminism are we up to now?
Fifth wave?
Or sixth?
I don't-
- I've lost count.
I do know that it is still... really hard.
Never mind the issue of proof...
I will never allow his wrongdoing to succeed!
-How do you see the outcome of this race?
-How confident do you feel?
Thanks to the absence of Mac...
I now have great hopes of winning the title.
What about Black Eagle?
I've never even heard of him.
So it may safely be said that I will be the one to win the championship.
What's that?
Mac!
So you are going to participate in the race after all?
"Yes, this is the prototype of my missing engine."
"I had kept it at a friend's place, so it wasn't destroyed in the fire."
"It may be not as powerful as the other one, but I'll race with it."
"Good luck to you, Mac."
I'll do what little I can.
You're right.
Let's do our best.
Am I in time?
"It's really a fine day for flying, isn't it?"
Has Moriarty appeared?
"No, not yet."
Please take care of Mrs. Hudson.
I'll fly with Mac.
Right.
"Finally, the moment has come for me to show the world... that my ""Crow"" is Number One!"
Here!
Here!
I can't wait to see who's going to win the championship.
"Are you ready, Mrs. Hudson?"
Yes.
Let's go.
I look like Kermit the frog.
"Oh, God."
"Artie, stop doing that!"
"Yeah, I gotta tell you, Myka, those really bring out your eyes."
"This is a, uh, 14th century Chinese firework"
Known as an ice flower.
Very few-- very few like it left.
Now...
"Do not tell Mrs. Frederic that I did this, all right?"
"All right, we've got about ten minutes, more or less."
Let's go.
The light pattern triggers a feedback loop
In the optic nerve that mesmerizes the viewer.
They won't remember a thing.
Booga-booga.
"Whoa, freaky McFreakerson."
So it's some sort of reverse chemical reaction?
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, take these off."
Just don't look directly through the window.
This was made by an implosion grenade.
It removes matter from the center of a space
And pulls everything-- Obviously everything--
Directly towards it with violent force.
This explains why they couldn't find the sword.
It could be in there.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no."
"No. the sword, long gone."
Stolen.
This was used by the thief as a cover.
- So the guy that I saw--
"You know, I've always tried to be there for you."
"I was off making the money, they money that is in that trust fund."
I guess I hoped that you'd be there for me now.
"Well... it's up to you now, isn't it?"
"Excuse me, Amelia?"
Let me guess.
"You want to audition, and you're looking for advice."
"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe lose 20 pounds and sleep with the choreographer."
"Actually, I'm not a dancer."
I'm a journalist.
"I'm from ""Interview"" Magazine."
They told me you were ready to talk to me.
"Wait, you're from ""Interview""?"
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you...
"I mean, you're so young."
"Well, I could say the same thing about you."
I'm 17.
"In this business, that's about a year away from being pushed out."
"And here I was, expecting I would have to talk to some old person."
"Nope, just me."
Cool.
"Look, I want to apologize."
- No need.
- It's just...
It's not what it looks like.
"Oh, it's not?"
Because it looks like you're married.
"Yes, but it's an open marriage."
We both want to be with other people.
Really?
That's not just a lie so you don't look like a snake?
When?
"I mean, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight some of these people will never talk to me.
And what happens next year?
"What, she does this next Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair."
"Well, what else can you do?"
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer and not face the damage she's done.
- Wait.
"That's not true, is it?"
- No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
"Well, here's something new."
"I told Chuck I loved him, again."
"And he didn't say it back, again."
"- Blair, I'm not gonna tell people that."
- I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
- Don't wanna be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school.
- Look what it almost made me do.
- That's the thing.
You need to be cool to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart.
She got her head chopped off.
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
"Keep your eye on the prize, Jenny Humphrey."
"You can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you."
For what it's worth you're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want to show your appreciation somehow?
I suppose I could do that.
"After all, it would be rude of me to turn down a..."
"Oh, Larry, small but eager."
I'm going to need a serviette.
Hmmmm...
"Ah, thank God for rigamortis."
Councillors.
I eat you.
Brother.
Brother.
"I'm feeling really good, Sam."
Full of hope.
My spirit bear put me through an exercise program.
"Really worked my core, eh?"
"Good morning,"
I have and important announcement which will change the outcome of this trial.
Oh...
This may be very good for us.
I think we're gonna get a retrial.
"I'm beginning trust you, Sam Murray."
As you know someone has stolen my first and second-string gavels.
Now today my wife needs the hammer that I've been using as my third-string gavel for one of her projects.
Bird house.
"Which is all to say, you're looking at it:"
Today's gavel.
"All right, look, look."
It's just gonna have to do.
What a travesty this is turning into.
"Your honour, may I approach the bench?"
Yes.
- Shut up!
Who are you?
You come in here with your fancy lipstick and your fake name.
- How do I know you don't work for those guys?
"- Eddie, just stop!"
- Shut the fuck up.
- You don't.
"But let me tell you about when I was a little girl, and Amancio killed my whole family and took me out of my pueblo."
"Or the thousands of innocents he sacrificed, or the many, many years I was his slave."
"But at the end of the day, does it really matter?"
Because the only way for you to trust me is for you to believe that I want him dead as much as you want his money.
"So, what do you say, Eddie?"
"I say you broke the code, kid."
"Oh, that fuck!"
Where's my shit?
!
- Seth took it.
- He what?
- I knew he was up to somethin'.
"- And I can tell you where,"
- but I want in on the job.
"- What is this, a potluck?"
!
"Eddie, look, okay?"
"I know you're pissed, and you have every right to be."
I messed up.
Gimme a chance to make this right.
"Larry, Larry."
Lawrence.
"Come on, man."
You gotta stop taking things so personally.
- You put my partner in traction.
"I was, uh, behind enemy lines in France."
"First, it doesn't feel like anything."
Adrenaline's good that way.
"Then, it was burning."
White hot.
I was trying to help a family of Jews.
Police didn't like that.
You know about the Jews?
About the Nazi Master Plan?
All those trains taking them East every day.
"They're not being ""resettled."""
They're being exterminated.
Five thousand Jews per train.
Ten trains per day.
You do the math.
"Your father, he's in charge of running the train schedules for the German Transport Ministry, right?"
He's very good at his job.
Very efficient.
How'd you get captured?
My plane was shot down.
You survived.
What about your crew?
I always wanted to learn how to fly.
Must be something up there.
"Everything looking so small, like tiny little pieces on a board game."
It's not a game.
"Real men, dying every day."
"And I'm being moved from camp to camp, for what?"
- It doesn't make sense anymore.
- You won't eat.
- Why are you still fighting?
- I fight for my country.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"My dad died, and..."
"Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
- Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"All right, then stand up."
Easy.
I love standing up.
"Yeah, you're staying here."
"Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
That's not happening.
"All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
Vending machine at a rest stop.
Give me that.
No.
INTERVIEWER:
"So Lloyd, do you think that this body burn will"
"Be better than ""Terror Firmer""?"
You're up.
[Screaming]
--[sigh] Nothing could be that good.
[Laughs]
Nothing could be that unbelievable.
Not since the Vietnam Buddhist priest
Was there such a flame up.
INTERVIEWER:
So how do you guys do this?
How do you light him on fire?
Carefully.
[Interposing voices]
Come over here.
I'll show you where to do that.
"We have Nomex underwear, two pairs,"
In here soaking in fireproof gel.
[Church bells ringing]
This should be the soundtrack!
"Then we have a Nomex jumpsuit over here, which doubles"
For his janitor costume.
"We get that all on him, all gelled up,"
His face and hair gelled up.
Then we put on lighter fluid and rubber cement.
Light him on fire.
He runs around like a maniac.
And we extinguish him down here.
"Maybe you should practice it now, before he"
Gets the stuff on him.
"Give me $200 each, for your own protection."
And I'll forget the insult.
You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me!
Otherwise the cops will come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.
Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole
- I'll take a little less.
"And by less, I only mean - a hundred bucks less."
Now don't refuse me.
"Understand, paisan?"
I understand.
My friends and I share all the money.
"So first, I have to talk to them."
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.
Don't be afraid to tell them!
600 bucks...
Suppose we don't pay?
"You know his gang, Tessio."
Real animals.
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood.
"He's got connections with the cops, too."
We have to pay him.
$200 each...everybody agreed?
Why do we have to pay him?
"Vito, leave this to us."
"He's one person, we're three."
"He's got guns, we've got guns."
Why should we give him the money we sweated for?
This is his neighborhood!
I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci.
Who?
"Nah, that's not a bullet wound."
"Damn it, Lyle."
"Yes, it is."
Then where's the bullet?
I haven't found it.
"You don't have a bullet, you don't have a bullet wound."
She could've hit anything falling into the water.
"A rock, a nail-- anything."
But she didn't.
It wasn't suicide.
It was murder.
"Melvin, I'm startin' to worry about ya."
Beautiful dead girl naked under a sheet.
Must have a way of makin' a man think strange.
Sam.
"Don't lose your cool, Sam."
"Melvin, this is nothin' more than an unfortunate case of suicide."
Bury the poor girl.
"If it was suicide, where's the gun?"
She wasn't shot.
I'm the coroner.
I say she was.
"If it was a suicide, the gun is probably in the water near the dock."
Maybe the gun's in the lake.
If she shot herself-- and I don't believe that she did-- then the gun must have fallen into the water.
That lake's near freezing'.
You want me to send a man into that icy water lookin' for a gun that's not even there.
"If the gun is there, then you're right about the suicide."
And then...
I'll bury her.
"Okay, Melvin."
I'll look for the gun.
I feel like it's my job to tell you the honesty.
Nobody else has.
Nobody else can.
"It's rare to find these things out, and also upsetting."
These little glasses.
Let me see these things.
"Oh, yeah, we have the exact same affectation."
Mm-mmh...
Ah...
Emily.
Erm...
Seems like a less than ideal place to carry on.
Is it 'cause you have a girlfriend?
You mentioned her in an interview.
It's because it's gauche to grope and kiss in public.
"You really don't remember meeting me, do you?"
I had a photo shoot in that same place when my first book came out.
I gave you a copy of it.
"You acted like you were better than some first-time author nobody had ever heard of, even though you were probably still in college."
"I wrote my number in it, twice."
I really honestly don't remember meeting you.
"Sorry, but I remember you now."
"Oh, of course you do."
OK.
I'll call you.
(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
ASHLEY:
Where were you?
Out.
"So, my meeting with Ike today..."
"Oh, so he's Ike now?"
- With Zimmerman.
Marion's dead.
"Yes, I know."
And me!
And me!
I'm sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
Uh-oh.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:
"A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher."
"In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They made their calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp."
"The Well of the Souls, huh?"
"Come, come, look."
Look here...
look.
Sit down.
"Come, sit down."
What is it?
This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
"What about the height of the staff, though?"
Did Belloq get it off of here?
Yes.
It is here.
Discipline and complaints.
Open up.
Now!
"What are you doing to my guests, Jack?"
No one's drinking.
They've all brought their cars.
You should have warned them in advance that I was a copper.
But then of course we might have been alone.
"Would you get me some more orange juice, it's in the fridge."
Yes ma'am.
Thank you.
"Oh, dear, this is no way to do it."
I should have known better.
What?
"Well, I wanted to see you on my own."
"To talk, not about anything in particular, but without, I don't know, without feeling there were things about myself"
I couldn't say.
"But I lost my nerve and invited, it was like looking up the recipe for disaster and doubling the quantities."
"Well then, next time cut down on the invitations."
I wanted you to carve.
"Yes, of course, right."
What's that?
Oh excuse me.
"That's you getting me excited, that is."
My bleeper.
"Oh, I don't believe this."
"All right, what's going on."
I just got an urgent call.
Discipline and Complaints walked in here half an hour ago.
I tried to get hold of Mr. Mullett.
That's what it's about.
It's the soap.
Give my regards to Sion and Noa.
You...
Who would want to tell the princess anything about you?
You little... son of a...
Let me go!
Look at that!
Protect His Excellency!
"Let His Excellency, Field Marshal Klom withdraw!"
They're a bunch of damned fools!
"You are, too."
You Roland folk are all idiots.
Truly foolish and good for nothing.
"I can't stand it, so I'll bail you out."
"Hey, you sons of bitches!"
Save those Roland fools!
Prepare to fire large-scale magic!
"If we fire that in a situation like this, we'll hit our own people."
He should absorb the magic.
That can buy us some time!
Fall back!
Damn it...
Captain Milk!
Luke made you a delicious cake!
"Please come out, Captain Milk!"
Ryner Lute departed from his inn this morning and hasn't been seen since.
After Captain Milk visited him.
That directive...
Maybe I was wrong to have shown it to him.
I know that you're hiding.
How about showing yourself?
"So, what business might you have with me?"
Milk Callaud is in our custody.
- Yeah.
"- And you, just find out if anything unusual happened on the floor last 24 hours."
I'm taking all the new chips off the floor.
- Whoa.
That's big.
- You got a better idea?
- I can stick around and help.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was getting through to you.
Go home.
Okay.
I'm gonna be here another 20 minutes.
I gotta meet my accountant.
Go home.
Okay.
Here.
"Hey, um, tell the cage, uh, we're gonna switch out the chips."
"Yes, all of them."
"Ed, it looks like the only counterfeits are hundreds."
"So, what's going on?"
We're just changing our chips... to get our players' feedback on our color combinations.
"- Well, I prefer burgundy and taupe."
"- And you, sir?"
Only color I care about is green.
Know what I'm sayin'?
"Ed, they took us for over a million."
Percentage of counterfeits stayed consistent.
"What, they have a million of our money?"
Million point two.
"Also, I looked into anything unusual on the floor yesterday."
"Only thing was a blackjack dealer, Jerry Smoltz, who was dealing 75% winners for three straight hours."
MAN:
Clear it off the south perimeter!
MAN:
Here comes your dad.
The rooms here also--
What's the situation?
He's gonna kill the girl unless we call CNN and tell the world we're not alone.
You two were going to pick her up.
This was supposed to be easy.
It got a little complicated.
I'm handling it.
How?
.
"I say what I have to, promise him anything he wants."
Just make sure the girl doesn't get hurt.
No one's going to get killed here today.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You got a nice move to the post.
"That kid yesterday thought he could get one past you, but you were right there."
What I do is I fool myself.
I make myself believe I'm really going to cover.
"Because I believe it, he believes it."
How do you get yourself over to the post?
I don't know.
"I'm afraid if I ever stop to think about it, it won't work anymore."
Do you know why you're here?
Do you know what this is about?
"I'm not sure yet, but I think we're gonna find out soon."
"This is the year for the ""big ideas,"" right?"
( groans )
Hey...hey.
"He had a passion, a transmitted lustfulness,... a feeling which I had never experienced before."
-Are you still there?
-Yes.
-Are you alone?
"-Yes, but only momentarily."
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?
Your husband?
"-A peasant, but he's not here now."
-It's better that way.
Let's take advantage of that.
Touch yourself and imagine it to be my hand that fondles your sexy bits.
He was stronger than me and emerged spontaneously to satisfy... the unknown and the unseen.
I don't know.
"Are you doing it, Rosella?"
-Yes.
-Bravo.
"You are getting your caresses from me, you know."
-What are you touching?
-My breasts within my blouse.
-On top of my bra.
-Bring them out.
Moisten your fingertips with saliva... and wet your nipples.
Do you like it?
It is my hand that plays with you.
"-Tell me, if you like it."
"-Yes, I like it."
"Very good, continue and pretend that it is my hand, that fondles you."
Bloody hell!
"Rosella, my love, let me feel how wet you are between your legs."
"Feel it, my love."
My fingers just slipped into your panties.
Did a cop tell you that?
We need to get to the guy first.
He's in a hotel on rue Marcadet.
The Étoile d'Agadir.
You don't answer questions any more?
"Fuck, Gilou, I'm fighting for you!"
You want to end up in jail?
Let's go.
"Arnaud, are you aware that as an intern, you are allowed to follow a police investigation in the field?"
"Yes, I know."
"Our relationship being what it is, I suggest you take this opportunity."
"Thank you, but I'd rather stay here."
And I have seen enough of you.
You are starting tomorrow.
They are informed of your arrival.
"- Is everything all right, Marianne?"
"- It's nothing, Your Honour."
It's just the shelf collapsing.
"Wait, let me take care of it."
My husband has a safe in a bank on the Champs-Elysées...
"Average height, short dark hair."
Stocky.
This is a peaceful hotel.
I don't want any trouble.
"Please, answer."
"OK, your colleagues came yesterday."
Yesterday?
- Yes.
They took the man you're looking for.
What was his name?
He called himself Mr Bo.
Thank you.
It's an act of love.
It's the divine mystery itself.
"You must think I'm inexperienced, but I assure you,"
I was baptised in the brothels of Paris when I first arrived.
"But, um..."
"I'm so ill, and I have been for such a long time, and my body is such a great disappointment to me that I've already said goodbye to it."
I'm not really in it any more.
I'm just happier floating about in music.
"And if I should come back inside this miserable collection of bones, then I am afraid that it would probably collapse altogether."
Forgive me.
- I am ashamed.
"- No, no."
Forgive me.
"I'm a fraud, you know."
Divine mystery!
I've never experienced that with anyone.
I've always had disastrous relationships.
- I've never managed to stay in love.
- Why?
I don't know.
I want too much.
I think.
Except when I hear you play.
And when I'm around you.
Look...
I simply want to be with you.
The rest doesn't matter.
Really.
Do you think we could just...
be together?
Like this?
Yes.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
"Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
So everyone's just gonna watch us?
Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"Come on, man."
How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"No, those are actually always there... something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
NineNine!
"Chills, you guys."
"Literally, chills."
"Hey there, Nikolaj."
It's your papa.
"If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me."
Go for it.
Jeremy.
Jenna.
"Hey, what's, uh?"
- What's up?
- Regret.
Make sure you lock that up.
Did I just pass their driveway?
"Uh, I think it's up there."
This is an amazing car.
Did I pass?
- Um...
- The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
I don't know.
"You were reminiscing about the Elena years all night, so..."
"Caroline, that stuff came before, okay?"
It's not just gonna go away.
"- I know that, okay?"
- No.
"No, you don't."
Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.
"Look, it's my fault."
"I, you know..."
I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me.
"But all that talk, it was just two old friends and some memories."
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.
I was there because I wanted to be with you.
And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you're the only person I want to be in this car with right now.
I don't even know if this makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself...
"No, no."
I think you're doing just fine.
Ow!
You can have a job here if you work like everyone else.
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, dad."
"I know you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought..."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
"You haven't spoken with me for over a week, since..."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened... make the best of it.
Mother?
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed... pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
-You can't mean that.
-I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison, I was only trying to protect you."
I was an accident that you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What will you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job.
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
"Oh, God..."
"God, help me!"
Allison!
Allison!
I didn't want you to come down here.
I couldn't say good-bye to you.
-You know I don't want you to go.
"Well, I was mistaken."
I've got a pretty good steak knife...
Just try to help.
"You go out the front door, you hook a right."
"Then walk three blocks straight down, its on this side of the street."
You can't miss it.
- I'll go Daze.
- Why can't I?
"Because you look 12, and I've an ID."
We might actually checked in this part of town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone, and remember what I said."
Okay.
You guys need anything?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"I'm not supposed to really talk to you anymore, so..."
"Oh, wait!"
I think you got a phone message.
"But that's all I'm sayin', now I'm gonna zip."
You have one new message.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone...
Me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time.
Maybe three years.
What?
How's Jai?
I hope he gets his degree and settles down
Come in with the chequebook
We've been childhood friends.
Don't hesitate about money... if it concerns Jai's education.
He's my brother too
Please sign there
Here's a million.
ForJai.
Repayable when able
You have taken God's place for me on earth
How's Jagadish?
- Jagadish?
"Oh, he's fine"
"I'm sure he's going to make it bigger than Jai, despite his education here"
He's so fast!
Not even I can catch up with him.
He wants to outpace time
You'll know more once the principal has noted your attendance record
Do you know how many classes you attended this semester?
What a brilliant record!
You will see the principal at nine am tomorrow
Stop going around with that bunch.
"- I'll try to, sir"
Jags!
I'm dead!
Dad will kill me!
Why...?
Only you can do something!
We'll see tomorrow
Where are you going?
To class
"Yes, it is."
"Inside this skull is another universe... the biggest, scariest haunted house of them all."
"Elmer, will you hurry up and tell Dr. Hook how profound he is... so we can get inside this poor guy's noggin and reduce the cranial pressure?"
"Anyway, after I've paused to reflect on the gravity of what it is I am about to do... and only after I've done that, do I proceed with my mission."
"Yes, Doctor."
"Steady as you go, Otto."
"Patient to Nine, Neuro."
Standing by.
"You'll be fine, Mrs. D."
"Yeah, I will."
You tell Bobby not to worry.
Bye-bye.
These things are so slow.
Mommy.
Someone was crying in the Children's Ward?
"We call it Paediatrics these days, Mrs. Druse."
"Well, whatever you call it, it sounded like it was right on top of the elevator."
A little girl.
I see.
It's very hard to get a place in here.
A gusher!
Mop.
"Irrigation people, come on."
Don't let this man drown.
"Come on, you're up, Elmer."
"Jump in here, please."
- That's not my job.
- Your union steward is not on duty today.
"If you wouldn't mind jumping in, right about now."
"Come on, son."
Right there.
Very nice.
What ?
"Oh, no !"
A rabbit ?
"I found him in the garage, and he was limping."
Let me see.
Careful.
"Baby, come here."
Let me see.
"You know, he seems like he's okay."
Maybe it's just a sprain.
"No, I can't take a chance, okay ?"
I have to go get him help.
"Summer, you can't."
It's too dangerous.
"I cannot wait here any longer, okay ?"
I have a missing boyfriend and a sick rabbit.
I cannot listen to any more of your mother's whining.
"Okay, I'll go with you."
We'll brave the zombies together.
"Mom, we're going to need to take Pancakes to the hospital."
Wait.
"This carrion gets help, but not me ?"
"We don't have a car, you can't walk."
There is no way to get you there.
"Taylor, I risked my life and hoofed it all the way from Emerald Bay, and you're just going to leave me here to rot ?"
"I have an idea, but I don't think you're going to like it."
This is not okay with me.
"Well, I told you you wouldn't like it."
"Mom, it's not that far to the hospital, and it's kind of this or nothing."
"Fine, but I'm not holding the rabbit... unless you promise I can make a vest out of him."
Okay.
I'll carry Pancakes.
"Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth."
So it's just us guys.
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!
How's that?
A little too bright?
Good.
(MANSLEY CHUCKLES)
"Forgive me, Hogarth."
I wanted you to learn something.
What can I learn from you?
"You can learn this, Hogarth."
"That I can do anything I want, whenever I want, if I feel it's in the people's best interest."
"The giant metal man, where is it?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't?
Well.
Does this ring a bell?
No?
How about this?
"You've been careless, Hogarth."
It doesn't prove anything.
It's enough to get the Army here with one phone call.
- Then what's stopping you?
- (YELLS) Where's the giant?
"You can't protect him, Hogarth, any more than you can protect your mother."
My mom?
"Ah, it's difficult to raise a boy all alone."
We can make it more difficult.
"In fact, we can make it so difficult that it would be irresponsible for us to leave you in her care and all that that implies."
"- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth."
- You can't do that!
Are you talking about names?
"Fitzwallace, Leo and Ulysses S. Grant."
"Not for nothing, but before we go in there, I wanna be clear."
I didn't have to convince him or even suggest it.
"Right off the bat he said, ""Let's take my name off it."""
- Yeah.
- Leo?
The vice president.
Thanks.
You can go home now.
- I go home when you go home.
- I'll get back to you.
"Mr. Vice President, I like your style."
- It's money well spent.
- It deserved to have your name on it.
I've got my name on other stuff.
You know what I don't like?
I don't like we can't campaign on it.
- Can you sit for a minute?
- Yeah.
"I'm in a bind, and I think you know what it is."
"I'm sorry, I don't."
"I respect the anonymity of an alcoholic, I can't reveal what's said in a meeting but I've got a responsibility to the president, and in fact, to the country."
"Leo, I'm sorry."
I honestly don't know what you're saying.
- You've gotta tell the president.
- Tell him what?
- That you're an alcoholic.
- Are you telling me he doesn't know?
- How would he know?
- You didn't tell him?
Of course I didn't.
"Oh, what a whore she is."
This is despicable.
You are drunk.
My only regret is that I didn't put 20 francs on the mantelpiece the first time.
"I can assure you, monsieur, that Madame Sand will gain no money from you on my account."
Hm?
(JAUNTY MUSIC)
Eugene!
Where's angel fingers?
I've lost him.
- He's taking the Countess d'Agoult home.
- Oh.
"If you plan to invade Poland, you should know that the countess has placed her troops at the border."
What are you talking about?
- I read a love letter she wrote to him.
- What letter?
What did it say?
Marie's jealous of you.
She couldn't stand it if you got a better composer than hers.
I don't know why I dress up.
Nothing here but old men.
You should bring that Mallefille fellow with you.
- He's at Nohant tutoring the children.
- So you took my advice and kept him.
No.
It's all over with us.
- What does he say to that?
- Oh...
He threatens to kill me and himself if I leave him.
He's been reading too many of your books!
- Let's stop here.
"- Mama, it is too cold for you here."
Ruins with artifacts that have this kind of power are all over the world.
Spriggan!
What's that?
Look!
The ark!
Damn...
It's over.
Wake up Ominae!
you jerk.
Jean.
What?
I'm way too easy going.
I can still see that brat's dying face in my mind.
but that's what I like about you.
What did you say?
Just shut up hang on.
What's that?
!
That is the true figure of the ark.
The ark is breaking up!
It can't be!
We couldn't even scratch the thing!
Something must have been activated to have caused this!
Four thousand years of time... and returned to the void.
what about Yu and Jean?
look.
Yu!
You're alive!
The King's New Grammar School in Stratford upon Avon... where over 400 years ago a young lad named William Shakespeare... poured over his classical literature and history... and began to learn about the great names and events that had shaped the world.
"Today, Stratford has changed."
It's still the cozy market town of Shakespeare's day... but it has also become the epicenter of the 'Shakespeare World'.
I know that.
You're going to take over.
You're going to be the Don.
"If what I think has happened, has happened, I'm leaving here tonight."
I give you complete power.
Over Fredo and his men.
"Rocco, Neri, everyone."
"I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children, the future of this family."
"-If we catch them, will we find out..."
-We won't catch them.
"Unless I'm very wrong, they're dead already."
They were killed by somebody close to us.
Inside.
"Very, very frightened that they botched it."
You don't think that Rocco and Neri had something to do with this?
See...
All our people are businessmen.
Their loyalty is based on that.
One thing I learned from Pop was to try to think as people around you think.
"On that basis, anything is possible."
"Mike, they're dead!"
Right outside my window!
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!
Over here!
There's two of them.
Looks like they were hired out of New York.
I don't recognize them.
Won't get anything out of them now.
Fish them out.
Get rid of the bodies.
-Where's Mike?
"- Oh, yeah, those are ""plow me"" heels."
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old tatas.
Oh.
"Gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
Now let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face.
- Mmm.
- Hey.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone."" Am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"- That's my sister, Ted."
"- Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you."
Thi-This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York, Ted... and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way... that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"- My sweet, little, innocent..."
- Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
It wasn't a bronnection.
It was a sisnnection.
"Jasmine, please keep your hands off your partner's buttocks!"
Some of the girls are getting restless
Someone has to stay upstairs.
"Fine, you can take one couple downstairs but make sure you send people up to replace them."
You look....
Are you having fun?
"Yeah, it's great but, aren't you freaking out, a little bit?"
You're president of the sorority now.
- It's a pretty big decision.
- Not at all.
I did what I had to do and it's working just fine.
Relax!
I am!
Can I borrow your lovely sister for a moment?
- You really pulled it off
- I couldn't have done without you.
What now?
"I say if you can slip away, we see what the real party's like."
Hopefully it's some more of your naughty little clappers.
Dean Bowman?
What a surprise!
Come on in.
You're here!
I'm so glad!
How can I refuse an invitation to a party of the infamous Kappa Taus.
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all!
Let me have your coat.
"You know what, Cappie..."
Cappie can take his coat.
Who invited dean Bowman?
Me.
They're doing the best they can.
No.
I'm not griping about how they're treating the Deucalion.
I've just... given up on them.
On us?
On the Martians.
"The war's going in their favor a little bit, and they're wildly misinterpreting it."
That's terrifying.
I will drain the therapeutic fluid and bring Princess Asselyum to my castle.
Tell no one of this.
"Not even Princess Lemrina, of course."
- But why not-.
- Do as I say!
Forgive me.
I did not mean to startle you.
No visitors are allowed?
My sister's condition is that serious?
She...
Perhaps it was a miracle that she held on for this long.
How much time does she have?
Today?
Tomorrow?
They say that they still do not know.
It is just as possible that she will remain in this condition indefinitely.
I see...
I can guess what you are feeling.
"You may have mixed feelings, but she is your only sibling by blood."
"It is you who are truly sad, aren't you, Slaine?"
I must go.
Slaine...
"I forgive you, Slaine."
Even if you cry in front of me today.
I hope so.
"What do you mean, you hope so?"
"Well, lot of people come here for dogs, but there ain't always enough people to take all the dogs we got here."
We're only allowed to keep dogs here five days.
"We got a couple here now-- they been-been, uh, over the limit."
- Over the limit?
-Yeah.
"Well, what happens to them then, when they're over the limit?"
Got to be destroyed.
"Hey, wait a minute."
"You mean that dog I just brought in here, my dog,"
-is gonna be destroyed?
!
-Right.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, come back... (chuckles)"
Who do I see about getting a dog back?
"Uh, lost dog?"
"No, no, a puppy that I got here yesterday."
And my husband brought him back today and I want to get him right now.
"Well, you'll have to wait till Mr. McGreggor gets out here."
He'll be out in just a moment.
Come on.
- Ralph.
-Alice.
What are you doing with my puppy and these other dogs?
"Look, I hope you're not gonna get mad, but I fell in love with him."
And these other two are over their limit.
"Come on, I'll tell you all about it at home."
"Come on, Alice."
Can't wait to see these little ones.
This was the night when friendship was truly solidified.
"Because at the beginning of this scene, I'd thrown up into a plastic bag but still had to hold the gum in my mouth, and then gave the gum to you."
- So you had...
- And I put it in my mouth.
You had my ABC gum that had been sitting in my mouth with fake throw up.
"With fake barf and then I put it back in your mouth because we realized, that once it lost its flavor it was better that way."
- Of course.
- This is so sweet.
This is the...
People go... when they see this.
- No joke.
- I'll do it.
"We had Chinese food, like, three weeks ago..."
"Oh, Chinese."
"- Oh, I love Chinese."
- There it is.
- There it is.
- These kids are so adorable.
God.
"Let's talk about something, like..."
"What's on your little paper, Pete?"
- A reference paper for stories.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, let's whip it out."
- What's it say?
- Does anyone wanna talk about...
Talk about the gum.
When you guys shared the gum.
"- We just did that, Mike."
- Okay.
About Mike and Kat living in New York for the first time?
This was the first time that me and Kat lived in New York.
Please write it down.
Pen is not working.
Dad leave it.
"You just get to Pondi, and go to the Hotel Blue Diamond."
I'll will courier all the pictures and details.
Please Dad don't say bra and panty over there.
Let's see how's her design.
"I'm a designer, You'll see Name of my brand Pure Diamonds."
Will be on everyone's toung.
Whole world will wear my undergarments.
Not less.
Not more.
Please leave.
It's simple.
Make me leave or I'll leave.
Actually you father and my father were partners in this restaurant.
So either you buy the whole restaurant or let me buy.
You know that I don't have that kind of money.
Why don't you keep half?
M.M. Munde never takes half.
Whole world knows that.
"I will pay you back slowly, slowly."
How slow Jia Jee?
Tommorow at 11:00 my client is coming here to meet me.
He'll like my design definitely.
And Jia's doors of destiny will open.
"Come Tommorow at 12:00, you'll get the money."
"Tommorow at 12:00, it'll be your bad time or mine."
If just Laxminarayan likes my designs.
"Here, Ticket."
Look son.
Do the murder nicely.
"- All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
- That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
- Vending machine at a rest stop.
- Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"- Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
"- Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
- So everyone's just gonna watch us?
- Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"- Come on, man."
- How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
- Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
- Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"- No, those are actually always there-- something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
A relative of the Emperor.
He wants to replace me.
I lost the Emperor's favor... because he badmouthed me.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
Mr. Hwang.
"This is my brother, Prince Daeso."
"(Hwangjagyung, Han Emperor's relative)"
I've heard a lot about you.
The Emperor heard about the alliance and was very impressed.
Long time no see.
Hope you had a nice trip.
What brings you here?
Your request for more provisions has upset the Emperor very much.
He was so upset...
I volunteered to come and offer some help.
I'm here to help you out.
Tell me whenever you need something.
Thanks for the offer but I won't need your help.
I'll organize a small feast for you.
I hope you enjoy your stay.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
What are they doing?
They're racking their brains but I think they're lost.
How can he help Jolbon... when he can't even satisfy me?
I'm off to see Buwiyum.
Will you make an offer?
Yes.
Tell me what you have.
Are you kidding me?
!
I'm not kidding you.
The invasion.
But it never came.
"Stanley, voice-over:"
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
Foyle:
"No invasion, and you panicked."
"You were going to be found out after all, and you decided to..."
Take the easy way out.
Yes.
I wanted to kill myself.
"And Stanley destroyed your suicide note, understandably."
"A fascist for a mother, a killer for a father-- not shining examples of parental guidance."
No wonder he was reading Freud.
What will happen to me?
"You'll be tried for murder, Arthur."
"I loathed her, you know..."
And the scum she brought to the hotel.
Didn't give you the right to kill her.
Please tell Stanley I'm sorry.
Tell him...
I wish I'd been a better father.
I think he knows.
Yes.
"Milner, sit down."
Congratulations on the arrest.
"Ellis has signed a full confession, so I suppose that's that."
"It pays crap, but the sandwiches are free."
I could work on your boat.
My boat?
"Now see, I get a boat, it's gonna be a thing of beauty."
"They see us coming, they'll roll over and beg."
Why am I telling you all this?
Because... you're hoping I saved you half a sandwich.
Name's Peter.
I'm Nicky.
Wallace.
"Good to see you-- circumstances aside, of course."
"Please, have a seat."
"Pam, uh, wants you to know that if there's anything she can do..."
I appreciate that.
We're... both completely devastated by all this which...
makes it difficult to ask.
Then don't.
I wish I didn't have to.
But I'm under a cloud.
"And you put me there, Jeff."
I think you owe me a little clarity.
Clarity?
That's what you really want?
How many years have I known you and Pam?
Since law school.
That's a half a lifetime.
And the fact that you're not out there leading the charge for my nomination...
I'm waiting for the hearings.
To learn what?
To spare you the humiliation.
To find you a way out.
What are you talking about?
Okay.
This time I want to get a little more creative.
You got a wind machine handy?
Just shoot me.
Okay.
Great.
I'm going to have to take the camera to the dance with me and keep having my picture taken.
Don't let anyone else in the picture.
"If people aren't flickering out, they'll gain a hundred pounds."
And to think I used to complain when I got a run in my stocking.
"I keep him in a little glass jar, which I refer to as ""Oz."""
Uh-oh.
Jailbreak.
You lost him?
"Oh, perfect."
"Thanks to your overreacting, I get to spend my Friday night looking for a cockroach with my sister."
"Oh, come on."
This is stuff that keeps us young.
Ooh!
I think I see a dropping.
You look terrific.
Do you think so?
Because this is more of a standing-up dress than a sitting-down dress.
I thought we'd be standing up more.
It's too bad your car doesn't have a sunroof.
You look terrific.
"So, what's up with the camera?"
"Oh, you know, I wanted to preserve the memories of our big night."
"Uh, did you drop your left cuff link?"
What was that?
Northern lights?
(upbeat music playing)
We'll see if she calls back.
I don't want to hear it.
Shame on you!
"- Is this what you ordered, sir?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
I'm not staying with you.
I'm finishing my apple and going home.
"Mom wanted to protect us, that's why she hid it."
"She was a wise woman, she realized our lives would be a nightmare if her secret came out."
"- What, that he's an Arab?"
- Exactly.
"You can play innocent and call me a racist and pretend you're from Mars, not from Jerusalem."
"And that you don't care it he's an Arab,"
- but it means something to me.
"- Me, too."
But I want to see who he is.
You don't have to be here.
You only get in the way.
"- Shai, you're going too far."
- You're right.
I found what I'm looking for.
I don't need this.
- Are you implying something?
"- No, I'm saying it."
How long can you blame Dad for your screwed-up life?
And we're following you like idiots.
"Leave me alone, Shai- Go find your answers somewhere else-."
"Right, maybe I'll find God and eat apples."
Maybe you should.
- Is that your idea or did Haziya write it for you?
- Watch your mouth.
What is going on?
Leave me.
Leave me...
leave me!
What is going on?
What happen?
"I think his death will happen with my hand, stand straight, or i will beat you some rascal is getting nail."
Not wall the door.
"Now i had enough of beating him, now call the police."
"Don't do this Sir, my hotel is very good."
"You are right, not necessary, the work has done."
"Papa will not do this again, Papa say sorry to Mummy."
Just finish it sir.
They have beaten me a lot.
The worst way.
Like Dog.
"You told me to beat Papa, not like this!"
Please let me go.
"Papa he also nailed you., he nailed him like pig, he is very dangerous man."
Size of your underwear...
"Laxmi Narayan is going away with bag, where are you going?"
"You take your bag too, lets press the remote from here."
"Not from here, take this left right from here."
Lets move.
Press the button boss.
Not now.
Come-on sit in the car.
"Let me go please, no!"
"Press the button, which one Papa?"
The left one.
And now you cant ask who's left because its everyone's left.
"There is only one... make target on Laxmi Yadev, and Khujli make target on Laxmi."
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?
Suppose I wanted blueberry.
You had that last night.
"You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik."
I have you figured out.
"You do, huh?"
What else do you know about me?
That you are lonely.
"When you work graveyard as long as I have, you get to know the type."
"Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor."
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"How can I be lonely, when I have you to keep me company?"
"Check, please."
"Yo, Reznik, Furman's office."
Now!
"How are you doing, Reznik?"
What's this about?
Frankly I am concerned about you.
"To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit."
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
- Anything we can help with?
"- No, thanks."
There's nothing I can't handle.
- Wanna see the doctor?
"- It is not necessary, I'm fine really."
"Are you doing drugs, Reznik?"
Where is the shop steward?
He couldn't make it
- Shouldn't even be in here without a union.
- See what I mean.
"Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, believe me, but there's absolutely nothing to worry about."
What is happening?
I do not see that pretty smile that all of Paris envies.
You cannot smile forever.
"Yesterday, I asked for 60.000 francs from my banker."
And since then no news.
What do you fear?
The banker Barbey has foolproof credit.
"It isn't his credit which I doubt, but mine."
"Usually,"
He sends me what I ask in the shortest time.
Mathilde...
You had to speculate deplorably to need so much money.
I bet you still bought some of these copper mines in Rhodesia.
I thought they went up.
But what do you want?
I like to play.
This is the only distraction I have left.
We never change.
"Mathilde, can I help you?"
"Oh, no!"
"That, never."
What happened between us was too precious to me.
Even if on your side...
It is no longer a subject of money between us.
"We'll have dinner later, but you will not regret it."
I invited the lady of your thoughts.
- Princess Danidoff?
- Herself!
Norbert Thomery?
Here you are.
- How's the sugar?
"- It melts, Madam, in your presence."
"Julie will get bored after a day, anyway."
"Want to go to a cardio bar, fashion island..."
Do I get a raise?
"- So, um..."
I appreciate what you're trying to do with the...
"- Okay, I'm reading here."
"- Oh, uh, take your time."
- I just wanted to let you know that you didn't do a bad job.
"- Your work isn't terrible, either."
"A little rushed, maybe."
"So, I've been thinking."
Um...
I owe you an apology.
"Well, several, actually."
You have to actually say the words.
That's kind of how it works.
"I would like to extend... to you a formal acknowledgment that I... may have, um, unintentionally..."
I'm sorry.
"Me, too."
I'm sorry.
- I-I'm sorry about the coffee and the... black eye and the... tampons.
"- Well, you can see why I thought you were intellectually"
I'm just...
I'm really glad that you're not.
"- Your, uh, penmanship, however..."
"- Hey, what's wrong with my penmanship?"
"- Nothing, just..."
"Just, next time, don't hold the pen between your toes."
"Oh, well, um, next time, don't spell ""canceling"" with two L's."
"Yeah, that's wrong."
You want to... you want to fix that?
- I...
Don't you want to feel good?
"Yeah, man."
This is the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
You're just sitting over there like some little brown turd.
Goddamn it!
"You watch yourself, Ray."
"Listen up, motherfucker."
Listen up!
This is what's going to happen.
"We're going to Houston and we're going to sell the shit 'cause this little $15,000 is not going to last."
"Until then, I'm going to hold on to the blow."
"And, Ray, I don't want to hear any more bullshit out of you or her."
You son of a bitch.
Fucking son of a bitch.
"Why don't you just fucking go to sleep, motherfucker?"
You know what you forgot?
You forgot one fucking thing.
You forgot about the goddamn money.
"I got all the goddamn money, motherfucker."
"You keep that little $15,000, Ray."
"He's right, baby."
We should sell the stuff in Houston.
"Think of all that money, huh?"
"We'll be okay, baby."
"Pluto, he knows people in Chicago."
We can live off that money for a long time.
"Baby, it's going to be okay."
We can buy all the blow we want to when we get there and we'll be safe.
Pluto will take care of us.
"We'll be safe, baby."
DUD:
"It's really beautiful, man."
"It just wants something to eat, and then it's going to leave."
"Let's just make a path of chips to the window so it can get out, but we can't feed it anything too nice or else we will never be able to get rid of it."
"Okay, well, that was my mistake with you."
"Well, hello there."
"Mr. Squirrel, I know exactly how you feel."
I hate people too.
Come on.
Come on.
I've been in the same situation.
"Stuck in a strange guy's bedroom, just looking for some nuts."
Come on.
Come on.
Dude.
Bam.
"Oh, my God, that was awesome."
How did you know how to do that?
I was raised on a lot of cartoons.
"Who was the guys, the, um..."
The...
"Chucky, and Bucky."
Bucky?
Who?
"Chuck... no, Chuck, and the guy with the, the, the..."
Are you talking about rocky and Bullwinkle?
Yes.
Do you know them?
They were basically my parents.
"Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting you were raised in the wild."
"Well, not actually that you were raised in the wild, but more that you were, just, kind of not raised at all."
"But, uh, hey, this is the first time it came in handy."
I don't know what to tell you.
You fell in love with a hood rat.
OK.
"We were on the roof replacing tiles when we fell through the ceiling, and luckily your bed broke our fall."
"Eric, you're in some big trouble here."
"Hey, go easy on him, I need this brother."
He taught me how to get what I want from a girl.
- Excuse me?
"- He taught me how to get a date,"
- and it worked big-time.
"- Oh, I see, and who is this girl?"
"- Uh, I don't know her name."
- You don't know her name?
"Not yet, but I'm gonna find out before I make any type of commitment."
How can you manage to ask a girl out if you don't know her name?
- All part of Eric's foolproof method.
"- Cory, get the phone."
"- Oh, Eric has a foolproof method?"
- Ring!
Ring!
"- Go ahead, Cory."
"- All right, first you pick a girl, any girl."
- Just any-ol-body.
- Yeah.
Then you pretend you're interested in her.
Now you don't really have to be interested in her.
"I thought you did, but Eric said it wasn't necessary."
- Ring!
- That's what you told him?
What?
Does it matter what I told him?
I'm dead.
You had the big sex talk with him two years ago.
What did you tell him?
We'll make sure no one knows that you were involved.
"Oh, god, no, no."
Please.
"Mr. McGovern, you're under arrest."
- Stay here with your son until we get back.
"- Please, you can't do this."
- Where's Dr. Robert Swan?
- In the O.R.
"This is my son, please."
You can't go in there.
You'll contaminate the room.
Who the hell are you?
Police.
Please stop what you're doing.
"I have to close this man's incision, and you have to get out of here before he gets infected."
- Where's his kidney?
- Right there.
- And it's going into Kyle McGovern.
"- No, it's not."
It's evidence.
And you're under arrest for trafficking in human body parts.
Now close him up.
I've got less than 24 hours to transplant that kidney.
"Doctor, you're not transplanting anything."
"Just, please, get changed."
"I'm not going anywhere until that doner wakes up, and Kyle McGovern is transferred to a hospital."
- What happened to Kyle?
- He's in hypertensive crisis.
His blood pressure is through the roof.
He needs a kidney in the next few days.
- He's on the transplant list.
- I have a kidney for this dying boy.
"Honey, look, it's best not to talk much about it until she's calmed down."
Is that gonna be the deal?
Sister blanche can't be annoyed with details right now?
"well, you saw how she was last night."
I saw how she was.
"Now, Iet's cop a gander at the bill of sale."
I haven't seen any.
What do you mean?
"She didn't show you papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?"
Seemed like it wasn't sold.
"well, now, what was it, then?"
Giveaway to charity?
-She'II hear you.
-I don't care if she hears me.
"-Now, Iet's see the papers."
"-Honey, there weren't any papers."
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.
Wait.
"Now, listen, did you ever hear of the napoleonic Code, stella?"
-I haven't heard of the napoleonic Code.
-AII right.
"Okay, then."
-Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
-Yes?
"Now, we got here in the state of Louisiana what's known as the napoleonic Code."
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband also and vice versa."
will you listen.
"Take, for instance, I had that piece of property--"
My head is swimming.
"Oh, well, all right, dear."
Okay.
And I lied to a whole lot of people who you didn't wanna talk to.
And I also listened to your friends tell me what a great boss I had.
As if I needed to hear that.
"Alex, I know you."
I know what a good man you are.
And I know how you've tried with Louise.
I love you for that.
All right.
Now just tell me one thing.
"When you were up in that kitchen a while ago, chopping those vegetables, you were very happy."
Yes.
And why did it change after that telephone call?
"You called her before when I was up there in the kitchen, right?"
You don't get a divorce on the telephone!
What difference does it make?
It's over with!
"Now, wait a minute!"
[Sighs]
I should've told her earlier.
You wanna know why I didn't talk to her?
I just wasn't sure how you'd react when I told you that I loved you.
"[Chuckles] Oh, no."
You weren't sure how I'd react?
- That's right.
"- Alex, what you decide with Louise... shouldn't be tied up with my reactions."
Go and find her.
Talk to her.
"Even if she hates you, she needs you."
And when you've got that settled...
Okay.
All right.
"I'm not going to, uh, lose you, am I?"
Is everything a joke to you?
Hey...
"I figure one day we're going to be buried here ourselves, and I"
"think it would be nice if our kids came and, and joked around with us."
I hope that's not for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
"We got more coming, right?"
"Oh, they're trickling in."
It's taking a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
"Jake, Eric, get on down to the pass."
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time before their advance unit hits.
Not you.
Why not?
Because these people elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
"And, besides, in a few minutes,"
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying a rifle and... and I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
"You know, Allie's safe."
"She's been assigned to Town Hall, and the fighting is miles from there."
"Right now, there really isn't anything else you can be doing."
Here we go.
Jake?
"Jake, you are about to have company."
Already?
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
"Mr. Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
"The last time we went to a concert, it, uh, didn't turn out too well."
Things are different now.
"- Well, then, come on."
You like this band?
- I like Journey.
Julie's waiting in the car.
You and I are gonna talk later.
Yes?
- I'm not sure I want to talk to you.
- Sandy.
Kirsten is the one good thing in your life.
How could you do this to her?
After all she has done for you?
- I have to think of my marriage.
- What does Julie Cooper know about being the CEO. of a multimillion dollar company?
- It's a figurehead position.
You said so yourself.
Kirsten will continue to run the show.
- And work for Julie?
Why the hell w
- What do you suggest I do?
- I suggest you find a way to make it up to Kirsten now.
"Unless you want Julie to be your lawyer, too."
- Can you see okay?
"- Yeah, I can see fine."
"- There's no, like, obstructed views or anything, right?"
- Right.
- Okay.
"I just know, sometimes at shows, you can't see so well, 'cause, you know, the tall people are standing."
"Yeah, right, you know, but now I'm just having a hard time hearing."
"- But, thanks for getting me a seat."
- No problem.
You never called.
What's wrong with you?
He is in deep shit.
You don't even know him.
His family doesn't accept him.
I can't leave him here.
I don't understand why this should be your business.
He will be saferwith me.
"""German rescues gay lover from radical Islamic family..."""
Perfect!
Have you gone nuts?
"Not only that, I love him."
Why don't you adopt a gay boy from all nations of the third world?
You could build a rainbow community.
I can't abandon a person in need.
Those kids in Afghanistan were going to die anyway.
There was a war going on.
I didn't even speak the language.
I shouldn't have pushed forthose pictures.
You could have stepped on those mines yourself.
I'm the one who lives with this every day.
There're mines everywhere.
I can't keep doing this.
"If he everbreaks your heart, don't call me."
What's up?
She won't stop.
She starts calling at 5am everyday.
I'm really sick of lying for you.
Is it worth it?
What are you hiding?
"Whatever it is, just be brave and come out with it."
They delivered this yesterday.
"And how he had, like, eight surgeries."
"This is in the middle of us trying to hook up,"
- she starts telling me that.
- Ugh.
"And I was just like, yeah, I can't."
I can't do it.
"And I'm sorry, but all I kept thinking was, is that gonna happen to me if I have sex with her?"
"Like, you're gonna catch her son's thing?"
"I know it's totally irrational, but that's what I kept thinking."
"Like, it's her vagina's fault and I'm not going anywhere near that vagina."
What's the oldest woman you would have sex with?
The oldest I've had sex with is 48.
How old were you?
17.
- Was that your virginity?
- Yes.
"- Oh, my God."
- Really?
- You lost your virginity to an older woman.
"- Oh, yeah."
You must be-
"- You should be great in bed, then."
- No...
"- No, there's no way."
- She was a real pro.
- Really?
"I couldn't keep up, yeah, and I think it scarred me."
That's why I would assume you were great.
"Was she a real pro, like..."
"I think she was a prostitute, but she didn't charge me."
Okay.

"- Well, I mean..."
"- Oh, I think that's Amy."
- Where?
"Jesus Christ, I'm in the back seat and I can fucking see her."
"Oh, right there."
"Okay, fine."
- Congressman.
"- Oh, wow."
"Well, this is freaky."
"Look, I'm not hiding, just so you know."
"Okay, Congressman, time to exit through the gift shop."
"Okay, sir, you're gonna have to come with us."
"Guys, my mom is too ill to be left alone right now."
"I mean, I left her alone right now because she likes to read."
But she can't read right now because she's very sick.
But she might get better.
Or she might not get better.
- She could be buried with a book.
- We know she's not dying.
"- She's a fighter, is the thing."
- Good for her.
"As weird as it feels to still be saying this, the president would like to see you at the White House."
I feel like I'm about to kick it old school and die in office.
Quitting on a high.
Do you think I'm doing the right thing here?
"I mean, this is a good bill."
"Even watered down, I think it's gonna make a difference in people's lives."
"Ma'am, you're the president."
It's not for me to tell you what to do.
Yeah.
Guess I should kill it.
Is the right answer.
"Not a lot to go on, is there?"
Cup of coffee?
Sir?
Except the panic.
The panic?
"Yes, sir."
I might have something in this area.
See what you think.
Mrs. Daley was shot at a distance of 30 feet and she was shot in the back.
Are you with me so far?
"Yes, I think I can grasp that."
"Now,"
Tony...
He's the owner of the deli.
"He said that the killer was ""cool as a cucumber."""
"That's a direct quote, sir."
"So that means that when Mrs. Daley tried to run, that's when he lost his cool."
"See, that's when he panicked and he shot her."
"But he hit her right in the heart, sir, and at the distance of 30 feet while she was running."
"Now, that's hard to do in a panic."
What do you think?
"I think that I had better try and help you because you're going to ask me to, aren't you?"
"You did it again, sir."
You read my mind.
Would you?
"Oh, that would be an honor."
Detective Lucerne helping me.
Wait till I tell my wife.
Somebody asking for me?
"Oh, Sid, it's all right."
This is Lieutenant Columbo from the police department.
"This is Claire's husband, Sid Daley."
"Well, let's call him in for the notification."
You haven't cut yet?
"You ever defrost a chicken, Agent Kelton?"
It takes time.
Your decident Amanda McNeil has minimal freezer burn.
Best guess:
She was kept in an airtight industrial refrigerator.
Any idea of cause of death?
I can't say for sure until I cut.
"Given the petechial hemorrhages, she probably died of asphyxiation."
"No ligature marks-- so, maybe drowning."
What about time of death?
Gray at the roots.
A little over an inch.
Average growth is half an-inch a month.
So she was alive about two months after her last visit to the hairdresser.
That was the day before she disappeared.
Two months.
That's plenty of time to party.
"Hey, Joe."
Take it easy there.
"- Sorry, Cap."
- Bucket up.
Hey!
You're eating my sandwich.
"Well, finders keepers, right?"
I was hungry.
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Nope.
"Well, enjoy."
I'm looking for a job.
"At Monty's bar, they're looking for a waitress."
But...
What?
Seems like he doesn't like you
Who is your Master?
Shi Zhengzong.
Have you heard about him?
He was nicknamed Thunderstorm
He has good technique and holds high acclaim
Thunderstorm?
Think I lied to you?
If he has good technique n' all that... how did I break his bones three years ago?
You've beaten him up?
I despise these hypocrites who call themselves
The decent school of martial arts
All they know is vanity!
"Don't worry, I won't beat you up"
Because we are good brothers!
Of course!
"Brother Jin, are you okay?"
T omorrow get me some medicine Tianqi and Baiyao
1 0 grams of Tianqi and 50 grams of Baiyao
Please get it from somewhere else!
Why?
I've got money?
Get it quick!
"Tianqi, Baiyao"
Do you need them for cuts?
"Hey, don't you want to do business?"
What are you doing?
"T ell me quick, do you need them for cuts?"
It's not your concern
I'll cut your head off if you don't tell me!
Do you want to?
You see him?
You...
"Anyway, Mitchell, I have in my hand a piece of paper."
Phase two of Find Mitchell AJob Campaign.
"Oh, Annie, Annie, it doesn't matter."
I'm considering other options anyway.
"Mitchell, you're not a quitter."
It says so here in the reference that I wrote.
Check this out.
"""John Mitchell is the finest employee I ever had."
"""He is loyal and dependable and valued by all his co-workers."
"""I recall he did not give the best interview..."""
- Whoa!
"- ""...but I put that down to nerves."""
"What, so I make a habit of screwing up interviews?"
"""But how glad am I that I took a chance on him?"
Very.
"""Because I was rewarded with a pleasant and reliable worker,"
"""who would be an asset to any company."
"""Plus, let's face it, he's easy on the eye."""
I'm just covering all my bases.
Yeah.
You know what?
Maybe I just don't want to be a hospital cleaner any more.
"No, of course you don't."
"This is just the beginning, Mitchell."
"With me in your corner, next year you could be in the canteen."
I'm going to type this up.
What's up?
- Where's Adam?
- He's in the kitchen.
"Well, look around you."
"We're not exactly starving, you know."
"Well, honey, I know we have most of the things we need but just having the things you need isn't everything."
I mean...
I'd like to buy you some things you haven't got.
I've got you.
That's the only thing I really want.
What about that fur coat?
"Oh, Darrin, I haven't heard you talk this way before."
Remember the new account I told you about?
Waterhouse and Company?
The one the agency's been trying to get for years?
Yes.
"Oh, don't tell me you lost it."
"No, we got it all right."
"The trouble is, I will not be handling it."
"Well, did you talk to Larry?"
Larry's the one who told me about it.
"Well, I know how you feel."
But maybe...
"Well, maybe you're just in too much of a hurry to get to the top."
"Remember, you're still young."
"I'm young all right, but I won't always be young."
"If that's Larry, tell him I'm on my way."
Hello.
"Oh, hi, Louise."
"Yeah, sure I'd like to hear some good news."
Larry told you wh...
Darrin's got the Waterhouse account?
"Oh, I can't wait to tell him."
"Oh, well, all right."
"If Larry wants to tell him himself, I understand."
"What's on your mind, gorgeous?"
"- Oh, just wanted to say hello."
- Really?
That's sweet.
"'Cause the last time we chatted, I believe you threatened to kill me."
"Gee, has something changed since then?"
"You really did out smart us, didn't you?"
Screwed us royally.
"- I'm impressed, Dick."
- I'm like a lion that way.
"I hide in the weeds, bide my time, then i jump out and tear the ass off some dumb buffalo."
Ooh.
"So, Mr. Lion, how are you gonna cash in that ticket?"
I'll think of something.
Don't lose any sleep over it.
"Believe me, honey, i sleep like a baby, 'cause the second you try to cash in that little fucker,"
I'm going to the lottery commission and tell them everything.
"If you did that, I'd rat you out quicker than a frog can take a piss."
Mmm.
- What do you want?
- Halfsies.
Half.
Have you been exercising?
'Cause you look great.
Deal.
Nothing like rekindling an old friendship.
"Hey, that's him."
Wagstaff.
- Wagstaff?
"- Yes, Wagstaff."
Are you sure?
"Light hair, 6'2' lives here."
"All right, I'll be there."
"Help the guy, fatso!"
- Again.
I'm looking for Miss Guadalupe Mendoza.
- Miss Guadalupe Mendoza?
"Yes, she's here."
She was arrested for disturbing the peace and public exposure.
"You know, the community calls and we have to act, sir."
How much is the fine?
It's 200 pesos according to the law.
She has to stay here for 24 hours.
But if you want we can put her in a cell by herself.
"Shut the fuck up, whores!"
Guadalupe Mendoza?
You're going to sleep in the suite tonight.
Shut up!
"Shut up, you rowdy bitches!"
I want to tell you...
I am a Christian now and...
God spoke to me in many different ways.
For instance in a dream.
"Now I ride a cab and I preach to the people, so to speak."
I tell them to get closer to God.
I tell them you can talk to Christ in different ways.
And thanks to God I'm with him now.
What are you going to do now?
Can you come to the living room when you're done?
"Now that it's sold, why don't we use it?"
I'll be in the bedroom.
Get away from the window.
Why are we getting out through here?
- They can see you in daylight.
"You see, Trixie, now that this young Tyler has brought more money into the play"
I shall arrange for you to have more to do.
- And you may become a star.
- A real star?
A great star.
Possibly as big as-as a planet.
"Well, where is she?"
Where's Miss Chummy?
"Well, I've called her twice, she's over there with the judge."
"Tell everybody else to go home, I'll attend to her."
Okay.
"Alright, Miss Chummy we'll go through that new number you've been telling me about."
- I brought my own piano player.
"- You wouldn't trust ours, heh?"
"Yes, but he knows all my routines."
"He does, huh?"

"Listen, being that it's a new number today just for the sake of novelty, please try to sing the same notes what he plays."
"- Alright, ahem."
- Music.
[clears throat] [falsetto singing]
What have you got in your mouth?
Firecrackers?
Must you give out with that shrill gargling?
"Well, I'm a dramatic coloratura."
Coloratura?
Music.

* Fluttering chirping birds of spring *
* Come back to your home in the north and sing * [falsetto singing]
What do you think you're doing now?
Look through her.
"I mean, make her think she's the most exquisite thing your eyes have ever beheld."
- Who her?
- Who cares?
Pick somebody.
"Well, how do I pick?"
- You got eyes?
- I thought we established that.
Make eye contact.
Make her eyes believe that your eyes are interested in her.
- So I have to be interested in her.
"- No, you're overachieving."
You only have to make her think you are.
"So we find, in Fielding's novel, the character Tom Jones is absolutely irresistible to women."
"- Isn't that right, Matthews?"
"- Uh, yeah, that's right."
- What's right?
- What you just said.
- What'd I just say?
"- You weren't listening, either?"
"Matthews, keep your head facing this way."
"Shawn, tell your buddy what I was saying."
"Uh, he was saying, ""Matthews, you're not listening."""
Thank you.
Did either one of you guys do the reading assignment?
- Some of it.
- What did you read?
I read the page you handed us with the reading assignment on it.
- (bell rings)
- Yay!
Yay!
- What?
- Tonight?
"- Oh, no, I can't."
I've got to meet my mom at the hospital.
- Want company?
"- No, I'm good."
'Cause we're here for you if you need us.
"He knows that, Brian."
Good.
"I can't count the times I wished you dead, miserable son of a bitch."
Literally can't count the times.
"Let me tell you, I always thought you'd outlive me."
You were always so full of damn life.
Used to piss me off.
"Goddamn sparkle in your eye just like the day I met you, like you were still 21."
I used to imagine you outliving me.
"Standing over my grave, getting cigar ashes on my headstone."
Terrible.
But here we are.
Looks like I'm outliving you.
I spent the last 25 years of my life hating you.
25?
"No, at least 27."
Do I regret it?
Not for a second.
"You and I weren't always nice to each other, but we never, ever lied to each other."
Now who am I supposed to hate?
Probably my mom.
"Can you believe she's still alive, making everybody miserable?"
"God, who sent you these ugly carnations?"
"Stink hands, yeah, figures."
"I'm sorry it didn't work out between us, Frank."
You weren't a bad guy.
like a shoelace.
That's pretty resourceful.
I know.
"All right, you're good."
I just can't believe he's gone.
Yeah.
And for what?
For trying to save a guy like John Cutler?
"Now, listen to me, all right?"
"Billy saw somebody in danger, and he reacted, all right?"
That's what he did.
And the fact that he knew the kind of man that Cutler was and he still put himself in harm's way?
"He was a hero, Catherine."
Yeah.
(knocks)
I just got off the phone with the lab.
There's something you're both gonna want to see.
What do you got?
"Well, there were no prints on any of the shell casings from our shooter's gun."
But the lab did find traces of blood on one of the slugs from Billy's gun.
Wait a minute.
Billy hit the shooter?
Apparently.
That's my boy.
It must've been a through-and-through.
I bet the slug was imbedded in the cabin wall and our cleaner dug it out.
You run the blood?
"Yeah, we got a match, too."
Our killer's a guy by the name of
Jason Kroll.
He's believed to be a hit man.
"HPD had him as a suspect in two homicide cases last year, but couldn't make anything stick."
"Come on, Tom."
"Wait right there, Tom."
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.
"You got anything in your pockets, Tom?"
"I got some Indian stuff here... some shells in a sheepskin, a little bit of change."
You ready?
"No, upstairs."
"Bill, you stay down here."
I'm going to put you in this one.
I know how you love those hills.
You can see a little bit of them from here.
"Don't close that door until I get over to that window, would you?"
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?
I've nothing to say on that.
Is the Association going to pay for his defense?
"I told you, I have no more to say."
John Coble to see you.
This is Thomas Burke.
He'll be your legal counsel now.
Every boy needs one of those.
Mr. Burke's the man to put an end to all this for you.
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.
They're going to have you come to court very quickly.
Have you ever been tried for anything before?
"Yeah, once."
It was a military trial a long time ago.
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?
Invasion of Mexico.
"Tom, I have to move on with this as quick as I can."
This is Mukesh calling.
Sorry.
Who is there ma?
Somebody's got the wrong address.
What are you doing here?
Leave!
My husband can come anytime!
Did he hit you?
What else do you expect?
A trophy?
"My sisters are coming, I need my money."
Are you done?
They rescheduled my appointment for tomorrow.
Breakfast!
"Johnny bhai, I need a favour?"
What?
You will have to go to that lady's house the one that you met with me.
Why don't you go yourself?
My aunt lives in the same colony if she sees me there...
What work do you have with her?
Sleeping through the day begets bad luck my friend!
She says that your due has already been paid to you.
Your lady friend didn't even let me enter the house!
She started shouting and threatening me saying that she will call her husband!
They have given your number to the cops even filed a report against you...
What the hell are you upto?
You will get me into trouble as well
Screwed up my work.
Got me thrown out of the house.
And now she says she will not pay me!
Bitch!
Does she think I am scared of her and her husband!

"Hey, let's see."
"Why are you like that, after one punch?"
After you beat me up last time...
I can't say I won...
I just got lucky when I went in with that punch.
"Anyway, since you gave up first, you have to do me a favor."
Think about it.
Why does my friend have to be accused of murder?
When the real murderer is out there.
Just tell me where his house is.
Please.
You said that you were hiding this secret for your friend's sake.
"You cover for your friend, and you fight really well..."
You're not doing anything bad.
This is for the good of your friend.
Come on.
Where is your friend's house?
Hello.
"Hello, there."
- Are you moving?
- What is this about?
We just got a call.
He said that he is the murder suspect for this case and that he will be coming to the police station at 5 p.m. to turn himself in.
But we got to talking.
"He said that he was persuaded by you, Representative."
By you.
"We wanted to have you there while he confessed, so we came here early."
This is really weird for me.
"I'm used to having sex with whoever I want whenever I want, not settling down with one guy."
"But sometimes your instincts change, and you just have to go with it."
"Oh, my God."
Gabriel?
!
New York has a way of changing you...
Sometimes in ways you don't expect.
♪ Darken the city
♪ night is a wire
♪ steam in the subway
♪ earth is afire
"♪ do do do, do do do it's just a loan, you know?"
- I'll pay you back.
"- Sure, dad."
"♪ Woman, you want me"
♪ give me a sign
But it doesn't just harden you or bring out the animal in you.
It can also bring out the humanity.
"♪ Do do do do do do, do do do, do do do, do do ♪"
"Oh, Gabriel."
Wait here.
Let me get my wallet.
No.
That's okay.
Oh.
"And as our instincts change, so do our actions."
And sometimes the city simply brings out what's already inside of you...
"A killer instinct... which may be scary, or may just be about survival."
But sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
It's a bigger desk.
"No one's using it, and you would have your own computer."
"All right, tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr. Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case, aren't you?"

Murder victim.
His unknown killer is still at large.
Witnesses saw stein enter the hotel
"With a very young, very attractive woman."
"The l.A.P.D. Is now looking for this woman,"
The woman witnesses saw with stein
Just before he was murdered.
Police are asking if you have any information
"About her or her whereabouts,"
Please contact l.A.P.D. Immediately.
"Oh,my god."
I killed him.
I can't believe it.
I killed him.
"Ann,listen to me."
Listen to me.
You did the right thing by talking to a lawyer.
"Now from what you're saying,"
It sounds like you have a good case for self-Defense.
"If he was attacking you,the law says you can protect yourself."
"But in order for me to help you,"
"I need to understand exactly what happened,okay?"
"So one more time, but slower."
Lenny invited me to his hotel room.
We're friends.
And i don't know if it was his temper
"Or his drinking or what,"
"But he got mad, and he hit me,"
And he wouldn't let me leave.
He... tried to kill me.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Hello again.
"Hamit Milonkovic, you are charged with deprivation of his daughter."
Shit genuine.
Why are you locked?
Now you're crazy.
I have not seen Zana since she disappeared.
You said nothing about it to have arrived.
It was because he wanted her to die there?
That's why you cut the fire rope?
'You had the courage to blow up the bomb?
-No Hear what I said?
Shit genuine !
-You Have evidence for this?
"Zana has been there many times, willingly, but for a long time."
The girl's apartment was treated for minor cuts before disappearing.
The blood test confirms that it is Zana.
Do not answer.
I want to talk to my client.
Okay.
She arrived a few days ago.
Something happened to her.
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
"I would give a time to talk again, but failed."
Zana disappeared and I snapped.
Then you cut the fire rope to protect her?
Do you understand me?
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
She was not afraid of anything.
She could get hurt.
Where were you from 9 at 9:30 am when the bomb went off?
-With Him.
-Discutíamos The visitation agreement.
I feel so glamorous.
Damn it.
Jill's already with the Earl.
"Look at her over there, shamelessly flirting with him."
Maybe I should just go home.
"No, you can't."
That's quitter talk.
"If you don't go down fighting, what does that do for us?"
Who look up to you.
What's the use?
"Look, he's already interested in..."
Hello.
"You move like an angel, as if you were floating across the room."
"Thank you for remarking on my grace, your grace."
Ah.
"Beluga, my favorite."
- I simply adore beluga.
- I adore it more.
Mm-hmm.
Delicious.
"Poor child, have you never had caviar?"
You must be so sheltered and naive.
"Well, I'm certainly not as worldly and experienced as some."
Perhaps the Earl would like to hear a story of a woman who's been ridden by more men than the London underground.
Or perhaps the Earl would like to see a recent photo of a woman with a mustache.
"I'm not sure that I would, actually."
"Who do you want the Earl to end up with,"
Joy mouse or Jill mouse?
Of course I'm rooting for Joy.
"Well, obviously I'm rooting for Joy too."
- But it's gonna be Jill.
- Totally.
Safe?
"What do you mean, safe?"
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.
Get out of my way.
It's no time to do a thing like that!

"Hey, uh, I need to know something."
What--what is your plan for me here?
We're working the plan.
"You're in the Cellar, honing your craft."
"No, my craft's already honed."

"You think 'cause some guy offers you the moon and the stars, he can actually deliver?"
Barton's offering cash...

He's still sleeping.
What?
He's still here?
"All right,look,I did something really stupid."
"If you did something bad to Augie,don't tell me."
"I love you,but he's been my best friend for 15 years."
"No,it's not that, but thank you,by the way."
There's a hierarchy.
I'm sorry.
"Alright,look,this is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life."
Really?
'Cause...
Oh!
What is that?
"Bella,I swear to God,if you laugh..."
"Ser... seriously,what the hell is that?"
- It's a merkin.
- Is it alive?
How do you not know what a merkin is?
It's like a toupee for down there.
How would I know that?
"Is it the next link in the chain of crazy, wax-it-all-off-and-stick- something-else on?"
"It's from,like,a zillion years ago when prostitutes would have to shave everything off so they wouldn't get lice."
"That one's a reproduction,right?"
Are you gonna help me or not?
"What do you want me to do,braid it?"
I can't get it off.
"Oh,sweetie..."
"I accidentally put it on sideways, and,and now I can't get it off, and I have a Ted Koppel."
"Oh,sweetie,come here."
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
He shut me down.
Boom!
Gone.
See ya.
It was cold.
Yet you found it hot.
"No,I mean,he was hot while he happened to be shutting me down, but it's not like the shutting down itself was hot."
I really think he's changed.
"Yeah,he's changed into a guy that doesn't like you anymore."
And it happened the same exact time he became more appealing.
Weird.
"Dude,he totally still likes me."
I don't know what you're getting so indignant about.
You won't even kiss me when I get my sideburns trimmed like a quarter of an inch too short.
"When they're too short,your chin looks huge."
I warn you about that before every haircut.
- Bella.
"- Oh,jeez."
didn't Vivian almost break up with me one time for wearing Crocs?
"I'm kind of still kind of asleep,Aug."
You're supposed to love me no matter what.
Anything I do.
Whatever.
That's ridiculous.
"So,if you put on 200 pounds and become a serial killer,"
I'm supposed to just roll with that?
"Like normal things,Augie."
"Like,what if I suddenly grew a disgusting mole out of my back,like Bella."
Ew.

Two years later.
It was the meanness of the campaigns... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty... that turned the voters off..
I think that these parties are demonizing each other.
They're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties... onto the national stage.
People don't like it.
"People are very, very unsatisfied at the moment."
It makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change.

I can be stubborn too.
You shouldn't have brought that snake here.

"I did things that were wrong, Goni."

"I wanted to get what was coming to me, no matter how."
But what I did is disproportional to the punishment and to your suffering.

All of our little family.
I carry it with me all the time.
"You know, a few days ago I bumped into someone I knew in 2nd grade."
She used to say I was from a family of thieves.

Let's go.!
Marshall showed us last night they have the ability to come back.
Let's see what they can do here.
This is Nathan.
Nice pass.
Knock it down.
"Biggest lead of the game now, and the Rams fans can smell it."
Been a great run for Luther Bedford's team.
The string of upsets stops here.
- And a foul on Agee.
- he fouls out.
But hejust never quit.
hejust kept going for the basketball.
I wouldn't be surprised ifhe made the all-tournament team tonight.
- Number one!
- We're number one.!
We're still number one.
All right.
All right.
"Though they lose to Peoria Manual... they finish third in the state, the highest a Marshall team has finished since 1960."
This was a great season you had.
There is nothing sweeter than going downstate as a young person.
"I mean, the record's gonna stay there, you know."
"1991, there was a team from Marshall played."
"- You know, and you're part of that."
- Yeah.
- That's part of history.
- Ah!
"But for you seniors,you know-"
"Best wishes to all you seniors, and whatever you try to do, uh..."
"Mr. Williams and I will be around school... as we always are - to help you if you want to be helped, okay?"
Step by step.
There's still lots of work.
I don't understand why our artistic director is walking like a peacock after everything they wrote in the paper.
What did they write?
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
She can stand in for me anytime.
What article?
It's been a month since I read the paper.
3 pages in in the newspaper about our nice little theater.
What did it say?
They're doing an investigative report about financial irregularities.
We have to get rid of our artistic director.
It's not that simple.
"Submit your candidacy, they'll back you."
You submit your candidacy.
"Do me a favor, get serious."
"- Do me a favor, let me direct."
I don't need that.
"The more the merrier, my friend, it's quite elementary"
Sergio Leone died yesterday.
Is that so?
What a shame.
He was young.
"Who is it, Liyova?"
A friend of yours?
"No, Mama, he's a great director."
"An incredible director, eh, Yitzhak?"
A Fistful of Rings.
- A Fistful of Dollars.
"Dollars, yes."
1966.
"Well done, Papa."
I told you Schnickelfritz.
You made me bet on Equipoise.
I clocked him this morning.
He was running like a doll.
You clocked him!
Why don't I clock you?
Another one of his enterprises was the distillery.
He ran a bar right in our barracks selling schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.
The boys called it the ﬂamethrower but it wasn't really that bad.
"We brewed the stuff out of old potato peels and once in a while, a couple of strings off the red cross parcels just to give it a little ﬂavor."
"It ain't fair, Harry."
"I'm telling you, it ain't fair."
My Betty.
Ain't she beautiful?
She married an orchestra leader.
So what?
There's other women.
Not for me.
Betty.
- Betty.
"-Forget Betty, Animal."
I'll get you a date with some of those Russian women.
You'll get me a date?
Sure.
I'll get you into the Russian compound.
How?
Pinky Miller from Barracks 8 tried getting over there and they shot him in the leg.
"It takes a gimmick, Animal."
I figured us a little gimmick.
- You did?
-Sharp.
Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Sensei!
Brother!
He said that ballerinas should dance until they die.
He said that they should dance as long as they have legs.
I'm going to dance.
I'm not going to let myself be defeated like my mother.
"After hearing Kayama-sensei, I know what I need to do."
It's been a long time.
I lived alone with Yagi.
I danced alone.
I pursued you all by myself.
"Now, I just want to be alone in the dark."
I want to do things on my own.
"You know, I was thinking that I wanted to see you not as an old friend, but as someone new."
I don't like that.
"If you were to pass me by now, you wouldn't even notice me."
Do you think so?
I'm going to go to Kansai soon.
Will you come with me?
We can decide our fates on that trip.
Shinako has a performance.
I want to see that.
After that.
That's fine.
"I'll go see it, too."
"Father, I brought you some iced tea."
Thank you.
What's Takao doing?
He isn't home yet.
"Yesterday I said some things I shouldn't have to your mother, didn't I."
It wasn't nice of me to say such terrible things.
"As your mother says, it might be true that your mother's unhappiness is a result of my behaviour."
They're a bit embarassed about their deficiency.
So we give them a safe place to practice.
That was the best party ever.
Girls!
"I'm ashamed of you, all of you."
"And you, most of all."
I'm sorry.
We snap.
We don't clap.
"And Casey Cartwright, you have earned yourself a grand round of snaps, right, girls?"
This was truly a magical evening.
You see how much fun you can have when you play by the rules and help other.
Come here.
I can't remember the last time I stayed up past 11.
- Good night!
- Good night.
I had an amazing evening.
"Thanks, big sis."
"OK, was Rebecca just being nice to you?"
I'm too tired to worry about that now
"OK, that was the most stressful, exhausting evening of my entire life."
We pulled it off.
And it's been almost a full 48h since I last thought about Evan.
"And tomorrow you'll think about him even less,"
And the next day even less.
"And eventually, it'll just be ""What's his name""."
I hope so.
I wish you were a boy and we could be together forever.
That's weird.
Why do I have to be the boy?
'Cause you're taller!
We want you to come back.
How is she?
My God...
Cumbersome.
Madam?
I'm a jewel broker.
"Since the announcement of my next wedding,"
"I keep getting visits from jewelers, decorators..."
"While browsing, I found in a jewel store,"
"I will not tell you his name by the way, these beads."
"These beads are beautiful, Madam, but again: it's not."
I m sure the Princess Danidoff would be very happy to have them.
Where are they from?
"Show them to her first, then you'll decide."
I will give you a great price.
And I have other jewelry.
A moment.
"Oh, look, I'm in a hurry!"
"If you decide to buy, meet me tomorrow at the Orsay railway station."
-Alright.
"Jean, please get Madam to the door."
"- Well, sir."
- Good evening.
"This is extraordinary, but..."
"I swear, my dear Norbert, these are the jewels that were stolen from me."
I have every reason to believe you.
It is this woman?
A receiver of stolen goods who sells the goods that thiefs put in her hands.
I'll buy them.
I have an appointment tomorrow.
Pay yourself.
Good morning.
I think you heard the news.
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up..."
We're driving towards Clare in a hearse.
(GRUNTING)
Fuck...
"I'm not going to hurt you, I need some drugs."
(GRUNTING) Adrenaline...
Something to keep me going.
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
"There are soldiers here, they're looking for me."
SEELA:
Why?
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.
She got kidnapped by the Janjaweed.
Her name's Clare Somersby.
- The aid worker?
- Yeah.
She's going to die...
"Along with a lot of other people, if you don't help me."
(GRUNTING) Okay...
"So, please?"
(SOLDIERS YELL IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
There's no sign yet of Stonebridge on any of the satellite feeds...
Widen your grid reference.
What about Matak?
"(CHUCKLES) According to his office, he's away on an official engagement."
"- No, He's stalling..."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
"See if she was arrested, as well, and get me on a flight to Khartoum."
I'm gonna have to deal with this personally.
(IN ARABIC)
(IN ARABIC)
There's more?
"Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax, it's mine."
It was knocked out of my hand by two women duking it out over a chintz mermaid dress.
"Oh, now it looks good."
There's Xanax on the loose and I'm just standing here?
"At least if I was high, I'd have an excuse to be wearing this."
"Here pilly, pilly."
"Here pilly, pilly, pilly."
"Girl, for real, you look like straight up crap in that dress."
For real.
You white girls can't pull that color off.
That's a waste of poppin' lemon yellow.
I know.
I am way too white for this.
"She's also too white to say ""turnt up"" all the time, but that hasn't stopped her."
This dress was not my choice.
I hate everything about it.
This is a disaster.
"This is ""Dressageddon."""
"Yeah, but in a good way."
You two don't want to wear the dresses.
You don't have to.
But I thought you wanted us to match the balloons and the ducks.
"Max, she said we don't have to wear the dress."
Don't question her!
That's like questioning a prison guard when he says you're free to go.
"Sophie, are you sure you don't care?"
"Oh, yeah."
Sure.
"Yeah, they're all yours, Destiny's Child."
This is ten pounds of ugly junk.
"Reminds me of this bartender, Pete, I used to date."
... she'sdead.
The little dog is there.
"I used to go over there on Sundays, you know..."
... bringthepaper...
... coffee.
I used to bring a bag of bear claws.
That little dog used to beg in front of me for them bear claws.
I loved that little dog.
I loved that little dog.
[MARTlNEZ SPEAKS in spanish] I'm okay speaking as we are.
MEDAVOY:
"Mr. Fuentes, when we came to see you yesterday..."
... youseemednervous about Mrs. Garcia making her bail.
You told us that you and your wife don't know her very well.
"So, what are you concerned about?"
You know her a little better than you said?
"I'll tell you everything, but you can't use it to incriminate me."
I gotta ask you something.
-Do you want to have a lawyer here?
-No lawyer. I didn't do nothing wrong.
Why don't you tell us what's on your mind?
-l had relations with Mrs. Garcia.
-What kind of relations?
"You know, intimate, virile."
I couldn't help it.
She fell in love with me.
Her husband worked all day.
"He'd come home at night, drink, beat her."
"Coño, you know, she has needs."
"You're home during the day, work at night."
My wife's a good woman. I love her.
But Luisa Garcia estaba bien caliente.
I trust that she offered some challenges.
"Yes, she did."
Good.
Now we can give Roland's mother a proper burial.
"Thank you, gentlemen."
So what did you glean?
Surely there was something.
"There was indeed, Dr. Ogden."
Mrs. Braxton was not a full woman.
Meaning?
She had no ovaries.
She was born without a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't bear children?
"Whoever she is, she isn't your baby's mother."
Who is this girl that you keep locked up?
And don't give me that story about Borneo.
I... came across her in the Appalachian Mountains some ten years ago.
"Well, she came across me, more like."
How so?
I was asleep in the caravan when I heard something rummaging around my campfire.
"In the darkness, I thought it was a bear"
- and almost shot it.
- Where did she come from?
No idea.
"You ask me, she was raised by wolves."
Highly unlikely.
"Sir, she's as wild as the day is long, mister."
"So, you keep her caged like a beast."
"Look, she's clothed and fed and in a better state than when I found her."
"And before you start, she's legally mine."
I have the paper to prove it.
There you go.
- It makes a handy weapon in a pinch.
You kidnapped me with a candy bar?
"Well, you have to admit it was rather inventive."
"Oh, God."
Don't be upset.
"If I'd had a real gun, I would have used it."
It sure felt like a gun.
I thought for sure everybody would hear the wrapper crinkle.
"Oh, God."
I can just see the headline now.
- Hey.
"Hey, candy thief."
"- ""Kidnapper Exposed When Candy Gun Melts In Hand. """
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Thanks.
Thank you.
If my father only knew you kidnapped me with a candy bar.
Think of the embarrassment.
"Oh, God, what a jerk."
"You know, he's probably thinking right now about how he can use all this publicity... 'cause he wants to run for governor of California."
"Now listen, once this whole fiasco is over..."
I want you to get me and Natalie on A.M. San Diego... and all the national morning shows.
Call Ted Turner.
Tell him I'll give him an exclusive first once this insane thing is wrapped up... in exchange for some good publicity.
He owes me one.
"Uh, you get to work."
I'll call you back.
- Mr. Voss?
- What is it?
- Our chopper's back.
Please use it to continue your education.
Your mother would've wanted that too.
Don't worry about the dead men in the bathtub.
It's not what it looks like.
And a long story to tell right now.
"Sometimes, for no particular reason,"
I think of you and smile.
"Seriously about that day, that... we drove out to the mall, for your birthday."
"Your mom had the flu, and she said to go on without her."
I remember you wandered off.
Got lost.
"And two hours later, we finally found each other."
We hugged...
You didn't wanna let go.
"Then we went for ice cream, and we talked..."
all the way home.
I think that was the happiest day I've had.
"I know I probably wasn't the best father in the world,"
but I tried the best I could.
Anyway...
I loved you all that I possibly can.
"Love, Dad."""
"""PS:"
"This isn't in my handwriting, because friend of mine wrote it out for me."""
"If you just leave that in the... apartment when you go, make sure to get to her."
Glad you girls came by.
I wouldn't have written that otherwise.
Daze...
"We gotta go now, Daze."
"We never even said his name, Vi."
Come on.
The bike is gone.
"Cairo, city of the Lilies, a paradise on earth."
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Ah, oh no..."
"Cute, Ha!"
What an adorable creature.
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Well no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me!"
I knew the Germans had hired you Sallah.
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They have hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous!
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It is as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one....
"He's very clever, he's a French archaeologist."
What's he's name?
"They call him ""Bellosh""."
"Belloq, Belloq!"
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the well of souls.
"Well, they are not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy...
There is something that troubles me.
...
What you need to take is not the people's judgement.
You should receive my judgement.
If you don't want to see any additional innocent sacrifices... don't block my way.
The meeting is in two hours.
"Oh, Chief Park..."
"Before that, an important guest is going to come looking for me."
"Without a bodysearch, just send him through to me."
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Also, I want to be alone for a while."
"But, we can't do that."
"Please, Chief Park."
Since I have some things to think over by myself.
I came here to see the President.
"Yes, he told me."
He's waitng inside.
Please enter.
So you came.
There's nothing for you to do any more.
This isn't a place you should be at.
I told you already
I'll block you with my own hands.
My revenge of 28 years...
you can't block it.
The type of revenge where I have to shoot my real dad.
Do you think I could live well afterwards?
Having the woman I love point a gun at me...
Did you think it wouldn't matter to me at all?
The dad who lost a leg for me.
Having to shoot him... how would that make me feel?
If you ever thought about me even once...
I wanted you to stop.
I want her!
I want her in my life.
She is amazing.
She's not that amazing.
"Hey, help me analyze this."
"We've been out a couple times, but when I call her, she just texts me back."
"And short ones, like, ""Hey, Everett."""
"I mean, you know her really well."
Does that mean she's brushing me off?
"Hmm, what to say, what to say."
"If you ever get the opportunity to talk me up, you know, if the subject of Nobel Prizes comes up, maybe you could drop something about my nomination."
"Listen, I hear you, okay?"
But I don't think I should get involved in this.
"I really admire you, and it doesn't feel right..."
Have you ever separated twins in the womb?
No.
- Would you like to?
- Would I like to?
"I mean, it would be the opportunity of a lifetime."
Are you bribing me?
"12-hour surgery, right by my side."
"Afterwards, an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta."
Fine.
I'll do it.
But just so you know...
This is very wrong.
Great!
"Listen, I need you to help me compose a funny tweet to Riley."
"I want it to be clever, but not like I'm trying too hard."
Okay.
You're a horrible person.
You're a horrible person.
- What do we have here?
- A broken statue.
- probably with that rock.
- By the young guy.
The lady saw him and went out with the gun.
He took it and...
Let's see what they say.
Why did he break the statue?
It can't be easy... seeing a statue of...
What?
"I don't know, just imagine..."
"You're in Africa, and you see a statue of a... a white guy in a Canadians sweater, fishing with a hockey stick, an Expos cap, a red belt, and a six-pack, while you're at it."
Why do you laugh?
That's exactly it.
"Take a hot head, he sees this and goes for it."
- You're right.
- obviously.
"obviously, the old lady was scared enough to get her gun."
What is it?
"I know you, you got an idea."
"If it had been a white guy, maybe she would've run out screaming, with a broom..."
"but here, she saw a black guy."
- She took a gun.
- She was scared of him.
"She saw him, got a gun, went out."
Jacques... did you ever wonder where it comes from... being uneasy around black people?
We're even scared of them.
Think about it.
"We copy Americans, and they don't like them much."
"I don't know, there must be a reason."
"It comes from, listen to this, from prehistoric times."
- It's true.
I put you a cold plate on ice.
I'm gonna try to keep blanche out until the party breaks up...
-...because I don't know how she'II take it.
-Isn't that just dandy?
So you'd better give me some money.
"Hey, where is she now?"
She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet her nerves.
She's terribly upset.
Over what?
She's been through such an ordeal.
We lost belle Reve.
"What, the place in the country?"
"-well, how?"
-It had to be sacrificed or something.
"Honey, look."
"When she comes in, be sure and say something nice about her appearance."
"And, oh, don't mention the baby."
I haven't said anything yet.
I'm waiting until she gets in a quieter condition.
-Try to understand her and be nice to her.
-AII right.
She wasn't expecting to find us in such a place.
-AII right.
-I tried to gloss things over a little in my letters.
Admire her dress.
tell her she's looking wonderful.
It's important to blanche.
Her little weakness.
"Okay, honey, I get the idea, but...."
"Now, Iet's just skip back a little, the way you said the place was disposed of."
"Oh, yeah."
"well, how about a few more details on that subject?"
She's a Wraith.
Maybe so.
"But she's different, I swear to you."
Let me guess.
A Wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
Please... lower your weapons and I'll explain it to you.
It's alright.
- Father.
- I won't let them hurt you.
I raised her as my own.
You live here?
Together?
"This was part of a mine, before the last culling."
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
Gee!
I wonder why.
The villagers told us there was a Wraith in the forest.
"It came here in a crashed ship, ten years ago."
Ten years ago?
Ellia was just a child.
Do you really think that she could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?
"So you know about that, then?"
I was there.
I helped kill the survivors.
"But... when I found a young female lying unconscious, some distance from the crash,"
I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.
I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others.
"To this day, the people of the village don't know and you must promise not to tell them."
Uncle Charlie?
Anybody home?
This is Charles Garrisons secretary calling from Hybra Tech...
Mr. Garrison will be working late again tonight and will see you sometime tomorrow.
Stay out of trouble and Julian still needs to mould the lawn.
Where the hell are you guys?
You scared the shit out of me.
You should look into that.
I brought you something to eat.
Way to go Zeke!
Now get out of the way and let me show you how it's really done.
I want to see Acho finally get it right.
"No, that's cool."
Don't be chicken-shit.
"Look at Pyro, he did it and he's a little kid."
You know what they say...
If you fall of a horse you gotto get right back on.
"What they say, if you eat dirt after falling of 6 meters..."
Like he did last week?
You can do it.
"We are all about trust, right Bro?"
"That a boy, show these Barneys how to catch some air."
Shit!
What are you doing?
Center the tire and the ramp does the work for you...
I told you to be one with the bike.
I know how to do it.
"Damm, where are you head theses days boy?"
What you got on your mind?
"Lead, follow or get out of the way."
You alright?
He's out.
I see you've drawn a tree.
Do you think you're a tree?
"Heh, heh."
- At least I didn't draw a knife.
- What knife?
This knife.
"Oh, you're gonna get your meds upped for that."
You should not be drawing knives in art therapy.
- All right.
"- Ha, ha."
Don't.
Oh!
It's almost like an outside force is guiding me.
Stop it.
Nice work.
- You ruined mine.
- Sorry.
"When my little sister was 8, her appendix burst and she was in the hospital for like a week."
And she was scared of everything.
"The doctors, the needles, the, um, weird plastic kidney-shaped thing that she had to pee in."
Um...
So I made my mom take me to the hospital every day.
And I sat by her bed and I painted her nails and we made fun of the nurses together and...
"I didn't really think I was doing anything that spectacular, you know, because I thought of course I would do that."
She would do the same thing for me.
"But the thing is, um, she hasn't come here to visit me."
Not even once.
I'm glad they don't come.
I don't want anyone to see me in here.
"It just makes me sad, that's all."
"Before we end, I just wanted to mention that this is Bruce's last session."
He'll be leaving tomorrow.
"I drive by your place, I call and hang up."
I'm turning into...
Me.
Yeah.
"A wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen, no matter what."
That's true.
But when I was hurling my body onto yours you did not seem to want to make it happen.
"Yeah, all right."
Here's the thing about that:
You were right.
I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from all these women and having the power that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually fell for one of them.
I didn't know.
"Look, I just went out with your friend Bill and..."
Yeah.
He might be just exactly what I need.
No drama.
"He calls, he does what he says."
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.
And that same wise person told me that I am the rule.
That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change.
That I have to stop thinking that...
I'm the exception.
You are my exception.
[PHONE RINGS]
Conor Barry.
"Hi, it's Mary at the Blade."
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.
Really?
You don't think the muscle T is too much?
I think the shirt you're wearing now is probably more you.
"What, you here?"
Ok.
"Maybe there was some truth in there, but..."
You know what?
"You're seeing who I am, who I really am, after all these years, and that's a good thing."
It's really important for me not to know anything about you.
I don't wanna know that you're an alcoholic or that you killed a guy and had sex with my mother.
You're my therapist.
I need to think of you as superman.
"I can't think of you as drinking and crying and screwing and killing and then ask you to help me with my fear of spiders, you know?"
Yes.
I'm erasing the events of last night from my mind.
You should too.
"- Oh, they're barely there."
- Good.
So last night never happened.
"Hey, boys!"
Now you know my day job.
What can I get yous?
No booze for you.
You have a problem.
I'm not gonna be your enabler.
The meatloaf's good.
Oh!
"Hey, hi!"
I got here as fast as I could.
"I drove like a teenager on coke, but I'm here for you, just like you are for me."
- Great.
How did you know?
- How did I know?
That we were stranded and where we are.
- Dr. storper.
"- Well, you called me, or some woman named Shasta called me and handed you the phone."
.. will go bore as your bolts will become loose.
To know your father's counter schemes after Vasundhara Devi caught him red handed..
.. we replaced Ram G with our Master.
They are planning to kill you.
"- Master, do as I say."
"Master, this is body bullet's remote."
You should handle this.
Okay
Our Master gave you the gun which had dummy bullets.
We showed you a dummy death via cinema technique.
I am a fighter.
There will be no interval until I finish the mission I take up.
Just climax.
"If it missed there, it won't miss here."
Karthi..
Come on!
Jump!
Come on!
Keep going!
Karthi..
Karthi.. Tell me Mr. Ratnam!
"Sorry sir, the entire family has died in the accident."
What?
They collected the bodies on the highway and sent it by cargo sir.
They will handover if you come and sign sir.
I am coming immediately Mr. Ratnam.
"Hey Macha, you had seen a business man in me till now."
Now you will see the actor in me.
Very agonizing thing has happened sir.
Sir..
Vasu..
Business man in you has got the Padmasri.
I do not take orders from lady straw bosses.
Hey hey.
Was that Miss Krail?
Is she back in her office?
Pining for you.
Pining for you!
- Miss Krail?
- Yes.
"Everything's here all ready for you, Mr. Sandover."
- These are the letters for you to carry.
- Thank you.
- Lita?
- Yes?
"I'm all packed, all ready to go."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Well, I-"
- I just wanted to make sure that you hadn't changed your plans.
About what?
"Oh, well, Sandy, there's so many things that I ought to be doing this weekend."
"But you fly down there quite often, you said."
And you said you might even leave early tomorrow to be in Phoenix around noon.
"And what if I do, Sandy?"
Do you have something to tell me you don't want anybody to know you're telling me?
"Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do."
I-
- I have several more tidbits about people in the office.
- But that's not what I meant.
- It's not?
You promised you'd be there.
"Lita, remember the money I mentioned I was coming into?"
"Well, you're the only one who can advise me."
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
"Would you like some brandy in that, Father?"
"Well, the doctors say I shouldn't."
But thank God my will is weak.
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.
The demon is a liar.
He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.
Do not listen.
It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."
-She's convinced that she's--
-There is only one.
"What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?"
Teresa.
What a lovely name.
Stick your cock up her ass you motherfucking worthless cocksucker.
-Be silent!
-Aah!
"Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name."
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
"""Because you are really starting"
"""to make us elf people look very crazy."
"""And what you need to do"
"""is sit your ass in the corner,"
"""enjoy your goddamn cookies,"
"""and have a good life in this raggedy son of a bitch."
"""'Cause I got all the edibles a pimp could want to eat."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"Pimpin', pimpin'."""
All right.
I know there's a few people confused.
"Some people are confused like,"
"""What the hell is a Katt Williams?"
"What is that, a negro feline or something like that?"""
Have fun.
"Kanye West, man."
"That short man complex, man, that shit transcends species."
That's why you'll see a Chihuahua trying to fight Rottweiler for no reason.
I know when I talk about dogs some people get tight.
"""Don't talk about the baby."""
Baby?
"Ma'am, your poodle did not come out of your vagina."
I don't know what you talking about.
It's not a baby.
It's a dog.
You know what I'm saying?
"And y'all be abusing the hell out y'all dogs, and I'm gonna tell you how."
Putting them little outfits on them.
They don't wanna wear that shit.

He's got fur.

Still nothing from the Maquets?
They already paid once.
And they shall pay again.
Put another note under their door.
I'm in no mood for tenderness.
You will stand behind the hedge and you will wait for my signal.
"Yes ,Madame."
"When I raise my hand, you will begin."
How much longer?
"Two hours, Madame."
"You do not have two hours, you have one!"
Stupid girl!
Go and find out at what time the King is expected to make his entry.
"Yes, Madame."
I had forgotten.
What?
How exquisite you are.
Don't ever go away again.
Monseur and Madame Maquet.
Did you hear the latest news about the Count De Valletta?
No.
A very sad affair.
"Despite several reminders from his creditors, he refused to pay his debt."
"The King was informed, sentenced him to 10 years in prison."
I thought you should know.
If it isn't France's favorite couple!
"On the right, the Duke d'Orleans, sporting a delicious spring outfit and on the left, looking in fine fettle..."
My wife is pregnant.
The King!
"Look at me, each and every one of you."
You all have a choice to make.
- And?
It's Lionel Luthor right before he died.
What?
No way.
Creepy.
I can't believe you got this.
It's gonna get creepier.
There's someone else in the room.
Lionel Luthor might have been pushed.
You think this blurry blob of pixel is the killer?
Trust me.
This has Pulitzer written all over it.
What are you waiting for?
Sharpen the shot.
It's not that easy.
My computer's not powerful enough.
What about that heavy-duty hardware that Lana has stashed at the Isis foundation?
Nice.
"I can upload this bad boy to the foundation's server right now and, if we're on Lana's system, we could use Chloe's mad skills with a CPU."
"That is, if we can pry her away from Clark."
Chloe and I share the same DNA.
"Trust me, Jimmy..."
She is gonna want to be in on this.
I'm so sorry about your father.
"Thank you, Chloe."
He visited you here tonight.
He really wasn't himself.
"I fear, in his deluded state of mind, my father disposed of some valuable family heirlooms."
Did he give you anything?
Other than the feeling that something was definitely off?
No.
He was here for a few minutes.
"Yes, I could make a killing on my own land, but they had to have the other property, too."
I'd promised I could deliver.
"Oh, I made a killing, all right."
"When I tried to get Somers' option in writing, he wanted more money to cover all those checks that he was kiting, or else he'd block my sale, block it so I couldn't deliver."
"He wanted more money, then more."
"We got into a fight, and-- that's-- that's how I made my killing."
"Axel, for heaven's sake hurry up!"
"The plane won't wait, Axel."
I forgot I need another shirt.
"Here, I'll do that."
It's so nice of both of you to come and see us off.
"Ja, we send you a postcard from Copenhagen."
"And, Mr. Mason, you won't forget--"
The hospital.
Don't worry.
We'll get that land back.
And raise the money.
Mr. Hadley's already helping.
Ja.
I forget my neckties.
Here.
"Edie, you just get him outside."
We'll bring the suitcases.
"Ja, we go."
There is no fool like an old fool.
Ah.
Such a pity.
Hm?
That a man like that should have to wait all those years to get married.
Don't you agree?
You've been my legal secretary long enough to know that that's a leading question.
Here.
It's been open to that same page for the last three days.
"Oh, that's the centre page."
It opens there naturally.
- How long for the pancakes?
- Just a few minutes.
Well I'll finish getting dressed.
Mother?
"Mother, I can't wear this coat."
"Yes, you're right, Samantha."
The colour isn't very becoming to you.
"Oh, that's perfect."
Mother.
"I know, I know."
"I don't understand, but I know."
"I will have a mink coat when Darrin can afford it, and not before."
"Well, by the time Darwin can afford a mink, mink will be extinct."
"Now, be honest with yourself, Samantha."
Wouldn't you adore to have that coat?
Well...
Wear it in good health.
Mother.
You take back this coat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"It's crazy, but I've been looking at that picture of that mink coat for so long, I could've sworn you were just wearing one."
Darrin would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
"I don't know, honey."
L...
I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
I've been doing pretty much the same job for the last three years and what have I accomplished?
"Sweetheart, I think you accomplished a great deal."
Like what?
- My lord?
- He did not call;
He's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
A most unhappy one:
"I would do much to atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio."
- Fire and brimstone!
- My lord?
- Are you wise?
"- What, is he angry?"
May be the letter moved him;
"For, as I think... they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government."
"- Trust me, I am glad on't."
- Indeed!
- My lord?
- I am glad to see you mad.
"- Why, sweet Othello."
- Devil!
I have not deserved this.
"This would not be believed in Venice, though I should swear I saw't:"
'tis very much:
Make her amends;
- she weeps.
"- O devil, devil!"
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears.
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
- Out of my sight!
- I will not stay to offend you.
"I do beseech you lordship, call her back."
Mistress!
"What would you with her, sir?"
"- Who, I, my lord?"
The guy was an industry legend.
Oh.
Wow!
You are so going to hit that.
"No, I just think we're going to be great together on the air."
And on the sofa and on the bed and on the coffee table.
"All right, all right."
I'm gonna go up on the roof and stand there by myself for five minutes.
Have fun.
And that's exactly what she did.
She just stood there.
"All right, kids, I'm gonna level with you."
That's not what she did.
Here's what she did.
"All right, all right."
I'm going to go have a cigarette.
BOTH:
What?
!
NARRATOR:
"I promised her I'd never tell you this, but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin did enjoy the occasional cigarette, and occasionally that occasional cigarette... was more than just occasional."
I just left something like this in my apartment.
"Robin, come on, take it to the roof."
We said no smoking in the apartment after you torched the throw rug doing push-ups.
"All right, all right, all right."
Geez.
"Yeah, Robin, I mean, God, not only is that a filthy habit, but also, can I bum one?"
Sure.
What?

"(normal voice) I don't think he knows that movie, honey."
"Mrs. Dunphy, you're trying to seduce me."
"Okay, let's just give him the gift, all right?"
"Okay, but first, gather around, everybody!"
Riddle me this...
"What has two hands, is wound tight, and has a lot of ticks?"
Alex?
- (laughs)
"- Good guess, but no."
"This was made in Switzerland, not in the Disneyland Hotel."
Awesome!
A watch!
We wanted to give it to you early so you could wear it to graduation today.
Yeah.
It's shockproof.
"Oh, good."
You can show it your grades.
- I love it.
- What time is it?
(voice breaking) Time for my little man to go out in the world and make his mark
- like the tiny trouper he used to be.
- (sighs)
Hold on.
I'll be right back.
"I remember when he was so small, we'd give him a bath in the sink."
Here we go.
"Dad, we really got to talk about the crying."
"When we graduated, you were a mess, and it was humiliating."
Showing emotion is part of being a sexy modern man.
Ask anyone who was raised on Alan Alda.
I don't think we have to worry about him going anywhere anytime soon.
He just installed a mini fridge and a hammock in his room.
- No!
You will be playing right into her hand.
I'm a good person!
You knew what you were getting into when you married me.
"Okay, but no crawling up her butt."
"No, like, ""Oh, we're just so happy you're here!"""
- I don't sound like that.
"- Dad, did you say something?"
All right.
So.
How was your trip?
"Not easy, as you can imagine."
Anna-Kat and I saw a video of this guy going through security who was caught smuggling a monkey in his underpants.
"It was supposed to be sedated, but it was awake."
- And very angry.
- Mm.
"Well, uh, we're happy you're here."
I...
"Check on the, uh, Thanksgiving."
Just leave it.
"Grandma is known for pretending, so even though she looks hurt, remember the important thing is that she's not hurt."
So no one talk about the monkey bars on Grandma's head.
I love watching your mouth move.
Dude.
"Anna-Kat, you don't need to squeeze your stress ball."
Mom is fine.
We are like E.T. and Elliott.
Whatever happens to one happens to the other.
Oh!
You're like me.
So you get a weird feeling in your tummy whenever you see a mommy that's taller than a daddy.
Totally.
Come on.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!
I'm going.
I'm going.

Sorry about that.
Now... you know I can't be letting a ten-year-old boy go unsupervised like you've been doing.
"And trust me, a 13-year-old kid on probation is not our idea of a good caretaker."
Now...

Judge Bradley's a big baseball fan.

"Look, I know that you and your family have been through a hard time."
And seems to me that you could use a little help.
"So you look to me and your sister-in-law, because we're just trying to help you out."
You understand?
Hollis?
- This is just temporary.
You know that.
"It's not like last time, okay?"
Yes.
Oooh!
Erie!
"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
You want me to start buying?
At 72?
I should say not.
I've passed the word that i'm not gonna buy until the price goes down.
In a few days it'll be a flat as a flounder.
The board of directors of the erie railroad wish to announce that they have declared a dividend on all outstanding stock of 50%.
Whoever heard of a 50% dividend?
"Nobody, but it makes erie the best buy on the market."

50%!

You don't know how lucky you are.

I didn't think drew was smart enough to find a new way to start a bull rush.
But i'm gonna fight him.
Go ahead and buy.
But it's a false price!
"False as wooden teeth, but the suckers are falling for it, and the only way to beat drew is to get control."
"No matter what it costs, i can make the railroad worth it when i'm boss."
"But commodore, i don't think- go ahead, buy."

"Yes, but it makes no sense."
It's not like she's asking him for anything.
"Sit down, love."

- Ok.

- Which guys?
"- Besides, I see the dance team checking us out too."
"That Hayley girl, can't take her eyes off me."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Hayley, the one with the college boyfriend Hayley?"
She dates boys in college?
None of the girls on the dance team date boys in high school.
- Oh.
We'll see about that.
- Better not let Emma hear you.
"Please, I can handle Emma."
What?
I pretty sure no one handles Emma but Emma.
"Hey, Brandon!"
Are you saying that this invisibility thing means I might not be able to get beer?

"I tried to connect with her, but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am."
"Well, j-just go simple-- does she like TV?"
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
Sports?
No.
"But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard, just... slathered in Bengay."
"Well, does she like books?"

I'll start on another room.
Does he always drink?
He's disappointed for me.
Loyalty is always more passionate than reason.
I guess that's why I came to see you first.
There was sentiment for making you principal.
"Please don't feel uncomfortable, Mr. Rossi."
My time came too late.
- I hope we can work together.
- Of course we can.
"I suppose you have a lot of new, progressive ideas."
"No, not really."
"I'm rather old-fashioned, as a matter of fact."

One more chance.
"See, to be Amity is to forgive."

And yourself.
"You're hurting, Tris."

What are you doing here?
We were to meet at the hotel.
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.
"A lovely ceremony, isn't it?"
Beautiful.
Ididn't think she was so young.
I guess you came because you didn't trust me.
I came because we can't go another day without talking.
You needn't worry.
It's over with Angela.
I've got proof.
During the ceremony I didn't cry.
But you did.
That's true.
And you needn't.
Don't you believe me?
It isn't that.
"It took me ten years to get over it, but I swear it's over."
Marco...
"Believe me, it's over."
Angela and I traveled a lot.
"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?
Everything's not okay.
- Hold on.
You give him an hour with the actors?
That's a joke.
Stop and think before you open your mouth and don't tell me it's a joke.
So that's why it is in the makeup room?
"Do it in the stairwell, for all I care."
Stop overreacting.
You're doing it wrong.
Then tell me how to do it.
"He's here after so many years and is so excited, you could at least give him a proper welcome."
"Believe me, I tried."
- I don't believe you.
"After he got out of jail,"
I asked him to direct in the basement hall.
He got up and left.
"I fought with everyone who didn't want to see his face in this building, and there were lots, there still are."
"You deserve a medal, Alex."
"- The next day, he changed his mind."
"Maybe Mother spoke with him, I don't know."
But he called and said he'd accept my offer.
I sent him the play.
"It was small, but it was a gem."
We chose the cast and scheduled a rehearsal.
"He stuttered, lashed out at the actors, came unprepared, the actors said they wouldn't work with him."
That was a long time ago.
What about the big stage?
Why not there?

Thank you.
Have you given any more thought to what I've asked - about enlisting?
I just want to know whether or not they'd take me.
That's all.
"But if they say ""yes"", then that won't be all, will it?"
"Erica, I'm not going to do anything rash."
I just want to know my options.
I suppose I was hoping that the girls and me wanting you to stay with us would be the only option you'd need.

That's the way her trust is set up.

"No, I didn't know that."
"And, uh...how do you know that?"
"I keep my ears open, too."

"- Oh,thank you."
- Robert rubia.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.
Doj new deputy attorney general.
Senator.
"What can I do for you,mr.Rubia?"
Supreme court... with confirmation being 3 days away I was hoping perhaps...
I'm sorry.
What were you hoping?
That you publicly declear your intention To vote with the party for the president's pick.
I'll vote as I see fit.
"I understand that you need to feel independent, be your own man on this one."
This is not a political function.
I'm here for my wife.
I won't take up any more of your time.
"It's good to see you,senator."
What in the holy hell is he thinking about?
"Excuse me,but where's sara?"
She's taking a call.
I just checked.
She's not in the lobby and she wasn't in the ladies' room.
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you please take your seats."
The program is about to begin.
Excuse me.
"...And if you don't have it,maybe janet, Call janet for any numbers.... have you seen a woman,brown hair, light colored dress?"
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.
"A lovely ceremony, isn't it?"
Beautiful.
I didn't think she was so young.
I guess you came because you didn't trust me.
I came because we can't go another day without talking.
You needn't worry.
It's over with Angela.
I've got proof.
During the ceremony I didn't cry.
But you did.
- That's true.
- And you needn't.
- Don't you believe me?
- It isn't that.
"It took me ten years to get over it, but I swear it's over."
- Marco...
"- Believe me, it's over."
Angela and I traveled a lot.
"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
They kept her away from drugs and from me.
- You still loved her?
- Yes.
"They're sexting, they're krumping, they're twatting each other 'cause their day's so special they have to share it with the world."
It's called tweeting.
I call it twatting!
"Look, Joey, we were single."
We had our fun.
We're not missing out on anything.
"No, you were single, you had fun."
"I got married early, so I never got to experience this."
I have a feeling you had a chance to experience lots of things.
"But, look, if you want to go play ""Guess Your Disease"""
"or ""Let Me Translate Your Tribal Tattoo,"" knock yourself out."
You don't get it.
I'm here trapped on an island with a woman who can't even stand the sight of me.
And whose fault is that?
It's not my fault!
"Dude, relationships are a two-way street, not a highway and a bike path."
"If it matters to you, work at it."
"And if it doesn't, then don't!"
But make a decision.
I want to be married 'cause I want to have people I can share my life with.
I don't wanna be doing this.
I know what I want.
I want it...
Look.
"Hey, Dave, it's not 'cause I don't want it, okay?"
You make the best of your situation!
My situation's to party!
Yeah!
"Yeah, definitely."
San Diego!
Remember me?
Where have you been?
Police.
- So we have to find these '63s?
- We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know,they're not so bad."
"Lucy,get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr.Sengupta.
"Thank you,Warden James."

"I don't know,Hauser.Maybe the pirate life ain't for you."
"All right,tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr.Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case,aren't you?"
A smile.
"On a child's face,it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world."
"But on yours,it's all the company of hades."
"If you've left any more of your mines on the mainland,son, it will be our singular aim to find out just where they are before anyone else is blown to kingdom come."

"No,the lady does not.But nice thought.Thank you."
Peppermint.

"She has good taste in music,Mr.Hauser."
Any improvement?
I'm sorry.
Look at that cannon!
Would you mind?
"Don't be ornery, Bill."
Let him see it.
Yankee army issue!
Where'd you get it?
"I say, where'd you get it?"
Took it off a dead Yank.
Which battle?
Battle for our hen coop!
"That's all any of them Yankees are, chicken stealers."
You hear that?
Chicken stealers!
"[conductor] Station-stop, Kingston, Kingston."
What do you think you're doing?
He didn't mean any harm.
He just can't help playing jokes on people.
I wasn't speaking to you.
Why'd you go and play a cheap Yankee trick like that?
You're right welcome to the seat.
I was just havin' a little fun.
I'll be dogged if he can't even talk like a Yankee.
"Sit down here, pint-pot, and see if you can teach me."
"[Pittenger] In spite of Campbell and Buff um, we all reached Marietta in safety and spent a restless night in the Railroad Hotel."

"What are the fine clothes for, Mr. Andrews?"
Today I'm an official of the Western and Atlantic Railroad.
"- A very high official, I hope."

It's 15 minutes till train time.
"Oh, what a clever thing to say."
How brainy you are.
Got a degree?
"Just cos you earn four times as much as a nurse, you think you can cheek Richie Rich, do you?"
"Now, that's what I like to see."
"A good, old-fashioned bobby."
"Don't worry, Richie."
"These days, prison food is quite acceptable."
"Mind you, it's not so nice when they nail you to the table and shove it up your backside."
"Well, Eddie, the long and winding road is over."
"The great god, public, claims another weary showbiz victim."
Huh.
"Oscar Wilde, playwright, arrested for his beliefs."
"Lenny Bruce, comedian, arrested for his beliefs."
"Richie Rich, celebrity, arrested..."
For going nicking down the local shop.
Huh!
Lt'll be the trial of the century.
I shall be tried in majestic splendour by a jury of my peers.
"Parky, Tarby, Lynchy, Sue Lawley."
- Annie Diamondy.
- Debbie Greenwoody.
"Selina Scotty, Maggie Philbiny."
"Bloody hell, what a fantastic jury."
We might be on for a sex sesh after the trial.
"Too right except you won't be there, cos you'll be in pris."
I'll be all right.
I'm gonna plead insanity.
Damn.
Let's face it.
You've got the evidence.
Let me out!
Didn't I run fast?
That's fine.
"But you have the plates, don't you?"
"Yes, the plates are with me."
Kania is in for some complications.
Baba and Nawab have burnt down our godown.
That's destiny.
"If you say, I will blow apart both of them."
You are my younger brother.
I can sacrifice several such godowns in your name.
- l won't involve you in this fight.
- Then would we sit quietly?
Enjoy yourselves.
I am there to look after the business. I am your elder brother.
Nawab and Baba are the backbone of Uncle.
Everybody knows.
Only I know what the weakness of Uncle is!
Do you know what Uncle's choice is?
"He likes gold, Mona, and Mona along with gold!"
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
Let me think it over.
I am your nephew.
I am your blood.
"By working as an ordinary driver in your business not just me, even you are insulted."
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
I am constantly worried that because of your foolishness the two of them shouldn't have to face trouble.
What did I do to make such a thing happen?
So you have come?
"These are my two arms, my two tigers..."
Baba and Nawab!
What's the matter?
Why are you so sullen?
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith

He's fascinated by insects.

Always filling the house up with bugs he's collected.

Maybe we can bring home something new for his collection.
[Scanner beeping]
Lift it up.
Dump it back there.
Stop!
You put Butterscotch Betty down.
"Oh, we were just looking for a price tag."
I know what's going on here.
You're hiding the good dresses to make sure no one else can get them at our annual half-off sale tomorrow.
"Yeah, that's what we're doing."
We're hiding the good dresses.
"In fact, I just caught another Sneaky Sue."
"Oh, I'm Sophie."
"Oh, wow, wow, wow."
"Oh, look at the color."
That's not color.
That's radiation.
That dress is a one of a kind.
Meaning there's only one?
"No, we have two."
And I have two bridesmaids!
I love it when life works out perfect like this.
[indistinct chatter]
"(Public address announcement) Ladies, our half off sale will begin in a minute."
Look at this place.
There are more desperate women crammed in here than the splash zone at a Kenny Chesney concert.
I know.
It's like Black Friday at Walmart
"And like Black Friday, hopefully someone will trample me."
"Cause thanks to these dresses, my life is over."
"Max, did you hear me?"
My life is over.
You said that when the Chinese food place forgot the duck sauce.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I had a whole other scenario planned for my return to The Times."
I sure wish your mother was here.
She's coming.
Yeah.
She'll be here.
Tell your mother I love her.
I was... hard on you.
I pushed you... away.
I'm glad you... came... home.
I'm proud of you.
He's gone.
Okay...
The big toast.
"Before I start, is there anyone who hasn't written me a speech?"
"I mean, it really makes me wonder how screwed up you think I am that I can't be trusted to say a few things about my brother."
"The thing is, uh,"
"Oh, yeah, the thing is these are all pretty lame."
Not one of them mentions my brother's musical theater phase when we all thought he was gay.
Seriously.
"I mean you have not heard disturbing until you've heard him singing ""One Hand, One Heart"" in the shower every morning."
"I tease my brother a lot, but the truth is the truth is I'm very proud of him."
"I'm, uh..."
I'm proud of how kind he is...
"I'm, uh, I'm proud of how giving he is, and, uh... he's a very lucky man."
Really.
My father's dead.
We'll get through.
Get Gray back to town.
What?
W-Wait a minute...
"Come tomorrow, what's left of us will need a leader."
I think we've lost enough in that department for one day.
We're gonna need every set of hands we can get.
Talk.
"Well, I was headed into work on 57th."
Today was my day to open up the shop.
So I took the 5:00 a.m. bus into town.
"Just got off and headed down State Street, and that's when I heard..."
It was awful.
It sounded like a dying animal.
"And I-I got to the corner, and that's when I saw him."
"And he-he was lying there on his side, and, um, there was all this blood and..."
But he was still alive.
What time was that?
It was just after 5:30.
"Okay, then what?"
"Well, he-he reached out his hand like he was asking for help."
"I tried to apply pressure to the wound, but it was too late;"
he was gone.
When did you call 911?
I called from my cell on the way to work about a quarter to 6:00.
You left him there?
"I felt bad, but I had to leave."
Man was dead?
Yeah.
My boss gets mad if I'm late.
"I need this job, Agent Gibbs."
Did you tell the 911 operator that Petty Officer Adams was dead?
"I gave them the location, my name, the address where I was at."
There any other witnesses there at the scene?
Just me; that's why I called as soon as I could.
I didn't want to leave him out there alone.
You ever watch someone die?
Not me.
Now I can't stop seeing his face.
"In fact, my involvement with you and mr."
"Stark could,"
"On the face of it, be considered treasonous."
"I don't need to know the details of your past, mr."
Jarvis.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Our investigators found an open manhole cover
They assume the thief came up there.
Carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment?
Seems unlikely.
You said it rained the night of the break-in.
It was a positive deluge.
Why?

Ever track down your missing boyfriend?
Brooke!
Are you joining us?
"Look, maybe I was unclear."
Go away.
"I'll take that as a ""no."""
"The way he looked at me, I wanted to cry, but I also got really angry."
"That's probably natural, right?"
That's a lot of history there.
I don't know.
"I think when Audrey went all doom and gloom on me this morning, she really got into my head."
I think something is up with her.
It's also Audrey.
It's hard to tell.
- You think your dad will stick around?
- ‭I have no idea.
He doesn't exactly have the most reliable track record.
My dad left us when I was little.
"If he showed up now, I'd probably punch him in the teeth."
"Hey, Fight Club, not cool."
- You were listening to all that?
"- No, no."
Eli and his dad have a complicated relationship.
And Eli's crazy.
I get it.
I definitely wanted to hit my dad when he left.
So I had to give you some sympathy points.
Can you stand up?
Do you need me to help you up?
I must learn well.
"Someday, I must possess acting skills comparable to this guy's."
"- When I said laughable,"
- Everyone together...
I didn't really mean it's funny.
I meant it's an embarrassment.
Do you understand?
Embarrassment?
Is it as bad as that?
It is.
"To me, it is!"
You're not allowed to leave!
I want you to wear the Love Me Dept uniform with me and be my nice partner.
"Gong Xi, I have run out of other options now, so I'd like to ask you to help me."
See if you can completely undo the knot in Mary's heart.
Don't rehearse anymore!
No one wants to watch such an idiotic show!
"Mary, how can you be so disruptive?"
I also think that the jie jie's response isn't very rational.
Let's see you act it out.

So you didn't tell them anything.
Um...actually I told them you went to Mexico for cockfights.
"You know what, though?"
"Even if they don't believe me, they'll never look for you here."
Did you seriously bring a loofah?
What's a loofah?
"Hey, you said bring whatever was around the house."
But I meant like survival supplies like rope or muskets and not...
Kio's cucumber moisturizer.
I hate airplanes.
I don't even know what keeps them up.
They're made out of sticks and bed sheets.
Why don't they just open up in two and drop Jimmy like a stone into water?
"That's right, Evelyn, you don't understand anything about it."
You've never done it.
You don't know why I do it.
So would you please just hold it down and let me think?

You should just leave me here.

Just when I'm getting used to you?
- You mean that?
"- Yeah, I mean that."

What is it?
It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.

I think it should fit.
There's something else in there too.
Thanks.

"Tell me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
He didn't tell you about Pete ?
No .
Who is Pete ?
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible because he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
What did he do ?
He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and the sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while, he heard a voice inside that said:"

Your mother never said that you were so lovely.

There's some good stuff here.
"You know, a little kid that's staying over at the motel found this medallion."
"I thought it was yours, but I see you're wearing yours."
Where did you find that?
A little kid found it in the RV.
That's not mine.
I see that.
That's Stu's.
"Well, give it back to him."
"Oh, Stu's going to be happy about this."
Look at that.
Where do you think that came from?
- I don't know--
- See the work in that?
Think anybody does anything like that these days?
You know how much that's worth?
You know what gold is these days?
You know where it's going?
[chuckles] Nobody knows where it's going.
"I'll tell ya, people are gettin' the fever for it now."
Everybody's looking for it.
"Everybody wants it, everybody's after it."
"You know, you could help me, if you would, you and Stu."
Sure.
"I got to go back over to the gulley and look around, and you guys know that country better than anybody."
"I thought maybe if you'd ride over with me and help me look around, we might come up with something."
"- Well, you want to go look around?"
- Yeah.
"Sure, that's no problem."
- The kid's at the motel?
- Yeah.
What's his name?
- Unless maybe that's what you want... - Cohen!
- What?
Come on!
Just wait a second.
- I believed you.
"How you were changing, that you just wanted to be friends."
- I do!
That's...
Maybe I just...
I can't be just friends with you.
"Well, then, I guess maybe this is it for us."
I'm so tired right now.
I
- I didn't even sleep at all.
"- Oh, dude, the only thing holding my head up is my lungs. - Sorry, man."
- I handled that Summer situation so wrong...
I just...
- I really shouldn't have returned her phone calls.
- She never called you.
- I should've dated other girls.
- What other girls?
"Maybe if I'd played her hot and cold, right, mess with her mind a little bit, then I don't know."
I think it potentially could
"- Look, man, I'm sorry, really, I am, and I would love to rehash the evening second by second one more time, but I'm late."
-
- Uh...
I'm meeting my lab partner.
I've got this physics assignment.
- On a Saturday?
"- Ryan, the whole geek routine... it was really amusing at first, but I think you're taking things a little bit too far."
- Thi
"- I just need to talk about me for, like, several more hours at least."
Hmph!
Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
"You give them an inch, they swim all over you."
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
"Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss."
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
"No, sir."
I'd keep her under tight control.
"- You're right, Sebastian."
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
"Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble."
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
[Sebastian] How do I get myself into these situations?
"I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager."
Hmm?
What is that girl up to?
[Sebastian pants]
[Gasps]
Huh?
"Ariel, are you OK?"
[Ariel] If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

"Come along, dear."
I'll tuck you in again.
"He's wicked, isn't he?"
"Was there anything else, Julian?"
"One of these days, Auntie, somebody will cut that iron umbilicus... and maybe your throat in the bargain."
"Go to bed immediately, Merle."
And see that you stay there.
"Hello, Corbett."
Is Merle ready yet?
"Miss Gilbert, won't you come in?"
I'll tell her you're here.
Thank you.
"Well, good morning, Miss Gilbert."
How very nice to see you again.
"Hello, Mr. Langley."
Where are you two young ladies off to this time?
"Lunch, fashion show."
I'll be taking some pictures if sleepyhead doesn't make me late.
Merle had a restless night.
"You know, Mr. Langley, it's always been my one great ambition to be able to sleep in till 11:00 every morning."
"Well, you'll just have to marry a rich man."
"Unfortunately, they've all been spoken for-- especially the handsome, distinguished ones."
Gina--
"Well, it's about time, lazy bones."
"Hello, Mrs. Langley."
"Good morning, Gina."
You're looking very attractive today.
Thank you very much.
I wish I could have clothes like that.
This?
It's only 14.95.
But it's so sophisticated.
Let's go home.
"A peaceful, stay-at-home kind of day in a town  very much like your own."
"But then, suddenly, without warning atomic holocaust!"
But how does one survive an atomic attack?
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
He says his boat ran into a sea monster.
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.
It was a metal meteor.
It ate his boat.
My dad says--
It wasn't any of those.
"What would you know about it, Poindexter?"
Don't make me come over there.
Hands over your head Keep low to the ground
Time to duck and cover The bombs are coming down
Duck and cover
It's about 50 or 60 feet high and it only eats metal.
"Shut up, you little spaz!"
It's been sent by foreigners to take over the country.
We should bomb it to smithereens before it does.
'Cause all the kids who don 't Will cease to be around
Thanks for the scrap.
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this...
... thislargebiteout ofit.
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.
-What could've done this?
-I told you what.
Strange invaders.
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
While behind the wheel of a car with headlights on.
So?
"- Marisa, how long have you smoked?"
None of your business.
- Just humor me.
"I don't know, since, like, 10th grade."
When I was 15.
- You've always smoked Camels?
"Pretty much, except for when I've bummed from friends."
You've seen that pack of Camels thousands of times.
Think real hard about the man on the package.
Was he sitting on the camel or is he leading him with a rope?
"Oh, come on, Marisa, this is a fastball right down the middle."
This is ridiculous.
"- Ah-ah-ah, no cheating."
Come on.
"Okay, fine."
I am 99 percent sure that the man is leading the camel by a rope.
Shit.
There is no man.
"Wow, that's crazy."
What people see and what they think they see are often two different things.
How can we put so much weight on what a witness saw in a flash in the middle of the night?
"Trick question or whatever, the fact is you don't admit to murder if you didn't do it."
They wore him down until he believed what they told him to believe.
- I want another vote.
Judd?
Okay.
All those favoring guilty?
"Hey, Jean."
Yeah?
- Did you clear out my messages?
Oh.
"Well, I-I guess we might have a minute."
Uh... is there...
anything you'd like to share with the students?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I got somethin'."
"They tell you you gotta learn your a-b-c's, but what they don't tell you is, you gotta learn them backwards while balancing on one foot with a flashlight in your face while some guy you went to high school with"

Ha!
(Bell rings) Oh!
Look at that.
Time for lunch.
"Let's please form a line, uh, by the door."
Go!
(Children speaking indistinctly)
"Hey, come on."
I'll take you to lunch.
"Uh, I don't know."
I think I'm supposed to tell the principal if I leave the school.
"No, we don't need to bother the principal."
"You know, they don't want some stranger coming in, saying he's gonna take a small child. (Chuckles)"
Hmm.
"Bye, guys."
Gotta go.
Taking aunt Ginny to the movies.
"Of course, she calls it ""The Picture Show."""
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
(Door opens and closes) Isn't it nice how good mom is to the aunts?
(Scoffs and chuckles)
What?
You cannot be that big of an idiot.
You really have no idea where mom's going?
"- Oh, just until I make one."
- What time is your appointment?
Why?
My teeth are straight.
To justify charging me more money that I don't have.
Robert Dumanjik from the District Attorney's office.
The District...
"Oh, yeah, okay, put him through."
- [telephone rings]
- Hello?
"Hi, Karen, This is Bob Dumanjik, We haven't met, I'm the,"
"- No, I know who you are."
"- Oh, good, good,"
"I understand that you're representing that suit against Atlantor,"
"Yes,"
"I wondered if we could talk about it,"
Talk about what exactly?
"Well, that's what we'd talk about,"
But I don't think that I understand.
"Well, we'd talk about that too, How about tomorrow?"
What is this about?
Should I be expecting a subpoena?
"Oh, no, no, I just think there are some things that are in our mutual interest to talk about,"
Let's say 10:00?
- Downtown?
"- If that's okay,"
- Okay.
"- Great, See you then,"
What was that about?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
Does this much slate exist?
They'll have to dig up Rhode lsland to find this much.
How's he holding up?
Same as he always was.
"They wanna lock him up, he says, ""Yes, sir, lock me up. """
"They wanna put him on trial, he says, ""Yes, sir, put me on trial. """
He'd help tie the noose if they asked him to.
He's your father.
What's the matter with you?
When I was about 7 years old...
... ourownersdecidedtosell him and us kids away from our mother.
Put us on a wagon and we ended up going to Alabama.
She stayed behind in Georgia.
"And after a while, he had told me that she died."
"Now, I was just a little boy at the time, but all that time..."
... Iwaitedforhim tofind away  to keep our mother with us...
... oruswithher .
But he never said one word.
He didn't do anything.
"He didn't argue, he didn't even beg."
He didn't put up one damn ounce of fight to keep our family together.
Harsh.
He should have done something.
What are you doing with all that string?
Keeping my mind busy.
What's a white lady doing in jail?
My own son locked me up.
Sometimes they don't rightly appreciate what you do for them.
Truer words were never spoken.
[EZRA chuckling ]
"Well, well."
"My, my."
"It's a touch baroque, but I like what you've done with the place."
-What do you want?
I told them I was on sabbatical.
"Uh, where was I?"
When did I get back?
What the hell is a sabbatical?
"Relax, they're not coming to see you."
"They're going straight to school, say hi to Ritchie and be out of there before their beers get warm."
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now, so leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hey, it's me, just thought I'd true you again."
"Get that, I'll wait."
I'm at the door.
She's coming.
"I didn't want to just stop by, but it was either this or drop leaflets on your lawn from a plane, so, here I am."
I was going to return your calls but I've been super-duper busy.
"Yeah, since Witch Detective took off, we hardly see her anymore."
Get out.
Come on in.
"What-what, um, what are you doing here?"
"Well, I can't stop thinking about our date."
I thought it... it was great.
"But then, when you didn't call me back, I thought maybe it wasn't great."
"And then I started thinking about the other things I thought were great, and maybe they weren't great either."
I-Is baseball great?
Is democracy great?
I-I don't know anymore.
"No, it was;"
it was a great date.
So let's go on another one.
"Oh, I don't know."
From my days in Monte Carlo.
"You been to Monte Carlo, Sam?"
No.
Have you ever been to Pahrump?
[Both Chuckle] Exactly how long have you been planning this?
"Ages, gumdrop."
"Now let's run along, shall we?"
"You know, I'd thought you had your work cut out since Mr. Wu's departure."
"It's so unfortunate, this haunting."
I had no idea when I had that newspaper delivered to him that it would upset him so much.
"[Chuckles] So, you had the newspaper delivered."
"- Oh, I'll get that."
- I'll have those then.
Hmm.
Knipex.
"If I held on to these, would you die a slow and painful death?"
"Well, if I did, you wouldn't be able to say you were Vegas's top host."
"Yes, but it suddenly doesn't seem so important, compared to your certain suffering and demise."
You'd rather kill me than compete against me?
"That's pathetic, really."
Honestly thought you were better than this.
I am better than this.
[Wind Howling]
[Siren Wailing In Distance]
[Phone Beeps]
Hello.
"Hey, Mike."
Yeah.
"Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not a ghost."
It's just a dislodged cable.
"Uh, must be the wind."
"- Yeah, right."
Long distance?
Chicago?
"See here, Mr. Norstaad."
I've been your leading representative in the Midwest for the past ten years now.
You can't do this to me.
Do?
I do something?
"You, Somers, who's ever running things--"
He's got a salesman in Chicago trying to saturate the market.
"Why, he's taking orders at prices so low the furniture bearing your trademark could be sold retail for less than I paid you."
"Oh, no."
"No, that's impossible."
Is it?
"Well, I've seen signed duplicates of the orders with my own eyes."
I call you back.
Parker.
I told you I wanted you to bring me some pieces to show to salesmen.
These pieces ready to show to anybody.
- I've told you I want production--
- But he's not in today.
If you'll call for an appointment--
"So now I need an appointment, huh?"
What's the matter?
You are hiding from somebody?
"No, no, of course not."
"Come on into my office where we can talk, Norstaad."
Aha.
"Ramsey from Chicago, he calls me."
He tells me that you sell furniture under my trademark cheaper than I can make it.
I want to know how can you do that?
"That's my business, I'm afraid."
"No, mine."
"So, anyway..."
It's really great to see you again.
Yeah.
"Yeah, you too."
Then...
You're happy?
Yeah.
"Like you said, It's all good."
"It's just... kinda hard knowing that I'm not even 30, and the greatest thing that will ever happen to me already happened."
"You take care of yourself, okay?"
Am I... the best thing that's ever happened to you?
"Baby, come on."
'Course you are.
- Really?
- Sure.
You're not counting playing in the Super Bowl.
"I mean, come on."
It's the Super Bowl.
But you're definitely number two.
"Oh, wait."
There's that million-dollar check I got for putting my name on that stupid barbeque grill.
That didn't suck.
"So it goes Super Bowl, big check, then you."
Dinner at the White House...
"When I was planning this party, I kept looking at these kids."
"And they're all smiling, and happy, and hopeful, and..."
"I kept thinking, ""How many of these kids are happy today?"""
I would say... all the ones who didn't come to this party.
I'm serious.
There were 28 of us in the class.
"How many of us are already, like, stuck in lousy jobs, or bad marriages?"
How many of us have already made that one big dumb choice we'll never really recover from?
"Yes, Inspector."
This way.
"We are too late, Inspector."
"Search the entire hotel, they must not be far."
Let's go!
Wait!
"Listen, Inspector, it's Adriana's beacon, we have a lead,come!"
"Based on the distance and heading, they are driving towards Guayaquil."
"To Guayaquil, are you sure?"
"That is what I believe, Inspector."
"Hold all flights, no one must leave."
"Advise the patrol boats, we will comb the entire Guayaquil."
"Is she ready, does she have petrol?"
"Yes sir, shall I accompany you?"
I would not recommend it.
"Quickly, push off the boat."
Call the pilots and advise them to be ready.
Yes.
Ms. Bristol.
"HQ to flies, HQ to flies, HQ to flies"
"Flies to HQ, go ahead."
"This is an emergency, have plane 336 ready to carry out plan two."
We will carry out plan two.
Have them send a plane to cover us if needed.
"Send a plane to protect us if necessary, on the river."
"Understood, we will be ready."
"Captain, radar registers a light craft that is closing in fast to our stern."
Its Dinamo.
Prepare arms!
Battlestations!
"Attention, light helicopters,patrol entire sector."
"Attention, Yacht club, attention, Yacht club."

It is possible to be known what happens?
"Ah, Doctor."
You what makes here?
The washbasins of the beadles are down.
"Doctor, already knows that I undergo hypertrophy to the prostate."
"Commonly call prostatismo, whose symptoms is:"
"first, frequent necessity to tinkle, secondly, difficulty in starting up the urinary flow."
Him memory that the classes occur in the classroom and that you not even are authorized.
Have you seen a naked man enter?
-A naked man?
-Naked.
It often happens to him to see naked men?
"Good, in fact, lately, there has been a case in that..."
"But, what makes say me?"
You are a dummy.
It is not allowed to return to take that class from confidences.
"It remembers that you it is not more than a beadle, however I am Dr. Cicchirini."
Benito.
"Benito, hears..."
Ben.
You must call Ben to me.
How I must say it?
In agreement.
You do not cause that the faults of the parents fall on the children.
You have to use some kind of protection or you are going to be--
"Mom, I am not having sex, all right?"
Really!
I am not even close to an embarrassing degree.
Okay.
"I am sorry, honey."
I want you to be prepared when the time comes.
- Whenever the time comes.
"- lt will never come, not with Jordan."
- ls that what is bothering you?
"- No, nothing is bothering me."
- Something is bothering you.
"- Mom, you couldn't possibly..."
"understand or help. I don't mean to hurt your feelings so just, please?"
I am here if you need me.
You know that.
- That is good to know about.
- Yeah.
My uncle choked on a chicken bone.
"That's when the change happened, J ust like that,"
"Somewhere ln those few seconds, I knew my life would never be the same,"
- Did he survive?
- Yeah.
"I knew then that the rumor was right, Not ln actuality, but ln my heart,"
"Because at that moment I would have done anything, I wanted him so much,"
"Look, I didn't say anything about, you know."
- l know.
- l just wanted you to know that.
Thank you.
Because I'm not like that.
I don't do that.
No.
hey hate dancing  with a passion and it goes to a whole sort of different level.
Can we just put that in?
Some point in the--
That's the dinosaur.
It's a bird pecking the sea.
"No, the bird, you dance out here, and the dinosaur's this."
I Iove how we basically take the piss out of dance moves.
And the winner:
Zayn MaIik.
"Okay, from the top."
When you go on tour the outfit you've got's the outfit you're stuck with so I'm gonna be wearing these clothes for a good eight months now.
Is this working?
Can you get in?
I feel weird wearing a trench coat.
It's the Harry styles look.
It looks good.
You look like one of those adverts.
You do though.
"here's been times when they've dressed us all in the same clothes and we're like, "" No, we can't do that."""
This is the:
""" I'm gonna rob your nan"" look."
"This T is bad, though."
I Iike this T-shirt.
-Is it not happening?
-They're a bit tight.
I just wanna see for the look.
"Oh, my God."
e have to be our own people.
I don't think this band would've worked if we wasn't because as soon as someone tries to tell us  what to do....
"Now do a normal one, please, honey."
It's like having five rowdy boys in a class at school.
Honey please.
They're sending someone to take care of the whole thing.
"Jeez, earl."
You really are crazy.
Who in the hell would the government send?
"Kent MansIey, unexplained Phenomena."
-Marv Loach.
I--
-What happened?
Not sure.
"Sometimes the line'II snap if the weather is bad, sure."
But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that... .
It's got me beat.
It's almost like it was bitten off by some enormous beast.
Enormous beast.
What do you think?
Escaped gorilla?
What department is that again?
I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of my agency...
... andallthatthatimplies.
You mean national security?
Let's put it this way.
"Once in a while, things happen..."
... thatcan'tbe rationalized in a conventional way.
people wanna know the government has a response.
I am that response.
So were there any witnesses?
"well, sir, if you'II just follow me."
We did find this.
"United States Government, huh?"
Guess that means something big's happening here.
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
Yeah?
"For years, I've been cheating on you."
"Well, I cheated on you with more than one guy!"
With two...
You had a three-way with two dudes?
"No, no!"
But I would have!
I totally would have!
"Well, I would've, too!"
Not with two dudes!
You know what I'm talking about!
"I thought I needed to know what it was like out there, in a real way, not like I read it in Cosmo."
So I went out there and I lived it.
I've had one-night stands!
Okay.
I've woken up in beds with men whose names I didn't even remember!
"I was like, ""'How did I get this T-shirt on?"
",'"
"Jennifer, I get it."
Land your plane.
Just deal with it!
You deal with it.
You deal...
You deal with going to Applebee's alone.
What?
"If you don't put in effort, you're gonna be the one who ends up at Applebee's alone."
Are you asking me to go to Applebee's with you?
The bottom line is that none of them made me feel the love that you did.
And I had to go out into the world in order for me to come back and say that I belong home.
Now I'm gonna keep on spinning these fly tunes until somebody gets something going on!
I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you!
"Well, I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you!"
"When they found you, what the hell did they do?"
My mom shook me like a Polaroid picture.
That's what the hell she did.
"She be like, ""Don't you ever run away from me again."""
I will kill you!
"As long as you stay Black--"""
"I'm like, ""When am I gonna change?"
"What-- What am I--""."
"""As long as you stay Black, don't you ever run away from me again."""
"And then I'd cry so hard,"
I could only get one letter out.
"I be, ""Uh--Uh--Uh--""."
"Eeeeh!"""
You ever seen a little kid get disciplined?
"He be crying, he be, ""Eeeh!"""
"And it's sprinkler cry, ""Tsh-tsh-tsh--eeeeh!"""
"I'm saying, you ain't gotta whip 'em."
You change your personality.
Go Bernie Mac on 'em one damn time and see how they feel.
Just let 'em talk back to you.
"""Shut up, Mom!"""
"""What the fuck did you just say?"
"""And let me tell you something."
"You better sit there and shut what they call the fuck up."""
"""And I'm gonna tell you something."
"""You come over here again, gonna be trouble, trouble."
"""Bust a move!"
Bust a motherfucking move!
"Son of a bitch!"""
"Y'all know the man's eyes was crossed, come on now."
"It's about an authoritative tone, man."
I'm tired of going to the malls and seeing situations with a little kid just running amok.
Not anymore.
What do you mean?
"- Well, neither of us has a husband now."
- Wh-What did you say?
"Well, Danny, about ten minutes before I left to come down here, my husband called, and he wants a divorce."
"Aw, come..."
Come on.
You don't have to worry about that.
"I mean, that's just talk."
It's not gonna happen.
[Louise] You're right.
"It's not going to happen, without one hell of a fight."
"Why isn't it gonna happen, Danny?"
"- Hey, come on."
We're talking.
"- Eh, what am I supposed to do, dig a hole?"
[Laughs] He got you there.
"They said that I should talk, you know, to give an expression to myself."
"Okay, maybe I'm a little bit pushy."
But I can't keep talking if he's gonna keep shutting' me up!
"Doctor, l-I don't even want this guy in here."
"I mean, after all, we had the perfect family without him."
"""We had a family."" Tell me about it."
No.
The family and the group are the same.
"Now, when I lost my son three months ago, these people were wonderful."
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that, Mr. Seymour."
"We've already been through that, Mr. Theodopilus."
Don't take us backwards.
"Besides, it's... it's all right about your family now, isn't it?"
"No, it's not all right!"
It'll never be all right.
"The catatrophe could only be avoided using the mathematical system of Adam Bernau, a 20th century scientist."
Academician Filip is entrusted with the leadership of Expedition Adam 84.
"The technology of the age is so advanced, even travel into the past is possible."
"The members of the expedition are getting to know the century of two world wars, natural catastrophes, and social inequalities, and unexpectedly start to oppose Filip."
They consider their trip to 1984 too dangerous.

THE VISITORS ARRIVE
"Yes, because they wanted to fly."
And not because the computer liked them.
Hallo!
Where are you?
Good morning!
Morning exercise!
- What a hairstyle!
- Come on!
Can we start now?
He looks terrible.
Who's going to tell him?
Will you?
No turning back now.
- Is the fire prepared?
- No.
It should be burning by now!
This man's blind.
He seems not to notice that we don't care about his Expedition.
A piece of crap!
He's gone crazy!
He'll burn down the house!
Filip!
Where are you?
Filip!
He isn't upstairs!
He gave to the cops?
He would not!
"He was on their side, get it?"
Why would he do that?
Ask your sister.
-Relax.
Nobody knows anything.
What happened with Siri?
Nothing.
-They Paid for the funeral.
I think they're angry now.
The club has a code of honor when it comes to girls.
"If Siri does not know anything, she's safe."
The police would take Christer Johansson's death at some point?
-I Do not know.
-You Can tell us about the circumstances?
The police would not comment on the report in VG today.
We comment on the technical findings?
No.
-You Can come here after?
-Of Course.
With thousand of these newspapers he will buy a new iPhone.
Good morning to everyone!
"It will be a tough day, but we will do better."
The moderation of the OS is not something to which we are accustomed.
But there is something interesting in the Oslo police files.
"A car seized a girl who can be Zana, highway E6 in Mastemyr."
"Get nothing else from her, and she looked troubled, then they took her to the psychiatric hospital."
She's there?
"-negative, She ran away."
"They warned the police, but no one found it."
Find out if it was Zana.
"I thought I had lost him, but maybe Malvado can sense me getting closer."
"Wait, he can sense you?"
"He's a Lord, Richard."
He made me.
"So he can get inside your head, like you do to me?"
Worse.
"Well, can he sense other culebras?"
- Can he sense me?
- I don't know.
"I thought I knew what Malvado could do, but I guess I'm not so sure."
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to find out."
[Malvado] Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"After all these years, only la diosa could come between you."
- [speaks Spanish]
- I don't speak Spanish.
"She's the sweetest kind of poison, the kind you crave."
She's the reason that my uncle is dead.
"True, and yet you, me,"
"Carlos, Richard, we're all fools for her."
No.
"I may be a selfish, backstabbing piece of shit, but I don't dig on your snake princess."
"I do, however, recognize her value."
I want ten million cash and a guarantee that you and your culebra cronies will never bother me or my girl ever again.
How do I know you even have her?
Figured you'd ask. [Whistles]
Give it to me.
[inhales deeply]
Your brother must be furious.
"Oh, I wouldn't worry about him."
He's just whipped.
Don't I know you somehow?
Trevor Nigel.
And you must be Richard Castle.
- Yes.
- We've only ever talked on the phone.
Yeah.
Nice to finally put a face to all those notes.
Thank you so much for seeing us without an appointment.
Are you kidding me?
This is fate.
"I'm serious, Rick."
Your name literally just came up in our last story-development meeting.
It did?
"Now, look, I know this studio did a poor job producing Heatwave, but believe me, I fought for your vision."
"And now that I am running the studio, it is time to get back in the Richard Castle business."
"Oh, uh, well, thank you."
I'm flattered.
[Cellphone chiming] But we're not actually here about my books.
We're actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.
"Yes, I heard about that."
It was shocking.
Phil was a great guy.
He saved my ass a couple of years ago.
Got photos of my ex having an affair with our personal psychic.
- Oh.
- Saved me millions.
"[Chiming continues] So, Phillip's sister told us that you gave him permission to go undercover here at the studio."
Yes.
Phil said he was working a new case.
He asked for a favor.
"I owed him one, so I said okay."
Who was he investigating?
He wanted access to Austin Elektra.
I'm calling the diner for help.
Han...
"Caroline, we don't have a good connection, and not just because we're dueling Scorpios."
Peek-a-boo!
I see you!
Oleg.
"All right, now do it with Barbara."
"Han, we had all of our belongings thrown out of a private plane."
"Caroline, you're cutting out."
"All I heard was ""private plane."" Brag much?"
"No, we need to get to Texas, so can you please put $500 in my PayPal account?"
What?
You have $500?
Did I call you to gloat when I bought this snazzy new vest?
I'm putting you on speaker.
Private plane...
Have... credit card...
We lost her.
Or maybe her butler snatched her phone from her.
"Oh, God."
He hung up.
"Max, can we just go back to that terrible place we call home?"
That mountain lion is wearing my new blouse.
And here she comes!
Keep the tags on if you wanna return it.
I'm calling the credit card company to send us new cards.
They're used to hearing me cry.
"So is the unfortunate family that sat behind us at ""Zootopia."""
"If animals can all get along, so can we."
"Look, once we get our cards, we'll be on our way to Randy in Texas... and what was in this for me again?"
5 1/2 near-death experiences?
"Hi, Visa."
"My friend worked in Jamie's Italian in Dublin, and you're given a list of words that you're supposed to say."
Them's proper posh chips.
"But, uh, he was selling a pizza to someone, and you were told to say, ""Do you want me to pimp that for you?"""
Ohh.
"And it was like an old lady who was like,"
"""Hire it out for sex work?"""
That is so Jamie.
"What do you think, do you like him, Ellie?"
I do quite like him.
"It's nice to have someone, cos I'm from Essex, someone else from Essex who isn't just famous for being, like,"
"""Oh, you're mugging me off!"" So that's quite nice."
"He's got a trade, and I like that about him."
I'm from Essex as well.
Are you?
"Yeah, if that helps at all."
You're really ruining the image.
There was literally like a gasp from the audience.
Whereabouts are you from?
Billericay.
Shut the front door!
"No, where are you from?"
Brentwood!
No!
"Oh, my God!"
That means we're going to have to fight.
"I was worried where that was going to go there, Richard."
"To be fair, the size of her, I reckon you could reach from there!"
DAVID:
"My, um..."
Wow!
There's a good chance they're talking about fighting.
Maybe they're talking about fighting.
- And the goods are still in the safe?
- Oh yes!
"Don't fret, if anything goes wrong, we'll do the fire brigade!"
"Don't get any funny ideas, you leach!"
"""Story by:"""
"See, you bunch of jerks?"
"Oh, shit!"
Tell me again how you pull these things off?
"I've put the luggage in coach 15, compartment 21!"
"And for the first time in history, even the train from Hungary is on time!"
"If I had wheels, I'd always be on time."
Hey cornflake!
Do you breathe at night?
"In Budapest, we hoped that everything was better here - even sleep."
Is that why you're wearing your best pajamas?
These are all I have.
I'm not rich.
"But, my mother was French."
Is French all you speak?
"He speaks lingo with his mouth, Yugoslav with his hands,"
"Japanese with his feet, Arabic with the ladies, and French with his..."
Fuck!
Drop it!
Drop what?
"It means, crawl off, like when you stamp on something creepy with your clog."
You dig clogs?
of course!
"Clogs, dig..."
Me... my father died a year back.
"My mother three months later, because she loved him."
We need foreign invitations to leave Hungary.
"The daughter of the sister of my mother who is a movie star - do you say ""star""?"
I mean about your being so wonderful and still single and everything.
Who knows what he meant.
"Well, what's so funny?"
"Lottie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, and at your age."
My age.
His age.
Same age.
"Give a little, take a little."
[Blanche laughing]
"Besides, who'd have him even if he asked me?"
That I'd like to see.
"Well, don't kill yourself laughing, Blanche."
"I may be a size 14, but I could get to be a size 10 for him."
"For a man like that, I could even get to be beautiful."
"For a man like that, a woman would do anything."
Just anything.
"Lottie, you didn't...."
Didn't what?
You didn't kill her?
What?
"Have some more cake, Mom."
"No, not for me."
I'm gonna start cutting down.
"You know, Janie, you wouldn't believe it."
"But when your father and me was married, I weighed only 98 pounds."
"He used to call me ""Peanut."""
Used to brag about my figure to everybody.
"In a nice way, of course."
Funny how a woman lets herself go when there's no man around.
"Well, those afternoon teas that you and Mrs. Armstedder indulge in... don't help either, Mom."
"You know, Janie, sometimes I think Blanche Armstedder isn't all there."
Only sometimes?
It's in every paper.
"Your name, your picture, everything."
"Gee, makes a person afraid to go out on a job."
"You know, I was supposed to sit for the Thompsons tonight."
But now....
I bet you never wanna baby-sit again.
"Well, you'd always be imagining a killer was sneaking around or something."
"Come on, Lottie, I bet you're just dying to tell me all about it."
"Move over, will you?"
"Well, if that's your attitude."
[slurping]
It's cherry chocolate with tutti-frutti.
[groaning]
There.
"Come on now, tell me."
What was she really like?
"It's a long, long story, Blanche."
"Well, don't worry."
I've got refills.
"Well, go on."
"You know, how I've often said... that sometimes a pretty face will do you more harm than good."
"Well, that Clara Nash was doomed to a violent end."
"Way she was carrying on, she deserved what she got."
"Shame on you, Lottie."
Go on.
You know how particular I am about who I sit for.
"Well, I never would've sat for her."
Except I had a soft spot in my heart for the boy.
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
What a gentleman he was.
"And the way she treated him, he deserved something better."
Did you see the flowers the women's club sent?
"And you said it yourself,"
"""If you can be one thing, be efficient."""
"Do's it once, do's it rights."
Figures it out.
"Pitter-patter, let's get at 'er, figure it out."
You shouldn't gang up on people on their birthdays.
We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family.
She's comin' this afternoon.
Don't be in your barnin' clothes.
(SPOON SCRAPING)
"I fuckin' hate praccy, bro."
"It's Senior-A whale shit, bro."
Why even praccy?
"Like, I'm just gonna praccy like a donkey."
I could donk all day.
Just blast clappers at the hash marks at the fuckin' plug tendy of ours.
"Clappys from the hashys, buddy."
Just stepping' into one from the ladies' tees.
Just bulldoze that speed bump.
Just firing' ringers at his ears.
Just firing' warm-up ringers.
Just tossing' chest-high sauce at the boys.
Just tossing' ankle-high rocket sauce.
Just tossing' mad sui's up the middle.
Just tossing' mad sui's through the trolley tracks.
Just tossing' mad breakout sui's directly into the skates.
Just tossing' mad breakout sui's.
"You know, it might be a fun praccy after all."
"I could donk all day, boys."
(MUTTERING)
I don't think I've ever sat on a hay bale before.
"That's a straw bale, and that's barley."
"Yeah, that's right."
And the head of your family is Michael Corleone?
"Yeah, Counselor."
Michael Corleone.
Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone?
"No, I never talked to him."
"Mr. Cicci, could you amplify your answer a bit?"
-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?
"I'm particularly interested in knowing, was there always a buffer involved?"
Someone in between you and your superiors who gave the order.
"Right, a buffer."
The family had a lot of buffers!
"You may find this very amusing, but the members of this committee do not."
"Tell me something, Ma."
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?
He was being strong...
Strong for his family.
But by being strong for his family could he lose it?
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.
But you and your wife can always have another baby.
"No, I meant..."
lose his family
But you can never lose your family.
Times are changing.
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.
Take it as a gift.
"If there's something I can do for you, you come, we talk."
"Signora Colombo, why did you come to see me?"
For instance?
"You'll need a second in command for that special stunt, Sir."
"Young man, ""stunt"" is a word I do not like."
Not when applied to a military operation.
"Slip of the tongue, Sir."
The Chief Instructor said he put a word in.
He did.
"It's a word I wouldn't care to use, but we'll see."
"A falling object descends earthwards at the rate of 32 feet a second, accelerating to the maximum speed of 176 feet a second."
That's what I call descending.
"You'll be all right, Alf."
As long as you land on that big head of yours.
"Green light on, action stations, Number One, and er..."
Hold it!
"What, may I ask, are you doing up there?"
Practising.
"If you want to be polite to a regimental sergeant major, you address him as ""Sir""."
"Practising, Sir."
Get down from there before I take you to the guard room!
Two volunteers to put him on his bed.
You and you.
At the double!
"Ooh, my leg."
So you're what they're turning out as soldiers these days.
I wanted to see for myself.
Mm.
Mm-hm!
A horrible lot of little men.
Thank God we've still got a navy.
Let's take a look.
... I'll kick him in the...
"First balloon jump 0600 hours, tomorrow."
- Was I with anybody?
"- Uh, no."
Did I talk to anybody?
Did I tell you where I'd been or where I was going?
No.
"You, uh, just ate, and then you left."
"Uh, gave me your watch first."
Do you still have the watch?
Best wingman I ever had.
That does not look familiar.
And it's a knock-off.
But it's the freshest clue we have.
I'll buy it back from you.
Sure.
My brother was right.
Right about what?
The Phantom.
A serial killer Phillip was hunting.
He stumbled onto it working a missing-persons case.
We haven't heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.
That's why Phillip called him The Phantom...
Because no one has any idea that he exists.
"According to Phillip, The Phantom had been killing people in Los Angeles and New York for the last several years."
A bicoastal serial killer?
"Right before Phillip flew back to L.A., he told me that he'd had a break in the case, that he was close to identifying The Phantom."
He must have gotten too close to the truth.
I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom's alleged victims.
Total of seven...
"Four in L.A., three in New York."
All seven were killed with a knife.
Any pattern besides the knife?
No.
"Please sit down, Mr..."
Dinamo
"Please, sit"
Thanks.
Smoke?
Very kind of you.
Do you understand the incovenience we have had with the police inquiry?
We are not used to that line of inquiry.
"But I will be delighted to cooperate, with what little I know."
"Hopefully, it will be of use to punish the perpetrator."
"Ms. Bristol, I would like to know about you."
I will spare you from a long line of questioning
Laura?
Give him what I dictaded persuant to the case.
Here you have all I know about the unlucky girl.
"When she was hired, how we met her, etc."
And...
"I will ask for you to bother me no longer, Mr..."
What did you say your name was?
"Forget it, it is not important."
Show him out.
Thanks.
"I need a secretary just like you, when you wish to resign, know that I await you with open arms, eh."
"I would like to have you as a boss, but I am quite pleased with my current job."
"Good bye, Mr. Dinamo."
I do not like that guy.
"Easy, Pascual, easy."
I am tired of this lack of activity!
"C3, go ahead."

"does this mean ""no""?"
'cause i love you.
"- oh, wayne, you only love me because we live in this crap town."
"but when you get to where you're going, you're gonna find somebody that you deserve to be with."
you don't deserve to be in a trailer park.
you're gonna do big things in this life -- important things.
- you really think so?
- i know so.
"okay, so i have one more gift for you, but you have to turn around."
- hey!
"- well, now you're all ready for college!"
"come here, wayne."
merry christmas.
- oh. excuse me.
"excuse me, miss?"
[chuckles] yeah.
i-is the salon open?
- c-c-can you see that we're in the middle of something?
"- cind, you might want to... ma'am, i apologize for her."
she can be a tad on the abrasive side sometimes.
but her heart's in the right place.
- look at you using all these big college words already.
- i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to intrude.
"i just wanted to know if the salon was open, 'cause i wanted, you know, a redo or a rebirth."
"- you know, i've heard all the stor-  hey, listen, i really don't need to hear your life story, okay?"
"can you come back in an hour, and i'll fix that mess?"
- okay. an hour.

- you should be nice.
[sighs] merry christmas.
"To dig the earth, Kolya!"
"Come on, help me."
"What's up, Nikolai?"
-ls it here?
-Where?
Next to the dig-out.
He used to be a scout.
"The place is dry here, it looks like a hillock."
-Whom did you bury?
- My dad.
"Well, come on."
"Are you surprised, mayor?"
It means that everything except for the comm point and a fewfiring slots is a mock-up made ofwood.
-A mock-up frontline.
- Exactly.
What about mortars?
Are they made ofwood too?
"No, the mortars, machine-gun slots and cannons are genuine."
"Ifwe considerthe terrain and the water spaces here and there, the firepower is enough... to extinguish a batallion,"
"But not enough to stop the entire offensive, do you mean that?"
What's wrong again?
What are you worried about this time?
There is no such thing as a mock-up frontline.
Ifwe see wood here...
-There must be some metal as well.
- lt is the same thing all over again!
"If ""ifs"" and ""whens"" were pots and pens..."
The offensive here has been confirmed bythe HQ ofthe front and we can not cancel it.
But we'll burythe whole regiment here!
-Do not teach me lessons here!
- l do not.
I've gone through all that before!
Remember Dan Aykroyd in Ghost Busters with that cigarette?
- He does that scene.
- It's hanging vertically.
"I know exactly what you're talking about, when he finds Slimer."
- How'd he get that cigarette to hang?
- It's incredible.
I'm glad that my life's insecurities of thinking people are mad at me got put to good use in this movie.
"- Yeah, it was such a good choice."
"- Oh, Ari."
I've been thinking that a lot lately.
"The phone rings and, ""Hey, we need to talk about something."""
"I always have the impulse now of saying, ""Are you mad at me?"""
"If I had a dime for every time I say that in life, I'd be a rich woman."
You haven't said that to me.
"You've only been like, ""Do you love me?"""
"""Do you still love me?"""
The answer is always yes.
"That's a pretty good one too, right there."
"Oh, my gosh."
- That's hideous.
- We were laughing filming this.
Right?
For some reason?
- We were giggling.
- Why were we laughing?
"Oh, it was when we were doing that shouting thing, which I can't say..."
I can't say because it's a bad word.
Remember the high-pitched shout?
"Oh, yeah."
"Wait, I thought that was in the van."
I think this is where it became invented.
Unfortunately.
"Yep, today is your lucky day."
Awesome !
"I mean, wait, what do you mean ?"
"Well, first, we have to get rid of that dorky bow tie."
"Yeah, and an apron is friend to no man."
Surely we can do something with this hair.
"I think I have some nail scissors in my purse, hmm ?"
I can't get anyone on the phone.
"Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh, I'll walk you through it."
Just open up the back door.
"It's easy, don't worry about it."
"Ryan, you're asking me to use tools and exert myself physically."
I think we both know where this is going.
"Yeah, okay, well, uh, start by putting the jack under the frame by the, uh, by the door there."
Yeah.
"The jack is this thing with the handle, right ?"
Yeah.
"Actually, wait."
"First, um... loosen the bolts with that wrench."
All right.
There we go.
Okay.
"All right, you may find this hard to believe, Ryan, but when I was younger, I used to be a bit of a worrier."
You don't say.
"To distract myself from worrying,"
I would sometimes make lists.
Didn't matter what the lists were.
They could be anything...
every cereal
"I've ever eaten, or... uh, the names of every planet mentioned in Star Wars."
Whatever.Anyways...
"You want to make a list, Seth ?"
Knocking.
Where's Olive?
Olive Snook was where Lily had taken her.
It was a place that valued Olive's silence as much as Lily did.
"Hello, Betty."
A little bee tells me you've met Kitty Pimms.
Briefly.
"Well, this morning Kitty says to me, she says, ""I wanna speak to Betty Bee."
"Bee-Girl to Bee-Girl, tell her how much she means."""
Bless.
"If there's a lull in the conversation, you just ask Kitty why she loves bees."
Oh?
Oh.
- You'll be glad you did.
- Thank you.
"Betty, I know Kentucky was your number one Bee-Girl and I wanna live up to her standard of honey harvesting and sales excellence."
"You're not really going to stand there and kiss my ass, are you?"
Or didn't Woolsey tell you?
He didn't.
How politic.
- Tell me what?
- His acquisition was a hostile takeover.
"- No, he didn't mention the hostile part."
"- Oh, yes."
The ass you were just kissing is now just the ass of a retired honey mascot.
That's my new title:
Honey mascot/consultant.
Used to be founder and president.
That would make me stinging mad.
"I get to keep my old office, just not my dignity."
"When all of your bees die, it's hard to care about any of it."

NEIL:
"Based on this, you think Mikey has an emotional problem?"
All we're suggesting is that maybe Mikey should see a child psychologist.
Christ!
I made a picture like this when I was kid!
I know.
But we feel that Mikey may be-- just may be-- suffering from an emotional disorder called unattached syndrome.
It's very common in adopted children.
Don't you know anything about his history?
I know Mikey.
"If anything, he's brighter than other kids."
"It's not a question of whether he's bright or not, Rachel."
Most kids don't mutilate their own arms with thumbtacks.
He did what?
I'm late.
My husband and child are expecting me.
I'm sorry.
Nobody is expecting me.
"- Goodbye, Pavlos."
"- Goodbye, Aliki."
That was 'I love you!

"Hey, let me tell you, your wife Alice really outdid herself with this stuff."
This is just delicious.
Here.
"Try this, Ralph."
"- Hey, that's great."
-How about that?
Got a real different taste to it.

Anything Trixie ever fixes for me is right out of the can.
"Now, if this could come out of the can, that would be different."
This is terrific.

You just gave me a million-dollar idea.
All I have to do is put this stuff in cans.
"Ralph, you're sitting on a gold mine!"
You could make a million dollars!
I don't care if I make a million dollars.
This is the thing I've always wanted to do for Alice.
Why should she cook just for me?
And just have me enjoy it?
I could put it in cans and the whole world can enjoy her cooking.
I'm gonna make her rich and famous.
I'll run the whole business for her.
All she'll have to do is sit back and collect.
"Boy, oh, boy, that is a worthy sentiment."
I mean it.
"Now, all you got to do is get ahold of Alice and get the recipe."
Then we're off.
"Now, that's the last thing I have to do."
All I have to do is tell Alice that I got a scheme to make money and she'll say it's a crazy scheme.

"And what if he does something totally unforgivable, like rape?"
"Or, um..."
DJ'ing?
"Dads, you need to talk to your sons and say, don't DJ."
It starts in the home.
These are all really valid fears.
"Look, your kids, they are gonna grow up to be pieces of shit and they will hate you."
But here's the thing.
All of you are also pieces of shit.
You really are.
Bat!
Bat!
Everyone for themselves!

"- What's wrong, Amy?"
- Nothing.
"- Oh, okay."
"- No, I'll tell you."
I got stuck on another awkward date last night.
"It's, like, you know in two seconds if the guy is wrong for you, but you still have to sit there through the whole dinner."
You need to try the website I'm on.
It keeps dating super casual.
I already tried It's Just Lunch.
It was still awkward.
I'm off that.
I'm talking about It's Just a Quick What's Up.
- It's Just a Quick What's Up?
- Yeah.
"When a guy decides he wants to briefly meet you, he'll send you a no-presh, super cash ""slight nod""."
"Okay, gang, take off the mustaches."
"Now, what is it, Schulz?"
"Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva man is coming to inspect the camp and find out whether we are living up to the international convention."
I'm sure he will find that we are treating you very well.
"Now, you must not run around in your underwear."
And take off the wash.
The kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
"Ja, we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs."
The kommandant also sends you clean blankets.
He wants every man to have a new clean blanket.
"Yeah, yeah, we know."
We had them last year.
"Five minutes after the Geneva man was gone, the blankets were gone."
"Uh, the kommandant also told me to pick up the radio."
Radio?
"What radio, Schulz?"
"The one you are hiding in the barracks, don't you know?"
The one your friend mit out the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
"Schulz, you're off your nut."
- Give me the radio.
-No radio.
"All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself."
"Now, let's see."
Where could it be?
Maybe...
Maybe in the lieutenant's bunk?
"Oh, no, not in the lieutenant's bunk."
I'm cold here.
Maybe warmer on this side.
In the piccolo may--
"Oh, no, not in the piccolo."
Am I getting warmer?
A good night's sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier.
"Remarkable technology, is it not?"
Not you.

I made the first few for revenge but then
I started exploring new aspects of myself.
Can I have a sip?
Mmm.
"I have lived these past years, Henry."
"My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid."

I've got you Under my skin
I've got you deep In the heart of me
So deep in my heart That you're really A part of me
I've got you Under my skin
I 'd tried so Not to give in
"I said to myself ""This affair never Will go so well"""
"But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well"
I've got you under my skin?
(WARNING ALARM BEEPS)
What is all this?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
"Something's wrong with you, mate."
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gonna sit you down in this ohair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.

Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
M r.
"Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- H im hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
- Next week.
- That's what I thought.
- I thought you were on later.
- I heard what happened.
- I thought we might need help.
"- Actually, we only got the one."
Three went straight to the morgue.
- Sorry I didn't come by last night.
- It's okay.
Maggie and I played Scrabble.
I got a 75-point word.
- Really?
"- ""Cyanotic."" She challenged it."
...found brutally murdered early this morning inside of this establishment.
Doc Magoo's a diner frequented by staff and visitors of County General Hospital.
The crime was committed prior to opening as the staff was preparing for a day of serving the usual sandwiches and sodas.
What got served instead was a cold-blooded robbery-homicide in which four people were murdered execution-style.
- One of them's still alive.
- Police are trying to identify suspects.
- More on the story later.
- Any word on Eric?
I don't expect any.
It's like a bear hibernating.
He won't come out till spring.
"Hey, what do you say we go out tonight?"
Sushi.
Just you and me.
- Maggie can fend for herself.
- Told her I'd drive her to the bus station.
- She's leaving?
- Yep.
- Is that a good thing?
- No.
- Why not?
That's really none of your business.

"Just pull over here, Mr Anderson, and let's talk a little business."
What about instalments?
I could maybe find a deposit.
"No, these things are selling like hot cakes."
I don't really do credit.
"Look, you're a lawyer, right, like Mr Kingdom?"
"That's right, yes."
"My son David and his girlfriend are looking to buy their own place, and I was thinking I might like to help them, by lending them the money."
Very generous spirited of you.
"So, look, why don't you do me a nice quick loan agreement, watertight, and I will let you buy a Whizz."
"An agreement that David can't get out of, that ties him down."
"If you want the car, I'm the only one round here who can help you."
"So, you'll be wanting to say yes."
It's a deal!

(Sighs) I need a Wii.
What?
No-one's stopping you.
"No, a Nintendo Wii."

- Doing what?
- Tech support.
"""Too thick or old to work your PC?"

You have no idea.
Tony's dad is on that London flight.
Come on.
Figure it out.
Who's the target on the plane?
Who's the hit man?
Let's talk possible hit people first.
We have a Joseph McBride.
"He's 49, from Springfield, Virginia."
He's a lobbyist for a chemical company.
Next.
"Ruth Potts, 62, Fairfax, retired schoolteacher, who wouldn't hurt a fly, obviously."
Just look at that sweet lady.
Next.
Thanks.
"Boss, I got 'em."
Manifests for 17 different inbound flights arriving to Dulles tonight.
"Okay, divvy 'em up."
Deal me in as well.
We are looking for a target significant enough to warrant killing a federal air marshal.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the extended delay,"
TSA is now required to perform a second routine screening.
"We apologize for any inconvenience, but we'll begin with Calgary flight 3184."
"If those passengers could calmly line up over there, please?"
Thank you.
"TSA isn't saying anything about landing order, Gibbs."
"They're all low on fuel, so... it's first come, first serve."
"Stay alert, Bishop."
We're watching.
Okay.
"Lucy, you go first."
I want you to look at Joey and say hi.
"And Joey, after you've heard that,"
I want you to look back at Lucy and say hello in return.
"And then we'll just see where it goes from there, okay?"
Hi.
Hello.
"You kept saying ""open"" and ""fruitful"" and other weird stuff."
"That's not feeling, it's just more talking in short half-sentences, and you managed to turn feeling into a job or an activity, and it was exhausting."
So now it's my fault that you don't feel satisfied!
Everything is my fault?
Is that what you're saying?
I'm not saying that!
I'm crazy?
You don't look at me!
You don't ever ask me how I am!
I work!
You haven't looked at me in 10 years!
"I'm crazy and everything is my fault, and my family is awful, and nothing at all is your fault!"
"'Cause you rock, Joey!"
"If a guy talked to me like that, I'd punch him in the face."
You're such an asshole!
You're an asshole!
"It's like a little kid who gets a puppy for the first time, just hugs it so much, snaps its neck."
Cynthia's your puppy.
It's puppy-cradle death syndrome.
All that love is gonna snap that puppy.
"Yeah, but..."
You don't want that!
The dawning of a new day.
A marriage is not a timeless agreement.
It is one day.
"- Shut your mouth, Sergeant!"
"- Go find a medic, Jimmy."
"Bring morphine, I'll take the responsibility."
Him?
He's Italian!
"That's an American soldier there, Captain!"
"Now listen, Sergeant!"
That man is a Captain with more experience than either of us.
We're going to do what he says.
and follow his orders.
I'll take full responsibility!
"We have to distract him, to do something... so he doesn't realize he's dying."
There's only one thing we can do.
"Listen idiot, if you're wrong about this... if that doctor doesn't come..."
"I'll rip your guts out just like his, got that?"
Now hurry it up.
"Well now Prewitt, you're lucky."
You're going home...
Just wet his lips.
"You know, I always thought you were lucky..."
"Prewitt, but this was surprising."
The ambulance will be here in a few minutes.
A few days with pretty nurses bending over in front of you... and resting their tits on your shoulder... and then you're on a plane headed to the USA.
"Isn't that right, Kaminsky?"
"Keep talking, Sergeant."
Leave that idiot here.
He's stuck in this stinking country.
"-Não é, amigo?"
"-É, goma de mascar!"
- Guido!
- Yankee!
Fag.
- I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
- That's what they do with killers.
- I'll see you around.
"- Come on, let's go."
"When I grow up, I'd love to have a pair of shorts like that."
"- How's your wife, Eddie?"
- None of your fucking business.
How would you know...
"You're his partner, how's his wife?"
"Eddie's picking on me again, Uncle Nick."
One of these days it's just going to be you and me!
Workers discovered the nude body wrapped in a sheet.
She was identified as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.
"Miss Putnam, a stewardess, was abducted from her home,   then taken to another location, where she was murdered."
The brutal crime reminds many of the Polish Hillstranglings.
There's no connection other than the victim being a white female.
"The Polish Hill victims were strangled, not shot at close range."
- You picked the wrong house to rob.
- You got nothing worth stealing.
- It's been a long time.
- I could've killed you.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You did.
Give me a drink.
Why do you live on a houseboat?
You and your old man should've burned this place down.
- How was California?
- Sunny.
Sunny?
You're out there two years and that's all you can tell me?
"""The Simpsons"" are on an hour earlier."
Are you still mad at me?
You're home.
Did you see that there was an attempted robbery at the new mall?
I'm glad I cancelled jack's photos.
I just decided I wanted you to be there.
It's better if we do it as a family.
Is everything ok?
"Yeah,everything's perfect."
"Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to learn the most important lessons of life, one must each day surmount a fear."
When did you know you were gonna have to trick him?
The first time I talked to him.
You realized you couldn't break him?
"Well,I realized he was too smart to have had that nextel phone registered to him accidentally."
He drew us there.
He wanted our presence at gitmo to confirm that he was successful.
And that's when you started moving up the time of his prayers.
"If I'd used an actual clock, he might have caught on."
So it was all a chess game.

- Hello.
"When I was inside, nothing happened."
When I was out it was all there to read on the front page.
"Yes, I read all the papers."
- You certainly make a good-looking priest.
- Thanks.
"Your mother always wanted you to do it, but what finally decided you?"
"Well, I was riding along on the top of a bus looking down, passing the cathedral."
"- That gave you the idea, huh?"
"That's funny, I got an idea on the top of a bus once."
Got me six years.
I was around while you were singing with the kids and I kept thinking of you and me 20 years ago.
- With Father Boyle.
- Yeah.
"Remember slipping ""Merry Oldsmobile"" into the hymnbook?"
- How could I forget it?
- How'd it go?
"Lead, kindly light Amid the encircling gloom"
"Lead thou me on, for the night is dark And I am far from..."
- Did a lot of crazy things in those days.
- Certainly did.
Certainly did.
Come in.
"Father, you're supposed to be down at the store."
The fellas are waiting for you.
You run and tell them I'll be right over.
Tell them to get the game started.
"- Okay, Father!"
- All right.
What's this store racket?
Got the kids shilling for the parish?
"That's not a bad idea, Rocky."
No.
"- The 21st century, no smoking... in office buildings, go out on the street with the rest of the junkies."

He doesn't exactly seem like the kiddie-porn type.
"He's such a sweetie, gorgeous!"
I wished he was into sausages...
I think I'll never be graced by his sweet ass.
- You mean Paul's no gay?
"- Your ""gaydar"" is failing."
Paul is as straight as Mark Jacob's pleat.
- Interesting!
- Every fashion magazine... needs their token hetero male.
It's like reverse feminine action.
Fuck!
I gotta dash.
I'm off that Palm press.
I think Judaism beats Buddhism... in the next century.
I really do.
And I've got the jump-start.
- I'm taking kabala classes.
- I'm sure I've seen sketches of a...
- Moses collection come cross my desk.
"- Wait a minute, haven't you seen..."
- at Skirt magazine?
"- Please, darling!"
Are they finally eclipsing Vogue in fashion for advance?
Skirt will only race clean when it shows the bat about one ways.
It's true!
They totally missed the ball on those princess skirts.
That's because Roxanne Rochett is Coco.
Bored?
How do you get bored with that?
"For every beautiful woman, there's at least one guy out there..."
... who'stiredof pretendingtolisten to her in exchange for sex.
"Well, let me go on record as saying, I am not that guy."
"If I ever had a woman like that, I would cherish her."
I would worship her. I would...
... starta smallcountryand put her  face on a stamp so I could lick her head.
-Why don't you go talk to her.
"-Yeah, right."
Gorgeous women like that are not interested in pasty guys like me...
... unlesswe'rein line for the British throne.
-So you give up without even trying?
-Yep.
That's my motto.
Why waste time on 1 0s when you're already getting rejected by sixes?
"Alan, listen to me."
"You are a smart, sensitive, good-looking man..."

That's the other thing.
Look at me. I'm a mess.
So?
"Women like Sherri have big, hunky guys hitting on them all day long."
"A guy like you walks up, makes a move, you know what that says to her?"
Trick or treat?
"It says, ""l'm confident in who I am. """
-You think?
-l know.
"So, what if she's not interested."
What's the worst that could happen?
"Actually, the worst that could happen is she points at me..."
- merry christmas.
"- and merry christmas, kids!"
"now, you guys... i know i don't say this enough, but i love you more than anything in this entire world."
and that's why i named you after some of my favorite things -- cheez doodles.
[baby coos] skoal.
brandie.
- but you didn't name me.
"- i know, but i still like brandie."
and i love you like you're one of my own.
"'cause family is very important, okay?"
family is all we really got.
"and, harley, my angel."
you know i've always loved you the most.
i'm just kidding.
i love all you guys.
but i love you.
and this is for you.
"- thank you, mama."
- you're welcome.
"- * noel, noel"
- it's just a little something.
"- i love it, mama."
"- oh, don't go bs'ing me, boy."
"it's, uh -- it's supposed to be like when you -- [sighs] when you don't have something, but it's like -- it's like it means something, but it's... help me."
you know what i'm saying?
- a symbol?
- yes!
a symbol!
dang!
wayne must have been teaching you while i was out doing... doing my thing.
"so, that is supposed to remind you of where you've come from, but not where you're going, okay?"
and that's probably me in there with my feet up on the recliner after a hard day at girl curl -- just lazy.
Fucking Randy?
Didn't you say he was as funny as a dick pimple?
Randy open mic'd for three years before he got down here.
"You know, he didn't leapfrog 'cause he built some fucking shelves."
That deserves some respect.
You dig?
Yeah.
"Whatever, nigga."
You don't ever get to call me that.
"And if you roll your motherfucking eyes at me again, your head is gon' be rolling after it."
You understand that?
[Al] That's my time.
"Clap for me, please."
Mind the fucking light.
[cheers and applause] [laughter]
I know what you're thinking.
I look like Danny Partridge if his mom kicked him out of the band.
"Wonder if there were some family members that didn't pass the audition, you know?"
"Like, behind the long bus there's a little short bus."
"Poor kid, Patrick Partridge, sitting back there wondering,"
"""Why can't I shake the tambourine or hit the triangle or something?"""
I hear you're having dinner with Roy Brenner.
Yeah.
Somebody was harping in his ear.
Eh.
[laughs]
Thought I'd use the guy's pain.
Little inside information on Brenner.
He doesn't like hard to get.
So do me a favor and quit acting like you're doing him a favor.
You want this.
"You want it more than anyone, so woo him."
Where were you?
The dining room's over there.
Hello?
Hello?
- What's wrong?
Can't you say a word?
- Sure.
Hello.
- Where are we going?
- Anyplace out of town where we can eat.
- Not to speak of why.
- You're an inquisitive gal.
"There's a place at Flamingo Beach, but it's f ar. I have to be back at 3."
Stand him up.
You're with me until after dark.
"- lt isn't a man, it's my hairdresser."
- That makes it rugged.
- My hair's a mess after last night.
- Then let it down.
Maybe I'll let mine down too.
I can't understand why Martinelli spiked our drinks.
- He thinks you're with that gangster?
- He knows I'm not one of the mob just a guy who sat in on a stud game once in a while.
"- Well, then I don't see why--"
- Women ask too many questions.
- They should just be beautif ul.
- And let the men do the worrying.
"Women ought to come capsule-size, about f our inches high."
"When a man goes out, he puts her in his pocket."
"That way, he knows where she is."
"He gets to his restaurant, he puts her on the table then swaps a few lies with his pals without danger of interruption."
When it comes that time in the evening when he wants her f ull-sized he just waves his hand and there she is.
I got rights.
- I could do something about this shit.
"- Boy, please."
"The only rights that are important are a woman's right to choose, and I choose a life without you."
"Come on, Amber, that's cold, now."
- You wanna know what's cold?
- What?
- The truth.
"- Well, what's the truth?"
( scoffs ) Truth is you old as dirt for a wide receiver.
"I mean, maybe you have a couple of seasons left at best, but after that, who are you, hmm?"
"Just some lonely-ass, busted ex-football player with a couple of bucks."
"- Well, you wanna know the truth I see?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what truth you see?"
Tell me.
Hmm?
- I ain't even gonna say it.
"- Yeah, 'cause you're chicken shit."
"Look, 'cause I'm a gentleman, that's why."
'Cause you have nothing on me other than I was stupid enough to sleep with your sorry ass.
"You really going for it today, huh?"
Well done.
"I'm just keeping it real, Rick, just like you taught me."
"So, if you don't mind, I have some packing to do."
"Oh, you know what?"
Can you put this on the truck for me on your way out?
Thank you.
Uh...
"Hey, I'm gonna have the tuna tartare, and can you have 'em throw a fried egg on it?"
"Okay, fuck me, huh?"
Two hours late for the biggest meeting of our lives.
I know I never told you often enough.
You were the best goddamn center fielder in high school.
"And on ice, heh heh, tough as nails."
Not to mention the way you fight fire.
You put every other fireman I ever knew to absolute goddamn shame.
I should have said this shit when I was alive.
"But hell, I'm saying it now."
You are the best goddamn son a father could ever hope for.
You happy now?
- Yeah.
"- Well, get over it."
"Because if you believe all that, I got some land down in florida I might want to sell you."
Now give me a goddamn drink.
"Middletons, not that bottom shelf shit."
He was a pretty good center fielder.
"No bat, hell of a glove."
I'll take the bottom shelf shit.
- Jameson'S.
- What is that with you?
"Budweiser, jameson's, always the low-rent shit."
"Hey, you know what, I like the way it tastes."
I could give a shit about what people think.
He's a great fireman.
No bustin' balls.
He's too risky.
Gets the job done.
"You know how many people would be dead but for him breaking rules, taking chances?"
Lot of kids would be on this side of the bar.
"Most guys, they play it safe."
"Him, he pushes the envelope."
"Like, um, what's his name?"
Who's that quarterback?
Put her on the God damned damn phone right now!
She's not here.
What!
?
"Look, I might as well tell you, she's with Alex now."
Alex?
"She's with him tonight, he and Claire split-up."
I'm sure you know how much she's always cared for him.
"So, like I said, I see no point in your pursuing this any further."
I'm so sorry to have keep you waiting.
"So, Mr. Jenkins, which one do you like best?"
"To be perfectly honest, I think you're more beautiful now."
Good answer.
Wai... wai... wai... wai...
"wait a minute, wait a minute."
What?
What?
What's the matter?
"What did you mean by, ""You must have loved me all along but just didn't know it.""?"
I don't...
"Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait..."
"figure it out, 'cause I'd like an answer."
"Well, I don't know, Rose, I mean, you were different then, you weren't the same as you are now."
"So, how could you have LOVED me then?"
"Well, I loved you because of who you were, not because I wanted who you are."
So now you want who I am because I'm not who I was anymore?
Okay...
"Rose, what?"
Where are you going?
"You know something, I have dreamt about this moment from the first day we met."
"I've played it out a million times in my mind... how you'd look, what you'd say, what you'd think."
- And guess what?
Yeah.
Clearly one of them was used to commit all seven murders.
There were eight.
W-What are you talking about?
I discovered a fourth New York victim...
A man by the name of Pat Crews.
Are you sure?
Phillip Harris only knew about three.
There's a reason he missed this one.
Because this murder took place on the same day The Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.
But how can that be?
Unless...
"There are two serial killers, one on each coast."
[Knock on door]
- [Groans] Who is that?
- Castle:
I don't know.
"Whoever it is, I hope they brought coffee."
Detective Menendez.
- You know...
- Please come in.
"I expect to be screwed over by an asshat that I don't know, but not from one who's supposed to be my friend."
I take it that you heard about what happened at Austin Elektra's house last night.
You said you'd keep me in the loop.
"Look, we can explain."
"Uh, Austin had a prop knife that matched the murder weapon."
And our lab tested it this morning...
it's clean.
Did you manage to track down the other four knives used in the movie?
Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse.
"They came up clean, too."
And according to the prop master...
MONTENEGRO:
"Not enough to escape, but enough to give him some range of movement."
"If he pushed himself back onto the table, he could raise his upper torso, which made it possible for him to generate a whiplike motion."
And sever his spinal cord.
I don't know.
The man was once a priest.
And suicide is a cardinal sin.
It wasn't a suicide.
"Booth, the facts clearly indicate that it was."
"A sacrifice, it was a sacrifice."
"""Sacrifice""?"
He was trying to protect someone.

"I haven't been that available, either. (chuckles)"
"No, I'm talking mentally present."

"Oh, yeah, it's-- it's about your father."
"No, I-I understand."
You must be worried about what happens when they find him.
I am.
It's not as cut and dry as I thought it was gonna be.
"Well, I'm glad you're seeing that now."
"(exhales forcefully) Look, there's something else that I've been thinking about."
I want you to know that...
"I'm quitting you and this, and, you know, all of this."
"Olive, you don't have to quit."
Calm down.
You want a drink?
"Lily, hand me your purse."
I'm not thirsty.
"I'm tendering my resignation and resigning my tenders to the cold, harsh reality of what's not meant to be."
But you can't just leave.
"Vivian, go wait outside."
- But...
- Haven't you caused enough trouble?
This is your home.
Where will you go?
I know a place.
Aunt Vivian used to always say there's nothing sadder than an empty birdcage.
Is Olive ever gonna come home?
She didn't say.
"She said her apartment was paid to the end of the year, and she asked me to water her plants."
I feel like I broke her.
I enlisted her to spy on my aunts and then turned her into a homeopathic drug mule.
What homeopathic drugs was she muling?
I baked antidepressants into pies to get them out of the house.
"It's something I've always wanted to do, but never had the chance."
I guess it worked.
I got them out of the house.
Olive got them out of the house.
They got out of the house.
"I mean, Vivian took the bus."
She never takes the bus.
She thinks it's too intimate.
I wish there was a way I could thank Olive.
You know today's my first day at Betty's Bees?
This is where I sleep.
I didn't get a chance to make the bed today.
Where do I sleep?
"Nixon was probably in office when this was made, but there's a brand-new mattress in there."
Most of your clothes should fit here.
Put the rest in the hall closet.
"I know it's a little bit out in the open, but..."
I didn't get a chance to finish your room here.
"Yeah, I'll fix that."
It's a work in progress.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
A few minor adjustments.
"Well, I guess I'll let you get unpacked."
You don't have to come in with me.
I'm your father.
I'm supposed to.
You don't know where to go.
It's okay.
"I mean, I have done this before - gone to school."
"All right, well, this is the name they gave me."
"Mrs Gwynn, main office."
I'll be back to pick you up at 3:30.
"Okay, sure, whatever."
"My door is always open and, contrary to hall rumour, you can talk to me."
"So, do you have any questions or concerns?"
"No questions, no answers."
All right.
This is Mr Campbell's class and he's expecting you.
"Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" represents a complete turning point in American history and literature."

That they took what looks like the most boring words in the English language and made them into a sentence?
"Well, I've always been fascinated by this stuff."
It's just the beast took up most of my brain.
Now you're free to really get your nerd on?
Exactly.
I wasted all that time on the beast when I could have been charting the development of metallurgy during the 19th century.
Is Shannon Kelly here?
Kyle Weathers.
I've come a long way to find you.
Thanks.
This is Tom.
Tom.
Good to meet you.
Hi.
"We're short on daylight, so I'll come straight to the point."
The beast is in my sights and you're the girl to help me find it.
- Excuse me?
- I've been monitoring your blog for the last six months.
Your findings are pretty compelling.
Why didn't you leave any comments?
Open up myself to replies from fools with no brains and even less imagination?
I know exactly what you mean.
Right.
I'm searching the woods tonight and I need an expert.
- What do you say?
- She's into metalgy...
"Metal...metallurgy now, you see."
Old news.
Tell me more.
Don't worry.
No-one can get in.
And we're not getting out.
Alright.
Can't go no further.
"Passengers for Blue-3, you're on foot from here."
OK.
Hm...hm.
"This way, Miss."
A million bullets by morning!

No wonder the audience booed or snored.
We learnt our mistake.
That would have shorted their eyesight not the picture.
Authenticity.
"That's what they are after, you know."
Authenticity informed by optimism.
You think I don't understand to give an audience optimism?
I've three grandsons in the forces.
Your company reputation is founded primarily on comedy.
Highest grossing British picture of the year was a comedy.
Mine.
"And Mr.Buckley here, wrote it."
"Yes, and very entertaining was too, but... if we were to capture public imagination and their trust, we need more than...fat policeman toppling off ladders."
We need a story to inspire a nation.
"Give me all in brief, Mr.Swain. This year, I'll bring you a picture to win the war."
You have your briefings today later...authenticity and optimism.

Right.
I'll look for a story.
So sorry.
Monstrous of us to have kept you waiting.
"Welcome to the Ministry of Information, Film Division"
Roger Swain.
"Look, you guys need a division title and my man will deliver like Amazon, all right?"
"He's got breakaway speed, durability out the ass."
He will finally put your offense over the top.
I think you might be right.
- Can I see him work out?
- Absolutely.
"I'm gonna coordinate that with you, Charles."
"- Thank you, Larry."
- Larry:
Don't mention it.
"Sorry, babe, we gotta stick a pin in brunch."
Fuck me and not feed me?
Fuck you.
We'll eat quick.
"Come on, I want stone crabs."
I don't get it.
Jason just said the same thing I did.
"He said it better, Charles."
Be grateful.
"You may not have got it the way you wanted it, but you got it nonetheless."
Now go coordinate.

"Hey, I'm seeing you at the stable in 30, right?"
"Yeah, listen, Wayne, I just have to push that back by a few, okay?"
"Hey, Reggie, put Vernon on the phone, please?"
- Wayne:
How few is a few?
- Just a few hours.
"Well, yeah, that's why I didn't tell 'em."
"Growing up, I.A. was worse than the bogeyman in my house."
Then why take the job?
Because I want to be a detective.
"When I passed the exam, they gave me a choice--"
I.A. or back to patrol-- I took I.A.
Double chili cheeseburger.
You want something?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
You hate the streets that much?
"No, it's just not my goal."
I did patrol because it was required.
Then just wait for another department to open up.
For how long?
I've already spent five years of my life on patrol.
Now I'm required to put in two more years on the job before I can even think about moving up to homicide.
Homicide?
That's your goal?
So that's how it is?
I.A.'s just another requirement.
"The minute your time's up with us, you're history?"
And I.A. was always your goal?
No.
But that's completely different.
I was pregnant with my first son.
I had to get off the street.
"I understand, but why are you so upset?"
Because I love this job.
"I may have joined I.A. because of the great hours, but I stay because I believe in what we do."
"Unlike you, I'm not just biding my time."
I am not biding my time.
You just missed out on the night of your life.
(PANTING) The night of your life.
I've been in love with her for five years.
I've been in love with her for 12 years.
I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half.
"Hey, maybe you can't dunk anymore, but you've achieved more in your 30 years than that 15-year-old dweeb could ever dream of."
You put yourself through Columbia Law School.
You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail.
And you married a smoking-hot chick who looks nothing like your mother.
I think that earns you an entire foot closer to dunking.
"There you go, Vanilla Thunder."
Step back.
(MARSHALL SCREAMING)
"Oh, baby."
"How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office, and you lie very still while I go bananas all over you?"
MARSHALL:
Could we maybe instead just do it right here?
"Sure, baby."
- She loves me!
- But I chose her!
Guys!
Guys!
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here.
"Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there, that window's gonna open up again in, like, 10 minutes."
"- Wait, where's Maggie?"
- She's gone.
- What?
- I sent her home.
You guys were like vultures fighting over her.
Let her be single for once.
- Jealous bitch!

What do you mean?

"The feds get him in his condition, who knows what he's liable to say."
"You go on trial, like me, you won't sleep at night."
All the more reason to clean him up.
"Still, he's...."
He's a major liability.
If it were anybody else....
It reminds me of people's feet.
I don't know if I can do that other thing.
"I will sit here, but I am not supposed to be anywhere near this woman."
Why?
I've taken out a restraining order on her because she will not leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
"It's phone calls, it's faxes, it's emails."
You have got to get it in your head it is never going to happen!
APPLAUSE
"If she promises not to bother you, will you join us?"
Don't touch me!
I won't.
"Now, I have to ask you..."
"Sarah, Sarah..."
Let's not involve the authorities.
You're winding me up.
Whoa!
The first thing I have to ask you is what's in your bag?
"Well, in the bag tonight, I've got all sorts of rubbish."
I've got...
I've got this which is me.
So you don't get recognised?
"I just bung it on people's faces like that, then I've got some idea of what it's like to talk to me."
LAUGHTER It's good fun.
"Now then, I know you through Vic and Bob."
Yes.
How are they?
I don't know.
I don't see them.
We do not socialise outside of the show because I have not forgiven them for tricking me into doing it in the first place.
How have you been celebrating Christmas?
What would be a typical Christmas for you?

APPLICATION AGAINST POLICE Västra Götaland
"for five years, I have worked the police in Västr a Götaland, -"
- See Annex 1 on signed and tasks performed by the code name Lisa.
Now I am uncovered and live on the run with a pr ice on my head.
"Hvisjeg was revealed, I thought, police management would help me."
Have you wondered why we live under a death threat?
Answer me!
Is it our fault?
He ar works for you!
It is your responsibility!
I thought I would get help but that did not happen.
"I have a closer look at the nemmelsen, that police management would see me dead."
Despite the police's own lawyer has exposed me to a lawyer.
- You must come with us to the station.
"- What is it, Dad?"
What we want to talk about is...
"They keep you pretty busy out there, don't they, Chief?"
Sure.
You got six people dead out there all at the same time.
We don't get that here.
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
"Colored boys, generally."
Just like out there.
One of them sticks another one over a card game or some shit.
"Chief Dixon, I think we should discuss..."
Craps sometimes.
You were wanting to know about this boy's uncle.
I think we hit the jackpot.
The uncle's place is the damnedest hideout I've ever seen.
"It's out in the woods, northeast of town, over this old rickety bridge."
You couldn't find a soul out there if you didn't already know where to look.
"You boys being from the city, you'd be lost in 10 minutes."
"But I'll be with you, so you don't have to worry about that."
"Damn, Bonnie."
Excuse me?
"Oh, nothing."
CHERYL ANN:
They were out of onion rings so I got you tasty taters.
"It's L.A., Cheryl Ann."
Chief Jenkins and them.
"Yes, sir?"
Will this be a promising avenue of investigation?
"Oh, it's a promising avenue, all right."
Me and my deputies can start setting up a surveillance now.
"Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off on that until we get a game plan?"
"Well, if you say so."
JENKINS:
Mr. Drew's escaped!
What?
!
Mr. Drew's escaped!
"We left him in the room, come out and see the fun, and when we went back, he was gone!"
"Why, you..."
let's get him!
"No, wait!"
We'll get him when he gets his fingers in the flypaper.
"Cornele, i told you, i've fallen among thieves!"
I ain't been righteous to you on account of jim fisk.
"He led me astray, and that's given me a misery in my conscience."
I want to get him out before he gets me out.
Ahh... now we've got at the bottom of this.
"Cornele... of course, i don't like to do business on a sunday... but it looks like me and you is gonna swap horses."
What about fisk?
Has he got anything to say?
I put him in.
I can put him out.
Uncle daniel in the lion's den!
"Say, what is this?"
"I'm sorry, commodore."
"Your butler told us that nobody was allowed through the front door, so we came- when a final settlement is made, boys, you'll be in."
"You bet your giblets, we'll be in."
"What's the deal, commodore?"
I get 5 million for half of my stock.
Drew says he'll take it out of the erie treasury.
"Why, uncle daniel, don't you know that my army is defending all that money?"
"That money's mine, too!"
I'm treasurer of erie.
You were the treasurer.
"We'll settle this right now, commodore."
To be seen together ?
Why are you getting mad ?
I'm just being honest.
Nobody wants to see us together.
We spend more time defending our relationship than having one.
It'sjust... so hard.
Everything's gotta be easy ?
"That's the story ofyour life, not mine."
You know this much about my life.
"I know when shit gets rough, you give up and punk out."
Just the way you punked out on ballet when your mom died.
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom !
God !
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
It'sjust that... all this shitjust kind of caught me off guard.
"I mean, it's, like, damn, you don't wanna be with me."
"is that what you're saying, that you don't want to be with me ?"
"No, it's not like that."
"I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're taking it personal."
"Let me tell you something, Sara."
I just hit the best friend I have in the world in the face overyou.
I've been taking shit from people I've known all my life.
"People I care about, that care about me so I could be with you."
Telling myselfthat we are in this together.
"So, don't give me this ""nothing personal."" l don't wanna hear it."
"Fine. lf l'm messing up your life so much, then maybe we shouldn't be together."
You know what ?
I don't need this shit.
ldon't even know whylbother.
I'm out.
To me.
If only it had found me first.
If only I could have stepped in front of him.

Your resignation in about six months would be appropriate.
"Six months, did you say?"
How about six hours?

"After the checks and balances rap, we'll go into:"

Sharks are getting hungry.
Give them a one-minute sign.
Look.
"Lean and hungry, even the fat ones."
Any news?
Got anything?
"Thirty seconds, ladies and gentlemen."
Was that fight was about you?
"I didn't want to tell Caleb over the phone, but... he called right after he got off the ship, and he wanted to come over, and I said no."
What time was that?
"Just after 11:30, I think."
I told him I was sorry.
"I didn't mean to hurt him, but I couldn't help how I felt."
I told him I was in love with Brian.
And he... lost it.
"Next thing I know, Caleb's dragging me behind some store."
Starts pounding on me.
"I fought back for a little bit, and finally, I pushed him off me, then I ran."
Never saw him again.
Then where'd you go?
"Walked around for a while, cleared my head."
Got to Meredith's around 6:00.
That was seven hours after the fight.
You just walked around clearing your head?
"Caleb was my best friend, all right?"
I would never hurt him.
"We grew up together, went fishing every weekend."
We were practically brothers.
"Look, I know I'm a bad person for betraying Caleb that way."
But I didn't kill him.
The last time Caleb called he was rambling.
"Saying that he was gonna win me back, buy me a ring."
He sounded so out of it.
He was slurring like he'd been drinking.
Caleb hardly ever drank.
And that was the last time you spoke?
I can't believe
I'm never gonna hear his voice again.
"Meredith, look at me."
There's two sides to that.
I made a mistake.
"Look, you know more about this sort of thing than I do."
I don't want you thinking that we're incompetent down here in Star City.
"Let me tell you, Dale, you got the energy and dedication of 10 cops."
No shit?
No shit.
"Say, Dud."
"Let me ask you about something else I was thinking about, and if I'm full of shit, you just tell me, all right?"
All right.
"Well, sir,"
I've been thinking about moving to L.A. and joining up.
Joining up with what?
Police department.
Been on the force down here ever since I was grown.
"Hell, after 10 years of busting peeping Toms and stop sign runners,"
I'd kind of like to take a crack at the big time.
"Now I realize that getting on the force out there is no walk in the park, but, well, I figure after we wrap up this big case here, and with your recommendation..."
"Well, who knows, you know?"
I think you and me and Mackintosh can make a hell of a team.
"That's, um..."
That's an interesting idea.
Well?
"How you doing, Hurricane?"
"Hi, Larry."
"Hey Dud, this is Larry Gibson."
He's our local Smokey.
"Larry, this is Dud Cole."
He's from L.A.
How are you?
"Hi, good."
Last night some folks killed a Texas state trooper in Odessa.
I spend 23 hours a day wondering whether we' re wrong for each other.
Wondering whether we've got the energy that we need to get through everything that we seem to get into.
Whether the baggage we both bring would sink a small ship.
"But in the 24th hour, I realize I've been thinking about her for 23 hours."
"And I come back to, there's something about her that I can't stay away from."
Something about her that makes me wanna love her.
"Julia, my sister, read this story about a little Japanese girl who had cancer."
"And she tried to make a thousand paper cranes because she thought if she did, it would make her wish come true."
- What was her wish?
- To get better.
So how many paper cuts do you have?
A lot.
But my wish is kind of different.
What is it?
It's hard to explain.
"I kiss pretty good for a dead kid, huh?"
Not bad at all.
Cop wounded in a multi-car collision.
"BP, 124/68, pulse, 96, good sats."
"Jing-Mei, take him in."
I'll wait on the next.
- Find the guys?
- The guys opened fire.
- We have a bunch of cops hurt.
"- Mitch Palnick, 41-year-old officer."
MVA with passenger-space intrusion.
- Can't breathe.
"- Hey, nice to see you again."
- You know him?
"- He wears Florsheims, rubber-soled."
- Isn't that right?
- Correct.
I didn't murder anybody.
This witness is lying.
One memeber of the police department agrees with him.
Thomas Hardy made this statement to the press.
I do not think Kesser is the killer.
Important information was withheld.
Can you tell us what that information is?
Two of the women were called from police call boxes.
Why didn't you say that?
.
A Pittsburgh cop did it!
An offical police report denied Hardy's accusations.
The controversy has not changed Kesser's death sentence.
Airtight case.
Kesser had no alibi at all.
He confessed to the murder of his accomplice as self-defense.
He denied the Polish Hill murders.
"We found evidence from the murders in his hotel room,   and the gun that killed Vince Hardy."
Then why does Hardy think that Kesser was framed?
Kesser's fingerprints weren't on the gun.
It was a police special.
The serial numbers were erased.
Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
- He thinks the killer's a cop.
- No one thought he was innnocent?
"Yeah, Kesser."
"Well, Bob, he's putting them in the Allegheny or the Monongahela."
That narrows it down.
This is Hardy here.
Go.
"Hi, it's Jo."
Are you going to the policeman's ball tonight?
The Army has a new mode of transportation.
Did you hear about it?
Feet.
-Wise guy.
"-Oh, on the double."
"Hey, what's the-- here."
"Formation, on the double, hee-yah, line up."
"Ever-Everybody, look alive!"
"Excuse me, gentlemen, I'll only take a minute of your time."
I wish to discuss the motor pool and the work... (chuckling):
Work.
"Now, look, men, I don't ask you to kill yourself, but every once in a while, move a little."
"In case an officer walks by, he won't mistake it for a painting."
"And Zimmerman... didn't get those brake drums on the half-trucks yet, did you?"
"-Well, you know, Sarge..."
"-Oh, I know."
"You've been too busy washing officers' private cars at a buck a throw, right?"
"-Well, Sarge..."
"-Get into those fatigues, down to the motor pool, get those brake drums, and out of here!"
There's been a lot of goofing off going around here.
This has got to stop!
Day sheet in yet?
HENSHAW:
Yo.
"Paparelli, you draw guard duty tonight."
I know.
What's this?
"""Permission-- ten days leave granted to..."""
"Oh, when it comes to asking for a furlough, they're right on the ball."
Let's see which meathead this is.
"""Ten days leave granted to Sergeant Ernest Bilko."""
I got it!
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy had killed a made guy.
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.
"Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason."
"You had to have a sit-down, and you better get an okay or you'd be the one who got whacked."
"Saturday night was for wives, but Friday night at the Copa was always for the girlfriends."
"And last week we saw Sammy Davis, Jr."
You got to see this show.
What a performer!
He does these impersonations.
"I swear, you'd think it was the real people!"
"Oh, it's unbelievable."
You could see how a white girl could fall for him.
What?
Not me.
But you could see how some girls could.
Like that Swedish girl.
In other words you condone that stuff?
Take it easy.
I just wanna make sure I don't wind up kissing fuckin' Nat King Cole over here.
I don't mean me.
"But, you know, he's got personality."
"""Personality?"""
He's very talented.
I understand perfectly what you're saying.
But you have to watch out sometimes how you say things.
"You know, people get the wrong impression."
I just said he was talented.
Why don't you just leave it alone now?
I don't really have an appetite right now.
I met some people there.
At Ojai.
Like Sarah.
"Mom, do you remember that Christmas, when I was eight and I had my tonsils taken out?"
"And then after the surgery, your friend Bill came by to visit."
And he gave me that doll with the long red hair.
Did Bill really think that a doll could make up for abandoning me?
"What was it, a ""sorry for being a deadbeat dad"" gift?"
No.
Please.
Let me explain.
There's an explanation for why you lied to me for 20 years?
You said that Bill was your friend and left out the part about him being your boyfriend for two decades and my father!
Honey.
"Oh, God."
It is complicated.
"It seems pretty simple to me, Mom."
You were willing to be sloppy seconds for some rich jerk with a wife and kids.
My dad didn't want to fess up to a bastard child with his mistress because he didn't want to risk his Norman Rockwell life.
No.
"I know that you're angry, but you need to hear me through."
Why?
It's too late to do anything about it.
He's dead!
"- Yes, but... but you..."
- How much of it is mine?
What?
The money that William Walker left you.
How much of it is mine?
I put two million dollars in a trust in your name.
And it will be yours when you're 25.
Another one ofmy favorite leading men was Howard Keel.
"Best known for his rich baritone voice, he had a very competitive romance with Betty Hutton in Annie Get Your Gun."
"- No, you're not"
"- Yes, I am"
"- No, you're not"
"- Yes, I am, yes, I am"
I can shoot a partridge With a single cartridge
I can get a sparrow With a bow and arrow
I can live on bread and cheese
- And only on that?
- Yes
- So can a rat
"- Any note you can reach, I can go higher"
- I can sing anything higher than you
"- No, you can't"
"- Yes, I can"
"- No, you can't"
"Yes, I can"
"Anything you can wear, I can wear better"
In what you wear I'd look better than you
- In my coat?
- In your vest
- In my shoes?
- In your hat
"- No, you can't"
"- Yes, I can, yes, I can"
"Anything you can say, I can say faster"
I can say anything faster than you
"- No, you can't"
"- Yes, I can"
- I can jump a hurdle
- I can wear a girdle
"Corporal Barbella, you're a dreamer."
"Now, look, you guys, you got to get on the ball."
You understand?
I want guys that want to soldier.
"You soldier for me,"
I'll interfere with the old man for you.
I-I...
What is that?
I cannot...
You making faces behind me?
What are you doing?
"Now, look, if you guy..."
"You know, Sergeant, some of the officers paid me for washing their car, and I figured if you're still running the snack-in-the-sack raffle, can I have a couple of shots at it?"
-(overlapping chatter)
"-Me, too."
"Yeah, me, too, Sarge."
Two tickets for the next dance.
-Put me down for the motor pool.
-Two tickets.
"All right, is this the suite?"
"Yes, sir, the adjoining room is right through there."
Is that all the flowers they got up here?
"-Oh, I'll get some more, sir."
"-Oh, never mind, we'll rough it."
"Hello, get me the main desk."
"All right, get that champagne spread out, get those cigars laid out..."
"Hello, main desk."
"Uh, look, there may be some poor souls wandering around the lobby looking for Squad ""B"" reunion-- ""B,"" ""B"" like in ""Bilko,"" yeah."
"-Send 'em up to suite, uh..."
-BELLHOP: 32C.
"32C on the double, look alive, hey... all right, good-bye!"
-You got the champagne out there?
Sorry.
I had a little bit of a kitchen accident.
"I was trying to get an avocado pit out, and I did the stab method instead of the chop."
- Took off like half my--
- Ahem!
...but I'm good to go.
I know.
I'm here.
"I'm here, you're here."
"Let's do this, right?"
So I am Patty Solis-Papagian.
I represent Jason Larson.
"So two years ago,"
"Ryan Larson, father of Jason, employee of Borns Tech, blew up on a boat owned by the defendant."
What was he doing on the boat?
"Well, he was dumping explosives into the ocean."
Completely illegal.
"Now, what were these explosives that he was dumping?"
"Well, they were parts of an illegal weapon that was being made by Borns Tech."
Get this: we have video of the explosion.
"Not only do we have video, we have the blueprints and the model of the weapon."
We found them buried in his backyard.
Guy had them buried in his backyard.
"At the end of the day,"
Borns Tech is no good.
- [clicking]
"- They're just no good because they do dangerous things with hazardous materials, and they don't care who it affects."
They could care less.
And this is a trend that happens with big corporations all the time.
Your Honor?
"Ford with the Pinto,"
"Big Tobacco, NFL with the--"
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad, but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no, that's the cuff."
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers and the rotten fish smell is getting stronger."
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
Is that why last night when I asked you to honka honka me you only honka'd me?
I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"Thanks, baby."
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
Mm.
"I'm sorry, bro, I totally overreacted."
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
"And wait, you-you forgive me?"
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple ""cee-gars."""
Get over here!
All right.
"So, where are those ""cee-gars""?"
"Eh, we'll break 'em out in a minute."
"Hey, Barn."
Ted?
"Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
But I've come for the singing - my teacher put me down on the list.
Baker.
You're an hour late.
Am I?
Bakers get up early.
Baker's the one with the music teacher's recommendation.
"So you wouldn't make a very good baker, would you?"
Do you have an excuse?
"Oh, he will have."
Sinners always do.
Judas had an excuse when he betrayed our Lord.
That sniper on Vimy Ridge had an excuse when he shot my leg off.
"All right, Kirkby, keep it Methodist."
Let's give him five minutes.
"Stand by the piano, please, Baker."
Face this way and really sing out.
Do you know your note?
"It's a B, Miss."
# I want to make you proud I want my song to let you see
# Who I can be when I belong
"# I'll give you all I have, I'll never swerve"
# I'll be the boy that you deserve
# See who I am A boy with a heart
# A boy saying please won't you choose me
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart
# Turn me away and you'll lose me.
# He wants to make you proud he wants to shine
# He wants to hear you say that boy is mine
# We know your love is there just in disguise
# He needs to see it in your eyes
"# Look who I am, a boy with a heart"
# A boy saying please won't you choose me
Forget it.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, how about a mini celebration?"
"All right, we'll just keep it simple, just the things that Judah loved, chicken parmesan, Willy Wonka, the original not the lame Johnny Depp piece of shit."
"A piñata, lap dance."
Celia.
"Hey, take it easy."
All right.
Enough.
I never should have done this!
They hate me!
They hate me!
This is all your fault!
"God, if you would have just put a fucking light in at the intersection!"
- I was going to.
"- Oh, right, you were?"
"But you were being this know-it-ally bitchface,"
- I couldn't resist fucking with you.
"- Yeah, and you still can't."
City Council is pretty much the only thing in my life
I didn't have to get baked to get through.
You took that away from me.
How did you know about Walter's boat garage?
"Celia, everything that happens in government is motivated by self-interest."
Someone's always trying to put one over on someone else so they can get something they want.
We're all just nothing but a bunch of selfish assholes.
"Remember that, and you won't go wrong."
Thank you.
Celia.
You should bring some vodka to the council.
- Vodka.
- That's what I used to do.
You think they like anyone?
"- Yeah, a plain wrap..."
"And, well, it was about marriage and sex."
I had it sent to me at the post office.
It took me two weeks to get up the courage to go pick it up.
Look... .
"I know it sounds funny, but it was the only way I could find out anything."
"Norman, you know what?"
I sent for a book just like that in the same plain wrapper general delivery.
"- No, really?"
The same one?
"And I read every word of it, and I think most of it's mid-Victorian nonsense."
Maybe yours was better.
"Hey, want to trade books?"
No.
I'd be too embarrassed.
"That's your whole trouble, Norman."
Everything embarrasses you.
Everything frightens you.
I know.
And I'm sorry we started talking about all this.
"Hey, Norman, look... ."
It's about time you learned that girls want to do the same things as boys.
And they have the right to know how.
"I mean, I think we should help each other."
- Are you suggesting that...?
"- Norman, don't get me wrong."
"All I want is some normal, intelligent discussion and maybe some normal affection between a boy and a girl, nothing more."
Everybody in this town hides behind plain wrappers.
You're so afraid.
You've even been afraid to ask me to the graduation dance.
"Allison, I want... ."
"Well, see, I'm just not asking anybody."
"Well, jim knows a lot more about business than i do."
"But you'll pardon me for saying it, but... i know more about women, and, uh- and you think he's made a bad investment."
His luck.
I'll take stocks and bonds.
"Hey, daniel!"
"Whoa, baby!"
Whoa.
"I might have known it was you, cornele vanderbilt."
A- whoopin' and a- rushing' around like a fiend in a fiery chariot.
You done near scraped the paint off my buggy.
"I'm sorry, daniel, but i wanted to make you an offer."
I thought maybe you might like to swap old bessie there for my team of thoroughbreds.
You want to swap that team for my bessie?
"Yes, daniel."
I'll swap you even- if you throw in the erie railroad.
It ain't no secret i'm gonna get control of erie.
I'm doing it because someone's got to protect the public from weasels like you.
Ya!
Now you boys listen to me.
That erie of mine is the best-paying railroad in america.
"For you, uncle daniel, or the stockholders?"
"For him, that's why he owns it."
Yes.
"When i get a good thing, vanderbilt don't sleep easy unless he gets some of the gravy."
Neither do we.
Who is he?
Do we have to put up with him?
He's the brains of our organization.
He don't look very bright to me.
What were you saying about the erie?
"When i say up, erie goes up."
"When i say down, erie goes down."
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-Iike arms and legs."
"And his green face, Iike a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-beIieve stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-beIieve, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you...."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao."""
"What'II you do, Grandma?"
I'II go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
AII right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
You didn't see the telegram telling you that?
"No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent while we were on the way back."
I guess we didn't have to come back in such a hurry.
I have heard dogs can see in black  white only
Is this dog an exception?
"Sister, come"
If you make noise I will break your head
Stop
Who are they?
They are guests to our area Why do you chase them?
I can understand
That poor girl wore a red color dress
You should not have chased a one legged girl
One legged?
Were you not running?
Running?
"No, I am one legged?"
How can I run?
Let me think about it
"Oh no, it seems you have come running"
Holding my sister I was leaping
You might not have noticed the leg because of the skirt
"You are right, you may go"
She is one legged
You are deceiving him as one legged....
The truth will come out one day
He is going to make you one legged
-Be careful
-Let us see
Can't find a place in Ukkadam to start the party office?
Half of the city has already been acquired by us
Stop
Whose building is that?
Belongs to Dr. Nallamuthu
How is his background?
"Listen, I know that you and Eric aren't close and maybe you didn't feel like standing up in front of a bunch of people and... acting like you were."
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing and doing what needs to be done are two different things.
"You don't have to worry about me, Dad."
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
"One day, I know you're gonna become the man I know you can be, the man you were born to be."
"My God, that day's gonna be something to see."
"Come on, Johnston."
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna head down to the lake and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...
"wait for Emily, say good night."
"I'll, uh... meet you there."
I'll save you a place.
Where's he going?
"Oh, he's waiting for Emily."
Gonna say good night.
Well... that's the last we'll see of him tonight.
Dad.
"Ah... listen, if I had a girl that looked like that,"
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
"Hey, you hear that, boy?"
I'm gonna take tha girl away from you.
"Yeah, you talk a good game."
"Eh, you better watch out for yourself, too."
Your wife is crazy about me.
"Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory switch to you three times a day."
"Jake, it's Constantino."
"We can do this any way you want, Doc."
One to one from the chest...
Or we can all get down !
"Yeah, we can all really fuck this place up!"
(BELL ringing)
I'm not going against the guns.
"You're gonna lose, Doc."
"Any move you make, we're on you."
You fucked up!
(MEN clamoring)
"You're staying in the hole for as long as it takes to break up your little gang, Santana."
(GATE CLOSES)
SANTANA:
There was nothing the system could do to stop me.
I could run this show from solitary.
"Gracias, carnal."
J. D. taking care of business?
"Simón, ese, but the heat's on."
They're trying to break us up.
(SPEAKS spanish)
Danny's down in Soledad.
Stevie's down in Chino and Willie boy's in Vacaville.
"We need a meeting, keep ourselves together."
Any of our people on the outside coming up for trial?
Puppet's little brother got busted.
"Tell our lawyer to subpoena us, get us together in one place."
"The brothers send their love, carnal."
Gracias.
SANΤANA:
"Τhe state is so lame, they paid for the game."
There were a couple of things from some of our people who've already gotten out that weren't in sync with instructions I've been getting from inside.
Inside runs the show.
"We shall see you at Barton Park, I hope."
Next time Sir John gives one of his hops. (CHUCKLES)
"Allow me to escort you to the carriage, Mrs Dashwood."
"Thank you, Colonel."
Marianne is still rather weak.
"And Miss Marianne, of course."
Your mother's as good a hand at that game as I am.
(LAUGHS)
"Thank you, Colonel Brandon."
"I wish you a good journey, ladies."
"Dear Colonel, thank you for your kindness."
"How good it is to see the sun, after what Shakespeare calls the furious winter's rages."
"Oh, my little love."
We shall always be grateful to the people at Cleveland.
Mr Palmer's library is full of great books.
I wonder if he has ever read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare.
I should think he bought them to make a fine show.
I have formed a plan.
I shall enter upon a course of serious study.
I shall rise at six and divide every moment until dinner between music and reading.
I dare say Colonel Brandon will advise me as to my reading.
"Yes, I'm sure he will."
I long to sit down at my own dear pianoforte.
My plan shall keep me busy.
We shall have no time for regrets.
(PIANO PLAYING)
It is over now.
"Elinor, do not grieve, that moment had to come."
I'm glad it is over.
- Is it?
- At least we are talking about him.
- We should have done so before.
I was spellbound... but she said it all...
I even tried to get away...
"""but when I looked back, there she was, right in front of me"""
"""Then I smiled and she smiled back;"
"when I took a step, she came along"""
"""Then we became breathless, and a moment stood stilled"""
"And then, we were in love"
That's our love-story
That's our life-story
"3 months, 28 days and 8 hours ago we fell in love"
You're crazy
Why do you drag him everywhere?
He won't leave us alone
What does that mean?
- You're bananas
I'll be home by eight.
"Yes, I'm with Jai."
Brian is also with us
Why talk to your mother like that?
Like how?
So irritably...?
Because she irritates me
"At times, I hate her."
Maybe Because of the familiarity?
"When you're far from home, you realise... what mother means, what a family means"
This monkey is hovering around all the time... particularly when I'm with you
"Yes, because of you"
You're seeing my parents today
After we drop Brian.
Won't take long
Now smile and give an okay
Watch!
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Himmler is already in Madrid and soon he'll go to Montserrat.
"He doesn't know anything, right?"
-He's unaware of the time door.
He's going to look for the Holy Grail.
Or at least that's what history tells us.
History.
"I would love to be able to travel in time and change it, I swear."
That's what we're doing.
"Yes, that's what we're doing."
-Let's go.
Madrid is full of spies.
And Juan and Luis?
-They're safe.
Leave immediately for Montserrat.
Destroy that door before the Nazis find it.
You two will travel to Hendaye.
"If they don't manage to destroy the door, you need to stop Spain from entering World War II."
By whatever means neccessary.
I look like a puppet.
"No complaining, I don't even want to think about when we travel to meet Viriatus."
"I knew that this day would come, but traveling to my own future terrifies me."
In 1940 I'll be over 80 years old.
This is only 60 years after your time.
Imagine how I feel on every trip.
It's almost better to travel farther than closer.
It's the memories that kill you.
"You're lucky, you can't ever travel to the future."
So you'll never know what will become of your life.
My future doesn't interest me as much as my past.
"Yes, too much sometimes."
"Anyway, past, future..."
What does it matter?
-Pizza Planet!
Yeah!
Andy!
Wh...
Doesn't he realise that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
"Oh, I'm a lost toy!"
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refuelling station of some sort.
You!
"-According to my navi-computer, the..."
-Shut up!
"-Just shut up, you idiot!"
"-Sheriff, this is no time to panic."
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost.
Andy is gone.
"They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!"
My...
My fault?
If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me..."
Don't talk to me about importance!
Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What?
What are you talkin' about?
"Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!"
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
"And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!"
You... are... a... toy!
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
"All right, bitches, all set outside."
Let's wrap it up in here and go hit the strip club.
"- Yeah, baby."
"- Oh, my god."
"Franco, we just did a full tour in the firehouse."
"We had 5 fires in 2 days, and now you're talking about tits and ass?"
That's all you can talk about?
Jesus.
"Um, actually, yes."
"Not to mention, scores serves sandwiches till closing time."
- Really?
"- Yeah, really."
"All right, let's hurry up and get over there."
My man.
"Yo, yo, yo, bro."
"We're closed, man."
I hear this is the hottest joint downtown.
Models and good tunes.
"Yeah, between the hours of 10:00 and 3:30, ok?"
Some come back tomorrow.
Ok.Sorry.
"Goddamn.Guys, I'm gonna need somebody else on the door if black shawn ain't coming back, ok."
"You know, got to get somebody to work for him tomorrow down at the firehouse."
"So, wait, he's still not back at work?"
Nobody knows where he is?
I got a message from him saying he's up in boston.
I know he's got a cousin in the department up there.
He hasn't called colleen.
She's out of her mind.
"You know something, if we keep covering for him like this, needles finds out, asshole mode he's in, trouble in river city."
"I hope he's not pulling this disappearing act because, you know, he knows I found out about what went on with him and colleen."
What?
"Actually, I wasn't alone."
Sergeant Hutchinson here served as my foil.
"- Well, thank you, Doc."
- Don't mention it.
"One day, you'll be proud to announce that you had the honor... of observing the great Dr. Winchester."
Anything I should know from here on out?
- Ask the expert.
- Just keep a close watch.
"If there's infection, the tantalum acts as a foreign body... and you have to remove it."
"If you'll excuse me, I have to sweep out the lab."
It just doesn't seem fair.
He's as good a nurse as any of us here.
## [Harbor Lights]
- ## [Stops]
- That's enough from the hurt parade.
"As long as the ""Harbor Lights"" are on, you're never gonna see things clearly."
"Oh, I see things very clearly."
That's why I'm writing Gus.
"""Dear Scum."""
I figured I'd start slow and then really let him have it.
Gus knew I still loved Laverne.
I told him that when I wrote him.
I don't understand something.
If all this happened because you wrote Gus in the first place... how were you gonna make things better by writing Gus in the second place?
What do you want from me?
I can't just sit and wallow in self-pity.
"Oh, Laverne!"
Laverne!
"Klinger, listen to me."
"You're yelling at him, but you're crying for her."
"If you wanna communicate with Laverne, why don't you write Laverne?"
- Hey.
When he thought there was a shirt under it.
I totally remember that.
"Rafi thought there was a shirt under my shirt when we were rehearsing and lifted up my hoody, and there wasn't a shirt under my shirt."
"I have to say, though, they don't..."
"Should I have to say, in a scene, that you should not pull up a girl's shirt?"
Don't pull up Kat's shirt in this one.
"I mean, am I supposed to say that in every scene?"
"I made it seem like it was Pete's fault, but it wasn't."
At least I was wearing a brassiere.
- Rafi was hoping to catch a glimpse.
"- No, I don't think he was."
- Rafi blamed it on his character.
"- Can I, like, reveal a secret?"
He was in character.
"This is embarrassing, but I wanna say it because you guys are here."
"After that happened, I re-created my crouch in my trailer pulled up my shirt to see what I look like."
Re-created your what?
"I was, like, ""I need do some crunches."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- You are so much.
"- Oh, no."
- That's what you do in your trailer?
That's what I...
"I know, it was really insecure of me."
"I like this part, Ari."
"We should talk about this stunt, Ari."
"- Oh, God, is this the...?"
- I didn't not...
"- Well, I accidentally hit it once."
- You hit your head once.
- But there was padding on the door.
- Should we talk about where this is?
Where?
You can't defend him on this.
Where is he?
I don't know.
"I found this in the corner, under a shelf there."
"200 quid, stuffed in an old biscuit tin."
And here... shoe marks... size and pattern of which seem a good match for Julie-Ann's boots.
How far from here to where her body was found?
300-400 yards.
Possible she was dragged all that way?
Possible.
This could be where she was strangled.
That money you found at the lock-up matches the notes Julie-Ann stole from her dad.
"Well, we know she was doing a deal with O'Duncie."
"After she left the squat, she needed a secure location to stash the money until the deal was in place."
So she gave it to David to hang on to?
But why did he turn the garage upside-down?
He'd know where it was.
- To destroy the crime scene?
- She's nervous.
"O'Duncie has already beaten up Eddie, so she's not gonna trust anyone with £200, and doesn't tell David where she's hidden it."
"Then on the 13th, David Bentley wants to know where the money is."
And ends up throttling her.
- We've found the Bentley van.
"- Yes, sarge."
Let's go.
Sarge.
The list of Bentley associates and their last-known addresses.
- You sent cars out?
- Sergeant Harris thought you'd coordinate.
WPC Tennison...
What does that look like to you?
I don't want any teacher making a fairy tale out of life.
It's hard enough without being unequipped to meet it.
That's a good rule.
Shall we sit down?
And rule two teach a minimum of facts and maximum of ideas.
"Our main job is to teach children how to think, not just to memorize."
If war comes for us these kids shouldn't fight just for historical dates but for the ideals behind them.
"I like your rules, Mr. Rossi."
Peyton Place is very fortunate.
"Thank you, Ms. Thornton."
"Allison, I don't know what Betty's buying, but tell her to hurry."
Okay.
"Mother, Ms. Thornton didn't get the job."
I know.
Betty and Margie told me.
They're in the back.
"After giving her the gift and the speech, it was embarrassing for her."
She'll get over it.
I'm glad I'm graduating.
I don't want to know the new principal.
"- Mrs. MacKenzie, about graduation... ."
"- What about it, sweetie?"
Mother needs a new dress for the exercises.
Could I make some arrangement to buy her one?
After I graduate I'll get a job and I could pay you back.
You'll be needing a new dress yourself.
I can get by.
"Look, with Easter and graduation coming on, I'll be needing some help."
Would you like to work afternoons and Saturdays?
- I'd love to!
- Fine.
- Then I could buy two dresses.
"Ho, ho!"
Poverty has got to go!

"I came back here to have a normal life, not to screw up yours."
"No, you came back to undo a regret."
At first.
And then I realized that I can do a lot more than that.
I can rewrite my whole existence.
"No, you can't."
"I can, and I was, until you showed up."
"You know, getting in the middle, between you and Ethan, that was the old me, and I won't go down that road again."
And I'm not asking you to.
"We shoulda stuck to coffee and small talk, like I said."
I think that you're overreacting.
Really?
Yeah.
You think you can just say that... that you feel something for me and it doesn't change anything?
"Well, not if we don't let it."
Just do yourself a favor and stay away from me.
Kai...
I'm serious.
I'm done--
"With this whole screwed up situation, this friendship... or whatever the hell it is."
It's over.
"Relationships-- they feel so permanent, so solid."
"So why, are we always surprised to find out that, like everything else, they are not immune to change?"

"""Tell me Devi, for what reason  work have you called me."""
Jalandhar has eyed me badly and tried to spoil my sacredness.
Now his end should surely come
- But how?
You are asking me that.
One who is eyeing other's wife wrongly...
"""...and crosses his limits, has no right to live."""
"""He attacked Kailash, he eyed me wrongly  called me..."""
...a beauty.
His intentions were'nt sacred.
He had sin in his mind
I want to finish Jalandhar.
He has also challenged my swami and his strength.
Why and for what reason?
"""What are you thinking, Shri Hari?"
"If that demon lives,..."""
...he will create havoc in the universe.
"""Hey Shiv."
"-You tried to deceive me, you deserve punishment."""
"""l am Mahabali Jalandhar, I am born to defeat Devatas  Gods"""
Face my attack
"""Rahu, your head is bowed down."
"Are you ashamed of your deeds."""
Ashamed as well as sad.
-lf proud and bad people...
"""...start feeling ashamed, there will be peace in this world."""
Bad deeds will only vanish
-Why you always sing the...
"""...tune of world's welfare, Narad"
"-As that is the best tune."""
The creation is there and runs due to this tune only.
"I said, ""Your fat ass gonna die, man."""
"Now I used to work in the back, washing the plates, the knives and the forks with my white friend, James."
"Now, there was an old Black dude named Fred, he used to wash the pots and the pans."
Now Chris Rock said it the best about old Black men.
"He said it the best, he said..."
"""Old Black men"
"""are the most racist people in the world."
"""Who the fuck are you?"
"Who the fuck are you?"""
"""Who the fuck are you to talk about..."""
"""They don't even fucking fight you."
"They just shoot you, ahh."""
"So they decided to send rolls to the back, right?"
I thought it'd be funny to pick up a roll and throw it at Fred.
'Cause I like messing with people.
"I picked up the roll, I threw it at Fred."
"It hit him, hit his water."
The water splashed him in his face.
But he thought that James threw the roll.
"Yeah, ""Oh, shit,"" right?"
"So in the back of Golden Corral,"
"I kid you not, he had a civil rights flashback right there."
"And it's like he turned back into a slave as soon as it happened, man."
"He said, ""Woosh!"""
"""Hey, cracker!"
"""You's throw another roll, and I's gonna fuck you up."""
"Now, New York, I had a decision to make."
"But I ain't no punk, I'm a survivor, so I was like,"
"""Yeah, throw another roll, cracker."""
And I was like... ¶ Wade in the water.
¶ Wade in the water.
¶ Whoa wade in the water.
"""I'm doing this because"
"I am your daughter"""
and there's this wonderful moment of recognition.
"No, I still can't read it."
It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate.
But this will.
"It's your daughter's name, in the language of the forest."
I know my daughter's name.
"Except, they don't have a word for ""Pond,"""
because the only water in the forest is the river.
"The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her, whatever it takes, and I know that."
It's me.
I'm Melody.
I'm your daughter.
That reveal was another Moffat moment that I got at the exact instant he wanted.
Holy crap.
"This whole time, really?"
The whole time.
"Once you see it, you're like ""of course!"
"Like Melody, Song;"
"Pond, River"""
and you feel like such an idiot.
"It was a good little surprise, there,"
Steven Moffat.
It makes perfect sense now.
Makes perfect sense.
"The Lady Cassandra is the last human, self-described."
"At this point, she doesn't look anything like a human."
"She's had so many plastic surgeries that she's literally just a sheet of skin, with eyes and a mouth and nose holes."
Because she had her chin removed because she said it made her look fat.
She's not unlike women I've met.
I lived in Hollywood for eight years.
I am thinking about my daughter.
"Tammy, we have some hard stuff... to talk about."
Your dad is in a coma.
From being stabbed?
He hit his head.
And Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
We're doing everything that we can.
"Look, I know this is really hard and I know you don't want to talk about it, and believe me, I know what that's like."
"But your mom's in trouble with the police, and I don't want her to be in more trouble."
"And this should not be your responsibility, but she says that it's all her fault, what happened, and... well, I don't believe her."
And... if you told the police what really happened... well...
I'm supposed to say it was an accident.
But it wasn't?
No.
No.
"Tammy, look, whatever your dad did... it wasn't him."
"I was cutting a cantaloupe, and my dad came in."
He started singing with the radio.
"He was being funny, but I got so mad."
I don't know.
It just cos over me.
My dad could see it was happening.
"He held me to calm me down, but I bit him."
"And he yelled for my mom, and they both tried to stop me."
"I had the knife in my hand, so I stabbed him."
And now he's gonna die.
I see you have a new rug.
Pete tells me you're afraid to leave the house.
"I said that you could come see the baby, not shrink my brain."
Your body language is telling me that you're uncomfortable.
My vocal language is telling you that I'm fine.
Really.
"Hey, sharing is a virtue"
This is a world of efficiency
"Only those fast enough can live, stupid!"
Y es!
"Come, take some soup!"
Your leftover!
We've tasted every bone!
Now you can have the most original taste!
"Brother Jin, you must be hungry"
T ake this first
I don't feel like eating
"I'm sorry, I did want to bring you some food"
"But all those nasty brothers, they were so fast in clearing up all dishes, leaving you only this"
This one is untouched!
I really don't feel like eating
You're deeply hurt and haven't eaten for days
Your stomach will hurt.
"Come, for my sake"
"T ake this bowl of rice, come!"
I'll get you some tea
Your brothers fight for food?
They say this is a world of efficiency
Only those fast enough can live!
You must be the slow one!
"I'm the junior, they always bully me"
"Every meal I only have rice with soup, no food"
It's better than what I have now!
So original!
"Y es, that's called the original taste"
Rice has it's own taste!
Isn't it?
My Master said... your Kung Fu technique is stunning
As you should be.
Yay!
"You know, the last time I was invited"
"To a ceremony in my honor, I had to slaughter a chicken."
"Well, at least you've been honored."
"I've-I've never been honored,"
"I did win a contest once at boarding school,"
"And I think there was a plaque,"
But I'm not sure that really counts.
What kind of contest?
It was for drinking hot chocolate
At the winter fair.
"I had a buddy that went to Exeter,"
And the stories he tells would make Keith Richards blush.
"Yeah, well, um..."
I wasn't really into the party scene.
I was there more for the academics.
"It sounds like you've made some great choices, Serena."
I'm glad.
The bad ones have a way of...
Following you.
"You know, I've never heard that hot chocolate story."
"Yeah, well, there are a lot of stories you haven't heard."
"True, but I did hear this one."
"My ex-boyfriend went to boarding school with Serena,"
And he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night
At a bed-and-breakfast- Jenny.
Although I'm sure they were just studying.
"You know, like she says, she was all about the academics."
"I have an announcement, everyone."
I've decided I'm moving back in.
"That way, I can be here with you, mom."
Reproductive Biology Research Foundation.
"Did you, uh, check on top of the fridge?"
I already looked there.
"Well, then maybe Helen finished the frosted flakes."
But that's what I eat for breakfast every day.
"Well, then fry an egg, then."
Just don't leave the refrigerator door hanging open.
"Oh, I got to go."
Are you-- are you hiding from me?
Hiding?
No.
That would just be silly.
Because I-I just saw you talking with Virginia.
I'm hiding from you because I do not want to have this conversation.
Why?
What did Virginia say?
"First of all, there is nothing going on between her and Logan."
She said that?
"Well, of course she said that now."
"But what if you were to take her out for dinner, you know?"
- Maybe have a drink or two?
- No!
"My responsibilities here are varied and far-reaching, but reffing a fight between mommy and daddy is not one of them."
"Hey, hey."
Maybe I can spare you a lot of grief by sharing with you a tidbit I've picked up-- one you seem to have missed.
"Trying to control other people doesn't work, ever."
The only person you can control is yourself.
"So, you got no relevant information out of her"
- about Logan.
"- Oh, for the love of God!"
Are you kidding me?
The placebo reaction.
... fromstaffer to congressional assistant...

And he gave a speech that day...

"Halfway through dinner, I had a job."
"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."
And here we go.
I hear the curve in your voice.
I've been with Pappas for 3 years...
"... andI finallyfoundaplace,where  you can make a difference."
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We gotta keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
"I gotta get that report, see where it leads."
"What if, while you're playing detective..."
... Wakeleydecides it'd be healthier to disappear?
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we gotta take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own...
... you'llfeelthefullweight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
"Barney, come with me."
Boys!
- Leave him alone.
"- You stay out of this, Michael Coyne!"
We're doing the job for you.
Maybe now the Yanks will leave our women alone.
Get away from him.
"Michael doesn't keep that gun loaded, Mrs. Coyne."
He told me often enough.
"Do you want to test that theory, Michael Hanlon?"
Rose.
Get away from him!
Cowards!
HE COUGHS
"Mr. Coyne, in light of what just happened, the Commanding Officer has placed your bar out of bounds for a period of two months."
Two months?
"He wanted to put it out of bounds, period."
- I had to argue very hard.
- Thank you.
Do you mind?
The Commanding Officer also wanted me to ask if Lieutenant Barnhill gave a good account of himself?
- He did.
- Good.
Good.
"We expect our fellows to give as good as they get, and apparently Lieutenant Barnhill is the current Kentucky golden gloves champion."
"That said, I want to say thank you for stepping in to save him."
"Now, Mrs. Coyne, I think it's more important than ever that we try to understand how to avoid things like last night."
I would very much appreciate the benefit of your local knowledge.
Rose is about as local as Winston Churchill.
But you're right.
She does seem to be able to make better sense of things in this parish than I do.
"I have to go, Captain."
Let me tell you that this is one of the worst days of my life.
Remember how I told you Minx's best friend was the light?
"Well, now I realise I was wrong."
Bonnie was my best friend.
Bonnie.
I saw that crystal clear today when I went to the airport to pick up her parents.
It was a good photo opportunity for Minx.
"So she went, even though it was very early."
"You didn't laugh at my little joke against Minx, Michelangelo."
Maybe you don't have a sense of humour.
"Anyway, her family are fat."
They're all fat and small.
Her little sister looks like a sausage.
Look over there.
But they loved Bonnie.
They loved her.
"Nursed her through the operations, the eyes, the nose, everything."
Worked night and day to pay for it all.
And now she's gone.
All for nothing!
The detective asks me how I feel about my models.
"I told him again and again, I adore them."
"Of course, Michelangelo!"
They wear my designs!
"OK, OK, Dorothy was, I must admit, tiring."
It was the tears like a fountain.
"And Bonnie was, I admit, a nightmare, but in the show, you see, she was a winner."
"She could walk, you see."
"And then there was the hair, red, which was, in my opinion, overrated."
"That's why I put her in a wig but not just any wig, you understand."
"A 30-metre long black braid, Chinese reference."
"It was superb, truly superb."
Come on outside with me and let blanche finish dressing.
-I'm finished dressing.
-Then come on out.
-Your sister and I are having a talk.
-Honey run to the drugstore and get me a lemon Coke with chipped ice.
"will you do that for me, sweetie, please?"
please.
AII right.
Poor thing was out there listening to us.
And I have an idea she doesn't understand you as well as I do.
"AII right now, Mr. KowaIski, Iet us proceed without any more digression."
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.
What is it?
In the state of Louisiana we got here what's known as the napoleonic Code.
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband and vice versa."
"My, but you have an impressive judicial air."
"You know, if I didn't know that you was my wife's sister, I would get ideas about you."
-Such as what?
-Don't play so dumb.
You know what.
AII right.
Cards on the table.
I know I fib a good deal.
"After all, a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion."
But when a thing is important I tell the truth.
And this is the truth:
"I never cheated my sister, or you, or anyone else on earth as long as I lived."
"-Where are the papers, in your trunk?"
-Everything I own is in that trunk.
What are you thinking of?
What's in the back of that little boy's mind of yours?
Where?
Taking Owen to our place?
"Well, I didn't want to go there."
"I don't like Owen baby, I don't want to see Owen."
What's your schedule like?
I need your help.
I cannot get to close because I'm a stranger in this country.
There are some things which are difficult to study because of that.
I watched the creature from the empire state building but at night it's closed.
How can I study the behaviour of this creature?
It's on a private property.
I don't know...
"I'd like to help you, but I don't know what you expect me to do."
I'm just a college acting teacher.
"Fuck see Owen, OK."
"I got business, I got things to do."
See fucking Owen.
"Well, listen..."
I'd like to help you in some way but...
"I've an appointment right now, can we get in touch tomorrow?"
"These aliens are killing people, you're the only person I know in New-York."
"Telephone me tomorrow, keep in touch OK?"
Almost everything you've done since you left me has been self destructive.
Adrian is a real bad influence on you.
She didn't care anything about you.
She's only using you.
You're ruining your carrer.
Your future.
What are you talking about?
"It's the only thing I care, about my carrer."
What do you thing I'm doing right now?
I'm getting ready to shoot with a fashion photographer I met at the club.
One day in his hospital in Switzerland he told people he was going to dance a solo performance.
He put up a crucifix made out of black and white cloth.
He climbed up on it like Christ.
"He wanted to tell people about war  the death, destruction, and emptiness of war."
Tomoko went home.
Without eating breakfast?
She gave this back to you.
"""Paganini"""
I haven't seen you in a while.
I saw Yagi the other day.
I got a letter saying that the place on the hill was sold.
"I was wondering what was up, so I tailed him."
He seems to be pretty worried about you.
Ha ha.
He was looking for Takehara-san everywhere.
"You didn't tell him yourself, did you?"
Of course not!
"In fact, it was I who suggested to him buy it for your studio."
I don't want to build a new studio anymore.
"In fact, I'm thinking of giving up my studio in Tokyo."
Why?
"I don't think I'm going to continue working, that's why."
"Mrs., don't make me worry like that."
"If you're worried, remember that I'm behind you all the way."
You mustn't quit like that.
I don't think Yagi likes it when I dance.
"Mrs, you need to do something about Yagi and his dreary ways."
"Mrs., go it alone!"
You need time for yourself and to get your enthusiasm back.
It's about time you got a divorce.
Get a divorce!
That would be better.
"Sophie, I've been looking at color choices, and how would you feel about us in a nude?"
Max could go nude but you don't have the rack to pull it off.
Does anyone have a knife?
"Max, why do you have a switchblade to work in a dessert bar?"
My mother always told me to carry protection.
Wait 'til you see Grandma Kuchenski's dress.
They don't make them like they used to.
"You know, forced gypsy labor is illegal now."
Here we go.
- Oh.
- Uh...
"Sophie, was your grandma the Crypt Keeper?"
What's going on out here?
What's all that white powder in the air?
"I'm trying to run a restaurant, not an 80's disco."
"Oh, put a sock in it."
I'm buying one of your freaking overpriced puddings.
I'd get mad but I'm mildly attracted to you right now.
Just mildly?
"I mean, now I'm getting mad."
Sorry.
Wedding drama.
Her dress just fell completely to pieces... like I'm assuming I'll do in the near future.
"Whatever you need anything bridal, go to Rosenfeld's in Brooklyn."
That's where I got my dress when I was broke and straight.
So you weren't always into women?
Of course I was.
Except those three years in Scientology.
"Well, it looks like the three of us are going to go dress shopping now."
Yeah.
"And you know, I got to go wash my hands 'cause they're covered in old lady DNA."
"Well, that's that."
- What was your last assignment?
The assignment was to rate Officer Hardy's competence   and to monitor his interest in the Three Rivers murder case.
You state that Officer Hardy neglected his duties   to pursue an illegal investigation into the Three Rivers murder case.
To what do you attribute his unusal interest in the case?
He feels the murders were committed by the Polish Hill murderer.
A case he worked on.
A prosecution witness in the case   said that Officer Hardy threatened him.
And that you were forced to protect him with your own weapon.
"No, that's incorrect."
- I drew my weapon as backup.
- Backup?
Officer Hardy was not...
out of control and dangerous?
At no time whatsoever.
Hardy is courageous and resourceful.
I wish we had more officers...
- Excuse me...
- Don't you want my evaluation?
"Thank you, Detective, you may step down."
Ten-minute recess.
I'm sorry.
- Why'd you change your testimony?
- Why do you think?
- You cheat good.
- Hardy.
"Hi, Emily, it's your father."

"When you work here, you don't think about home"
- and families and babies.
- That's not fair.
He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year...
"Let me tell you something, Stephanie."
"Maybe you don't know how babies are made, because when people are trying, they know they're trying!"
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the chapter that you have on the entities you call..."
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
"Beseech you, tenderly apply to her some remedies for life."
"The queen, the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead."
- Oh!
- O thou tyrant
Belake thee to nothing but despair.
"Go on, go on, I have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest."
Prithee bring me to the bodies of my queen and son - one grave shall be for both.
Upon them shall the uses of their deaths appear unto our shame perpetual.
Good Antigonus
Sin fate hath made thy person for the thrower-out of my poor babe
Places remote enough are in Bohemia
There weep and leave it crying
"And, for the babe is counted lost forever"
"Perdita, I prithee call it."
"Blossom, speed ye well"
"There lie, and there thy character."
"Farewell, for the day frowns more and more"
Thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough.
Oh!
Oh!
- Why...?
- I am gone for ever!
What have we here?
"Mercy on's, a barne"
I'll talus it up for pity
Yet I'll tarry till my son me.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I have seen two such sights by sea and land!
"Why, boy, how is it?"

And now you think of something beautiful...
"Oh, my Lord."
it hurts so bad...
Bruno!
Check if the water's already boiling!
And bring the hot towels from the dryer!
A boy!
Where is he?
...And so I can only say:
my dear Mrs John... a la bonheur!
Thanks a lot.
"Look at it, Mr Hassenreuter:"
A seven-month-old child and already it looks just as big as my own.
"""Explain to me, Count Oerindur, this dilemma of nature!"""
"Why ""dilemma""?"
There is no dilemma!
"You're absolutely right, Mrs John."
With such a giant as father...
"Well, he'll be in for a surprise, right, Mrs John?"
Don't blow your smoke in my child's face!
Don't be surprised then if your child still looks like a seven month-old one.
That is not due to my smoking!
"That's all down to his father, that blue-blooded weakling who tried to prove that I couldn't bring up a child!"
But he lost the case yesterday.
I got full custody.
"- Well, I congratulate you."
- Thanks!
"Could we also look at the new one, Mrs John?"
"And the alimony too, 75 Mark monthly."
Learn to hate the alimonies that come from cultivated human hands!
"Little enough, when I consider that it was pure pleasure for these gentlemen, and for me just..."
"- Regardez les enfants, Madame Knobbe!"
"Ganz, I've got your man."
Shrubbery and ground's all in good shape.
- What rent is it bringing in?
- Just enough to pay the taxes.
But it's a valuable property.
"Surely, you could loan me 15,000 on it."
"You know, Douglas it was father's wish that you keep the place."
"Yes, I know."
"I hate to take a chance on losing it, it's all I have left."
But I've got to have the money.
But the theater business is an outright gamble.
Anything is a gamble to a fellow who doesn't know his oats.
But I think I know something about the theater.
There's a wide difference between college plays and Broadway productions.
"But one has to start somewhere, and there doesn't seem to be any room for me at the bottom."
So I'll start at the top.
"Alright, take your positions, girls."
Music.
[piano music]
Come ahead.
"Wait a minute, where's Gambarelli?"
She's supposed to enter with her father.
(male #1) 'She's coming.'
"Well, tell her to hurry up, Mr. Ganz is waiting."
I'm afraid you won't get much idea of the number this way.
We expect it to be one of the highlights of the show.
"Chowsky, explain how you're putting it on."
"With pleasure, Mr. Ganz."
"The setting is a magnificent art saloon with terrific big pictures all around, very lovely."
Gambarelli is coming with her father to sell his paintings.
I see.
"Visualize it, Tyler."
"Here's a sight for thee, look thee"
A bearing-cloth for a squire's child
"Look thee here, take up, boy, open it."
"What's within, boy?"
You're a made old man.
Gold!
All gold!
"This is fairy gold, and 'twill prove so."
"'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't."
In the name of Time I slide over sixteen years.
"In fair Bohemia, a son of the King's which Florizel I now name to you"
"And Perdita, now grown in grace, a shepherd's daughter."
"Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son?"
"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince."
I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd
"A man, they say, that from very nothing is grown into an unspeakable estate."
"I have heard, sir, of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note."
- Thou shalt accompany us to the place.
- I bear your command.

"Hey,got another dna sample to test it's a rush job."
"So,should I put it in front of my other rush jobs?"
Yes.
"Okay,I'll make a rush-rush job, and I'll get right on it, unless I get a rush-rush-rush job."
"Thanks,abs."
"Hey,um,could you tell gibbs that I got the results back from rebecca's dna?"
It does not match the genetic material in finn'shorts.
That means we're... looking for third woman.
"Since you revisited the crime sce,"
I decided I want to revisit the body.
Something's troubling me.
"Me,too."
"Uh-huh.What's that,tony?"
"Well,finn had two entrees and still had room for dessert."
"Makes me wonder if there was anything, you know,special about him."
Like what?
Oh...
like that.
did he have extra women because he had sething extra for the women?
"Well,take a look for yourself."
"sadly,the first thing the maggots eat is the soft tissue."
"Still,you've given me an idea."
To vomit?
"No,to reexamine the soft tissu thanks,tony."
I do what I can.

"Finn's bag contained 120 ounces of gold worth about $78,400 at today's conversion rate."
Nt numbers?
Tracing 'em now-- the coins were purchased over the internet in three batches.
I should have the dates here in a moment.
"Figured $60,000 came from the fiancees, and finn must have tossed in the rest."

Are these the same X-rays?
"Jefferson, Jefferson Reed."
"Mary, would you give me the blood vial on this patient?"
"""Jefferson Reed."""
The patient's name is Jefferson Reed.
"Dr. Jones, you're needed immediately... in patient Jefferson Reed's room."
Cut the bandages away.
"Oh, my God."
Let me have a mirror.
This is how I always look.
What we have here is another case... of a patient being diagnosed improperly.
He was suffering from third-degree burns... but there isn't any scar tissue anywhere.
Any real doctor might assume that this is... a rare case of the Stromburg theory... where badly burned tissue has an adverse reaction... causing the tissue to heal.
- Wrong!
Wrong.
- I beg your pardon?
Wrong.
"The Stromburg theory states... that minor burns could heal under stress, not third-degree."
"Look in the book... page 294, 3rd paragraph, middle of the page."
- He's right.
- Thank you.
Dr. Jones wrong.
He don't know what he talkin' about.
You really should reread chapter fourteen.
Chapter fourteen?
"Please, tell us why."
"In chapter fourteen, he starts out talking about..."
What was I saying again?
"Thank you very much for your medical tips, Mr. Reed."
I just want to run a few more tests... and you may leave whenever you're ready.
"Oh, no, Mrs. Johnson."
"They just called me, and I..."
Forgive me of holding you up.
What has happened to you?
I was collecting the mail.
"Dear Mr. Brass, I am Rosella and I saw some of the films,... not in the cinema, but in the tapes, which Gianni my husband,... brings home and which we watch together."
"I am 33 years old and think of myself as as a normal woman,... far faway from damsels and their works."
"However, something incredible happened to me, which seems... impossible of having occured."
Perhaps that's why...
I write.
"I was angry with my husband, because he would stay... at work at the clinic at night and not... take me out for dinner as agreed."
I had my outing organised.
I took the children to... mama and did not prepare dinner.
You could have told me before.
"Sorry, it is not my fault."
"We are going out to dinner another day,... besides, I am tired."
-It's always the same!
First the rest and finally your wife.
"-Not so, I apologised."
-You are a specialist at that.
Thus you never bring it on.
You only care for yourself.
Everything must turn around you and get done your way.
The others do not count.
"For you I am just a housewife,... and your maid."
"Enough, Rosella."
I visited the sick all day long.
I am tired.
And you create problems over nothing.
Stop being so hysterical.
Bye!
I cannot say any more in here.
Talk to me at home.
When you have calmed down.
I know he was dead.
"You bastard,you killed him!"
"ziva,get her out of here."
Mcgee.
Handcuff him and get a sworn statement.
I hope you fry!
Go to hell Go to hell.
Wow.
"I got to come up here more often gibbs,I screwed up."
"Well,yeah."
You almost spilled my coffee.
"When tony and i ran out to pick up jody, I left finn's bag of gold on my desk."
Mm-hmm.
"I know I should've taken to evidence, but we were focusing on... here's the inveory."
You took it to evidence.
"It says re the bag contained $18,000 worth of gold."
"We are $60,000 short."
You gave siri and rebecca back the money they loaned finn.
I thought I'd save the courts some paperwork.
You wouldn't be getting soft?
Of course not.
You shaved your moustache.
"Uh,boss,reception called this morning, they said that seone was here with information about sorry about a case."
"I went to meet her,and,um,this is jessica coleman,james finn's fiancee. ncis Season 4 Episode 5"
It's a great neighborhood.
"Very quiet, very private."
"There's an oversized backyard, that's a big plus."
Whole house has been newly renovated.
There are upgrades all over the place.
"Stainless appliances, air purification system, total move-in condition."
"The furniture is rented, but if you like it,I can have the company make you a deal."
Coffee?
"Thank you, yes."
Right now I'm waiting for Lt. Anderson.
I thought he ought to know about a call I got yesterday afternoon from this man Somers who was murdered.
Mind letting me know about that call?
I represent Axel Norstaad.
Norstaad?
Small world.
Somers wanted me to be ready to file an injunction this morning restraining a man named Norstaad from any future acts of violence and/or interference.
And also to put a private detective on the trail of one Latham Reed.
"I didn't take the case, though."
Too busy.
Who's Reed?
"Some building contractor that Somers said may have made off with a certified check for $50,000."
"When, do you know?"
Yesterday afternoon.
"Oh, there's Anderson now."
If you'll excuse me.
Certainly nice to have seen you both.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
[door closes]
[Axel] No.
It cannot be that you have not heard from her in all this time.
You must tell me where--
Have I interrupted you?
"Please, Mr. Mason."
Why do you not leave like I tell you?
"Well, it seemed obvious you didn't want to talk in front of Lt. Anderson."
But I do not need you.
"Axel, what happened between you and Somers yesterday that caused him instruct his attorney to file an injunction against you?"
"Oh, that."
She traveled around the world.
"Well, Anna-Kat is..."
Did she come to one of my basketball games?
No.
Was she at my back-to-school night?
No.
Did she ever check out my break-dancing crew?
Never!
All she does is come around and expect everybody to fawn all over her and listen to her talk about herself.
Unh-unh.
Not in my house.
"She was not there for me, and I am not gonna..."
Do you...
Do you have a pillow?
We're actually here to talk about Anna-Kat.
"And right now, she is feeding off of your anxiety."
"Uh, I wondered if you'd given any more thought to putting her on medication."
"Dr. Ellie, you know where I stand with this."
She is 6 years old.
I don't think screwing around with her brain this young is a good idea.
We'll revisit this if I find a bag of cat heads in her backpack.
Dr. Ellie says Anna-Kat is feeding off my anxiety.
She brought up the medication again.
I like how she's not afraid of you.
"So, instead, she taught me a few coping techniques for her."
She can either squeeze a stress ball or sing a song in her head.
"But I don't want to open the door to ""Frozen"" again,"
- so I just gave her the ball.
- Here's an idea... don't let your mother stress you out.
This is not me.
This is all her.
"No matter what the occasion, the attention always has to be on her."
She said she saw them from the skylight.
"Yeah, this would be the Nelsons' apartment right here."
"Yup, here we go."
This is the blood the neighbor was talking about.
Boom.
"So get this, there's no Thursday night business classes at NYU or any of its extension schools."
And there's no Vince Nelson registered with them period.
Nelson was lying to his wife.
He also withdrew 200 bucks from an ATM on the Upper West Side the night he was killed.
Maybe he had something going on the side?
"Confiscate his computer, bank records, credit card statements--"
- I want to know what else he was hiding.
- Done.
What are you working on?
The blood we found on Nelson's roof.
"I thought whoever was up there could've been connected to the case, but it isn't human."
Take a look.
"Cells have nuclei, it looks like some kind of animal."
It's a very large animal with claws and scales.
"The blood comes from an alligator, Mac."
Mr. Potato Head.
The live versision.
More like the bloody dead version.
I used to play Mr. Potato head as a boy.
I would time myself.
See how long it took to assemble him.
Some would say I was obsessed.
"You, obsessed?"
No.
I found this stuck in a patch of dried blood on Nelson's torso.
Looks like some ki of jewelry.
It's an acupressure magnet.
"Oh, man."

"I know, it's shit, man."
HE LAUGHS
Are you taking the piss?
Have you just...?
Because it's his first day.
First day?
Taking the piss?
"Flipping heck, mate, you had, right, so, so it's a joke then, is that it?"
No.
Isn't it?
"Still sacked, I'm afraid, Sid,"
I just thought I'd let Dermot hit the ground running.
"You not only ask the questions, you answer em too, don't you?"
Let me ask you a question.
"Assuming that Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, then I'd never reveal anything he said to me."
"Even Americans, I suppose, find it sometimes desirable to betray a confidence."
Let's get some things straight here.
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.
"I somehow got involved in this very unfortunate incident, and I came here to make a simple statement of fact and not be subjected to a police grilling."
- l would like you -
"- No, you let me finish."
- (Knocking)
- Entrez.
(Both Speaking French)
Wait a minute.
Did he say I was wanted on the telephone?
I'll take that call now.
"- But, sir -"
- You just take it easy.
- Hello.
- (Man) Dr McKenna?
This is Dr McKenna.
Who's this?
If you tell even one word of what Louis Bernard whispered to you your little boy will be in serious danger.
"Remember, say nothing."

Hello?

Drayton?
Didn't you tell me your wife was going to take Hank back to the hotel?
"- l thought so, yes."
- Call her up.
"Somebody just called me, threatened me about Hank."
"Call her up, see if he's alright."
He also buys me birthday gifts.
I'm the one who picks out those birthday gifts.
He has no idea what you even like.
He doesn't care about you at all.
That's not how it is!
Isn't it?
"Dad, he..."
He sends me messages from the States every day!
"Good morning, Mary."
Is the weather in Taipei nice today?
"Mary, I love you."
He writes the same thing every time.
"But the contents of the messages are always the same, right?"
He's just humoring you.
A message like that can just be copied from old ones.
It takes less than a minute to write.
That's not how it is!
"No matter how busy Daddy is, every morning and every night, he writes me an email."
Mary.
"Although every note is pretty much the same, Daddy writes to me every day..."
So what?
Didn't you just say he writes the same thing every day?
A letter like that takes less time than cooking ramen.
"You dare to compare Daddy's letter to ramen, that's too much!"
You say that yourself all the time.
Plus the time here is different from the time in America.
But he still accommodates the times I wake up and go to sleep to write me emails.
He tries really hard!
Isn't that what I frequently say to you?
Maybe those messages aren't even written by your dad.
He could have his assistant write them.
He wouldn't allow other people access to his email!
"Your mother, how can you leave her alone?"
Mother's always been alone.
"Oh, Selena."
I cried all the way to New York and my eyes were the color of the oak leaves that had started to fall back home.
"For days, I struggled to keep alive and I shivered with loneliness in a back room on the fourth floor of nowhere."
"There were times when I wanted to crawl home but somehow I managed, and I stayed."
"I learned what I could endure, but none of us, in New York or in Peyton Place could guess how much would be demanded of us that winter of deep despair."
I knew families at home would be getting up on frosty mornings driving their sons to a place of hurried goodbye.
I prayed for them.
"Fellas, get your last cup of civilian coffee."

- Became the first 4F in town.
"No, he enlisted in the paratroopers."
- Our Norman?
- Norman Page?
"- He volunteered, the paratroopers."
- That's funny.
- Maybe they'll drop his mother.
- She'd kill 1000 Japanese before she'd let one touch her little boy.
Brought you a doughnut.
"Rodney, I'm gonna cry."
"No, you don't."
"Betty, you don't know how glad I am that I married you."
"Rodney, I hope so."
Your father's over there.
Go say goodbye to him.
Go on.
Go say goodbye to him.
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.
"That big, stupid--"
It was my shop!
My office!
Who do you think everyone was looking to for running things?
Me.
Lisa Pedersen.
But I paid Mr.-
- Mr. Somers nothing.
Who else did you tell about those bids?
Who else could have had private dealings with Somers?
I don't understand.
I don't remember.
"Lisa, do you recall correspondence with a certain shoe company in Chicago?"
A company interested in obtaining a large building site?
A company who had written concerning the property occupied by Axel's cabinet shop?
"Oh, that."
I-
- I threw that in the wastebasket.
"Yet that company still expected to obtain the property, just as they'd already obtained the land next to it, the land once slated for Axel's Hospital?"
"Now think hard, Lisa."
Who else did you tell about the bids?
"It must have been a man who dealt with Somers, since he obviously knew what Somers had planned."
"It must have been a man who, on the night of the murder, told Axel where to find Somers."
"Now, it must have been--"
[Lisa] Yes.
"Yes, I told him."
Somers was a crook.
And out-and-out crook.
"Oh, yes, I knew it."
And what he was up to-- everything.
I paid him to tell me.
In return I was to have an option on the property he never intended to use anyway.
The alternative seems more painful than being shot.
In principle I try to live as a witness-protection program.

It's a little hard to explain to a child -
- Why one should go by train one day and by bus the next -
- Or by subway or car.
"Man has always checked the car, before starting it."
A child found it's fun at first -
"- But when you do it every day, they begin to consider why."
"Had I known it would end like this here, I would have never made it."
"To be honest, I was I probably quite naive and young and stupid -"
- For the price I pay is   incredibly high.

Entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
Sometime during the Clinton administration Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy and all it's gonna cost you is 80 thousand and one pound of your finest meth."
"Eighty thousand dollars for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'll represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
Fifty goes to me.

So in the space of months the fans got the entire planet  to support One Direction.
You sing!

So the whole world are fans of One Direction.
And we haven't put a record out yet.

here's not much of a track record  of any British boy bands breaking in America.

hey've gone straight to the number one spot.

Best British single.
It's One Direction.
Lik e it just  took itself off and took our career off too.
It just went:
hank you so much.
Yes they're all good-looking guys.
"Yes, they can all sing really well."
But combine that  with the style  of music they were making  which was rock-influenced so they had lik e a little edge to it.

Can I say one thing?
- Say four things
It'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?
"Ever since she was a baby, she has known that she is engaged to Kuljit"
That she knows.
But20 years...
- Don't you worry!
Simran is going to be so happy... you'll pray that she never gets the evil eye!

Main Stage too.
Main Stage?
"Oh, I'm honored."
And please know that whatever additional responsibilities you might find necessary on my part to keep your empire running...
are welcome.
Just give the word.
"Easy, Mussolini, just keep the trains running."
- [Cassie] Hi.
- [knocks on the door]
"[Goldie] Hey, honey."
Can I talk to you alone?
"Yeah, Arnie was just leaving."
"Oh, yeah, right."
"I'll go and, uh,"
I just gotta set the lineup for the Main Stage.
[scoffs] [clears throat]
"I know it's probably not my place to say anything, um, but have you read the sketches?"
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, 'cause I'm worried that the Little Bo Peep one might be kinda..."
lame.
It's not lame.
"It's fucking horrible, goddamn offensive."
Ohh.
I thought I just didn't get it.
"[laughs] Ho, ho, the writers don't get it."
"I mean, it's two guys never been laid writing their idea of what a woman might say."
"If you told them your twat was horizontal, they wouldn't argue."
"Okay, because I was thinking, maybe we could change it to ""The Little Bo Peep Show,"" and men show up thinking it's gonna be this sexy peep show, but instead, the girl behind the glass is wearing"
"this ridiculous dress, not showing any skin, because she wants to be taken seriously as an actress, doing her one-woman show about her wayward sheep."
[laughs]
Why don't you take a swing at rewriting it?
Really?
"How could I forget that you're going out... with the ""cover girl""?"
Everyone else is orgasmic... that you're going out with her.
"- Good, because I just wanted to..."
"- Don't worry about it, Paul."
- It's good to keep things open.
- That's what I...
Here.
There are many more where these came from.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was just wrapping this up... so I can go to Carl's photo book party.
"I'll send Carls your best, because you're not going."
You have a very important project to do.
Have you noticed people's desks lately?
Atrocities!
I haven't seen so many colors... since Todd Oldham's debut collection.
It's all about black.
"What it this bullshit, anyway?"
This is not Lucky Charm cereal.
"This is not ""Oz""."
"This is not ""Skills""."
I want you to replace each and every one... of these hideous five-a-dime acessories immediately.
Everybody's desks should be in ship-shape by tomorrow morning.
Philip's just messengered over his new line of desk acessories.
"From now on, everything should be black."
Those bitches... they all said:
"""Brown is the new black""."
"I got news for you, baby:"
Black... could kick brown's ass.
"Jocelyn, what are you doing working so late?"
I'm making the bulletin boards clash-proof.
God forbid we have a stray yellow damn tag!
- I'm so sorry!
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engaged to Jimmy, too?"
"'Cause if that's true, he better hope he's dead, or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connected on a deep, spiritual level."
"From then on, any time he was in town, he was with me."
How often did you see him?
He would come and go a lot.
But I understood.
That's how it is with Special Ops.
Lance Corporal Finn's record does not indicate he was involved with Special Operations.
He said his missions were top secret.
"He wanted to tell me more, but he didn't want to put me in danger."
When'd you last see Lance Corporal Finn?
Six months ago.
Before he left for Iraq.
How'd you meet?
At a bar.
Two years ago.
"I was there with some girlfriends, and when I got up to go to the ladies' room, he blocked my path, said he couldn't keep his eyes off me."
And that worked?
"What worked  is that when we talked,  he had something to say."
"Most guys won't shut up about their online war games, but this guy, he had seen real action."
"And I was  feeling patriotic that night,  so I invited him to come home with me."
The sex was fantastic.
When did you two get engaged?
About a week before he left.
"James wanted to borrow $30,000."
Did he tell you what the money was for?
Gambling debts.
"And if he didn't pay, they were gonna hurt him."
Who?
-They haven't had the time to replace it!
- Really!
Samsonov!
Mayor Samsonov reporting.
Replace it!
-Quickly!
"-Yes, sir!"
-He is about to replace it.
- Have a smoke.
-What is there on your mind?
- Thanks.
-Tell me.
"- First, we witness all distinctive signs of a trap."
"And ifthere is a mousetrap, there is a wayto deceive it."
There is no better place forthat than this hill.
I've already heard that.
"Second, my scouts took a prisoner who clearlyfed us false data."
Why?
He knewthat we'd check it and find out that the hill seems not to represent any imminent danger.
What ifthe Germans knew about the exact time ofthe offensive and were going to covertly pull their shock troops out to the hill bythe time it begins?
The front intelligence units reported that somewhere here deep in the German defence... there were mobile reserve tank units.
"The Germans are not so strong as they used to be in 1941, so they gather all theirforces into one fist."
How much time do you think they need to get to Hill 89?
"Well, ifthe road is good, it'll take them not more than two hours."
"OK, tomorrowwe are going tojump into this boiler."
May I come in?
"- Oh, it is you finally, Ivan Semenovich."
Come in.
"The oven is fuming all the time, it is really hard to breathe. I do not knowwhat to do."
Can you help us?
It is a nightmare.
-Can you see that?
"So on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a black mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."
I don't know anyone who fits that description.
Ah.
Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
-Is that a threat?
"-No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Hey, Father, wait a minute."
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, though, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
-That's too bad.
"-Yeah, I hate to go alone."
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
-Who's in it?
-Who's in it?
"Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx."
Perhaps we could have a duel.
"That's a good idea, I think."
"If Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Enright have a duel, one of them dies... sorted."
Mrs. Rogers takes to her bed.
She's waiting for an apology.
Underneath the trees...
Captain Glover has planned an afternoon to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar with a nautical picnic of salt pork washed down with rum and fresh lime.
"I'm going to introduce you to a distant relative of mine,"
Captain Blackwood... and there's the gentleman himself.
"He looks like you, actually."
You see the curly hair there.
I can really see the resemblance.
Look to your left.
Yes...
Needs a shave.
"My hair isn't quite that gray yet, but I'm working on it."
I have a letter here from Admiral Nelson to Captain Blackwood giving instructions to keep an eye on the fleet.
"So, as I pass that round, I'll read out actually..."
That's the genuine letter.
No way.
So I'll pass this round.
That's the real thing.
"It goes, ""To Captain, the Honorable Henry Blackwood,"
"""HM Ship Aureleus."
"""From the Victory, October 9, 1805, AM"
"""Cadiz due east, 19 leagues."
"""My dear sir, many thanks for your letter of yesterday."
"Let us have them out."""
"""In short, watch all points and all winds and weathers,"
"Be assured I am ever and always yours, Nelson and Bronte."""
Wow!
"At the house, Mrs. Rogers finally receives an apology from Mrs. Enright."
Everything's going to be fine.
"- I don't want you to worry, sweetie."
- I'm not.
- Because it's not going to be like it was with your father.
I'm going to hold this family together.
- Fine.
"Marissa, listen to me."
"I know that there's a lot of uncertainty in our lives right now, but I want you to believe me when I say that Caleb is not going to jail."
"Oh, well, that's a shame, 'cause if Caleb did go to jail, then you'd be out on the street, and I could go back to living with Dad."
- So should we maybe exchange numbers or something?
- For what?
To work on our lab report.
"Oh, uh... no, I already turned it in."
"Don't worry, I put both our names on it."
"You'll get an ""A."""
"- Funny, I thought we were supposed to..."
"- Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing."
"The only reason why I transferred to Harbor was so I could load up on A.P. courses, get accepted into Yale early and never have to look at another cheerleader or water polo player ever again."
- No offense.
"- Okay, I think you got the wrong idea about me."
You think I'm stupid.
"God doesn't give with both hands, so..."
"take the ""A."" Enjoy it."
It's my treat.
- Uh-huh.
- Where are you going?
- Mr. Greenberg?
- Yes?
"That lab report Lindsay handed in, I'm afraid I'm not quite finished with it yet."
"Well, it looks perfect to me."
- Nice work.
You guys make a great team.
May all welfare come to you.
Did you see any pregnant lady running from here.
"""l did'nt see anyone, King"""
"""Where had you gone, swami?"""
"""T o Uma"
"- But I am Uma, you have come to me only now."""
That widow's name is also Uma.
She is bringing up the two boys..
"""...with great love."
"You should help her, Parvati."""
"""Mother will surely help, but what is the their future, Lord"""
Sometimes you talk in such a way that I feel you are mad.
"""What is my mistake, Lord?"
"-lgnorance can cause mistakes."""
Now only you said Mother Parvati will help in the...
"""...upbringing of those boys, then immediately you ask their future."""
"""When Parvati is going to help them, how will their future be?"""
"""Lord, I have been caught in my own web of words."""
"""Always you trouble others, Narad."
"You just understand that..."""
...those two boys will always get the mercy of both of us.
They will cross all hurdles and come up in life.
Their mother will also attain fame  get peace due to them.
"""This is enough, Lord."
"Both of you are venerable"""
"""Come Suchivar, come"""
Long live!
"""Bless my son, Sage"""
This is not your son.-But I have only brought him up.
I know and also that Shiv's mercy is there on Satyavrt's son
"""That is why, Shiv came in the form of Trishwar to protect him"""
And has handed over the work of bringing him up to you

- Figure it out.
"- Yeah, figures it out."
Don't you tell me to figure it out.
Yous are the ones should figure it out.
"All you have to do is sit down with a matchmaker, answer a few questions, and then she sets you up on three dates with girls that she thinks you'll jive with."
Has anyone heard from Jivin' Pete lately?
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"No, Jivin' Pete's one nut got all swole up..."
I don't give a shit about Jivin' Pete's one nut.
"No, no, this is a story about Jivin' Pete's other nut."
"Yeah, Jivin' Pete's had himself a botched vasectomy a little while back, so now his one nut's there all swole up bigger than the first nut that was all swole up."
If you can believes that nonsense.
Was Jivin' showin' it to people again?
"Oh, he's showin' it to people."
I seen it.
"- You seen it, Dary?"
"- Oh, I seen it."
"- Yeah, I never seen it."
- It looks like a rambutan.
"Which is to say, this hairy fruit."
"So, not smooth like a persimmon?"
DAN:
"No, although it is about the size of a persimmons."
"Which, of course, is much like a tomatoes."
"What sort of potent peace pipe was some prick pulling off when he titled tomatoes ""fruits""?"
Well...
"Now both Jivin' Pete's nuts have a story, which I hope guarantees that I'll never have to listen to another story about Jivin' Pete's nuts."
- He's a good guy.
- He's a real good guy.
"- No, he's a great guy."
- Wayne.
You're looking for love.
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the I-got-caught-cheating diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
It's a family heirloom.
"Yeah, I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half-sister over Christmas, so I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully... that she can suck it."
Okay.
I got to bounce.
Stop saying that.
This DJ from Dubai is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
"I was still young, and I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me would be a total disaster."
She's like an entirely different species.
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
"Wow, my phone has a clock."
And they subsist on a diet of pointlessly weird combinations.
Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber jalapeño egg cream."
Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
What is she thinking?
"What are you laughing about, Lola?"
"Based on the script, Lola should now say..."
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and I accidentally laughed.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and couldn't help laughing.
That line is exactly what's in the script...
But the tone is completely different.
This jie jie is different from the script.
She's not gentle at all.
I'm sorry.
Such a murderous aura.
"The dialogue didn't change, but the mood is completely different."
She has totally overturned the character's personality concept.
Gong Xi jie is amazing.
"Next, in the script, Lola gently says,"
"""Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say... """
"Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say, you already know the answer in your heart."
"Then Lola will gently say,"
"""Daddy is human too. """
"""Sometimes he's irrational. """
Daddy is human too.
Sometimes he is irrational and unintentionally says hurtful things.
"Angel, you ought to know that parents don't resent their children."
"Angel, you ought to know that parents... do resent their children."
She changed the dialogue.
What is she doing?
Jie Jie is supposed to make Mei Mei realize that their dad loves her.
But why would Betty wanna kill Kentucky?
Maybe she didn't kill Kentucky.
Woolsey handpicked Kentucky to be the new face of Betty's Bees and then she betrayed him.
"Yep, she sabotaged his company and stole his bees."
She played him like Boo Boo the fool.
Boo Boo had it coming.
Woolsey tells me I'm too old and slaps my name on an inferior product.
"Did you know there's now 60 percent less honey in all Betty's Bees honey-based products, including honey?"
"He wants the company, have it, but I'll be damned if he can have my bees."
"Hello, Kitty."
And you.
You're not a temp.
Who are you people?
We're investigators hired by Kentucky's husband to find her killer.
There is no killer.
That's what the police told me.
Can't prosecute a swarm of bees for murder.
You can prosecute Woolsey Nicholls.
I loved Kentucky like a sister.
But if I told the police Woolsey killed her because we sabotaged his company I would go to jail longer than Woolsey would for murder.
Jail might be a safer place.
I was attacked in your office by a swarm of bees.
- I think those were meant for you.
If you loved Kentucky tell the police.
You can't let Woolsey get away.
Woolsey is gonna get away with murder.
Unless you can pull his DNA off those bees.
Oh.
"Please, don't get up."
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Emerson Cod.
I'd like to ask you questions about the murder of Kentucky Fitz.
And she doesn't let him get away with anything.
She was his wife when he met her.
They're the blue stabilizers.
Ugh!
See?
"Yeah, well, it's just boring now, isn't it?"
They're boringers.
They're blue...
Boringers.
"Doctor, how come she can fly the TARDIS?"
You call that flying the TARDIS?
Ha!
"River Song is better at operating the TARDIS than the Doctor is and, for the first time, you see the Doctor actually being quite put out by that."
Charted the ship to its destination and...
Parked us right alongside.
"""Parked"" us?"
You haven't landed.
Of course we've landed.
I just landed her.
But...
It didn't make the noise.
What noise?
"You know, the --"
It's not supposed to make that noise -- you leave the brakes on.
"Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise."
I love that noise.
"I like that the classic noise that we all associate with the TARDIS, the fact that my ringtone is that noise, turns out that it's a mistake."
I imagine that that was just a nice little Steven Moffat gem for people who have watched the show for so long.
[ Wheeze
"What's great about river is that she's this mysterious character and, generally, when the mystery is taken away from a character, they become less interesting."
River becomes more interesting.
"A lovely twist is when River Song is about to be shot by Amy Pond and, suddenly, River Song says,"
Which firm have you decided to join?
All three offers are equally good

"Jai, just do it"
What's all this?
Nothing much
"Just my stuff, my stock of mineral water, juices"
"My exercise kit, etc."
Mamma sent it
Did you have to get it from your Mummy?
We would've bought it for you
"I guess, that's a mother's love."
Like when Jai was in America... his mother would send over...
what do you call those... those sweet gramflour-balls and the mango pickle
So my Ma sent me this stuff
Careful.
Juice cartons on the right

"Sorry, I had to change my dress"
"Rice, please."

"Uh, sure."
Do what you want don't have restraint.
Don't stress about it or you just might faint
You gotta do what you wanna do

"Hey, guys!"
Huh?
Where'd everybody go?
The girls all wanted to go watch that Bridon kid practice basketball.
But the girls like singing and dancing.
"No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does."
"But...no, we just-- no, no, wait!"

Look at Kenny's lunch.
"I keep refreshing and refreshing to see if they put up the new video yet, but they keep not putting it up, and it's very frustrating."
They'll put it up soon.
They're just trying to build suspense.
"Hey, I brought you a present."
"The person who made it loves her little boy very much, and she put that love into every stitch."
"So when you wear it, maybe you'll feel the love, too."
You want to try it on?
"- Thanks, Uncle Nico."
- Come here.
"Sweetheart, love ya."
I came to tell you I'm sorry about your teacher.
Someone can be a good person and a bad person all at the same time.
"They have to know that everybody in the world is waiting, so why don't they just put it up already?"
"It's very, very, very, very frustrating."
"How's she gonna feel when her daddy's gone, too?"
You have to help him.
"Mom, I think it's gonna go better this time."
Which time?
What are you talking about?

"I didn't want to tell you this, because I was afraid you'd get angry, but..."
I have to.
You know how they never found Susanna's scarf?
Burned up in the fire.
No.
I saw it... two days ago.
- Mom...
- The D.A.'s little girl was waving it out her window like it was aa toy.
"Okay, Mom, one, there's more than one yellow scarf in the world."
"Two, why would the D.A. give his kid 10yearold evidence to play with?"
"And, three... the really big three... you can't stalk the District Attorney's family."
It was Susanna's scarf.
"Oh, don't get sensitive."
Y'all act like I said Flavor Flav.
Don't get sensitive.
Don't give a damn what R. Kelly did.
He makes good music.
"He makes stepping' songs, baby."
And stepping' songs means something to everybody up in here.
"Steppin' songs be the jump-off to cookouts, don't they?"
Don't they?
Don't they?
"Ma'am, you be at a cookout."
Let The Electric Slide come on.
You will drop your potato salad right there.
That's what you'll do.
"Hey, folks, there's a song that has been out for years."
It's called the Cha-Cha Slide.
"Now you let that song come on anywhere, let that song come on when my family's at a funeral."
"Well, guess what, if we carrying the casket, we dropping it right damn there."
That's what's gonna happen.
"Let the music play long enough, the corpse start dancing."
"Corpse come out of the casket, ""Whoo, Charlie Brown,"" he be--"
"Everybody at the funeral, ""Aah!"""
I make that noise when I get excited.
"Like, look, if I'm getting a haircut, and it look really good,"
"I look at myself in the mirror and I be like,"
"""Oh, look at that boy."
That boy fresh.
"Look at that boy, that boy!"""
"Now if they cut me up to back too far, and have a cul-de-sac on top of my shit, have me looking like Stephen A. Smith, well, I'll go right into it, I be..."

"I've gone on two dates in the last six months, both with women I met over the internet."
"And, hey, no one wants to see me again because no one wants to date the short guy."

I wanted them so bad.
It's 2 inches.

"5'5"" you can say out loud."
"Okay, I made a list of the best pediatric GIs in the country."
"I figure, between the two of us, we can get one of these guys to come down and do a tips procedure on him."
Doing a tips on a kid who needs a new liver?
- Yeah.
- That--that's like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound.
"- Well, you have a better idea?"
- I do.
Waiting for UNOS.
Trusting the process.
W-why can't you do that?
Because I'm tired of waiting while this kid is getting worse.
Jackson's tired.
"His mother is, too."
The only one who's happy to sit on her ass and twiddle her thumbs and wait is you!
Whoa.
I have been patient with you.
I have been nice.

Constantly telling me how to do my job.
"- Okay, somebody has to--"
- I've got 20 other kids in this hospital.

"Look, someone's behind all this pulling the strings and I want to know who it is."
"Ronan Murphy, the suspect killed by Danny Waldron, what do you know about him?"
- Nothing.
"- They had history, Danny and him."
That's news to me.
Danny shot Murphy and was going after Murphy's associates.
They were the ones that wanted Danny dead.
The job you did for them.
I didn't know Murphy.
I didn't know his associates.
- I don't know why they wanted Danny dead.
"- Look, who's behind this?"
What was Danny on to that meant you had to kill him?
You've nothing further to say?
You've offered nothing new in this interview to mitigate you being charged with the following offences.
I therefore have the authority...
"- Well, we got the bastard."
- Yeah.
They should throw away the key.
.. of PC Roderick Kennedy.
"Two, the murder of PS Daniel Waldron and, three, the attempted murder of DI Matthew Cottan."
"Now, do you understand?"
I've been doing more work on the Ronan Murphy file.
"There's a small entry, blink and you'd miss it, that he was interviewed by Murder Squad in relation to unsolved gangland murders, but there's no details of the offences he was being linked to."
Can't help you.
How many times are we going to go over this?
Lindsay lied in court to con the jury.
"a boy, 8 years old, and a young girl of 5."
Seems the farmer was more concerned with the hardship of replacing them than the welfare of the children.
"These Home Children, they were orphan workers, sent there as cheap labour."
They were often very mistreated.
"Whatever the reason they may have left, these could be the two children Mr. de Jaager saw in the woods."
"The girl could be Fen, sir."
"The timeline matches, this is 13 years ago."
It says the boy was mute.
"Sir, that's probably why the wolves caught him."
The poor thing couldn't cry out to scare them away.
"Wolves are like that, sir, they'll go for the weakest of the bunch."
Perhaps she tried to save him and almost got herself mauled to death.
"If I'm needed, I'll be at the Asylum."
- Check into that detail.
- Julia.
I believe I've discovered the origin of Fen's gestures.
- You have?
- She ran away with a boy who was mute.
- Pardon?
"- Right, uh, sorry."
George found a report of two Home Children who ran away in roughly the area where Hugo de Jaager says he spotted two feral children.
They would have been about 8 and 5 at the time.
Wasn't the boy 11 when he was killed by wolves?
"Yes, and Mr. Travis figures that Fen was about 8 when he found her."
The two of them survived all that time alone.
Perhaps they developed this language to communicate with each other.
"That's extraordinary, William."
- (Fen grunting)
- Fen?
Fen.
This man.
Man...
Corneal tissue samples from the eyes of each victim.
Mr. Brewer's on the left and Mrs. Brewer's on the right.
Mrs. Brewer's has many more macrophages.
That's right.
It's a natural immunological response to a foreign substance.
Huh.
The white blood cells in Mr. Brewer's sample are completely normal.
Plain English--his eyes didn't react to the glue.
Plainer English-- he was already dead when it happened.
Garcia's not coming up with much.
The Brewer family was well-liked.
No known enemies.
What about registered sex offenders in the area?
There's over a thousand in Wichita alone.
Garcia's checking them out.
Agent Hotchner.
The body of a young boy was just found.
Where?
"Prairie Creek Road, a few miles from the crime scene."
The description matches Ronnie Brewer.
"The child's body has not yet been identified, but there is growing fear that it could be Ronnie Brewer, the boy missing from the attack here in Wichita last night."
Stay tuned--
"Hey, Hotch, we're done here."
It's definitely Ronnie.
I recognize him from the family photos.
Body temperature and state of rigor indicates that he's been dead 7 to 8 hours.
So he must have been killed immediately after the abduction.
It doesn't make sense.
All the effort put into taking him.
"Well, maybe the compulsion is about the pursuit of the child rather than the child itself."
"Well, if that's the case, he's gonna try again soon, with someone else."
Josie!
Of course I will.
Absolutely.
It's gonna seem so weird here without her.
And the house is gonna be so empty.
-The dishwasher's just....
-It's okay.
"So how are you faring, Julie?"
"You know you've got to try and be strong, for your dad's sake because he's a right wreck down there, I tell you."
"What am I gonna do, Auntie Alice?"
I'm gonna have to kill myself.
I was already gonna have to kill myself before after I got dumped by this boy at school.
-Before all this happened.
"-Oh, God."
"So, now you've got to kill yourself twice."
"Listen, a great girl like you, there'll be loads of other boyfriends."
"Yeah, except I'll never get another one now, will I?"
-Why ever not?
-Because...
I'm different to all the other girls.
I don't talk like them.
"'Cause they're all like, ""Hey, I'm so cool,"" and ""That's so not true."""
"And ""She was like, 'Hey' and I was like, 'Chill'."""
"And ""fess up"" and ""don't diss me""."
"I mean, why can't they speak properly, you know?"
"I mean, Mum was always teaching me how important it was to... express yourself clearly and intelligently if you want to get anywhere in life."
"Of course, she's serving a jail sentence now for embezzlement, but...."
"I'm sorry I just can't say all those things which, of course, makes me totally weird."
I don't think you're weird.
I think the fact you're a bit different from them and want to think for yourself is wonderful.
"Always remember, ""A cliché is the handrail of a crippled mind."""

"Mr. Feeny, shouldn't you break them up or hose them down or something?"

Okay.
"Look, Addison Wells found out who you really were, and then all of a sudden she-she ends up missing."
H-How do you explain that?
"Now, look, I admit that I misrepresented myself to Addison, but I had nothing to do with her disappearance."
It was all just a fantasy.
I never planned on acting on it.
Chin showed Mintz's photo to the Hillers.
They don't seem to think he's our guy.
"I'm not surprised, look at this."
"Mintz was perving on at least a dozen other women, and he was actually at this terminal chatting one of them up last night."
He logged off around 11:00 p.m.
Okay.
There's no way he could've been in Kahala at the time of the abduction.

Any straight-up New Yorkers here right now?
"Yo, you can always tell when somebody's from New York, because when you get in an altercation with them, they'll let you know... what city they came from, what borough they were raised in,"
and at least one thing that happened to them when they was little that qualifies for them whupping your ass in a situation.
"Like my mom, for instance."
"If you would ever get in a verbal fight with my mom, it would never get to fists 'cause she'd fucking, you know, verbally--we--pfft!"
You know fucking New Yorkers.
"They fucking--they'll fuck you up, you know what I'm saying?"
"My mom be just like this here, ""Unh-uh, I'm from Brooklyn."
"""I'm from do-or-die Bed-Stuy Brooklyn."
"""Do not play with me, okay?"
"""There was 40 roaches in my house."

And this lady caught herself taking my mother's pump.
But my mother wasn't having that.
She told me and my sister to get out the car 'cause she was gonna discipline this lady right on spot.
"I said, ""You gonna discipline her right on spot?"""
"She said, ""Mm-hmm."""
"I said, ""Worse than you did when you hit me"""

"She was like, ""Much worse."""

She walks up to the lady.

Why?
I think your wife needs some help.
"Believe me, I've tried to talk her into getting a nanny, but she doesn't want another woman raising her daughter."
It makes her feel like she's less of a mother or something.
I don't mean that kind of help.

What?
"Brad, why don'twe sit down."
"It's not uncommon for new moms to get overwhelmed with all challenges of child care, specially the 1st year."
So why are you making a big deal out of this?
"Usually, it's short-lived and goes away after the baby falls into a routine and the mom's hormones stabilize."
"But occasionally, it lasts longer, becomes more severe, and develops into something called postpartum depression."
"Yeah, yeah, but that's not Judy."
"Judy's not depressed, not like that."
"I mean, sure, she's anxious to get back to work, a little down about that, but that's normal."

No one in this family ever forgets that
So no one gave you a chance to forget?
How about me giving you one chance?
"""Queen, today is the happiest day of our life."
"I have cut the..."""
...head of my lifelong enemy with these hands of mine.
"""T oday, you are very happy."
"-My enemy had not allowed..."""
...me to sleep at all.
The thorn of my life has gone and today I will be able to sleep peacefully.
Sleep was not in King Satyavrath's fate as he insulted Lord Shiv by leaving his prayer in between.
The queen had also supported him in this sin of her husband.
Time passed.
Queen became pregnant and in her last stage...
"""...of pregnancy told the king, her wish to go to the forest."""
But she was not aware that insult of Lord Shiv will come as their death on the way.
"""Satyarath, where is happiness in the life of you  your queen."""
"""Kethudwaj's this son Vishdwaj, will destroy your whole race"""
"""You killed my father, and his son will give you death penalty."""
"""The pain you gave me, will be returned to you as my revenge"""
Vidarbha king Satyavrat is going with his wife in this path.
"""Come Satyavrat, your misfortune and my fortune are crossing."""
"""Swami, Vidarbha's prince is going to be born very soon."""
Start preparations for welcoming him
"""That is done, queen."
"I will celebrate his birth more..."""
...grandly than the death of my enemy.
Get down Satyavrath.
I will behead you and avenge my father's death  then only his soul will rest in peace.
I need my revenge.
Forgive me Vrishdwaj
"""Forgive me, king"""
Forgive me Vishdwaj
"""Not forgivance, but revenge"""
Where is Surtha?
Axel Norstaad got so angry that he smashed a chair and threatened Martin Somers.
Did the defendant say anything to you about this occurrence?
"No, but I could tell he was awfully upset."
Would you tell us what he said or did?
Yes.
"I was sure that Axel had seen Mr. Somers in Long Beach, so I wanted to hear how he'd made out."
And how were you able to tell that he was awfully upset?
Axel loves animals.
He's always feeding stray cats and dogs at the shop.
"Well, this favorite cat was meowing to come in."
Axel picked up a coffee cup from the desk and threw it.
"Mr. Pedersen, why were you so anxious to learn the results of Axel's meeting with Mr. Somers?"
"Well, like I said, the Cabinet Shop had been my best account, and now Somers was cutting me off from it."
Did this come at a particularly inopportune time for you?
"Yes, I'd fixed up my lumberyard."
Fixed it up?
In what way?
"New sheds, boosted my inventory of hardwoods, and...things like that."
Thank you.
That'll be all.
"Now, when Mr. Somers called you the afternoon of the murder and you went to see him, Mr. Reed, was anything said about the defendant?"
S-Somers called him a wild man.
He-
- He said he'd going to tame him if it was the last thing he did.
"What explanation, if any, did he give for calling you in and telling you this?"
Said he wanted my help.
What kind of help?
Through my former wife Edie--
Edith Morrow.
He had an idea that... she could wrap him around her-- the old guy around her little finger.
"- Objection, Your Honor."
- Sustained.
There's no ice
Tomorrow we're buying a refrigerator
"With the best freezer, fuck"
"Stop it, you're getting him drunk"
"Take it, you go first"

Forever friends

Is it true you have never been at the sea?
"No, never but he's taking me there"
When you get out of the water and lay on the sand
You can easily die
That's better than anything
"But better than this, no way"
"Hey, have you started with the same music again?"
He's such an annoying guy
Put a little more don't be greedy
"Well, if something goes wrong don't blame me"
"Come on Angela, let's dance"
Let me see you dance
What's happening to you?
Nothing
- So?
I killed him
- Who?
"Yes, I killed him"
No way You haven't killed anybody
Mr. Helms.
"Arrange for some coffee, willyou, General Cushman?"
"Gentlemen, please."
Bob Cushman is a lieutenant general in the marine corps.
Deputy director ofthe C.I.A.
Is this whatyou use him for?
"I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President."
You did.
You live prettywell out here.
Now I understand why you want to keep your budgets classified.
I suppose you're unhappy... because I haven't implemented your domestic intelligence plan.
"Yeah, you're correct."
"I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whetherthey know it or not."
The F.B.I. Is useless in this area.
I wantyourfull attention on this matter.
"Ofcourse, we've tried, butso farwe've come up with nothing."
"Then, find something."
And I want these leaks stopped.
"Jack Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department."
I wanna knowwho's talking to them.
"I'm sure you realize, Mr. President, thatthis is a very tricky area, given our charter and the Congressional oversight Committee."
"Oh, screw Congressional oversight."
"I know, going back to the '50s, this agency reports what itwants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know."
"Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?"
Yes.
It involves some old and forgotten papers.
"Uh, things I signed as vice president."
"I wantthe originals in my office, and I don'twantcopies anywhere else."
"You're referring, I believe, to chairing the Special operations Group..."
- as vice president.
- Yeah.
"As you know, thatwas unique."
"Coach used to always say this -- ""I prepared you for this."
"Now, just go out and have fun and let it happen."""
"In all honesty, I just went out and let it happen."

"You know, everybody's running around, hugging everybody, and I hugged coach Smith, and I said,"
"""I'm just so happy for you, just to shut those people up,"""
and he made a statement that I've never forgotten.
"He said ""you know, I'm not really that much a better coach than I was 2.5 hours ago."""
Someone who deserved something so much finally got what he deserved.
"There was no doubt that with or without the championship, he was a great coach, but you need to have those accolades to go along with it."
"For Dean Smith, it was a championship 21 years in the making."
"For legendary north Carolina photographer Hugh Morton, it only took an instant to make one memorable photograph."

It is normal to be angry for being a captive

She's waiting to be rescued
Robert comes to wake me up.
"He says, ""Hey, Ray's home, Ray's home."""
"Well, I'm in bed asleep."
This is about 10 o'clock at night.
"My oldest son came in and woke me up, said, ""Robert's outside"""
"""with Ray,"" which was our neighbour."
Robert was only 15 at that time.
"So when I got up, I go outside to check this dude."
And my dad was struggling then.
"Time I get over there, I've pulled him up off my dad and me and Ray started going at it."
He gets up on top of me.
"My dad, he's coming round the trailer and everything to pull him up off of me."
"But as he pulls him up off of me, stabbing him."
"I don't know where the knife came from, you know."
But my dad had a knife.
It was a steak knife that was laying on the counter.
"When I come out of the house,"
I picked it up and stuck it in my back pocket.
For self-defence!
Ray Yarborough died from multiple stab wounds.
Sam Pruett was sentenced to life in prison for the killing.
Steven Pruett got 40 years.
Robert had turned 16 by the time the case came to trial.
He was sentenced as an adult and given 99 years.
"When somebody's already in prison for murder, it kind of makes your mitigation investigation a bit more difficult, cos you have to counter that."
And it makes it easier for the state to prove their case.
"You know, they think, ""He's killed someone before"","
"""then he definitely deserves the death penalty now."""
So it just makes it harder at every stage.
All of the mitigation evidence has been sent to Professor Dow.
It's time for his verdict.
"I would say that the evidence in Pruett's case was some of the most compelling, strongest evidence that I've seen in more than 20 years of doing this."
You're doing a magnificent job.
"Of course, I accept."
I'm flattered.
And I wantyou to knowthat I serve only one presidentata time.
Yes.
And you will give General Cushman full access.
"[Sighs] Itcould take a little time, but I will order a search foryour papers."
- Good.
- But it does raise a troubling issue.
- What?
- Castro.
Yes?
We have recent intelligence thata Soviet nuclear submarine... has docked at Cienfuegos.
"Well, we'll launch a formal protest."
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.
Mr. Kennedy gave the Russians a verbal promise... that he would not invade Cuba.
Did you authorize Dr. Kissinger to putthis in writing?
Are you tapping Kissinger?
My job...
unpleasantattimes... is to knowwhatothers don'twantme to know.
"Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't."
It is notmy practice to spy on the president.
Dr. Kissingermanages to convey his innermostsecrets withoutmy help.
"Dick, we've lived with Communism in Cuba forten years."
"But it has never been the policy ofthis governmentto acceptthat, and it is certainly not C.I.A. Policy."
C.I.A. Policy?
The C.I.A. Has no policy exceptwhat I dictate to you.
"I tried to, uh, adjust to the world as it is today, notas you or I wanted it to be ten years ago."
Is thatwhy you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
"This is a very dangerous direction, Mr. President."
Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors of judgment.
"But ifwe were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can... we could create a balance of power... thatwould secure the peace into the nextcentury."
He said that I paid him three million won a week?
It wasn't three million won per week.
It was three million won per month.
Please think about it.
In that raggedy office... we have three employees.
Do I look insane to you?
How could I give him three million won a week?
The rest of the money must be from...
Baek Shi Yoon.
You probably knew it from the start.
Im Tae Ho's obsession with money.
Why would I take money from Baek Shi Yoon for no reason?
"I was paid in cash, so there's no evidence, which is why he's able to lie."
He uses psychological warfare to appeal to the emotion inside all of you.
That's the kind of work Baek Shi Yoon always did with the agency.
He probably did the same to Im Tae Ho.
Park Seon Woo asked me to bring Lawyer Jo's computer out of the station.
"Park Seon Woo came to the police station, and with the equipment in his trunk he erased all of the data on the hard drives."
"So I went all the way to the police station, with my specialized equipment and erased the hard drives?"
"If it were you, Mr. President... would you be able to do something like that in front of the station doors?"
Shi Yoon... just wanted to know the truth about the mission from three years ago.
And I'm sure there were some people who didn't want the truth to be leaked.
The Baek Shi Yoon of three years ago caused a lot of harm.
He caused the death of his own colleague.
Baek Shi Yoon would want that truth to be covered up forever.
"So, then..."
Who is the murderer?
"If you give me some time, I promise you that I will find out."
"Thinking about it, putting all of the pieces together..."
I wonder if Im Tae Ho is the murderer.
"Okay, then."
We have two very contradictory statements...
"Mr Aouny, the stairs should only be washed at night... when there are very few people going up and down"
"OK, are you going to chat with me?"
- Dry up a spot for us to walk on
"- At your service, Pasha"
Out of the way
"Did you finish high school, Taha?"
- Yes
- What college will you apply to?
"Thank God, my average can get me into a respectable college but I applied to the police academy"
"You want to become a police officer, Taha?"
Put the mat back in front of the door after you're done
"- Good night, Buthaina"
"- You, too, uncle Hamed"
- Don't leave the TV on
- Don't worry
"What is it, man?"
I've already gone to sleep
"You can get up, woman"
"I will pray to God, God the greatest..."
"No, I've done it before"
"- What is it, Khamees?"
- This is not the place to talk
Isn't it late enough?
Or are you waiting for the loved one?
- Don't you have work early?
- I quit
- When?
- Today
Why did you quit?
- I want to watch the movie now
- What damned movie?
Am I destined to live in anguish day and night?
"I would, like, make up stories as to what I thought she was saying."
"Like, I imagined if I asked her, like, ""Mom, what do you mean when you say memories,"""
"she'd say something like,"
"""Well, Sasheer, when I was 11 years old,"
"""I went to the public library in Little Rock, Arkansas."
"""And I was buy myself,"
"""and this old white man came up to me"
"""and put his hand on my shoulder."
"""And something about his hand on my shoulder"
"""and me holding the book"
"""sucked us into the world of the book."
"""And we landed in this magical forest"
"""where the trees could talk to us"
"""and the dirt tasted like licorice."
"""Now, we didn't know where we were,"
"""so we split up to find help,"
"""and the old white man went one way,"
"""and I went another way,"
"""and I found this cave."
"""And inside the cave was this big, beautiful dragon"
"""with a purple tail and glittery wings."
"""And she spoke to me and said that she would take care of me"
"""if I just stayed there with her."
"""I lived with that dragon for the next three years of my life."
"""And on one of our morning walks,"
"""Crackle and I--"
"""that's her name, Crackle the Dragon--"
"""we saw the old white man."
"""And I don't know what kind of adventures"
"""he went through on this three-year journey"
"""in this magical land,"
"""but he looked totally different."
It's hard to forget
I wish there was a solution
Don't spend your time in confusion

Yesterday afternoon our European section intercepted a German Communique that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

Hitler is a nut on the subject.
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.

20th century story
Somewhere in North Hungary there is a little village between pinewood and behind the beyond.
Far from everything.
Its air is clear and with ozone rich
Many tourists and vacationists visit to who the local population give out a room into rent a weekly.
"Lived in this village where silence and peacefulness reigned  and for example conflagration did not ravage since long years, his was called Tót Lajos."
Everybody first greeted him because it was surrounded by general respect  if he went along the high street.
Because he friendly natured one and majestical one was his authority.
He was sit on the head of table on weddings
The population turned to him for a council.
And death cases the coroner was called if he said his judgement already only.
Suffered poor.
"In 1 828, Walter Scott pulled all the strands of myth and hearsay together and gave the Bruce an encouraging spider for comfort, but it was just a story."
Where he fled to precisely is not known.
Ardnamurchan is the current favourite.
"But wherever he went, Sir Walter was right about one thing, that Bruce had a decision to make, whether to give up or go on."
He had connections.
One of his sisters was the Queen of Norway.
He could have hidden there.
"But that would have left his wife, his other sisters, his daughter and all his bishops in captivity."
"It would have left his supporters, his friends and his brother dead and unprayed for, in purgatory, or worse."
What sort of choice was that?
He chose to fight on.
"He gathered a force of Irishmen and Hebrideans, and landed secretly at Turnberry in Ayrshire, towards the end of February in 1 307."
"By the beginning of March, two more of his brothers were dead at English hands."
The price of Robert's throne was rising.
"He took his forces, his anger, and his grief into the broken lands of south-west Scotland."
He wasn't hiding.
He was learning how to fight.
He had no more than a few hundred men.
Hardly any knights.
"He only had spearmen, foot soldiers, and no intention whatsoever of following Wallace to an early grave."
So he could only wait until the English were wherehe wanted them to be... and then surprise them.
"In April, Robert and a force of 300 men surprised an English force of 1 ,500 here beside Loch Trool in Galloway."
It was an unpleasant surprise.
There was no room for cavalry to manoeuvre and nothing for the English to do except trip each other up and die.
So they ran away.
So this was victory.
The Bruce enjoyed the taste.
But was it a fluke?
A one-off?
It might be.
"By May, Robert was in Ayrshire."
The land was full of the level playing fields that knights adored.

September 18th 14:00
18th Natsuki's recital 14:30
It's Reardon:
"He's an impostor, a fake:"
We were tricked into taking him on board the Searcher so he could destroy it:
You've got to find him and stop him:
Where is he?
"He should be in sick bay, unless he's taking another one of his little walks:"
"Sick bay, this is Colonel Deering on the bridge:"
Is Mr:
Reardon there?
"[Man] He should be, Colonel:"
Just a minute:
That's funny:
"He was here a minute ago, but now he's gone:"
I'd better get down there:
Let's organize search teams to scour the ship:
Good:
"Buck, Reardon's disappeared:"
We're starting a search now:
How long before you're back?
"We're on final approach now, Admiral:"
"Buck, we have teams out searching the entire ship, but still no sign of Reardon:"
The fusion reactor room:
It's the most sensitive part of the ship:
No sign of Reardon anywhere:
We think he's in the reactor room:
Come on:
"Well, we know someone's inside:"
The green light's on:
- Captain Rogers:
- Lieutenant Parsons:
"Good to have you back, sir:"
"I've checked the reactor room for any sign of Reardon, as Colonel Deering ordered:"
"A ""Sex Slave"" is still a human"
"Honestly, I regret it"
I should have dissuaded Miyu from going to Tokyo
I'm sure she's trapped under some wimpy guy's penis as his sex slave
A sex slave for a wimpy guy?
Just an assumption
Miyu likes wimpy and skinny boys
Much like Lin right now
She is a sex slave with a lot of motherly love
A cute girl with a lot of motherly love...
That's nice
Yeah
But her motherly love is now conquered by her sexuality
It's a waste to fall for sexuality.
She is being too honest to her needs
One should get married first and then fuck all day and night
"When one falls for sex, they lose track of themselves and fail"
It doesn't even become a craft
"The three pleasures: drink, gamble, hustle were a big part of Shinsho's life but he never fell for Juliet's heart"

He is an old master comedian
"Bon, you like comedy too?"
"No, that isn't so"
I just recently grew an interest in him
One of grandpa's relics was a biography about him
Interesting
Craft...
The thing that Japan lacks right now is artistic craft
Whatever it is.
"The illustrious King of Scots was buried here, at Dunfermline Abbey, near his wife."
"The dead King, and the first king of something that had never existed before."
"The very word ""Scots"" meant something different."
"There was a Scottish people now, loyal to a Scottish throne."
"No more confusion, no more divided loyalties."
The bishops and the Bruce had done theirjob.
It was a revolution.
The King is dead.
Long live the King.
"His five-year-old son David succeeded Robert the Bruce on 7th June, 1 329."
"The following year, James Douglas took the Bruce's heart on crusade against the Moors in northern Spain, and died there."
"The heart, having fulfilled its promise, was found on the battlefield, returned to Scotland and buried in Melrose Abbey."
"After his death, the legend of the Bruce did what legends do."
It ate things up.
It ate the human being.
"All that was left was Robert the Bruce, the soldier King who fought for Scottish liberty and won."
"It left a suit of armour, and this face, resolute and empty."
The legend hid his consuming guilt.
"It rarely mentioned the bishops who'd chosen him, and who had guided his every step."
It barely muttered the names of his lost family.
It shrunk the Scottish casualties and multiplied the English armies he'd defeated.
It blurred the medievalness of what he did.
"It made it about liberty for all, instead of a revolution that established a free and independent Scottish crown."
"On November 24th 1 331 ,"
David and Joan were enthroned as King and Queen of Scotland.
There was no Stone of Destiny.
Edward III had promised to return it and hadn't.
"But at last, there was an ampulla of sacred oil from the Pope."
The bottle of independence from the English crown.
Final proof of the Bruce's triumph.
Final proof that the Scottish crown was free and quit of English authority.
"Final proof that the reign of Good King Robert had been worth everything, all the deaths and horror."
He thinks of me as a child still
I want to come down to Deal with you when you go
I think that's a very good idea Perhaps between us we can make him see sense
"I don't like it, Esther"
When you speak of Richard as if you think he's taken leave of his senses
I didn't mean it like that
I've made up my mind
"Ada, are you sure it won't be throwing good money after bad?"
I don't care
"I love him and I want to help him , and that's all I know"
"Rosa, come and sit down by me"
"Rosa, remember I told you that I might have to send you away?"
"Yes, m'lady"
"I have written to Mr Rouncewell, and he will come for you tomorrow"
So soon?
"Yes, it must be soon"
"Rosa, I did not want to part with you, but it is for the best"
"I hope you will think kindly of me, Rosa, whatever you hear about me"
Ah !
"Here we are, ladies"
As snug and cosy a room as any you'll find in Deal
Is this your first visit here?
"Yes, it is"
Are you meeting someone from the Indiaman?
"She's due to drop anchor off the Downs, on the afternoon tide"
Lots of folks gone down to see her boats coming to shore
"No, we've come to see an officer who's billeted here"
"I wonder, could you tell us how to get to the barracks?"
"Surely, Miss Nothing easier"
KNOCK ON DOOR Yes?

And prince Kang was held hostage.
Prince Kang finally escaped and?

"By the time 15-year-old Judy appeared in Everybody Sing she had already been on-stage for more than a decade billed as the little girl with the great, big voice."
Teach me how to sing
Music with a modern rhythm Let me swing
Mr. Mendelssohn swing
Music is a thing
That's no good without that rhythm
Sweet and hot Fast and slow
So get yourself A little dash of holy ho
And swing it Mr. Mendelssohn swing it high
"Hey, swing it low"
And swing it Mr. Mendelssohn swing
I'm past the stage Of doll and carriage
I'm not the age To think of marriage
I'm too old for toys
And I'm too young for boys
I'm just an in-between
In Love Finds Andy Hardy Judy laments the fact that she's not a little girl any longer and not quite a grownup either.
Grownups ignore me
And in every sense
I'm just on a fence
I'm just an in-between
"For a few years, Judy was an in-between."
Even though the critics had compared her talent to that of a teenage Sarah Bernhardt the studio had to search for just the right part to showcase her grownup gifts.
They found it in her first starring role:
Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz.
When Judy stepped into the Technicolor land of Oz it mirrored her arrival as a major star.
"Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."
We must be over the rainbow.
Follow the yellow Brick road follow the yellow brick road
"Follow, follow, follow, follow Follow the yellow brick road"
Follow the yellow brick Follow the yellow brick
Follow the yellow brick road
You're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a Whiz of a Wiz If ever a Wiz there was
"If ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because"
"Because, because, because Because, because"
Because of the wonderful things he does
The Wizard of Oz was to become the most widely seen motion picture of all time and Judy's wonderful performance in the picture earned her a special Academy Award which I was lucky enough to present to her.
"And, Judy, I hope you win many more of them, honey."
Thank you.
"And how about doing us all a little favor now and singing ""Over the Rainbow""?"
Will you do that?
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
"Why, then"
"Oh, why can't I?"
"I like New York in June, how about you?"
"I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?"
I love a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips Moonlight and motor trips
How about you?
My favorite memories of working with Judy are when it was just the two of us performing a simple song and dance routine together like this one from Babes on Broadway.
"I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine"
I'd love to see your name
Right beside mine
I can see we're in harmony
Looks like we both agree
On what to do
"And I like it, how about you?"
"Down on an island, the southern seas"
There lived a lassie named Minnie Breeze
And all the natives agree That she's the hottest thing in Trinidad
Judy became one of the country's top 10 box-office stars.
Nothing can stop me now 'cause I just don't care

"you're not getting tired are you, you fucks ?"
Kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky and i was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe sometimes i don't believe them myself And i decided i was never coming down
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about too small to see
But i watched it way too long and that dot was pulling me down
"- No, Your Honor."
- Very well.
"Excuse me, Your Honor... ...but the jury would like to make a recommendation... ...regarding the sentence."
- Objection.
"Sit down, counselor."
"It's only a recommendation, and I would like to hear it."
We recommend a sentence of time served.
I'll accept that.
"You are guilty, Father Moore."
And you are free to go.
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.
Thank you.
"Well, you shocked us all."
Everyone at the firm sees this as another victory.
The archdiocese is pleased.
They feel the trial has raised public interest in the Church.
Have you seen the news?
"There's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man... ...right next to you."
Just like James Van Hopper.
"All right, I'll say it."
I was wrong.
But I'm ready to make it right.
I'm offering you a full partnership in the firm.
Keep it.
Will you be able to return to your parish?
I can't go back.
Not now.
Once you've looked into the darkness... ...I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.
What about you?
I believe you've seen the darkness too.
I don't know.
"ln the last riots, I defended some innocent Hindus."
And my own people did this to me.
Father cannot walk.
But you want to fight.. ..with the One who created your entire community.
Will you flee?
I've no other option left.
I won't run.
"Look, I cannot fight your case in this condition.. ..but if the lawyers refuse to take up your case.. ..then according to the law you can defend your own case."
ls that possible?
"- Yes, there's a provision in the law."
lf you want I can prepare your legal notice.
"I'll be grateful to you, Hanif."
Hanif.
Do you believe in Allah?
Of course.
"God, Allah, they are all the same."
"So, I am fighting against Him."
"So, why are you helping me?"
You're not the only pleader.
Everyone does.
"Some pleads to Him, and some against Him."
Where do you want to send this notice?
I don't have his...
- Address.
No.
- Then.
The judge will dismiss your case in the first hearing.
"I mean, I don't have His address.. ..but of the places where people look for Him. "" You're our benefactor, our friend. """
""" So scare us. """
""" Why ruin our present, by telling us about an unknown future. """
""" You're our benefactor, our friend. """
""" Why ruin our present, by telling us about an unknown future. """
Just leave.
"Boss, honestly."
"If it was about a goon, we'd have managed."
This girl is very sharp.
We can't control her.
We're trying to explain her that we're the police officers...
And she's in the police custody for her wellbeing.
But she's not ready to believe us.
We've to keep her here for 18 days.
How will you manage?
It doesn't suit to tenderly girls like you.
You all are goons.
You've kidnapped me.
But I'm Radha Mathur.
I know how to tackle with goons like you.
"Never try to do that with me, is that clear?"
I beg of you
You can take away all my jewelries.
But please let me go.
"Look, you are misunderstanding us."
We're government servants.
We'll have to follow our senior's orders.
Then why don't you arrange for me to talk with my father?
What's all this?
This is the result of your father's enmity with a goon.
That goons is planning to kidnap you.
That's why our IG has ordered us to keep you... ...in our safe custody away from the city.
But how do I believe you?
This is a not a drama.
Do you have any evidence?
Wait for the 24 hours and you'll get the evidence.
That's a tape.
"Whether the Lord exists or not, doesn't make a difference to me."
The insurance people said that.. ..God has razed down my shop.
"Or, he's the One behind your shop's destruction."
"So, I said fine."
Ask God to compensate for my losses.
Case closed.
But why will God raze down your shop?
Fool!
Please.
Please come to the witness box and speak.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
Why will God raze down my shop?
"Exactly, why will God raze down my shop?"
He has other important things to do.
"So, tell the insurance company to pay me."
End of matter.
Why will the insurance company pay you?
You've agreed to the terms and conditions.. ..of the insurance company.
"Exhibit no.1, sir."
Right.
Then God will have to compensate for it.
"Call upon, Lord Ram, Shiva, Ganpati.. ..Whoever you get along better with."
"Do some of your hocus-pocus, or.. - Fool!"
The only way to find God is through salvation.
God won't descend down on earth.. ..for a ordinary man like you.
He would only if He exists.
"You're turnover is in millions, and this is a small settlement."
Just say yes.
I will even give you cash discount.
Really.
You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
I have forgotten too much.
I have to go to China in this ship to pay you back.
So that's why you agreed to such a high interest.
"Since my ship is not setting sail, you're the only one that's making money here."
Ten thousand yang a day.
Am I the only one that's benefitting from the ship not setting sail?
That is why I am going to put the bait out tonight.
"If the bait is out and we put out the trap, the mice will be caught!"
He's showing him the girls!
Does he suspect Gil Dong hyung?
"He must have gone along with him to not arouse suspicion, but how infuriating!"
We have to come out aggressively so that they will fear us.
But isn't this too much?
"You know this business well, don't you?"
"Be gentle, won't you?"
I'm scared I can't even look at them!
You will get your money only if the ship sets sail.
"If you stand here, you will have a nice view of all the mice."
Throw them in!
"Yes, sir!"
Help us!
Help us!
"We'll send them into the water, so they can have them back!"
Save us!
Please help us!
What is it?
You want to help them?
"If he does something, it's all over."
Then should he let them all die?
"When he gives the signal, we go."
That giving mukti.
"Up to namabhas, up to mukti, it may be."
Or may not.
That name.
[or??] namakar.
That [of??] the seed without the potency within it.
Imitation is like that.
Without the seed.
"The medicine is there, apparently."
But the potency of the medicine is [absent?].
It will be like that.
At most that name produce what is namabhasa.
One thing: proper...
Name proper.
Name means it is not material.
It is not under the jurisdiction of the concocted area.
Misunderstood area.
It must not have root there.
In the [paws?] of imitation.
The root must not be there.
"The root, name proper, must have to become, have it's connection with the infinite proper."
One thing.
"And the next thing: it must be treated properly, that is sevon-mukh, serving attitude."
"Not exploiting mood, not indifferent mood."
"Serving attitude must be there and the seed must be proper seed, bonafide."
Two things necessary.
Everywhere.
"Sadhu-sanga, that is also bonafide."
We are to differentiate it from the sham.
From the apparent.
That is from mayic conception.
Which is not so.
Did you call to ask how much I got as priests fee?
Nothing.
The marriage was cancelled due to differences between.. ..the two parties.
We are returning in the same bus.
The boys people are at the back.. .. and the girls people on the right.
I and Shambu are suffering in between them.
Why should it not be cancelled?
It is a love marriage.
Is there any rule that lovers will never go apart?
They got separated due to a silly issue.
The groom has.. ..a temporary job but the girls side was told.. ..that it is a permanent job.
At this the girls father got angry and made the girl.. ..take the issue up with the groom in front of everyone.
At this the boys ego got hurt.
So it is an ego problem.
Because the girls side insulted them..
When did we insult them?
They only lowered our dignity.
As if they had any dignity.
"Hey priest, why should we talk with those people.. ..who do not have any status or capability?"
We are drinking scotch because we are capable.
The drinking during day time shows.. ..that theirs is a manner less family.
"You driver, stop the bus."
I will finish off this man.
Who are you to finish me?
"If I hit you, you will go sprawling."
What will you hit me?
If I take one more peg.. ..I will sleep on the seat myself.
We do not talk to idiots.
- But we are talking to idiots.
Do you mean that my teacher is an idiot?
It seems to be your opinion.
Not theirs.
Let's just make some funny tails.
Twist about two inch bubble at the end of each balloon.
And force the bubble to the very end of the flat tail.
Do it with all four balloons.
"I know, it does not look like a crane now."
Some silly sculpture... anyway.
We are going to improve it now.
We are going to use one more balloon to make the crane's arm.
Inflate a balloon.
I use a brown balloon
leaving about eight inch flat tail.
Oh!
I forgot to mention.
Not for this sculpture. but with regards to many other sculptures.
We can use technique desribed in this instruction to wrap balloon in balloons.
Now let's fix the crane's arm.
Just force the brown balloon through both sides of the cabin.
That is the simplest crane's arm.
"Again, we can make funny tail."
It will represent the hook.
Let's make this bubble up to one inch size.
This time I am going to tie a knot to secure the funny tail at the end of the balloon.
It is a necessary precaution.
Be course my young son will play with this crane.
As all we know all unlocked bubbles doomed to be deflated in hands of little kids.
Here I twist two small soft bubbles.
And lock all ends of those two bubbles in one lock twist.
"Actually,"
I twist one bubble.
Lock both ends and split the bubble on two bubbles.
"In anyways, it will look the same."
It looks ... ridiculous.
There's the cars we're driving and the water waste.
And all the trash we don't care where we're throwing it.
That's what I think.
"Cars, buses."
"It's industry, its gasoline, it's energy use."
All the fumes from cars.
Cars.
Too many vehicles maybe.
The fumes in the air.
All the gas.
And people driving in the city.
"Cars, factories, planes."
I image the aviation industry hasn't helped.
I mean one air plane can fly across country and its like 40 tonnes of carbon.
"40 tonnes, that's a lot."
I think in one word I would say pollution.
"Coal power stations, gas power stations."
People using more energy than they need to.
We are wasting a lot ...
An excessive use of gasses.
"And also coal burning stations, especially in China."
"All the pollutants that we pump into the air, day after day."
"Everyone says the same thing: it's the cars, the planes, the industrial plants."
It's because we leave our lights on and take long showers.
Always the same familiar answers.
"And yes: of course it's true, but no-one has yet won the grand prize."
Because we're forgetting one extremely important factor.
Eighteen percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock farming.
That might surprise you.
"Farmed animals, 18%!"
And guess what percentage of total global emissions are caused by transport?
Thirteen percent!
"If my father did all this, why would he try so hard to bring.. ..you out of the jail?"
Do you know you would have been in jail.. .. for up to five years if he does not helped you.
Why would he do that if he wants to separate us?
Because they want that you should find fault in me.
Forget about all others.
Do you believe that I am the culprit?
Let us leave that matter now.
"Shailu, Do you believe that I am the culprit?"
What can I do but believe.
To get a job so quickly you may.
It is useless to convince you.
You began to believe.. ..your father blindly.
That is why you could not even .. ..believe me.
You dont love me any more.
I cannot be with you if you dont love me.
It is not proper for you to go to Vizag for such a small reason.
Small arguments are common among couples or lovers.
It may look like a small incident for you.. .. but it is very big concern for me.
Then also how can you break a relation?
You should convince her later when she is calm.
Convince her?
Is she a small girl?
Doesnt she have any brain?
You are behaving arrogantly.
I need not beg her.
She will come to me if she wants me.
Why are you worried so much baby?
It is just a small argument.
Is it not your fault that you raised an argument with him.. ..when he was surrounded by many tensions?
You know quarrels will increase if you let them to.. ..otherwise they will simply vanish.
After all the hard work I have done to separate them.. ..this old lady is trying to take away my fruits of success.
What are you still thinking?
If the mean beak width does significantly increase or decrease in size.
This is referred to as Directional Selection.
Then the environment allows the survival and reproduction of finches with bigger beak widths.
Let's say we know that the average beak width of all finches is 6.07 millimeters.
This includes finches that have been studied over the last few years.
But now let's say we're studying a sample of finches from today.
"We want to know, do finches today have beak widths that are different in size?"
"That means our null hypothesis is that, the population mean for finches today is equal to what they have been."
And what should the alternative hypothesis be?
"That mu is less than 6.07, greater than 6.07, or not equal to 6.07."
"Sir, what's the progress?"
The New West is on strike until the King agrees.
We're in the right.
The King can't ignore our petitions.
Not just the Southerners.
The majority of the ministers are with the New West.
They insist the King punish Prince Yuning.
What will you do?
Geum.
Mom.
We'll have him banished for this.
He won't threaten your crown again.
I'll see to that.
We're leaving.
As you say.
Your Grace.
The New West is applying pressure.
If they keep this up the King will have to accede.
Is something bothering you?
The Crown Prince knows everything.
What?
He knows what's wrong with him.
It was too damn hard !
some of you already know that it's hard.
It's not easy.
It's hard changing your life !
"That in the process working on your dreams you are going to incur a lot of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain, a lot of set backs and a lot of defeats."
"At moments when you ""re going to doubt yourself and say:"
"""God why is this happening to me,"
"I'm just trying to take care of my children, my mother."
I'm not trying to steal or rob from anybody.
How does this have to happen to me?
"For those of you all that have experienced some hardships, don't give up on your dream."
Pain is temporary.
"It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year,"
but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.
"If I quit, however, it lasts forever."
Talent you have naturally.
Skill is only developed by hours and hours... ...and hours of beating on your craft.
"I will not go down, THAT WAY!"
"it's about no days off no weekends, no holidays, no birthdays."
Listen to me!
No days off!
No half days!
No holidays!
No snow day!
It's about gaining the competitive edge.
It's about separation.
It's about separating yourself from the past !
"I choose to rise, not fall!"
"I choose to live, not die!!"
I choose to fight back!
Here we go come with me there's a world out there that we should see take my hand close your eyes with you right here
I'm a rockateer
So let's say that that is the x-axis.
"Actually, I drew this-- let me edit, undo."
OK.
So let me draw the x-axis.
You might realize pretty soon why I have to redo this.
"The y-axis. x, y."
All right.
So we know that a and c are negative.
"So c is the y-intercept, right?"
"When x is equal to 0, we're just left with g of x is equal to c."
So c is the y-intercept.
"So if c is less than 0, we know that the y-intercept is going to be below the x-axis."
It's going to be a negative number.
We know that this is c.
That's where the graph intersects the y-axis.
We also know it's going to be symmetric around the y-axis.
"Well, actually, we don't know for sure that it's going to be symmetrical around the y-axis."
"And I could go into that in more detail, but I won't."
But that's all we need to know.
It depends what the bx-- this term-- is.
But let's just ignore that for now.
And then we know that a is negative.
"So in general, you might want to prove it to yourself, you know the graph of y equals x squared."
That opens up like this.
And the graph of y is equal to minus x squared.
It goes down like that.
So a possible graph for this would look like this.
The important thing is these are the two things that you know when they tell you a and c is negative.
"It's going to be a graph that opens downwards, and it's going to intersect the y-axis in the negative area, below the x-axis."
A legitimate graph also would have looked like this.
It could have also looked like this.
It didn't actually have to be symmetric.
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.
(Laughter)
"I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders."
(Laughter)
"The sixth-graders look at it and they say, ""No."""
(Laughter)
"""You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."""
(Laughter)
"""The chicken is not."""
(Laughter)
"So this is our problem, as you can imagine."
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
(Laughter) (Applause)
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"""Fix the chicken."""
(Laughter)
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
"Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools."
We'll call them biological modification tools.
We have selection.
And we know selection works.
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese.
"How much do you have, if the interest rate is eight%?"
2.59 million.
Huge difference in magnitude and who's the culprit?
Compounding.
"In this case, the culprit is helpi ng you."
"But in the case of if you are paying it, it hurts."
"So, we'll do a loan later."
"So, here it's helping you."
"So, let's talk through this problem a little bit."
And so that you understand how empowered you are.
"How empowered actually you are and Finance will make you feel liberated in some, in the simple problem."
"So here, here you go."
"Let me ask you, who decided the 10,000?"
Think about it.
"Who should decide the 10,000 every year?"
You?
Or a financial adviser?
Who?
I hope the answer is you.
"So, 10,000 if you have, I know it's not easy to figure out."
But I would encourage you to think about what your needs are in the future so that you could figure out how much you need to put away.
"And we'll talk, do a problem quite the reverse in a second, say you put away $10,000, who decides that?"
You decide that.
"Second question, what is the other number in this problem?"
It's 40.
How many years to retirement?
"I know you can say that a job may have a retirement age or some sort of, but I, I challenge you in that."
"Hopefully, you will have much more control on when you retire."
Then you think you do.
"By that, I mean you should keep learning in"
"life so that you will always have the opportunity to do something, right?"
And we are talking about the money problem but it could be about anything.
How does that not drive you crazy?
You get used to it.
I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
He can say what he wants.
The bottom line is he's showing me off.
Dr Bension.
"Oh, just give us a second."
Will you big guy.
Did you hear about it.
Watching Dr Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.
Any questions?
Great.
He seemed nice.
Careful newbie
You know I'm hearing it now.
It's kinda annoying when I talk.
I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met
So Elliot's exam was that bad
Dude she violated me.
Ina good way?
What's the deal?
Ah!!!
I think I broke my ass.
I heard
Well of course.
"The hope is, and experience shows that material like this does contribute to reduced civilian casualties and a higher threshold for war and more cautious planning for war."
"And hopefully, in this case, and understanding and careful planning for what the exit policy is for Afghanistan."
This is a war that has been going on now for nine years and is clearly been getting worse for the past three years.
Something has got to change in this equation.
"And soldiers, foot soldiers, are of course victims of war."
"They do benefit to some degree, I mean they benefit in terms of their career and in terms of money."
"These are not people, frequently not people that are totally innocent unless they are conscripts."
And where is he getting all his protein from?
From this.
"His diet consists of roots, shoots, bamboo and banana."
"He is getting all his calcium, all his iron, all his vitamins, all his minerals, the amino acids from this."
You get everything.
Everything.
Here is the new food pyramid.
There are two things.
Your body is like a machine.
Think of your body as a machine.
You have to put the proper fuels in it to get it to work properly.
"If you don't put the proper fuels, it aint gonna work."
"And if you put fuels that aren't as good quality as others, that will lead to heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol."
"It's like, if you take a Porsche, and you fill it up with diesel, what happens?"
"You just screwed your car up, right?"
"And I guarantee what are people gonna say to you, when you say, I put diesel in my car today."
Do you know what they gonna say to you?
I guarantee they are going to say
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No offense.
"When somebody puts a hamburger in their mouth, nobody says"
"What the fuck is wrong, stop!"
Stop!
You get everything.
I know I said to think your body as a machine now think of your body as a house.
I love analogies.
Think of your body as a house.
"To build a house you have to start with the foundation, you can't start with the roof."
Here is the foundation.
This is the foundation.
This is where all of it starts.
The fruits and vegetables.
Brandon:
Ok.
Ok I like that.
That's not one I usually put up there but that's a very good point.
Characters should act like themselves.
And you can't get to know someone if they're not consistent.
"In fact, characters in books tend to be far more consistent than people are in real life."
This is case of truth is stranger than fiction.
"And in the book, you're going to have to give foreshadowing and reasoning for why a character's acting that way if they're acting erratically, which they can do, that in real life you may never not give."
"You might just be a moody person, and you're jumping all over the place."
In the book you'll have to establish that this is a moody person.
"Alright, what else?"
Student:
"They have depths in their interests, and what they think about."
Brandon:
"Ok, depth."
That's a good one.
What else?
Student:
Something you aspire to be.
Brandon:
OK.
That's one of the other big three that I usually point out.
"In a lot of ways, I view characters like this:"
"It's almost like there's a continuum between what we call the ""everyman"" and the ""superman"" or woman."
The idea being that these two things are kind of core concepts that make up what attaches us to a character.
"Either we see what we are in them, or we see what we want to be in them."
And a lot of times you will have books that this is the growth archetype of the character.
Can you think of one of these?
Student:
Star Wars.
Brandon:
Sunita.
Final year medical student.
You don't know me.
But I know you.
Can I talk to you for two minutes... please?
"As a medical student, I want to know how..."
Camera beeps
What's that?
My camera.
Why is it beeping?
It buzzes every 15 minutes.
"So that I can take photos... of important things, people... to inscribe on them, to remember."
On photos?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Making notes...
"I grew up on Oracle from Oracle four on, and there are some really awesome features in Oracle."
- That's so sad.
- It would take those 3000 queries and actually work whereas mostly [indecipherable]
"- Oh yeah, no, no, no, no."
"The 3000 queries was, in fact, Oracle, and it did, in fact, work just fine eventually."
- 9000 seconds later.
"- It just took a while to run, no problem."
- Are you saying qualifying the dates or indexing the dates or both out of curiosity?
All of the above?
"Oracle dates, time stamps."
"Sequel, JBC when you're using a NS timestamp will output a Java sequel timestamp."
"If you have your Oracle column set to date,"
Oracle then in the database has to convert that Java sequel time stamp into a date.
"If you've used that date, say as a partition column, you're going to have a query that takes 100 to 200 times longer to execute than if you had just passed in a time stamp, or if you used a time stamp for your partition column."
There's a nice work‑around.
I'm not sure if there's a techno publish for it.
It was the defendant.
Counselor.
Ethan Thomas calls himself a man of faith.
"I, on the other hand, am a woman of doubt."
Angels and demons.
God and the devil.
"These things either exist, or they do not exist."
Are we all alone in this life?
Or are we not alone?
Either thought is astonishing.
Do I really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
"To be honest, I don't know."
But I cannot deny that it's possible.
The prosecution wants you to believe... ...that Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder was a fact... ...because facts leave no room for reasonable doubt.
But this trial isn't about facts.
This trial is about possibilities.
Is it a fact that Emily was a hypersensitive... ...as Dr. Adani suggests?
"A person who's more likely, by her very nature, to become possessed?"
"I can't say that, but the question is:"
Is it possible?
Is it a fact that Gambutrol anesthetized Emily's brain... ...so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
I can't be sure of that.
But is it possible?
Is it a fact that Emily was beloved by God?
"And that after her exorcism, she chose to suffer till the end... ...so that we might believe in a more magical world?"
A world where the spiritual realm really exists?
I can't say that's a fact.
But ask yourself:
Is it possible?
It's what Emily believed.
It's what Father Moore believed.
And that sincere belief is what determined her choices and his.
That is the total number of ways that you can set the
Enigma machine.
This would be an army Enigma machine around about 1939.
-You are telling me that the Germans would send each other messages like Numberphile or send--
DR. JAMES GRlME:
"Yeah, they did that all the time."
-Or send the U-boat to this position or whatever.
But how were they telling each other their plug settings and their starting rotor numbers?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
So this is very important.
"So these two people, who are miles apart, need to have the same setting."
"Now, the setting was written down for you on a piece of paper."
What they would have is a sheet of paper like that.
And it would be a big sheet of paper for each day of the month.
So it was a monthly sheet.
"For each day of the month, they told you how to set the machine for that day."
"If you didn't have this sheet of paper, you wouldn't know what the setting was that you had to use for that day."
"And nice, little story, the Navy would write these code books in soluble ink."
"So if you get sunk, if you get caught, if you throw the code book into water, that's how you keep the secret."
"-It sounds to me that all you need is an Enigma machine and a copy of that book, and you know everything they're saying."
DR. JAMES GRlME:
You would do.
"So if you had the machine and you had that code sheet, you would be able to decode all the messages."
Fantastic.
Great.
But we had the machine.
"And once we've had the machine, we can pull it apart and find out how it works."
Great.
But it was getting those code sheets.
That was difficult.
They were monthly.
They would change every month.
"So, the kind of programming , the kind of programming that is going on."
And I'm asking you to just stay as only the awareness of it.
You're aware of that.
"And somehow in being aware that you're observing a kind of pattern, a kind of story, a kind of picturing."
"Because this is what actually happens quite often, is that there is a picture, you've a little youtube in your head, of somebody going , 'I'm having a baby'"
'being happy and it's like forever'.
Although it is only 10 minutes.
"It's kind of , you know.."
"You tube is only 10 minutes, but you can.."
"So, like this and something, the mind embellishes everything else."
It fills in.
This is how it is.
"You suggest something and the mind fills in all the other parts of it, like this."
"And so, it is the mind that is addicted to it's own projections."
And you've identified with the mind.
And so some of the stain feels like it is coming off on you.
That is the 'I' who want it.
"So, it's a bit entangled there, you see."
"So, I only say, that you're aware of this."
This activity of the mind or personality.
"It's creating these pictures, Ok?"
"So, just now, even now, you can do, that you're aware of what you've spoken also."
Something is aware of this.
There is an awareness of this.
That's the awareness of.
"But now I'm pointing you just to the awareness, without the 'of', something, you see."
In which anything can come.
Ok.
"Well, this story of wanting this, you know, shining prince or whatever, it comes and goes."
"It's not constant, continuously in your mind."
Is it?
No.
"Oh, by the way, the Louvre was doing them too."
"Programs are now available, they are on art."
The history of art.
There's a group called Art Education for the Blind.
New York.
"They produce twenty volume set, with great photos in it."
Art history for the blind.
Cave art to the present.
It's spectacular.
A lot of people are getting hehind this evidence.
"This is not a practice or a fashion, this is evidence that this stuff works."
"And when you build a practice, a program on top of that to suit whatever needs you have."
Why do this?
"Well the evidence shows, raised line pictures can be used by the blind."
When they are drawing objects they show the shapes of objects.
The very thing you see.
And they have different levels of sophistication in their drawings.
Especially if they have only recently gone blind.
A child and an adult.
And I think
"Eriko and Esref's perspective and metaphor drawings are kind of ""firsts"" in art history."
"We had no idea, 20 years ago that any of this was possible."
And it's just spectacular that it is possible.
Thank you very much.

Constance:
So we have time for a few questions for Dr. Kennedy.
"Does anybody have anything they would like to actually comment on, based on what he said, or questions for him?"
"Anything you would like for clarification, possibility for your museum."
"Speak loudly, if you don't mind."
"I'll ask you to say your name, your organization and then ask your question."
And if you could stand up.
"This is the first lecture in MlT's course 18.06,"
"linear algebra, and I'm Gilbert Strang."
"The text for the course is this book, Introduction to Linear Algebra."
"And the course web page, which has got a lot of exercises"
"from the past, MatLab codes, the syilabus for the"
"course, is web.mit.edu/18.06."
And this is the first
"lecture, lecture one."
"So, and later we'll give the web"
"address for viewing these, videotapes."
"Okay, so what's in the"
first lecture?
This is my plan.
"The fundamental problem of linear algebra, which is to solve a system"
of linear equations.
So let's start with a case when we
"have some number of equations, say n equations and n unknowns."
So an equal number of equations and unknowns.
"That's the normal, nice case."
And what I want to do is
"-- with examples, of course -- to describe,"
"first, what I call the Row picture."
That's the picture of one equation
at a time.
It's the picture you've seen before in two by two equations
where lines meet.
"So in a minute,"
you'll see lines meeting.
"The second picture, I'll put a star"
"beside that, because that's such an important one."
And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time.
And those are the rows and columns of a matrix.
Once was real love and now it's fake
Who would've known this path we'd take
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good

Hi guys.
"This is Max Tapper again, for Howcast."
What I'm going to do today is talk about a set.
"So, what exactly is a set?"
A set basically is just a certain number of repetitions that you choose to do in any exercise.
"So, say if I pick up a dumbbell and I want to work my chest and I'm going 10 to 12 repetitions, after 12 repetitions, that is one set."
Okay?
"Now, you can choose different repetitions for different reasons, depending on what you're trying to achieve."
Let's say your goal is just complete strength.
A lot of times they'll do six sets of repetitions.
"If your goal is to build muscle, like hypertrophy, then we'll work somewhere between 10 - 12 repetitions, and that's one set."
"If your goal is for endurance, then you're doing 15-20 reps, and that is still one set."
"So, a set basically is just a certain amount of repetitions."
That's all.
All right guys?
Get out there.
Do your sets and be safe.
(Music playing)
columns.
So I know how to get that one.
So what's the solution?
What combination will work?
I just want one of these and none of these.
"So x should be zero, y should be zero and z should be one."
That's the combination.
One of those is obviously the right
one.
Column three is actually the same as b in this particular problem.
"I made it work that way just so we would get an answer,"
"(0,0,1), so somehow that's the point where those three planes met and I"
couldn't see it before.
"Of course, I won't always be able"
"to see it from the column picture, either."
"It's the next lecture,"
"actually, which is about elimination,"
"which is the systematic way that everybody -- every bit of software,"
"too -- production, large-scale software would solve the equations."
So the lecture that's coming up.
"If I was to add that to the syilabus,"
"will be about how to find x, y, z in all cases."
"Can I just think again, though, about the big picture?"
By the big picture I mean let's keep this same matrix on the left
but imagine that we have a different right-hand side.
"Oh, let me take a different right-hand side."
So I'll change that right-hand side to something that actually is also
pretty special.
Let me change it to --
"if I add those first two columns, that would give me a one and a one"
and a minus three.
There's a very special right-hand
Upon recognizing her condition... ...I would have tranquilized her and force-fed her.
"And then, if necessary... ...I would've treated her with electroconvulsive therapy."
Electroshock treatment.
You would've done this against her will?
To save her life?
Absolutely.
Nothing further.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, I offer into evidence this photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A."
"And having done so, the people rest."
The photograph is entered into evidence.
"We are recessed until tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp... ...at which time the defense will give its opening statement... ...and call its first witness."
I'm sorry I was late.
I didn't get a lot of sleep.
Big power outage knocked out my alarm clock.
- It won't happen again.
"- No, I didn't sleep either."
What kept you awake?
Doesn't matter.
You're under attack.
What are you talking about?
"You're in a spiritual battle, Erin."
The forces of darkness are trying to keep you away from the light.
Don't let them.
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.
We're getting creamed.
I can't believe I walked right into that.
"Look, if we don't find a doctor to testify that Emily... ...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose."
Care of the city's main branch and the university library... ...I bring you another dozen fun-filled books... ...about the demonic and the mentally deranged.
They burned women at the stake... ...during witch hunts for being possessed.
Glad you don't have to defend those guys.
"You guys, we live in this world where sexuality is kind of the center of everything."
At the center of how we think about relationships.
At the center of how we think about pleasures.
The center of how we think about a lot of aspects of our lives.
"And so asexual people are, you know, when I was in high school and middle school,"
"I had no idea how to think about relationships,"
I didn't know what was going on with me.
No one was talking about the fact that-
Star:
"So, you're a young man and you're an asexual and you don't have the same sexual feelings, you feel lost."
Like you're odd man out because nobody's telling you why you're not having the feelings that everyone else is talking about.
David:
No one's telling you that it's okay.
And no one's giving kind of a space and words you can use to talk about it.
Chandra:
You said middle school.
Is that how young you were when you found out?
David:
"Yeah, I was 13, 14 when I realized that, I mean, pretty much what all my friends started being sexual, I was just kind of like, ""All right"
"I know, have no way to figure out what's going on"" [laughter]"
I had no context to understand it.
And so I kind of figured out for myself.
"Well, I'm not experiencing these things."
I must be asexual.
Joy:
"Well, maybe it's repressed sexuality."
"Rather than, you know, that you're just like a normal guy walking around."
Maybe it's repressed because you don't want to face what the sexuality might look like.
Could that be?
Lie down.
[laughter]
David:
"A French invention, a well-known Ime brand."
"Of course it's a French invention, that is exactly what I want."
How much would you like
Let's say a bagful.
"Thank you, just a moment."
"Excuse me, before I sell you the French invisibility powder, I am obligated to ask you if you know how to use it."
I suppose you ingest it.
-That's correct!
That's not all.
Many people think that all you have to do is ingest the powder and everything will be ok.
"When taking the invisibility powder, or any other medicine, it is important to believe in it."
Do you believe -Of course.
Thank you.
"In that case, here's what you do."
Do you have the patience to listen.
"-Yes, mr apothecary"
"Do the following - ingest a pinch of invisibility powder, kick the big toe of your left foot with the heel of your right foot, and shout in your mind, through the walls!"
"In that instant, you'll be invisible."
You may also walk through walls if you feel like it.
But only in the clothes you're wearing.
"For example, if you turn invisible and steal teamster Ruuskas' hat and run away it is going to look like only the hat is running down the street."
Will I stay invisible then
"Don't worry, Mr Vinski, if you want to become visible again, you just have to do everything in the opposite order."
"Kich the big toe of your right foot with the heel of your left foot and shout in your mind, walls through!"
In that instant you'll go back to normal.
"Yes, I think I got it."
Thank you!
-It's quite simple really.
All great things are simple.
"Excuse me, considering that my shoelace came untied with all this climbing you won't mind if I tie it up."
Of course!
-Thank you!
And it comes up and over like that.
So this is kind of what the actin would look like.
"And, of course, I want to make sure I draw my titin."
"Titin is kind of helpful, because it helps demonstrate that there's now a little bit of space there where there wasn't any before."
And so now there is some space between the z-disc and this myosin right here.
So there is some space between these myosins and the z-discs.
"In fact, I can draw arrows all the way around."
And so there is a little bit of work to be done.
But I still wouldn't say that it's maximal force.
"Because look, you still have some overlap issues."
"Remember, these myosins, right here, they're not able to work."
"And neither are these, because of this blockage that's happening here."
This blockage.
"Because of the fact that, of course, actin has a certain polarity."
So they're getting blocked.
They can't do their work.
"And so even though you get some force of contraction, it wouldn't be maximal."
So I'll put something like this.
This will be our second spot.
This will be number two.
"Now in number three, things are going to get much better."
So you'll see very quickly now you have a much more spread out situation.
Where now these are actually-- these actins are really not going to be in the way of each other.
"You can see they're not bumping into each other, they're not in the way of each other at all."
And so all of the myosins can get to work.
So the z-discs are now out here.
"My overall sarcomere, of course, as I said, was from z-disc to z-disc."
So my sarcomere is getting longer.
"And you can also see that because now there's more titin, right?"
And there isn't actually more titin.
I shouldn't use that phrase.
But the titin is stretched out.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
AUDlENCE:
Hi.
I have a question about lining stuff up.
"So in Android, I would try to put an image next to a text view, and then there would be this little bit of space from the top of the text view until the text actually shows up, so it does not line up."
"The top of the image does not line up with my text, and it bothers me."
"I try to fix it, but there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it."
Should I even try?
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yes.
Please try.
"I am reminded again and again that that's a little bit difficult right now because the reality is top of the text as we perceive it is the top of the caps, it's usually the place where we want to measure from."
"And in this case in a lot of the systems, it measures from the clipping bounds."
"So measuring from the very top of the text, if you're building these kinds of systems, measuring from the cap height and the baseline is where you want to measure from."
"So you may have to do some kind of-- people always hate negative margins, or I don't know how to technically achieve it."
AUDlENCE:
"I mean, I guess the next question is, if I decided to do it, how do I figure out, what is the amount to shift for my font?"
Is there a computational way to do it?
"I don't want to just trial and error, one pixel, two pixel, I do it until it lines up."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yeah.
We can talk a little bit after.
ALEX FAABORG:
It's an important limitation.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"Em height times 0.23, I think."
ALEX FAABORG:
But thank you for trying to line it up.
That's great.
AUDlENCE:
"This is something I've been really curious ever since Google started rolling out the new design, because in"
And the trouble is the toilet was about 20 meters outside the hall.
[Some laughter].
In the darkness.
"So this poor little, you can imagine what he felt like, he had the pain in his bladder against the fear of that ghost getting him."
So he made a run for it - desperation.
"He ran and he got to the toilet, locked the door."
He'd only been in that toilet for about a few minutes when he heard the steps.
[Laughter].
And it came right to the toilet cubicle he was in and started scratching.
Can you get a scratch..?
[Scratches tissue box].
I tried to get some special effects.. for the tape
[Laughter].
A scratch at the door..and this poor little novice didn't come out of that toilet cubicle for about 3 hours.
[Laughter].
And when he came out he was telling us - the ghost came to get him!
The ghost!
"And he heard it, he heard it scratching."
Another monk saw that ghost..
You know what it was?
It was a civet cat.
Like a possum.
Those of you who've been to Asia know they've got squat toilets.
"The toilets are actually on the floor, and that little possum, civet cat, every evening he would go into that toilet cubicle to get some water to drink from the toilet bowl."
That was his drinking place.
And so that evening all that happened was this little possum walked to that toilet and was scratching the door
"- ""please let me in, I'm thirsty""."
[Laughter].
"But that little novice [laughs], he was a ghost coming to get me!"
"And you can actually see how because of wrong thinking, and because there was a funeral that day, thinking all day, thinking all evening, and what was just a little jungle cat, just coming for a drink, he thought it was a ghost and he was in that toilet for about 3 or 4 hours - poor little novice."
Now what about you?
What do you get afraid of?
I always had to go in there and fiddle them.
"Then another version of WOlips would come out, and I'd have to change the things again."
In ANT 1.6 they added the ability to import one build.xml file into another.
That's a really good thing to do.
"For an example of doing things like that, see the Wonder build system."
"It is really quite complex, but you can find a lot of interesting things in there."
I'm currently redoing our build system so that I have a couple of shared files that all the projects use.
This is what I've ended up for a build file for a WO framework.
"That's it, three lines and a couple properties."
It's a lot easier to maintain.
- OK.
Just one comment on that.
Look at Maven.
You can actually build some awesome tools with Maven.
I think there was a demonstration last year from Jake.
Maven is actually an extremely good tool to build Web Objects.
That's how we build Web Object every night.
We use Maven.
We've got a Maven build system for Web Objects.
It's really awesome.
It takes care of all the dependency.
"It's really reliable, in fact, you don't have to write much code if you accept two of the Maven conventions."
- I don't.
- We use some funky tools.
You can ask Mike.
"Every time I tell him one of them he goes, ""Oh, I want to die."""
"Our build files are highly customized, so I don't know how happy it would be with Maven, but I'm not going to go there."
"There was a question and answer here, I've been doing some questions."
I'm going to skip over this.
"We don't have time to go into the fun topics, but if you want something to talk about over beer tonight..."
"- They're hard to read from this distance, and we'll take that as a good thing."
- It didn't look so bad on the screen.
You just find the root of P and the root of Q and if you check if they're equal.
And then the union operation is simply find the two roots I and then set the idea the first one could be the second one.
"Actually less code than for Quick Find, no fore loops."
There's this one wild loop that we have to worry about a little bit.
But that's a quick and elegant implementation of code to solve the dynamic connectivity problem called
Quick-union.
So now we're going to have to look at can this code be effective for
large problems?
Well unfortunately Quick-union is faster but it's also too slow.
"And it's a little different kind of too slow then for Quick Find, there's times when it could be fast, but there's also times when it could be too slow."
And the defect for Quick-union is that the trees can get too tall.
Which would mean that the find operation would be too expensive.
You could wind up with a long skinny tree.
Of each object just pointing to next and then to do a find operation for object at the bottom would involve going all the way through the tree.
Costing involving in the ray axises just to do the find operation and that's going to be too slow if you have a lot of operations.
"Oh, Opalescence."
Can you just picture it?
"Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
"Why, yes!"
I did make it myself.
Thank you so much for asking.
"Oh, Opal, of course you can help me."
Thank you.
What's that?
You wanna help me more!
"Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?"
Careful now.
Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.
"Howdy, Rarity?"
Shh...
Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
And it is possible.
You just have to splint with something else.
You splint with bamboo and gauze.
And you need several people to pull.
The most important aspect was politeness.
You explained what you were going to do and what they could expect.
Compassion was more important than the medical performance.
My medical training said the opposite.
"You could behave badly, but you had to follow the latest research."
In Africa you did the best you could.
But you could never compromise on how you treated people.
In rough deliveries you could save the mother by fetal skull decompression.
"If the fetus was dead, you had to put a hole in its head to get it out."
It could save the mother's life when it was too late to do a caesarean.
But first you had to explain to the grandmother that the baby was stuck.
"""I can get it out, but the head will be destroyed."""
"- ""No matter."
"Will she live?"""
"- ""Maybe."
"I can't promise anything."""
"You reasoned with the disciplinary board, or else things went bad."
These are the konzo patients.
It's from 21 August 1981.
That's a date that is etched into Hans Rosling's memory.
That day the request for help came on the back of a cinema ticket from a village in the country.
The Italian nun worked as a sort of district nurse.
She wrote that she had 30 crippled women and children with both legs paralyzed.
She'd been nursing for 20 years and never seen anything like it.
The first woman I examined had extremely sharp reflexes.
That means it's a spastic paralysis.
"Sort of like MS, but the symptoms developed in one day."
I saw immediately that I had never seen anything like this before.
Welcome to another tutorial

We hope that you guys will join us a little bit later this afternoon for more of our Innovation Challenge.
"We'll see you then, thanks very much."
(Applause)
Tom Brokay:
Who says that CBS has got a corner on the Amazing Race?
We've got our own going on here on Education Nation.
"I'm joined now by Sal Khan, who, in a fact, is one of the leading innovators of the country, but kind of stumbled into it,"
You were a computer science enthusiast.
Sal:
Yes.
Tom:
You got into the venture capital business.
But you had a niece across the country who was having some difficulties doing her math.
What happened then?
Sal:
"Yes, it was 2004, they were visiting me right after my wedding."
It just turned out.. it came out while we were just talking about it that she was getting tracked into a slower math class when she was going into 7th grade right after the summer.
And I talked to her.
"I said ""Nadia, you are clearly a bright girl --"
And we share a certain amount of DNA --
"There is no way that you should be tracked into a slower math class."""
"And so, she agreed that we would tutor each other, or I would tutor her when she went back."
Tom:
"Okay, I'm gonna note the time here:"
7:47 is when I turned it on.
Doesn't look like it's quite ready for the egg; what I'm looking for to know when it's time to put the egg on is for the oil to sort of spread out on its own.
The induction cooktop doesn't use a lot less electricity than the radiant element; it's just that it uses it for a much shorter time.
And this is probably the best illustration of it.
"If I were using the induction cooktop, my egg would be well along its way by now."
And I'm going to put this in here and I bet it's gonna be a little cool.
"Yeah, it's a little cool for the egg right now."
"As you can see it's being . . . that's a little cooler than I would want to put an egg in, but I'm sort of out of the habit of using the radiant eye, so I forget how to judge that."
"And Amanda likes a little pepper on hers, so actually she likes a LOT of pepper on hers"
[Amanda chuckles]
And now I'm gonna wait for a second because it's got some cooking to do before we're ready to turn it.
I put the egg in too soon.
Should have waited even longer to put it in.
If I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do one of those
"""time passes"" things (Note:"
I'm no real man . . .)
"Okay it's 7:48 now, I guess, so it's been in there for . . ."
Well we'll figure that out.
We'll probably flash it on the screen how long it's been in at this point.
Note: call it 2 minutes 50 seconds so far . . .
"Whatever you do then, Honey, don't let it stop."
Just let it keep rolling.
"I'll let it cook a little bit longer before I try to turn it, because I want to see that middle area there harden up."
You're probably a little close for focus.
(Note:
She was fine . . .)
[Spatula scraping on pan]
Probably turned it sooner than I should have.
[Amanda: looks good.]
Looks good?
Okay.
So this is in meters.
"0.5 meters, so that alone doesn't help us."
We have to be able to figure out the circumference of this tub in order to really be able to figure out the surface area because the circumference times this height will be the surface area.
Point two: they say the height of the tub is one meter.
So they're telling us that this is one meter.
Well that doesn't help us.
That still doesn't tell us how far around the tub goes.
If they had given us the diameter or the radius or the circumference then we could've used our basic geometry to figure out the circumference.
But they didn't.
So either way-- it's a one meter height-- both of these combined still do not allow us to figure out the surface area of this green band.
E again.
Problem 40.
What is the value of integer n?
And n as an integer.
So statement number one: they tell us that n times n plus 1 is equal to 6.
"Now we should already be able to figure this out because n is an integer, n plus 1 is an integer."
So what are the factorizations of 6?
You could have 1 times 6.
"But that doesn't fit n and n plus 1, right?"
This is n and n plus 5.
"You have 2 times 3, which work, right."
"If 2 is n, n plus 1 is 3 and they equal 6."
So let me circle that.
And then what other factorizations?
You don't have any other-- these are all of the factors 6.
"So just looking at the first statement, you know that n has to be equal to 2."
This is the only integer where this is true.
"Actually, let me take a step back."
"No, what if n is negative?"
"Because I was assuming it's a positive integer but they didn't say it's a positive integer, so let me think about that."
"If I did minus 3 times minus 2, that also equals 6 and these are both integers."
"Huh, OK, so this isn't enough."
Or I'll push them away.
It's... it's not something that right now I want to feel in my life.
"For me, it's gotta be my family."
"When you realise the reality of love not lasting, with my parents breaking up."
For me that totally shook everything I knew.
Umm.
"You know, they're the ones who are always meant to be together, that are always meant to love each other."
"It's the most painfull thing that I've ever felt, and it wasn't even me involved in the love."
[soft music continues]
"God's unconditional love, I struggle with."
"I mean, I know it's real... but I struggle to feel it."
"I guess when I've had such a mixed up view of love, that is so painful, when I know that there is an unconditional love, I just don't... it doesn't connect to me."
But I guess to me it's... it doesn't mean that it's not real at all.
I struggle to feel His love.
"I struggle to, to know."
Knowing that there's love.
Out there.
Even though I don't feel it.
Knowing that someone else does.
Knowing that it actually exists.
"Just because I fall, doesn't mean I should crawl for the rest of my life,"
I should get back up.
"And I know that one day, I'll learn to love."
And I'll learn to be loved.
"'Cause I guess for me, where there's another day, there's still hope for it to happen."
"When people have diabetes, their bodies aren't able to keep their blood sugar in balance."
So sometimes they need to take regular doses of a medicine that helps restore that balance.
People with depression have the same  kind of problem with their brain chemicals.
But regular doses of antidepressants can keep these chemicals in balance.
"As a first year intern you have very little free time, so when you finally have a night off, it's important that you do something constructive with it."
Hey man how's it goin?
Hey wait a second.
"Yeah, that's the way I do it, [laughter] it seems to work fairly reliably."
[Coordinator]
"Um, there's a, hang ...There's another question from the phone."
Go ahead.
[indecipherable question]
[Coordinator]
So let me start with that.
"So if you're in a meeting and you're taking notes, ... and you either have voice over off and your headphones on...okay continue with the question."
[Teleconference caller]
That's my question.
[Coordinator]
"That, So your question is, ""When you're in a meeting taking notes, which option do you use""?"
"Or, do you need voice over off when you have your headphones on?"
Do you guys understand the question?
[Panelist]
You definitely need voice over on.
Voice over will work fine with head phones.
[lower tone]
I think that's what she was asking?
[Coordinator]
So Is your quest....is the answer you have voice over on when you have headphones on the answer to your question?
long pause.....[teleconference caller]
"Uh...Yeah, I guess it is."
[undecipherable conversation between two teleconference callers]
You would have to wear your headset otherwise [undecipherable]
[Coordinator]
"If I understand the question correctly, as a Skype user, ah, in setting up whether or not you're going to use the computer's built-in microphone and speaker ah, that is an option that needs to be selected."
"If you're going to use a headset, look forward to the option of listening through the computer speaker the headset speaker, and speaking into the mic."
Does that answer your question?
[Teleconference caller]
Yes.
[Phone coordinator]
That's one way to think about it.
"But there are other ways which would describe the same quantity, right?"
"I could have divided the cake into six pieces, and picked two of those pieces."
Right?
"So, the one third we normally write one over three, and this thing we might say two parts of six, and we could write two over six, and we see, already, another issue, which is what?"
"We have two different fractions, but they represent the same thing."
Right?
Sorry my microphone is... it really is falling.
Ok.
"So, this brings us to a concept here, which is... ok, well, we have two ways of representing the same thing."
Two ways of representing the same thing.
These two things are in some sense... we want them to be equi... equivalent.
[Laughter].
Equivalent.
Ok?
"So maybe we want to set up a construction that's... where we define fractions in terms of equivalence relations, ok?"
How are we going to do that?
What will the equivalence relation be?
"So, how about this?"
"Let's take any construction like... any picture like this, and if I want the associated fraction,"
I'll think of one over three as an ordered pair.
"So maybe I'll do the following, in the first picture I'm picking one part out of three, and in the second picture I'm picking two parts out of six, and I'll think of these as equivalent ordered pairs."
Ok?
"And to make this a sentence, I might say write that as equivalent ordered pairs, period."
All right?
Ok.
"And then, what I will do, if I can is, once I figure out what all the things that are in the... that are equivalent are, the idea is that these belong to some equivalence class."
That might have lots of other things in it.
Right?
Like ten coma thirty.
Right?
Or a hundred and twenty one coma... why do I torture myself?
"And of course it's heating up as all of this is happening, so my egg, my scrambled egg's gonna cook a lot faster than Amanda's is."
"Since we're using this anyway, I'm going to go ahead and set the warming zone (which we don't have with the induction cooktop)."
"You need to back up 'cause it won't, yeah,"
"What I just did is to set the warming zone, which is this little thing right here, which will keep Amanda's egg warm while I cook mine."
That's one of those conveniences we're about to give up.
Okay.
"Now Amanda's egg is done, and here's mine already mixed up."
[sound of sizzling oil in pan]
That's more like the temperature you'd want to have.
You can hear it bubbling and sizzling.
Note:
4 minutes 46 seconds so far . . .
This one's gonna cook nice and fast.
It's had time to warm up now.
Now it won't be long before I'll be able to turn this off.
So we'll figure that out.
"Probably after I flip it one time, we'll be able to turn the radiant element off, knowing that the rest of it will cook by itself okay."
"Yeah, I think I feel safe now to go ahead and turn it back off."
Note:
Power off at 6 minutes 16 seconds.
"So whatever time I just turned it off, that's the time elapsed for that radiant element."
Then we'll just let that sit in the pan and finish cooking.
And then the next time we do this we'll use the induction cooktop.
"A equals 1, b equals 5 and c equals 6."
Since we should have ax squared plus bx plus c.
"Equals 0, of course."
"Do you remember that pink dress I bought, with green flowers?"
"Well, last week I wore it at work and everyone went"
"""Alex, it's gorgeous, you look beautiful in it!"" and all"
"Brigitte was green with envy, you see."
"The day after, she comes to work with the same dress!"
That bitch!
Oh! -- it's trick.
It's a gimmick to crawl into a corner and wait there until somebody comes to your rescue.
I'm admitting it.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm not being phony.
I'm not pretending I'm so brave.
I resent that.
"I feel like you're saying, unless I come out openly and stand on my own"
I'm not a phony.
Bologna!
I'm just as real sitting in that corner as I am out here all by myself.
But you're not sitting in that corner.
"Well, I'm not now."
We're on problem 27.
"They tell us if i is equal to the square root of minus 1, then what is 4 times i-- that's an i-- times 6 times i?"
"Well, multiplication is associative."
You can switch the order around.
"So this is the same thing as 4 times 6 times i times i, or the same thing as 24 times i squared, right?"
"If we square both sides of this, you get i squared is equal to negative 1."
So this is 24 times negative 1.
"So this is minus 24, which is choice C."
"Next problem, 28."
They want to know what an equivalent form of 3 plus i is.
"A lot of times, people don't like either when you have a square root in the denominator or they don't like it when you have an a complex number in the denominator."
A complex number is just something that has part real and part imaginary.
So the way you can do it with this case is you multiply times the conjugate of this number.
"I know that sounds like a fancy word, but all it means is you take the opposite of the imaginary part."
So what's the conjugate?
"Remember, the only way you cannot change a fraction is if you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing, because then you're multiplying by 1."
So what's the conjugate of this?
The conjugate of 3 plus i is 3 minus i.
Ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
"Now, mostly we're looking for correct code."
"If you wrote some more tests, you may start to have some more confidence in the code that we have."
We're also considering efficiency to some degree.
It seems like there's a big problem with the efficiency of the program we have so far.
Let me show you one of the issues.
"Now we represented states as a (here, there, t) triplet."
"The problem with this is there can be two states that have identical here and there's but differ in the t, and they're going to be considered different states."
Why is that a problem?
Consider this problem.
"We have two people--one who takes 1 unit to cross the bridge, and one who takes 1000."
It seems pretty clear there is an easy solution.
The two of them go across together.
"It takes 1000, but look how we're going to explore this space."
"We're going to start out in the initial state that took time 0, and then we're going to start adding things to the frontier."
"Out of all the ways we could cross, the one that adds the least is for the 1 to go across by himself."
Now he's on the other side with the 1 on the other side and the 1000 on the original side.
That only took 1 step.
Now what's the fastest thing we can do after that?
We could take 1 more step and go back to the original state.
Here we had 1 and we'll call K for the 1000 on the left-hand side.
Here K was left behind and 1 went over to the right.
"Here we took one more time unit, and we had 1, K on this side."
"If we continue taking the fastest step we can, we'll get to another distinct state where K is on this side and 1 is on the other side."
The flashlight is always going with the 1.
"It's part of your job to convince yourself that you feel comfortable with it, and."
The blue dots are the only things you save.
"Now, let's take a look at this when we scale it."
"Cuz, nobody's going to solve this thing on a for, fiv, four by four domain."
"Right, I mean, you're going to need a lot more points."
"You might say, I'm going to chop up my X domain into a 100 points."
"And then you spy that thing and, boom, this things huge, 10,000 by 10,000 matrix."
Okay so this is kinda what we're looking at.
We're going to be working with that matrix.
Now you see how white that is?
That's cuz there's all zeros there.
You don't want to save all that.
You know how many components you'd have to save?
"10,000 by 10,000."
"I'll let you do the math, in your head."
"Right, this is huge."
"Ten to the five squared if you want to save this in memory, you gotta eat up all that memory to save a bunch of zeros."
Spdiags changes your game.
Bring you up a level because now you can do this thing with sparse extinct.
"Now, one last thing I want to do."
"Let's go back down to five, and we're not on these five, we're going to say, hey, what's the determinant of that matrix?"
"Huh, that's not zero."
Ten to the seventeen.
If you see a number like this.
That's bad okay.
So the condition number is the measure you want to look for cuz that determiner actually said oh by the time I was three that's not done yet that's pretty far away from zero all things considered.
The problem really comes if you look at the condition number.
"Anything you're like when you start gaining ten of five, ten of six you're kind of like ooo that's looking singular."
Ten of seventeen says dude I am totally singular.
"To you,"
That's the interpretation of that.
"Okay, If I, wrote mat lab, I would have a"
-Get out of the dryer.
[laughter continues]
"-You know, when I wash my bitches, I make sure to dry them on medium heat."
"And I always make sure to throw in a dryer sheet,"
"'cause, you know, you don't want your bitches to get too clingy."
Why was that chick in the dryer anyway?
Was this a dare of some sort?
"Either way, this got about 100,000 views in over a month."
"If you notice when they pull her out, it looks like the dryer is giving birth to Snooki."
"And props to the guy who uploaded this footage, because you know, when your friend gets stuck in the dryer, your immediate reaction should be to be to pull out your cell phone and film it,"
'cause that's what friends are for.
I also noticed that one dude took full advantage of the situation and was like touching her ass.
"Now, I'm not condoning that, I'm just saying it happened."
"You know, I'd say this video deserves more than 100,000 views."
As long as you aren't watching it like...
"""Oh, s--t."
"That looks like a good idea."""
"Yeah, stay out of the dryer guys."
"Your dirty ass will leave all kinds of s--t in the lint trays. all right, this last video, I didn't want to cover it, 'cause it's kind of dumb, but admittedly, it's got over 8,000,000 views in four days."
Geezus.
"And I don't know why, but maybe you'll think it's funny."
"So there's this Chicago news show, and they're trying to get the destruction of this bridge live on film for their show."
"So they're live and they wait and they wait and they wait and they wait but the bridge doesn't blow up, so they cut away for a second."
-When we did the live remote of the guy dressed as a taco parachuting out of a plane into the plastic pool of salsa.
"-While we're stalling, go ahead and show the picture, but today, as we get going..."
-Are you kidding me?
Who did that?
-Wow!
-Are you kidding?
"-Yeah, they missed it."
"Yeah, fayul."
"See that's my new thing, it's not my new thing."
"One looking at a half a million, a million, and two million seeds per acre drilled, and broadcasting, where we just toss it out on the ground."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Another big question is simply determining when in the fall we need to plant, so I have successive planting dates, starting at September 1, all the way up here to November 30."
And looking at what is the best time to plant.
Can we do it right after corn?
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So the pennycress is crop that you're using to put into the field in the alternate season.
"So you're still going to have corn or beans, and then this goes in afterwards?"
Win Phippen:
Yes.
"Typically, on pennycress, we would follow corn."
So you would plant after the corn comes out.
"And this would form a rosette, just a bundle of leaves, into the fall, it will overwinter just fine."
And it will start flowering in early spring.
And it will be at this stage by the end of May.
And you would hope to harvest that by the first week of June.
And then you'll plant a full season of soybean right behind it.
And so the real niche for this crop is growing off-season crop production.
"It's called ""double cropping."""
Beth Seaton:
And this is what the Field Day is going to be about tomorrow; people are going to come out so they can
learn more about pennycress and what you're doing out here?
Win Phippen:
Absolutely.
We're trying to answer all the basic questions you would ask on any sort of new crop you're introducing.
"Because this is strictly for the bio-diesel market, we're not making a feed crop or anything like that."
It's strictly for off-season bio-diesel production.
So we've got a lot of studies out here.
"What we'll look at, in terms of, what kind of nitrogen does it need?"
Scientists were studying sharks off the coast of Florida using an acoustic tracking system.
"In the shallow bay, a locator signal every 15 minutes tracked their movements."
"Then one day, the sharks just disappeared."
And no one knew why.
"At the time, people had bigger problems."
A category four storm was bearing down on the Gulf Coast.
[thunder]
"Analyzing the data, scientists discovered sharks detected the drop in barometric pressure preceding the storm."
They bolted from their shallow nursery to the safety of deeper waters.
"Twelve hours later,"
Hurricane Charlie ripped across Florida.
"When the storm was over, the sharks returned."
"Reef sharks kick off the Survivor countdown because, thanks to incredible senses, they dodge disaster."
"Other animals are not so lucky-- battling adversity for days, months, or years."
One fifth of the Earth's surface is desert.
Baking hot.
Bone dry.
To survive here takes a special kind of animal... and special humans to catch them.
"In the Outback of Australia, these guys are hunting the next survivor sprinting into number 9-- the camel."
"Introduced in the 19th century, camels thrived in the arid land."
Now they're pests.
Rounded up and sent back to the Middle East.
Try running through a desert without water or shade... and you'd be dead in a day.
Camels barely break a sweat.
Camels can go eight days without water.
One secret for survival is on their back.
Camels store fat--not water-- in their hump.
It's a portable pantry.
"By burning all the fat in its hump, a camel can survive without food for up to a month."
"When a camel finds water, it soaks it up like a sponge."
A thirsty animal chugs 30 gallons in 13 minutes.
"Try that at home, and your blood cells would burst."
"Next, position yourself behind her."
It's not the time yet.
(Queen Mother) It's not time yet.
It's not the time yet.
It's not the time yet.
You can get a son only by finish together.
It's not the time yet.
You can get a son only by finish together.
(Queen Mother) You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.
"It is time to head to the bed chamber, now."
"You Majesty, if the Queen Mother finds out about this ..."
What has happened?
I couldn't even ask because of the leery mood in the royal kitchen.
I don't know why but every one's avoiding me.
"No matter what, we need to find the head chef."
Your Highness.
Do you know something?
Tell me.
It's just ... if she isn't dead...
I once heard when eunuchs were talking of a place ...
"From the basement corridor of the main building, past the  workers area, there is a passage to a lower floor entrance"
The place has no daylight and dust snows down all day ...
"There are people who study psychology,whoever studies  Pirkei Avot in depth understands the depths of a person's soul on an amazing level."
There is a lecture series on the Hidabroot website about Pirkei Avot and people tell me how much  it benefits them when they study the wisdom of Chazal in  Pirkei Avot.
In general you know that Torah study enhances your knowledge.
"If a person goes to a lecture for a few months,he feels a change."
"In fact it says abut our Torah that if you ""turn it and turn it you'll find everything in it"" Just like a box that has all kinds of objects in it,if you turn it you'll find everything in it."
Same for the Torah.Whatever you  want you can find.
"For example,when a person learns  Pirkei Avot it's as if he took a course in psychology.He learns""He who is rich is happy with his lot"""
"""He who is mighty,conquers his evil inclination"""
"Key to a healthy diet is a variety of foods, a variety of colors."
You get everything from this.
"And then you build your walls with the legumes, the beans."
"And you got the whole grains, the wheat, the pasta, the spaghetti, the rice, the breads, and on top, your roof, you get your nuts and seeds."
"You can get everything from this, everything."
"All your vitamins, A, B, C. Vitamin D from the sun."
"You get all your calcium , all your iron, your omega-3, all your protein and amino acids."
"Everything from this, everything."
"Now I know I am a skinny white dude with glasses telling you to get enough protein, but these guys aren't skinny."
Only one of them is white.
"So as you can see these guys, their diet consists of no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
There might be some variations.
"Tony Gonzalez, he might be eating fish."
Don't hold me to it.
"But I know Prince Fielder, who is the 2009 home run derby king, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
"Mac Danzig, who fights in the ultimate fighter, he is a season 1 champion, UFC fighter, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
So you can still excel at your sports.
You can still gain muscle mass on a plant based diet.
"Again, just remember the gorilla."
So what do they eat?
"Instead of dairy everything a meat eater, a dairy eater an egg eater eats,"
"I eat as well, that just comes in plant form."
"No cruelty involved, no cholesterol, high in fiber."
And these are all the processed food.
This is the transition food.
This is where you go when you go from eating meat and you make that switch.
Instead of poultry.
Instead of beef.
"Garden burger, veggie burger."
"Right here what you see up here, this is one of the best items on the market."
"Again, not the healthiest food in the world, but certainly better than your meat."
This is called the Riblets.
"I don't like these one halves lying around, so let's multiply both sides, this equation, by 2."
I'm just gonna multiply both sides by two.
"So, on the left hand side, I'm just left with (a+b) squared, and on the right hand side, I'm left with 2ab and then two times one half c squared, i.e., plus c squared."
What happens if you multiply out (a+b) times (a+b)?
We get (a+b) squared.
That is a sq. + 2ab+ b sq. = 2ab + c sq.
"Subtracting 2ab from both sides, we are left with, a sq. + b sq. = c sq. i.e. the Pythagorean theorem."
OK.
"What we see here, is a 3D maze."
"It's actually HTML, CSS3, and a bit of Javascript but the CSS3 is 3-dimensional CSS."
"What we've got is a whole bunch of cubes, stacked in bars, and we've got one red ball in the upper left corner."
"And I can move that ball with the buttons up on top to the right, down..."
Why?
"Because there's cubes that are opened and cubes that are closed, which are part of the maze set-up."
"The proof of concept is created with one singular maze, in the end product it will be possible to incorporate different mazes."
I can move the ball by clicking the correct button.
"I just went right and as you see, there's a little marker line that says I moved to a different bar."
"Now I can't go anywhere else,"
"I can go back left, that's where I came from,"
"I can go back right or come forth, and this way"
I can walk through the entire maze.
The objective of the maze is to clear the maze.
"Rather, the objective of the game is to clear the maze."
"On this side there is one more block open, that has no front."
"If I go through there,"
I'm out of the maze and I will not be able to use any of the buttons anymore.
"I can only go back and forth, I can go down, and I can walk my way all around through the maze."
Just like this.
"Oops, can't do that."
I can come forth and left and forth and left...
"Well, you get the idea."
Now this maze obviously is quite simple.
- You cannot even touch her shadow.
You said I cant even touch her shadow?
I am going to marry Shailu.
Venkat weds Shailaja.
If anybody try to obstruct Venkat kills anybody.
I like you O Nijam girl and you are my princess
Welcome my dear prince and take this young beauty with you
If you give me your hand I will take.. ..you atop the elephant with me
Arrange for the musical band for our marriage.
I will come with you
This girl has eagerly accepted my proposal
Let us come together and steal each others hearts
Talk sweetly and open the treasure of my beauty
You too became intelligent
Because you pampered me
I laid a path of jasmines for you.
Come to me running
I heart found the priest of love and could not escape from him
Be the deity in the temple of my heart
I am intoxicated with your love and come to you
I will blow away with you like a gale
My shyness became an hurdle
I will drive it away by kissing your cheek
Drown me with your kisses and lift me in your embrace
Become the beautiful day once and a lovely night once
We must be exited each time we embrace
I lost all my prestige.
"When he was kissing you in front of your father.. ..and everybody, you didnt say a single word."
She is being ecstatic about it.
You took an oath by your mother.. ..does he became important than her?
I took oath of mom that I will act in movies not to forget him.
It is unnecessary for me to live any more.

Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered.
He became a recluse.
"Dodged by death, he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria."
NT:
"Everything I did, I did for mankind, for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich, where products of intellect, science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life."
MT:
"Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January, 1943."
His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.
His legacy is with us still.
"Tesla became the man who lit the world, but this was only the beginning."
Tesla's insight was profound.
NT:
"Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear, and the coal deposits are exhausted?"
MT:
Tesla thought he had the answer.
We are still asking the question.
Thank you.

There was one huge possibility created by the emergence of money as a system of mutual trust.
A possibility that would revolutionize world history.
It was the idea that you could rely on people to borrow money from you and pay it back at some future date.

"We're gonna be,"
"I just want to let parents know at home, we're gonna be talking about some mature material here."
"So, if there are kids in the room, you may want to have them go somewhere else for a little bit."
"Um, we're going to give you a second to do that."
Star:
"She's the mother, she made sure of that."
[laughter]
Elisabeth:
Exactly.
Elisabeth:
"Um, you actually define yourself as an asexual."
You have an organization.
You're pretty much the spokesperson for asexuality.
"You have this organization with, what?"
"6,000 members?"
So that's choice D.
"The hard part here, as far as I'm concerned, is just understanding the problem and their diagram."
And then just seeing the pattern that you're just switching the letters.
First you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
Then you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
"Until you get back to A, B, C."
Next problem.
White I don't think is colorful enough.
Let me do magenta.
19.
In a set of 11 different numbers-- they're different- which of the following cannot affect the value of the median?
"So it's a set of 11 different numbers, they're different, so let's say it's 1 through 11."
That's 11 different numbers.
"And in this case, what's the median?"
"Well we have 5 on this side, 5-- the median is this, this is the middle number, right?"
6 is the middle number.
"Doubling each number-- well, if you double every number, the median's going to become 12, so that's not right."
"Increasing each number by 10-- once again, if you increase all of these numbers by 10, this number's going to be 16, so you would've changed the median."
Increasing the smallest number only.
"Well, what if you increase the smallest number to,"
"I don't know, 12?"
So then this 12 would go all the way on the other side right?
And then the median would move to 7 because you would have to have 5 below the median and 5 above the median.
So you can increase that smallest number.
"But if you increase it by a large enough amount, it kind of goes into the greater than the median column and then the median would have to shift to the right."
"Try it out, write out the list from 2 to 12, and then the median becomes 7."
"OK, so we know that choice B is not right."
"Choice C, increasing-- oh no, that was choice C-- choice D, decreasing the largest number only-- well, the same argument can apply."
"We could take the 11 and decrease it down to,"
"I don't know, decrease it to 0."
"Sir, if you saw someone eating insects... ...on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?"
"- Probably, yes."
- So can you say with confidence... ...that the behavior you saw in your daughter's bedroom... ...could not be the behavior of someone suffering from psychosis?
I don't know.
She never had any problems like that before.
It just didn't feel that way to me or to Father Moore.
"- And you trusted him, right?"
- Yes.
He is our parish priest.
Fair enough.
"And after that night, would you say that you... ...put your daughter entirely in Father Moore's care?"
Yes.
We had done all we could.
We said she was in his hands now... ...body and soul.
Thank you.
"No further questions, Your Honor."
"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
You may step down.
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
I am currently a professor of anthropology and psychiatry... ...at Northwestern University.
Where did you receive your education?
"At Yale, and then at Cambridge."
And what is your specific area of expertise?
I study the spiritual experiences of people in various cultures... ...and the physiological and psychological changes... ...they undergo during these experiences.
Would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
Yes.
"""Possession"" is one term for a basic human experience... ...reported by a great number of people all around the world."
"In my fieldwork, I've seen many people who experienced... ...a sense of being invaded by an entity from the supernatural realm."
Why do you think Emily was invaded?
Why did this possession happen to her?
Based on my study of the case file... ...I believe that Emily Rose was a hypersensitive.
"A person with an unusual connection... ...to what Carlos Castaneda called ""the separate reality."""
"I'll send him another bucket of Yemeni almonds, he loves Yemeni almonds."
"If you look at all these guys, they're just ordinary people who have good days, bad days, successes, failures, setbacks, everything."
Where they differed is in the fear department.
That's where they differed.
They did not allow the possibility of failure to stop them from trying again and again and again.
We have seen J.K.Rowling.
Twelve times.
That's the key.
"That's the key, right there."
"See, as long as you're still trying, as long as you are still in the game, the game hasn't ended."
You are still working on it.
You haven't failed.
"You fail when you throw in the towel, when you give up."
"And then, you are the one who has announced that failure."
Nobody else has done it.
"You are the one who announced failure, yourself."
"In the mid 1970s, when I was in my 20s,"
"- it's kind of difficult to believe I was ever in my 20s - but, yeah that did happen sometimes in the last century."
I was in Abu Dhabi trying to build my life.
"I had to sleep in the beach, not because I love beaches, but because I was thrown out of my home by the landlord."
"We were 8 guys of us staying in one room, one day, the landlord came  and threw us out."
He found another tenant who paid him more.
So what do I do?
"Well, you do what you have to do."
I went to sleep in the beach.
"In fact, my morning shower was in the mosque nearby, which helped me discover gold, and that's a different story."
It took many years to happen.
"At that time, I was about 21, 22 looking at myself."
I was looking at a failure.
"I mean, how do you actually build your life when you have no roof in an expensive city like Abudhabi at the age of 20-22?"
"Many years later, it occurred to me that what I was looking at is not failure."
"I was looking at the building blocks of character that will make you one day appreciate, strive and if ever you succeed, realize that you succeeded."
Outliers get squared.
Right?
"So if you're really bad, you square it, to get even that much worse."
Okay?
"Now, it could be that, in fact, that outlying data shouldn't take up that much importance, but when you do the"
L^ The square fit with the L2.
You square that distance and you put it into that thing.
Where is if you do L1?
"You just take the distance and leave it, you don't square it."
Okay.
How does it impact this example?
Well let's see.
I'm gonna put in some outliers.
"So I'm gonna add a couple data set points here here's my data, here's what I'm gonna add at .5, it's at 3.8 and at 3.9 Now, let's try it."
"Okay, there is are results, so I added a couple points, outliers to the data."
And now You can see there's a pretty pronounced difference between the L2 and the L1.
"And then, we can talk about, well, what's best?"
"So, first of all, that's question doesn't even make sense."
"Because when we say, what's best, you could say, well, if it's an L2 sense, clearly, the red line is best because it minimizes the L2."
"So, best here is."
"Akward, mathematically its best and best by the eye."
And then look at the magenta line.
The magenta line really doesn't change because of the outliers.
"Right, hardly influenced by them, shifted slightly."
The red took a huge tilt.
"So some would argue that when we answer the question about what is best, that in fact, the magenta is best, cuz it does not react to the outliers, and the only reason that red, and that red line got way shifted, because it's trying to compensate for these points that are way out squared the distance analysis and this red line doesn't do the job at all, bottom points or the top points, doesn't, doesn't do well anywhere."
"But the L1 says, tell you what, I got most of them right, I got a couple of outliers."
"But by the way, nobody is gonna get the ou tliers right, so I'll try to get the bulk of them right."
Does that make sense?
"Okay, that's the L1 norm."
All right.
So curve fits.
"It builds a pearl around it to smooth out the sand, and that's what our memories are really."
"We forget all the bad things, or a lot of them, or they're dulled."
We dull the emotions.
"But with Jill, she's right there."
"For instance, her mother, a dancer, remembers saying the usual one or two things about her daughter's weight gain."
Jill has the days and dates.
She'll not realize that she said 500 times.
She'll think she's said it one time.
"And it has caused a weight problem for her, but there's nothing I could do about it anymore."
"Jill wants us to know that too much memory, living in the past, is paralyzing."
It's uncontrollable.
"I actually probably should be in a mental hospital because this makes me crazy, but I figured out a way to live with this."
Think about your junior year in high school.
Now what can you remember?
Doctor Cahill and Doctor McGaugh of the University of California
Irvine say there's something else they've
"learned about that mysterious part of Jill's brain, which is larger than usual."
It's an area associated with OCD.
We believe that she has strong tendencies towards obsessive-compulsive.
"Could her brain be storing an infinity of memories, just as some OCD patients hoard things?"
We don't think it is an accident that the tendency to collect is both for objects and for memories.
"We think these are related, and we think the brain does it, and we want to figure out how."
"Do you save things, hoard things?"
"I don't like the word hoard, but yeah."
I have the first doll that was put in my crib.
I have the first gift that was given to me when I was born.
This is my notebook from senior year in high school.
Have you tried drugs?
What kind of drugs?
Antidepressants.
That doesn't work either.
There is only one thing they did make a dramatic difference.
"You have to work so hard to form the letters, that it's hard to do that and spell at the same time."
And it's hard to do that and have good ideas at the same time.
You're so good spatially--
Dr. Levine tells Nathan his strengths can help overcome his weaknesses.
"For example, his ability to draw this complicated design from memory can help him visualize facts like history dates that otherwise he would forget."
Remembering dates is a lot of detail.
But it won't be a lot of detail for you if you make a diagram of it and remember it as a visual pattern.
I have evidence that you're very smart.
You need to convince yourself of that.
"It was probably the first time he's heard somebody-- since the second grade teacher-- tell them how great he was, instead of ADD, you know, this huge thing."
It was really specific and it was something that seems manageable.
So it's very encouraging.
"But Nathan's parents think he needs one other thing, discipline."
"One year later, the ranks of the Hargrave Military Academy include Nathan Suggs."
"We get a lot of boys that are very smart and intelligent, have a lot of potential."
But for whatever reason they come here because they do not think they can do it.
Cadet Suggs.
"For his parents, sending their son here is a big sacrifice."
But they believe it's his big chance.
"For this year, we cleaned out his college fund and my parents also contributed."
"And so, I don't know exactly what we would do for next year."
I love you.
I love you.
I've missed you so much.
He lives at Hargrave.
And this fall has been very difficult for me.
"But I'm hoping that he will take in some of the discipline, make it his own."
I'm feeling happier.
I have more self discipline.
I'll probably have more than I have now at the end of the year.
And it will probably be a whole lot easier.
You look so nice.
"I'm looking at a list of your published articles, doctor."
You've been quite busy and prolific.
"So based on your time spent with Holy Roller snake-handlers... ...voodoo priestesses and Indians tripping on peyote buds... ...based on observing these bizarre individuals... ...you've concluded that possession is... ...a basic, typical human experience?"
"I must say, counselor... ...that's quite a laundry list of disdain... ...and one that thoroughly mischaracterizes my research."
"No, I don't think possession is a typical experience."
But I am convinced that it is a scientifically verified... ...culturally universal one.
Have you ever used Gambutrol in your studies... ...to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
Absolutely not.
That would be dangerous to the patient.
"So this notion of Gambutrol locking someone in a possessed state... ...the key to your assertion that her medical treatment harmed Emily... ...this would be your own pet theory, correct?"
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
Sustained.
"Although I think he's just taking a page from your book, counselor."
No further questions.
Erin!
I've got a doctor who wants to testify.
"He's an eyewitness, Erin."
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.
- What?
- He called us.
"Dr. Graham Cartwright, Department of Abnormal Psychiatry... ...at St. Mary's Hospital."
Dr. Cartwright.
Ring a bell?
Yes.
He was there?
- Yes.
"- Father... ...if you want me to defend you, you've got to give me... ...all the information I need."
With all of this medical testimony helping the prosecution... ...how could you not tell me that a doctor attended the exorcism?
He asked that I keep his involvement confidential... ...and I said I would.
And the Pentecostal Church accepts that a member has a legal abortion.
This was 1948.
I lived in the Luthagen district of Uppsala.
"We had one room, a kitchen, a privy in the yard and cold running water."
I remember Mom doing the laundry by hand with a washing board.
"A washing machine requires electricity, steel and detergent."
And it consumes energy.
But almost everyone in Sweden uses one.
Even the core of the environmental movement.
They probably use a low temperature and only good chemicals.
But if you ask Swedes if everyone in India should have a washing machine many would say that not every Indian household should.
They don't get that people are all the same.
"If I have a washing machine, so should everyone else."
People think Indians shouldn't have washing machines?
Not if they think about it.
But that's the general reaction.
Isn't it really that they're poor and can't afford one?
Consider the planning for how much electricity is needed on earth.
"Work out what we need for lighting, a washing machine, radio and TV."
That gives you the power we need.
None of my students have suggested that the world should be planned for that consumption.
"They hope ""those"" people will be playing flutes under the mango tree."
Isn't that a very generalized image of the students?
"There's a lot of variation, but a surprisingly large number hope that development will stop."
They think it's unsustainable.
We often hear that we already live beyond our means.
"""Everyone can't live like us."
"All Chinese people can't have cars."""
That's what we usually hear.
But the world can't function if we don't all live about the same.
How can the world unite if we don't live in the same conditions?
There's such appeal in having electricity and having some kind of holiday.
I didn't nail it.
I screwed it up.
"Christine, let's go, please."
(Christine) I sauteed some onions with scallops and chicken stock that I had infused with smashed garlic and chili peppers.
You were almost frazzled by this dish.
"You have a extraordinary palate, but I think that one is subpar."
"Next up, Ryan."
"We have portobello, dried shiitake, and morel mushrooms."
I made a duxelle out of the three of them so that I can incorporate the mushrooms in every bite.
The consistency of the risotto itself was spot on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good technique&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the rice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Good job.
- Thank you very much.
"- All right, Scott."
"- Good luck, Scotty."
Let's do this.
This elimination challenge is definitely a chance for me to redeem myself with the judges.
"It means everything to show them that I can not only just bounce back, but actually really shine."
You think this has it?
Is this gonna be good?
I went back to where I normally cook.
I went as simple and core as I could to let the risotto speak for itself.
Seven ingredients in this entire dish.
- The texture's nice.
"- Thank you, chef."
Huge improvement over the last dish that we saw.
"A spirited effort, and, uh, welcome back to the contest."
"Thank you, Joe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So the next risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we want to taste&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is from Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Joe is definitely the scariest judge.
"He's the judge to win over, and, if I can do that, then the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; title is definitely mine."
"I made a pistachio, cranberry, cherry, and gooseberry risotto."
What's this?
What is this baby powder-looking stuff?
"Standard adult size is going to be a 22 gauge, 1 to 1 and a 1/2 inch length, 22-23 gauge for intramuscular."
It's going to be a smaller gauge and a shorter length for small children.
You might have a 3/8 inch for an infant perhaps instead of 1/2 inch.
"I have a very small set of 1 inch or 1 and a 1/2, its going to be very short; 1/2 inch, 3/8, something like that."
Ok so select the appropriate size needle and syringe.
[ Pause ]
I'm going to clean the top of my medication bottle.
"I've done my 5 rights, I've done my 3 label checks to make sure I have the right medication."
[ Pause ]
I'm going to put the amount of air that I need to pull back the same amount of volume of medication to displace my volume and my... [ Pause ]
...ampule; my vial.
Get rid of the bubbles.
[ Pause ]
Drop your medication.
"Again, this is sterile."
I'm going to need to carefully recap it.
Alright so now I go into my patient's room and I position my patient in the appropriate spot so that I can administer the injection.
"For this particular medication, I want to use the ventrogluteal muscle."
Remember that's the most recommended in the literature to use for your injections.
So our anatomical landmarks with the heel of your hand.
I'm using my opposite hand to the patient's hip so this is their right hip and my left hand.
"I find the head of the femur and then with my index finger,"
I find the anterior superior spine.
I move my middle finger along the crest to open it.
Open my hand.
Alright.
This is the pelvis here and this is bone.
"This is a little tight as I walk my finger down, I can see that it has a lot of give there and this would be the sweet spot of the muscle; the give of the muscle."
I'm going to use my new alcohol.
Make a nice big circular cleaning out.
Ok.
Now I have to keep my hand on the anatomical landmarks because it's a very small injection site so I can't take my hand away.
"We're going to have to draw a lot of things, we're going to have to draw a lot of states."
That's kind of difficult.
And the answer was yes.
That's the point.
"It's these little pieces and these little touches that don't necessarily have a practical purpose that demonstrate to people that hey, if they thought that much about this, then think about how much work they put into the actual search results."
"Now, you have to be careful with this because it's a very, very strong message to send."
You have to make sure that your product backs it up.
So how do we apply this to thinking to products?
"Well, it doesn't have to be the large things."
"The Pac-Man example, the effort to actually make the game was a lot smaller than to produce the search results."
But simply ask yourself this question.
What are the things that I can do that I don't have to?
"So that said, here's a couple pieces of reading that we recommend that you look into to find out more about some of these topics, like affordances and natural mapping, an in Don"
"Norman's book, or the mental models in Alan Cooper's classic, About Face."

CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"Yes, the wounds lasted for some time."
And did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
I believe they were stigmata.
"By that, you mean supernatural injuries... ...that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ?"
Yes.
"Stigmata are a sign, a mark indicating one is touched by God."
"After that night, why do you think Emily refused another exorcism?"
I believe she'd accepted her fate.
Is there anything else you'd like to say about Emily?
No.
The defense rests.
Father Moore attaches divine significance... ...to the wounds on Emily's hands and feet.
Why?
Because he sees them as confirmation of what he wants to believe.
"That Emily was a saint, touched by the hand of God."
I'm afraid the truth is far less inspiring.
"Because the truth is, by the time these miraculous wounds appeared... ...Emily had already shown a tendency to injure herself... ...and simply did so again on one of the barbed-wire fences... ...surrounding the Rose family farm."
Father Moore's beliefs are based on archaic and irrational superstition.
Emily suffered because she was sick... ...not because she was a saint.
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.
"And in here, facts are what must matter."
And these are the facts of this case:
"Emily Rose had epilepsy, which caused psychosis."
"And, given time, medicine would have cured her."
But it didn't.
Why?
"Because Father Richard Moore convinced Emily... ...that she wasn't ill, that she didn't need medicine."
And in the weeks leading up to her death... ...when she was clearly in need of medical treatment... ...he failed to have her hospitalized.
So... ...the defense has given us an extraordinary... ...creative explanation for the events that led to this.
"Ladies and gentlemen, don't you believe it."
"Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil that did this to Emily Rose."
"It was accepted, but they, they said, you know, do you have something on cancer?"
[laugh]
"So, naturally, he was younger and needed publications more than I did."
"So I, I sort of fell on my sword."
[laugh].
"Withdrew my paper from the Annals of Epidemiology and, and combined it with his and the New England Journal took it."
"Wow, yeah."
So even I was faced with a salami problem as an author.
"So those our the, the things Yeah, sorting those things out Yes Early can be very helpful."
And what do you think is if you have to point to one thing that number one mistake that scientist make when submitting their paper for publication?
I think it's overconfidence in how important.
And how good there study is.
[laugh].
"You know, you've worked on it really hard."
Yeah.
And done your best to write it up.
And this was an important topic or question that was really important to you.
"And you think, oh gosh, this is really an important finding, but others may not value it so I. [laugh]."
"So if it gets rejected I would do this, some factor like that."
"I would persist, I think it's important to persist and submit it elsewhere."
Fix it and submit it elsewhere.
"Yeah, finding the right journal for it might be the."
"Might be the key, yeah."
Right but you know just because you've devoted a year or two to this project you think its really important don't assume that other people will place it as high priority as you do.
"Yeah, yeah that's a good point and I have to profess you go give some advice to authors about writing style because you've written a number of editorials in American Journal of Epidemiology dealing with writing."
Mm-hm.
Right.
So what advice do you have to the writing?
"Well, I guess clarity and conciseness are what I would put as the highest priority."
Characteristics of writing avoid repetition.
Sometimes people will say something in the introduction and then repeat it in the discussion.
"Avoid that or they'll say something in the method section, which gets repeated in results."
"I have D, I have a D 70 too, earlier with the, the."
"Yeah, the, but this new one's nice, very nice, the, the busier ones now, although I really help with the multimedia stuff."
"Um, I'm gonna look and see if we have something coming up on that."
Um.
"While I'm looking up the D800, what types of courses would be most helpful for you coming up?"
"Um, do you, do you I ike the longer courses where you can just go in and pick out a movie?"
Or would you like shorter more direct project type courses?
"Um, I would say well, for the subject matter, I mean I think you guys do a pretty good job, at least I think with a lot of thee a Adobe ones, which I, which thee, I think those are my, the ones I've been using a lot, on there."
"Uh, how they connect with each other, that would be helpful because they go into the multi media, there is after effects photo shop, and premiere, and the audio piece, what is it, the um, audition."
Uh huh.
"Here I have one that shows how they all connect with each other, how you place to using one thing and go back to the other set, for saying, mention "" em briefly in one or the other."
And stuff.
Don't really have anything to actually.
"So the true relationship, because all these have, are connected that you can use them in a way where they all complement each other, but"
"I don't really, it offends me to figure them out."
"Within each one, they might mention, it might mention a little piece on after effects."
Sure.
Bye.
But not like the total workflow.
My might mention a piece on premier.
"But there's no real slow connection on how all of this production piece, that production piece works all together."
"Same with the way of uh, design is really easy to figure out on that one."
It's just opening photoshop illustrator.
That's not that complicated.
But far as the .
"Uh-huh , a lot more complex on there."
Okay.
Okay.
"Um, yeah that's good feedback."
Those areas are mostly outside of my segment.
"But it's really good information for me to, to talk to the audio and video guys about."
And uh.
And you still do this?
And I don't do this anymore.
I haven't practiced for real for the last 7 months.
What the meaning of that?
For me if you were to pull it very far - it was like being a drug addict and not getting the high you need.
"But after some time I learned - no, I do practice because I go through everything in my head."
"I play with the band, I play concerts, I don't have time to do everything anymore."
But that time will hopefully come again.
As long as you work and do something you just need to be happy with yourself.
Teenagers who are sad and have a bad personal image send in a demo after demo and have no response from  record-labels.
They shouldn'tbe sad they should be proud of themselves that they  are not just sitting on the couch doing nothing.
Do you feel that you had to let go of many things to get where you are now?
No.
The only thing I let go without knowing was my first and biggest love.
"You talk a lot about love, you sing about love."
"Well, there are a lot of emotions in me; it's not for just anything."
"I get very emotional - ""Titanic' you know of it, right?"
"Or ""Notebook"","
I just cry because I put myself too far into the films.
And I can't be sad for breaking up with a girl when there obviously was fate surrounding the situation.
We're getting close to the end and we talked about it earlier - how does you future look?
If you can picture it?
If I'm allowed to decide...
But you will decide.
"Yes, my future looks like I will now do many concerts this summer which I will not let people cancel, that was some surprise."
And...
And I will after some time take a little vacation where I will think over what my next project will be.
I'm quite sure that one day I will end up in children's television as a host probably.
And I also really want to help with a new talent.
And I will turn into an old-news and then I want to be there discovering a new talent.
"It's kind of the ""circle of life""."

S:
I'm here with Dr. Agus who is a professor of engineering and medicine here at USC.
We're looking at pictures of things that seem very different to me.
What is the commonality?
Dr:
The commonality is inflammation.
"Inflammation can be manifested by a runny nose or the flu, it could be manifested by an infection in your toes, it could be hitting your head playing football, or hitting your arm when you fall while playing a sport"
All of those can cause inflammation.
S:
Inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language:
It means something is swollen and red.
But here we're talking about inflammation in the medical or scientific sense where it's not things are swollen and red BECAUSE of inflammation.
Dr:
Right.
S:
So what is inflammation?
It isn't just swollen and redness.
Football players get red and swollen.
Dr:
Inflammation occurs when your body senses danger.
"So when something is wrong--whether it be infection, whether it be trauma--in the case of football players your body senses danger and sends in its front-line soldiers which are its immune cells in order to fight whatever is causing it."
"So, if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that is damaged."
"If it's bacteria, they go in there and try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu."
"So, that whole process is what we call inflammation, it's the ""danger process""."
S:
So the immune cells go to the site of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath of the danger.
That sounds like a good thing!
Dr:
It's an awesome thing.
Those are roosts.
Oh!
OK.
"Again, what it does is, it makes the whole farm infrastructure portable."
"So it could be done in suburbia, it could be done on a rental farm, it could be done on an uncle's farm, you can move all this around."
"And that really changes the entrance opportunity, and the expansion capability, by having the infrastructure all portable."
"Of course, the turkeys, they'll pick up 45% of their diet off the grass, so that's why they get a much bigger area."
It's great.
"Yeah, they got this area today, and they were just there two days before, we move them every two days."
"And, again, we've got the cows ahead, we're shortening the grass with the cows."
Do you need a tractor to move this?
"Yeah, this is a feed buggy up on the front, so it's hooked up to the feed buggy."
"So you just hook up to the feed buggy with a tractor here, you set up your next circle up here, and you just hook up with the tractor and open it up."
And you've been doing this for twenty years?
"I came back to the farm full time September 24, 1982."
It'll be 30 years this September 24th.
"So what type of adoption have you seen across the industry with people accepting these techniques and utilizing them, and raising pastured poultry."
"Well, it's growing, but it's such a tiny subset of the whole industry that it's still not a spit in the ocean."
Still way less than one percent.
"Oh, yeah, but it's growing."
What is the rate at which it is growing?
Is it doubling every year?
Is it 50%?
"I don't, it's hard to tell."
Do you think it might be doubling?
"I don't know, I doubt if it's doubling."
"Doubling every year, that would be astronomical."
But I can imagine now that it's increasing by 10 or 15% every year.
So it's definitely going up.
"So if there were one thousand farms last year, there'll be probably eleven hundred this year, and thirteen hundred next year, and it's definitely on the up swing."
Being fueled partly by the whole local food tsunami.
"The whole local food, integrity food tsunami."
Hockenheim.
It was while test driving and I was always a proponent of hassling people.
That's what we were talking about.
This hierarchy...
"Mansell, Prost, Senna, Berger wanted to put us in our places, which I could never accept."
One example was the test driving in Hockenheim.
I was during a qualifying simulation.
"Ayrton already finished his turn, actually, but suddenly he wanted to come in again."
"He saw that I was straight behind him and even though he had Honda power he drove the curves very slowly, but I could not overtake in a curve, so I tried on the straight but he pushed the throttle and was gone again."
I could not keep up with my Ford engine.
"He did that to me twice in different moments, but then there was a third situation."
"But this time, I was the one ahead and of course I made now the same play as he did."
But he could not stand that and told me afterwards that this is not a correct behaviour.
So that were the first conflicts with the established ones.
I remember that Berger once said:
"""This guy is so eager."
Totally overambitious.
"Actually we don't like him!"""
Did you feel that you got kind of ignored by those drivers?
I felt the opposing wind from them.
"There was an interesting situation, I think in the first or second year"
"Gerhard (Berger) had a flat tire, drove on the side, could not go fast anymore."
I tried to overtake and he totally cut in on me.
This was an act to show me that I should be aware when and whom I overtake
Years later we went home from Monza in the same car...
I already made my first championship and we had an honest conversation.
He said:
"""Well friend, at that time we had the feeling that we must run rings around you."""
You were considered as unapproachable at that time...
What do you think about it?
Quite the contrary!
"Of course I was stubborn, ambitious and focused, but I always tried to be fair"
"It was nice, thank you."
The Inclusive Design Research Centre is focused  on designing for diversity.
"We try to design with, rather than designing for."
We believe that we will have greater designs for diversity and more innovative designs when there are multiple perspectives.
Our research is intended to help everyone.
A 3D printer is a printer that prints stuff - physical stuff.
It will enable everyone to basically have the equivalent of a little factory in their own home.
"Well, my name is Judith Snow."
"It's not really so much how the Institute has helped me, as it is I'm a participant."
Inclusion brings out a lot of value in society.
"This place is all about the structures of that, making inclusion actually work, so nobody's left behind."
Ontario is probably one of the most diverse communities in the world.
We are a world leader in things like accessibility legislation.
"What we're creating here is potentially an economic driver for Ontario, so that the world can come here to receive innovative solutions for designing for diversity, or for digital inclusion."
"I went to Eton, paid a lot for knowledge"
I joined the Bullingdon at Brasenose College that's where I caught his eye
He told me that his dad was loaded
"I said, 'Mine too, we should run this country!'"
"He said, 'Yah.'"
"And in 30 seconds time, I realised"
I'll need the votes of common people
I must pretend to do the things that common people do
Then I'll shit on the common people
Then I'll shit on common people like you
What else would I do?
I'm a Tory.
That's what we do
So I became MP for Witney
"It was an easy seat, I had to start it somewhere"
So I started there
I met some people who had no money
"I laughed and laughed, and said, 'Ha!"
"So, you have to get your own strategies together before you go to make a major purchase."
"Now, something else that the book talks about."
It talks about price comparrison.
And here we are not necessarily talking about a major purchase.
"This can be, I'm going to the store and I'm having dinner and it normally takes two cans of green beans for my family."
"Well I can buy one can, the small can of green beans for $.99."
"So to buy two of them would be $1.98, right? $.98 X 2."
"But, I can buy a larger can, double the size, for $1.50."
Should I buy two small ones or one large one?
"Obviously, you would buy one large one."
"And we make the assumption, because this is how it used to be, that the bigger the quantity the less per ounce or per pound or whatever an item is."
And let me tell you that is not always true.
They got you to thinking that so now they do just the opposite because if you need two cans of green beans for a meal you will buy the big one when maybe the big one is $2.25 and the two little ones are $.99 each.
You are better off buying the two little ones even though you have to open two cans than you are buying the one big one.
If it is twice the volume.
Okay?
"So, how can I do this?"
And I will tell you what I do this in the grocery store all the time.
"It takes a little longer to buy groceries sometimes, but this is what you need to do."
You need to be able to figure the unit price of an item.
"And if you will look on page 190, there is the example."
"To calculate the unit price of an item, divide the cost by the number of units."
"So, if I am trying to figure out how many ounces are in something."
I mean how much an ounce of something costs.
I look at how many ounces are in the can and then I take the price divided by the number of ounces.
"So, if you look at this it says a 64 ounce product costing $8.32."
So you take $8.32 divided by 64 and it tells you the cost per ounce.
Okay?
"So, you need to use that when you go grocery shopping."
Take a calculator.
Use the calculator on your phone!
But sometimes it is cheaper to buy two little cans of green beans than to buy the one big can.
Let's say that this distance between this leg and the book is 1 meter-- or the box.
"Let's say that this distance between the leg and the center of mass is 2 meters, and so this is also 2 meters."
"OK, so we can now set this up as a moment problem."
"So remember, all of the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments."
So what are all of the clockwise moments?
What are all of the things that want to make the table rotate this way or this way?
"Well, the leg is the only thing keeping it from doing that."
So everything else is essentially a clockwise moment.
"So we have this 100 Newtons, and it is 1 meter away."
Its moment arm distance is 1.
"So these are all the clockwise moments, 100 times 1, right?"
"It's 100 Newtons acting downwards in the clockwise direction, clockwise moment, and it's 1 meter away, plus we have the center of mass at the top of the table, which is 20"
"Newtons, plus 20 Newtons, and that is 2 meters away from our designated axis, so 20 times 2."
"And you might say, well, isn't this leg exerting some force?"
"Well, sure it is, but its distance from our designated axis is zero, so its moment of force is zero."
Even if it is exerting a million pounds or a million
"Newtons, its moment of force, or its torque, would be zero because its moment arm distance is zero, so we can ignore it, which makes things simple."
So those were the only clockwise moments.
And what's the counterclockwise moment?
"Well, that's going to be the force exerted by this leg."
That's what's keeping the whole thing from rotating.
So it's the force of the leg times its distance from our axis.
"Well, this is a total of 4 meters, which we've said here, times 4 meters."
And so we can just solve.
"We get 100 plus 40, so we get 140 is equal to the force of the leg times 4."
So what's 140-- 4 goes into 140 35 times?
My math is not so good.
Is that right?
4 times 30 is 120.
120 plus 20.
So the force of the leg is 35 Newtons upwards.
"And since this isn't moving, we know that the downward force right here must be 35 Newtons."
There's an not a decade long period.
Where you have health care expenditures less than the growth in GDP or equal to the growth in GDP.
"And you can see in almost every year, here it's almost two%."
"Here it's almost three%, it is three percent 1990s last and we'll talk about this in a second."
An d you can see in this period 2-1/2%.
"Overall, 2.4 percent for 40 years.You're on, you're on, those of who have understood the idea of compound interest."
"That makes a grow, grow, grow."
"But I do wanted, draw your attention."
"There is one year there, one year, one decade, the 1990s where it only grew 1.3 percent above GDP."
What was happening do you think in the 1990s that did that?
"Could, empower, that's right."
So 1993 he takes office in January.
He attends to introduce health care reform and get
National Health Coverage and what happens?
"It was defeated, that's right."
"Lots of reasons why it was defeated and we'll talk about that on the first session of the ACA why, what some of the differences are but it was defeated."
One of the reasons it was defeated was.
The passed Congress.
"Yes, that's correct."
But that means it wasn't a coalition.
Who pulled out of the coalition?
Businesses.
And they pulled out because they thought they could get a better deal somewhere else and the thought was the manage care companies came to them and said we can hold your cost down.
You don't need the government.
And the way they were going to do it was with manage care and then what happened.
So one thing that happened is that reduce choice and
Americans rebelled because at that time the main mechanism that manage can control the cost was to reduce what they paid doctors but also restrict choices of the population.
"There was a line going around in the 1990s, one 800 just say no."
That's what happened.
Men's care company gave you an 800 number if you didn't like their decisions and all that happened at the other 800 number just say no.
And the consequence was.
Manage care was able to control cost for a short period of time and we'll see about five years but then towards the end of the 90s cost went up.
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

Since the design of the Nokia M9
"On a totally new way of thinking, we wanted even the smallest detail to refglect that."
Every single function you exoect your phone form has been redesigned.
Now even setting up
"My name is John Green and I wanna welcome you to Crash Course ""World History"""
"Over the next 14 weeks together we will learn how in nearly 15,000 years humans went from hunting and gathering..."
"""Mr. Green, is this going to be on the test?"""
"Yeah, about the test."
"The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world."
And it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship.
"You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football and while scrolling through your Tweeter feed."
The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages whether you will be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric and whether you be able to place your life and your community in a broader context.
The test will last your entire life and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that when taken together make your life yours and everything...everything will be on it.
"I know right, so pay attention!"
"In a mere 15,000 year humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities as the airplane, the internet, and the 99 cent double cheeseburger."
The correct answer is:
"When evil is legal, become a criminal."
"When oppression is enacted as ""law,"" become a law-breaker."
When those violently victimizing the innocent have badges become a cop-killer. so the next time you hear of a police officer being killed in the line of duty take a moment to consider the very real possibility that maybe in that case the law enforcer was the bad guy and the cop killer was the good guy.
"As it happens, that has been the case more often than not throughout human history."
Stephen:
Come with me in the airplane and you are
looking at the instrument panel and you are flying in the clouds.
You can't see a thing.
Imagine.
"Now you are born deaf, profoundly deaf."
"If you have never heard anything in your life, how is it that you can fly airplanes?"
How is it that you can hear people teach you how to talk?
I am that person.
Announcer:
"""The guy just blew me away."" ""One of the best speeches I have ever heard."""
"""He's funny, poignant and he's lived it."""
That's what people are saying about Stephen Hopson.
A passionate and entertaining speaker.
His message about overcoming adversity comes from his heart and his own experience.
"Deaf since birth, Stephen never let his disability become an obstacle to achieving his dreams and reaching his goals."
"In February of 2006, Stephen became the world's first instrument rated deaf pilot."
A dream which began in childhood.
Stephen:
"When I was 4 years old, I begged my mother to take me to the airport so I could watch planes take off and land."
Did you ever do that?
"OK, so you know what I am talking about."
"Remember, I am 4 years old!"
My mother would park her car by the fence and I would be so eager because I wanted to be a pilot.
I would hop out of the car and I would run up to the fence and I would put my fingers on the wires of the fence and I would wait for a plane to come out.
"The minute a plane came out, I would put my head on the hood of her car, like this... and then I would wait for an airplane to take off."
"And as soon as that plane took off, the car would vibrate."
What's 0.5 times 0.03?
"I'll do it down here just because multiplying decimals seems to be a problem for a lot of people, including myself, many times."
"So what you do, you just multiply the numbers."
5 times 03 or 5 times 3 is 15.
"And then, how many points do we have behind the decimal?"
How many digits behind the decimal?
Let's see.
"We have 1, 2, 3."
"So 1, 2, 3."
We have to add the 0 because we need three spaces behind the decimal point.
So we get the force is equal to 0.015 kilogram meters per second squared.
And this is a Newton.
So the force is equal to 0.015 Newtons.
Let's do another problem.
"And this one's going to be-- and actually, I think you'll find most of the difficult Newton's laws problems or force problems, they're just some combination of making sure you get the units right when we're talking about in one dimension."
"The difficult part is usually getting the units right or just the math, just the algebra."
So if you have trouble with this it's usually because you have to just brush up a little bit on the algebra.
The physics itself is just force equals mass times acceleration as we will see in this problem.
"So let's say that when I apply some force, some particular force, I use this little 0 here."
So I call that force F sub 0.
So this means a particular force.
This is some value.
"When I apply that force to some mass, let's call that m sub 0, I get some acceleration."
I get acceleration a sub 0.
We could've put numbers here.
"We could've said, well, if I apply a force of 10 Newtons to a mass of-- I don't know-- to a mass of let's say 2 kilograms, I have an acceleration of 5 meters per second squared."
But I'm just doing this because this could be any relationship.
"And let's say the problem tells us that when I put another mass with this first mass, so let's say that, you know-- let me draw this diagram."
"So here's my mass, m sub 0."
"When I apply a force of f sub 0 to it, I get an acceleration of a sub 0."
Now the problem tell us when I add another mass-- so let's says I stack it up and we're like in an ice skating ring or something.
"And I stack another mass up here, and let's call this mass m1."

David:
"I've been fortunate enough that the people I've been in relationships with have been respectful and also we talk about it, we communicate if you openly communicate about what's going on then it gives a space to work it out."
That's what's important.
Elisabeth:
Thank you for being as candid as you have been today.
I know a lot of people feel the same way you feel.
"All right, thanks to David Jay."
"If you want to learn more about asexuality,"
David will be seen in an upcoming segment on 20/20.
We'll be right back.
"Well, when we took that break, Brian, you mentioned that you had some special guests once, that you met the..."
We were with the 130 at the time
"We were supporting the Antarctic ... and the astronauts, the navy was the recover for them, like the mercury astronauts, primarily."
"But the Air Force, we train crews and we were all over the world, and I ended up ... in which I'd been to a couple of times."
"We covered between South America and Africa and then we had them in Singapore, we had them in..."
I'd been to Greenland a couple times and I didn't want to go to Antarctica.
"I had a choice of either going with the astronaut recovery or that, so I volunteered, and we..."
"There was another guy, too, who did most of..."
"And then, at the last minute, we'd bring in the guys that would take the other airplanes."
So I was down to... in Florida for probably a month.
And we take the
Air Force paramedics out.
We take a dummy capsule a couple hundred miles out.
We'd go find it and dress these guys - put their scuba gear and stuff on them - and they'd jump out and then I'd sit in the tailgate of the back of the truck of the one-thirty.
With the flotation collar that went around it.

Our release engineer at the time had the keys to the server room where the Mozilla machines operated.
"These are small details but they were really important at the time and we knew that if he could do it he would help us keep Mozilla operating and we knew that Chofmann was running the engineering organisation and we knew that he would be helpful as it turned out, we needed him."
And Marcia had the keys to the closet that was our single supply of Mozilla t-shirts.
Which I bought with my own money.
"Oh, no."
"That was later, nevermind."
The ones I bought later.
But she had that key and she had access to some other things.
"So we would sit and think how many machines do we need, how many employees do we need."
"If we have one employee, is it Leef who runs the build machines?"
"If we have one employee, is it Brendan?"
Who is he?
And what's the best way to keep Mozilla operating?
But when it came to it I was the only one who was fired and so the rest of the Mozilla folks were left and Chofmann provided a haven for us to try and continue to be effective as well.
So this was this first era.
"So after I was fired there were a bunch of people still at Netscape, working on Netscape navigator."
As part of that we finally managed to ship our first product as Mozilla.
Mozilla 1.0 we called it.
And this had been a long time in coming.
That was in 2002.
We started Mozilla in 1998 and expected to have a product very shortly afterwards.
"But it turned out, when we got into it that the technology was pretty old."
Brendan made the decision to really build the new technology base.
That technology base is Gecko.
It cost us years to get the rendering engine to a point where we could really build a good application on it and ship it.
We finally did that in 2002.
It was Mozilla 1.0 and it was technically a good product.
It was technically a shockingly good product.
"Across the open source space, where people knew it they were retelling us they were really shocked to how good a product it was."
But it was not a consumer product.
"It was really built by developers, for developers."
To find out why Sarah Lee is suddenly tongue tied in class the school's resource teacher takes her to see speech and language specialist Donna
Orloff.
I'm going to read a sentence to you.
Orloff starts by testing Sarah Lee's basic language skills.
Look at some pictures and you can start up here at A.
"Lion, horse, mouse."
She has very good language for single words.
"She knows a lot of labels, a lot of nouns."
And she uses them and she understands them.
But there are other words that were associated-- not the direct label-- but associated with the pictures.
And that posed difficulty for her.
Perfect.
Point to swine.
So we get to swine.
She had no idea what swine is.
She's heard it.
She's heard it from reading Charlotte's Web.
But she doesn't have that rich storage system that enables her to tap the vocabulary and to retrieve the words that she needs.
"Our brains are basically a very complex storage and retrieval system where every piece of information that comes in to you, you put it someplace so that you can refer to it later on."
"If you see a Saint Bernard walking down the street, your retrieval system goes to your storage system, pulls out all of the note cards that it has on dogs, go through it until it finds Saint Bernard, and says, oh"
"look, there's a Saint Bernard."
All this happens in a millisecond.
And then you take that card and put it back where it belongs so when you need it next time you can find it.
The problem with these kids is that the storage and retrieval systems are very complicated and generally very confused.
So they will go and take the card out and then put it back in the wrong place.
"That ability to make mental connections, to go from one file drawer to the next also affects the way kids think abstractly."
"A student talking about a trip says, it's still up in the air."
Probably he's talking about a trip going around the world.
This is the child who only sees the picture of the pig is the pig.
The picture of the train is the train.
"If it's up in the air, he's got to be on an airplane."
"Language is never that one to one, rigid, concrete correlation."
The clocks are set at different times and moving at different speeds.
So the clocks are totally out of sync with each other and the child is generally out of sync with his environment.
"But the law of averages will tell you, if you take three clocks, set them at different times, and move them to different speeds, eventually-- bingo, bingo, bingo-- there will come a time when the three of them are all telling the same time."
"And when the clocks are in sync, there's this incredible forward movement on the part of the child-- for a day or week or a month if you're lucky, this incredible forward movement and progress."
And then the clocks get out of sync again.
The moment of truth called demystification.
You are like a wonderful car like a Mercedes or a Jaguar.
"But it has a very small gas tank so that when you try to think or do a lot of work, it runs out of fuel pretty easily."
"Demystification, I think, may be the most important movement in this field in the last 10 years."
And that is explaining to the child what the problem is.
"If you have a child with diabetes, one of the first things you do is explain to the child this is what diabetes is."
These are the foods you can eat.
This is what's happening to your body when you don't eat the proper food.
And explain line and verse.
"Yet when a child has a learning problem, we try to protect the child from it."
"I've had parents say to me, he doesn't know he has a learning problem."
"Indeed, he does."
"And sometimes a child takes great comfort in the diagnosis, in knowing"
I'm not the only person that has it.
I'm not stupid like the kids tell me in the school bus.
I'm not lazy like the teacher tells me every day.
There's really a name for this.
The second problem you have is what we call a graphomotor problem.
You don't have very good control over the very little muscles at the ends of your fingers.
And you know what you do because of that?
You try to get rid of them.
You know how you get rid of them?
By putting your thumb over these two fingers.
And you bear down real hard.
And you end up writing with your wrists.
And that's too slow.
And then you know what happens?
That's what I was talking about.
To block somebody in a training session on purpose or tease somebody....
I never did that.
"And I think that, because of me, we have nowdays clear rules in this respect..."
That one treats another fair no matter if someone has the fastest or slowest car.
Everyone tries to respect each other and let them their freedoms.
"Things in Formula 1 have changed a lot after 1994, also due to the death of Ayrton Senna."
When you look now at yourself...
What are the special things about Michael Schumacher?
"Considering the beginning of your career where you were considered unapproachable, overambitious, gifted with steady nerves and an intuition about how to act in critical moments..."
There is a good example.
A German sport journalist described it like this:
In order to describe the characteristics of Michael Schumacher there is one key moment!
"It was in Austria 2003, Schumacher is about to win and makes a pit stop."
"While he was standing in the pit, flames are blazing."
"The astonishing thing is that the remains calm, with an even temper."
"Not like that he would jump out of the car, as we might do it... but one recognizes that he moves the helmet slightly to the right and observes in the mirror what is Happening."
"He sees the flames and although everything is over quickly, he drives out of the pit and wins the race."
And I think in this situation you can see what makes the difference between very good racing drivers and champions...
The ability to be mentally ahead in criticial situations.
That they take their time and analyse without any emotion and only after that make their decision without beeing hectic.
Did he describe it correctly?
...
Not bad ...
But I did not say that money is a bad thing
"I respect every religion ... ... as servile, as it is."
Oh. .. yes ... you do not know ...
"Only calm down, stop splashing with your the spinal cord."
MONEY IS GOD
And you believe religion is Christianity Buddhism and shamanism0:
"00:00:23,501 --&amp;gt; 0:00:00:25,001 not ... but certainly not ..."
And you are not stupid ...
Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?
What are the dark matter and the dark energy that make up so much stuff in the universe?
Where did the universe itself come from?
What we're hoping is that the Higgs boson gives us a new tool to answer these questions.
"That is, one era ends, another one begins."
"It is as if we'd been in one room for all of our lives, doing physics, and the Higgs is a door into the next room."
And it'll be very interesting to see what's inside.
"Of course, I believe."
"Especially during the period of recession, my faith has grown even more."
Human actions can only be successful with the help of God .
Let's see.
We have this graph over here with t is the independent variable on the horizontal axis and d is the dependent variable on the vertical axis.
And then they have a table here.
Looks like this table corresponds to this graph.
"When t equals 1, d is 40, when t is equal to 2, d is 80."
So these points correspond to points on this line.
"And then they explain to us, you are buying a gym membership."
The membership costs $40 per month.
"In the graph and table above, d is the total number of dollars that you pay for your gym membership, so that's d right over there, and t is the time in months that you keep the membership."
"Write an equation for the amount of money d that you pay for your gym membership, if you keep the membership for t months."
And you see that here.
"If you're one month, you pay $40, two months you pay another $40, you pay $80."
You see that in the graph right over here.
"If you have 0 months, you pay nothing."
"Then one month, $40, the next month another $40 getting you to $80."
"So if I were to write this as an equation, the dependent variable here is the amount that I pay in dollars."
So that is going to depend on the time.
And how is it going to depend on the time in months?
Well I'm going to pay $40 per month times the number of months.
"So I can either write it as 40 with a little asterisk sign, which is Shift 8-- and then I put t there-- or I could literally put just a t right over there."
"And I think that's right, because if my time is 0 according to this table and according to this graph,"
least square you minimize this.
Whether it's the two or the one norm.
"So really that corresponds to, the only thing I really gotta minimize is this."
"This stuff is always the same, so if I can minimize that some, that's all I care about."
"So there's this thing called fminsearch In Matlab, which allows you to just give it an expression, and it will try to minimize, and you give it some initial values, to try to say, hey, try these and then go find me a minimum solution."
'Kay?
"So that's what we're going to use, fminsearch."
All right.
"So, we come into here and here's how it works."
"We want the coefficients, using an L2 fit, the coefficients meaning a and b."
"And want to call the fminsearch, command."
"And want to call a function called line, L2 fit."
"And well we've gotta pass it, or the initial guesses for the values of A and B. I'll just pick one."
"And I'. gonna pass it the data X and Y. The box here is for tolerence settings, just allow you to make it, get more accurate fi, or less accurate fit. the default is ten minus six."
"It's gonna try to get you the minimum, and once it gets, it's, it's an iteration routine, and once you get down to 10-6, it stops, 'kay?"
"So, ther e you go, that's how you do it."
"You send in your, you send in your data, you send in your initial guess for A and B, and what is gonna come out are two numbers, A and B. That, it thinks, so the minimum, give you the minimum values for those things."
"Okay, now we can do this without one by simply changing two:1."
"So we're gonna do two this, we're gonna first call F and then search, and use, yeah, two, minimization, and then we're gonna call F and search."
A one immunization.
"Now, it turns out, it's kinda like the cooking show today."
"Where,"
"like, you know, oh, you put it in the oven for 50 minutes and, you know, all of a sudden, right at that point, they pop one out."
"It's all planned as if, as if it wasn't spontaneous."
"Okay, so we're not going spontaneous today."
"We're going to go get these , they're sitting right there."
"There's one of them and let me get the other one, and then we'll talk about them."
"Where is it L2 fit, okay."
Alright.
"So what are they, what are these subroutines."
"Well, here they are."
They're actually quite simple.
"I feel the energy, the heart filled, I see all of your faces, really just brightening up."
We are going to end here and remind everyone to come back  to the basic practice.
Because I know we have been stimulated.
Don't let that pull you from who you are.
"I think we have touched that, the truth of who you are and your practice in the present moment."
"Don't let anything tempt you and lose that, even if it is about teaching  and education and all that."
"We just come back to our breath,  our steps, basic things that will..."
"Actually all the things that we need  are already in us and with the practice, we can trust that."
"With the mother and... as parents too, the teenagers."
I work with a lot of teens and the mindfulness has helped me a lot to really call out what it is that is really happening in present moment.
You only can do that calmly  if you've done your own homework.
So there is nothing that  you cannot solve or deal with.
"Mindfulness is just an energy, is not a technique, an energy we can cultivate."
"Just in present moment, you can recognize and call out to the teenagers to the students, what it is, what is happening."
"But calmly, with a lot of love  and compassion, miracles happen."
We all have experienced that  wherever arena we are in.
"So that encourages you for the next hour, or as we eat lunch."
"Don't think about this,  let it go."
"Come back to your steps, come back to your dinner."
"What it is that you are looking for, it is already in there."
"I think we all know that already, that's why we're here,to actually cultivate that."
"So we learn the teaching mind,  a teacher's mind which is... more things, more pieces of paper."
"We just let go, come back."
"So, we'll end here  with three sounds of the bell for us to really enjoy this moment and to let this happiness and what we touched here for the sharings, giving us a lot of energy."
"We let that dissipate  into all the teachers, all the students, all the young ones, all the parents  out there, all doing their best."
(Half bell)
(Bell)

May we end here?
Can I teach you a song?
"I'll sing the first line, okay?"
"You're better off with a nine-to-five job."""
80% of the people fail within the first year.
"Go back home."" That's what they told me."
Announcer:
"Stephen disregarded those discouraging words and when he once again found himself in the vice-president's office, he acted on his intuition."
Stephen:
"I looked at him in the eye and I said, ""Sir, if you don't hire me,"""
"""you'll never know what I can do for this firm."""
Announcer:
"Stephen got the job, but with one final condition."
"Stephen: he said, ""We'll train you for three months, we'll give you a little salary."""
"""At the end of three months, you have to take a 250 question examination."
"If you fail by one point, YOU'RE OUT!"""
Announcer:
"Stephen passed that exam and over the next four years he achieved national recognition,"""
"""earning a six figure salary as his personal sales increased by over 1,700%."""
"But there was something more, a broader goal and purpose for his life which came to him with instant clarity on a vacation trip to the ocean."
Stephen:
"I had to get away for a while, remember I was a stock broker at the time, and I had to get away."
"It was a lot of pressure, I just needed a little bit of sun and a little bit of water, and a little bit of sand."
"I needed a little bit of a tan, too (laughter)."
"So I went away, and there I was on the beach, and it was a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous day."
I was reading a book and then it happened.
Out of the clear blue my eyes flew open.
It was a revelation.
I just knew that my life purpose was to become a speaker and an author.
Announcer:
"Since that decisive moment on that beach, Stephen has shared his inspiring story through the medium of television and radio as an author and has spoken to hundreds of organizations of all ages, all across America and has never looked back, except to remember the people who helped to encourage him along the way."
People like his fifth grade teacher.
Stephen: ...and then Mrs. Jordan made a grand entrance into my life.
She was a larger-than- life woman with salt and pepper hair and eyes that I swore twinkled.
"Have you ever had someone in your life that you wanted to be so much a part of, people who are that powerful?"
"What do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the world greatest husband"
"Please, I was there when you were flirting with exgirlfriend, and neglected to tell her you were married."
I was there when you were trying to hook up with that waitress the day before you got engaged.
"And I was definitely there when you were hooking with that nasty ass stripper at ""Boobies, Boobies, Boobies""."
That wasn't me that was you!
"Yeah, I know, but I told her my name was Turk"
"The point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife,'cause you were trying to hang out with me"
"You know, maybe it's time you start acting like a real husband"
Stop acting like some sort of crazy cowboy
A cowboy?
"I don't know, it just came to me"
"You know I'm right, Turk"
When your pride 's at stake* you can't help but have questions
Just tell me how did you know what was bothering her?
"Tell me now, so we don't have to talk anymore, never."
"How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?"
"A lot of time, the answer is about sacrifice"
"I was thinking, you'd rather just stay in tonight."
"You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?"
You are trying to smile?
You're so damned cute.
"Sometimes, sacrifice is only wearing a new uni when you are not at work"
"Okay, how about this one,Three blue-jays fly into a bar &amp;amp; they say, ""we just want to wet out beaks*"
"No, sorry Dan, you tell one"
"Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride..."
"JD, could you hand me the wine, please?"
Turk is not talking to me
"But ulitmately, big or small, sacrifices is about doing something you really don't want to do"
"Hey guys, I know we talked about this before , but I'm moving out"
Really
"I mean, you guys need your space"
Thanks man
"Of course, the House of Representatives is very difficult there."
We're going to try to do more briefings and increase the bipartisan support for the program.
We have had some very encouraging republican interest shown recently in response to a lobby day that we did in
"February, and we'll keep working the Senate very aggressively."
"So, Bob thanks very much for those comments, and we'll have to watch closely for that $24 million set-aside for multi-family housing."
We'll watch how that plays out.
We just don't have the details right now.
Bob:
Right.
I'm aware.
Brad:
"So, I think that brings us to the end."
We have not received any further questions or comments.
We've had several people who have inquired about talking points for the member letter for the Senate.
"We'll be reaching out to you in the next several days, and yes we will send talking points out."
"That will be a very quick turn-around, and we do appreciate your help with that."
"We will have the audio portion on the NASCSP website no later than the end of the week, and we will have the slides available as well."
"Many, many thanks to our two guests who joined us today, Steve Capanna from the White House, and"
Elyse Wasch with Senator Jack Reed.
Senator Reed a great champion and she is the Senator's Legislative
"Director, and thanks to my colleague Arley Johnson, Director of Government Relations, and to Mark"
Schmeissing for your excellent presentation on CSBG.
And thanks also to Alice Gaston for her help in putting the webinar together.
"And thank you, our audience, for your patience for staying with us for almost 90 minutes."
We hope this was useful.
"We welcome your comments, and we'll take a survey of everyone who was on the line, and we apologize again for any audio difficulties at the beginning."
"Technology is always a work in progress, and we'll see that the next time around we don't encounter those problems."
Thank you for joining us.
Please let us know what you think of this presentation and enjoy the rest of your day.
Good afternoon.
Welcome back.
"For example, on the sculptures, there are 3 crescents, swastika, latin cross, inverted cross or moon and stars of the Turkish flag"
"When retouching or drawing onto them, it gives you the impression of supernatural things."
I'm not trying to give a message or
I don't have a political stance.
"That swastika is standing there actually for ignoring that, it becomes a figure in the picture or a character in the story."
It's the same with the signature.
For me there are 2 types of signature.
Signutare seems like artist's ownership in the work.
I don't believe that signutare is important.
I think the artist is like a screw.
The actual important thing is the artwork itself.
Artwork is like a gun or a toy.
"As I said before, the big signatures that I make, are like symbols and for ignoring this behaviour."
I use the handwritings in the same way
"For example, if there's an empty part in the picture, the handwriting might come right there, I write my name etc."
"If there's not a catchy sentence or word,"
I can simply wirte my name there.
It can be offensive for someone but at them same time it's pretty.
I will do the thing that I want to do with the painting here in this room.
"I will make copies, put them onto the wall, there will be a small video..."
"There's a video that I made, it will be here etc..."
"I collect images from google and make collages with these images,"
I will put them here as well.
These were going to be big sculptures.
"I actually wanted them to be bigger, but still, they are still a reference."
"When we went to see Derya with the paintings,"
she recommended us to show them to Christina and Nesrin.
One night we went to meet them at Galata with paintings.
"They got surprised actually, because normally people do this representation with pdf files or books."
"It was a nice evening though, we liked eachother and we decided to do the exhibition right on that evening."
"I will attend to an exhibition soon, in Koln."
"It's not ready yet, I'm on process"
"Preached in many churches can say, but only on the outskirts of Fortaleza."
"Probably the major ministries do not know me, to tell the truth I am alone, like a drop in the middle of the desert."
"I'm just a man who does what he believes God has put in my heart, and I do not care about what others say."
"I don't care that God knows my heart, this is the most important thing."
Q: the big ministries missionaries know Gap?
A:
"No, I think not, I can't guarantee it."
Sometimes we try to establish contacts but ...
"Q: can't you feel kinda saddened because nobody pays you for what you do, for your sacrifices?"
A:
No.
Q: why don't we have been called to become famous.
The word says that we cannot be more than our master.
One of the things that most are horrified me is this idea of the Ministry set up blindly ...
"Watch, the helmsman's not you ..."
But the rower!
What obeys.
"Are not entered in the missions looking for earnings, but conscious of the sacrifices."
Got It?
"Usually we say that no one can be sure to be a servant of God if he has not first explored the depths of the disenchantment of oneself and the world, because the treasures that gives the world not a blessing but a priming."
There is one thing that happens sometimes ...
"God gave us the grace to spread the word about Gap for Fortaleza, but few have heard of me."
I see it as a gift in many ways because there is something in us that ...
It is difficult to explain.
The Bible doesn't say that to get something from Christ we need to deal with him.
It is he who tells us what is our call.
We trust in him then!
"There is a phrase that says ""join in the boat with God and return to port with him."" In short, don't you dare even to start without him, we do ours that ""dying"" expressed by Christ on the cross, dying to our dreams, and everything that we thought they needed ..."
I wish to remain clear that God has never abused my will.
"It was always patient, as in fix I've often complained."
"But I felt in these 12 years as say the Scriptures, that his goodness is perfect and good, I only had to align my heart closer to Her to figure it out."
"I don't know where I will go, whether I'll live a humble life."
We are reaching out to friends and  communities who are doing the same.
This is not new.
"It's a really broad area, it covers a lot."
I do not think we could cover it all in 6 days.
I think you know.
What is special here is that we are face-to-face.
"We get to hear from a real living being and from our heart,  not on a website or something."
You'll have time also afterwards  to approach our wonderful friends.
So this is the living Dharma as they will speak from their experience.
The panel is a way of reaching out and connecting and collaborating with others.
"We are doing similar things, bringing and helping education,  improving the purpose of education and creating techniques  and methods to help teachers, students as well as their parents and the whole overall."
So we can just start with the classrooms and it will touch everything.
"That is the core  of our teacher's teachings, interbeing."
"When you touch one student, one teacher, naturally you will have to deal  with all the other issues."
So we have here today our panel  that represents a very diverse area and they will share  their personal journey and how they have come  to the point here.
"Without any further ado,  I introduce brother Richard here, a wonderful friend in our community."
He will be introducing each member.
Richard Brady is also  a retired math teacher and he has inspired many people.
Having him to come up here is a gift.
I met his student  who came to Plum Village.
After many years he came and  we asked him:
"""Why are you here?"""
"He said; ""I used to take a class."
"My math teacher is Richard Brady."""
"So you can see, just one student's experience in a class, how later on in life,  he confronted suffering and he remembered the teaching and came to learn more about the practice."
There are many stories like that  but I won't hold up the panel here.
Thank you for being with us.
(Richard Brady) Thank you brother.
It is my honor to introduce some old and new friends to you.
It is a privilege to hear from them this afternoon.
"Each will speak for  about 8 minutes, not very long, but we want to leave some time  for questions and answers at the end."
"So, just focus on them and if there is any questions that come up afterwards, be ready to ask them."
He's lazy.
And they gave kind of behavioral descriptions to something that wasn't behavioral at all.
"To be told over and over again, you're not quite cutting the mustard, it breaks down your self esteem."
And you have to go somewhere else to get your self esteem built up.
And kids get into trouble.
And they go looking for things that are more exciting than being told every day that you're dumb.
I think there's a huge payback for not providing kids with what they need.
"Just as the experts could have predicted, Adam turned to drugs and alcohol."
"When I drink, it's just to forget about everything."
"If I'm really having a tough time, I can't take this anymore, I just have to go drink some beers to let it all just get away."
There's been a lot of evidence of drug use.
"Continuously money being stolen, no matter where it was."
"We're kind of guilty of overlooking it, thinking, well, you know, so he needs some money."
"But when he gets into the thousands, you know, we've let it go too far."
And it got there.
"Then, one night, the phone call every parent dreads."
We get a phone call from the state police.
I thought he's getting ready to tell us that somebody been killed.
"I thought about, how do you plan a funeral for a kid who doesn't seem to want to be part of your family anymore, doesn't want to be a kid?"
Adam was safe but in deep trouble.
The police claimed that he had crashed a stolen car.
"The next morning, Terry took his 15-year-old son to the psychiatric ward at Boston Medical Center and had him committed."
I've had my son hospitalized to give him some attention.
"I mean, he could have been killed that night."
And he was out that night because he skipped school that day and didn't want to come home.
So he was out that night.
"I mean, how many more chances does he have?"
"After years of academic failure, Adam's slow, downward spiral was turning into every parent's nightmare, a teenager too far gone to rescue."
His parents will soon be confronted by that terrible prospect.
"But right now, the story of another young boy sending alarming signals that he is headed for trouble."
"His parents, desperate for help, can feel him slipping away."
"10-year-old Nathan Suggs lives in rural Bear Creek, North Carolina where he"
It's designed for other people too.
We should think about everyone living in our city.
"We need more things designed for everyone."" Babies, children, young people and old people are living in our city."
Some people are physically challenged.
We sometimes care about only ourselves but we should care about those people too.
"As a person living in this city, I want to make everyone happy."
It's important for us to think about things from other people's points of view.
That's the thing I learned in this class.
Let's work together to have a better life in our city.
Hey guys.
Welcome to another episode of Drive Clean.
"I'm Larry from ammonyc.com, where we're obsessed with driving and protecting cars."
"Now, on today's episode, we're going to be working on a 1958"

"Now, the paint is totally wrecked, so we're going to restore it."
That's all coming up today on this episode of Drive Clean.

"Before we get started, I want to thank all you guys for the emails and comments I received since the first episode."
"They've been spectacular, and I'm really grateful for them."
"But the cool part is I've actually kept track of everything you suggested, and we're going to try to incorporate them into the upcoming episodes."
"So for today, we're going to restore this 1958 Porsche Speedster."
"Now, I think the problem was they washed it improperly, and nobody took care of it, didn't put a cover on it and left outside, so the paint is totally wrecked."
"Now, the first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to clean, protect, or restore the paint."
"Now, obviously, in this condition, it's so bad, we're going to need to restore the paint."
"Now, the second question is what year is the car and has it been repainted?"
"Now, this particular car is a 1958, but it's been repainted in modern times."
"So now I know there's clear coat on it, I can approach it differently."
"Now, the third question is a little bit more complicated."
It's deciding whether the paint is hard or soft.
We're going to talk about how to figure that out in the upcoming steps.
"So this episode is going to be a little bit more complicated, because we're really going to geek out."
"From then on we danced together, no matter where or when; waiting for the underground or the bus stop."
"And we are still like that today after 10 years that when we are going to a dance, we just walk faster"
We just want to arrive and start dancing!
"Unconventional, without prejudice and full of life energy; Lindy Hop is more than just a dance!"
John:
"Hi, I'm John Green."
"This is Crash Course World History and, today, we're going to discuss, wait for it, the Mongols!"
(wild galloping music)
So you probably have a picture of the Mongols in your head.
"Yes, that's the picture."
"Brutal, bloodthirsty, swarthy, humorously mustachioed warriors riding the plains, wearing fur, eating meat directly off the bone, saying, ""Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar."""
"In short, we imagine the Mongol Empire as stereotypically barbarian, and that's not entirely wrong."
"But, if you've been reading recent World History textbooks,"
"like we here at Crash Course have, you might have a different view of the Mongols, one that emphasizes the amazing speed and success of their conquests."
How they conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans did in 400.
How they controlled more than 11 million contiguous square miles.
"And, you may even have read that the Mongols basically created nations"
"like Russia, and even Korea."
One historian has even claimed that the Mongols smashed the feudal system and created international law.
"Renowned for their religious tolerance, the Mongols, in this view, created the first great free trade zone,"
like a crazy medieval Eurasian NAFTA.
"And, that's not entirely wrong either."
"Stupid truth, always resisting simplicity."
(upbeat lively music playing)
So remember herders?
"We talked about them, back in Episode 1, as an alternative to hunting and gathering or agriculture."
Here are the key things to remember.
1.
Nomads aren't Jack Kerouac.
They don't go on random road trips.
They migrate according to climate conditions so they can feed their flocks.
2.
"Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?"
"You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing, you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry."
"You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"""
"I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye, dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers."
"I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day."
"""And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively, it might be time to think about it."
"Because, dude, you know, four years."""
"You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around."
"And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally."
"And now, when I talk about the show,"
I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.
"I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not."
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
"As a group, they're the happiest people I know."
"And I don't want to start whistling ""Look for the Union Label,"" and all that happy worker crap."
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work.
I swear to God --
I did it with them.
They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.
And I see it over and over and over again.
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows.
Follow your passion -- we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?
Probably the worst advice I ever got.
(Laughter)
"You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?"
"I mean, that's all I heard growing up."
"I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out."
"I can give you 30 examples, right now --"
"Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine."
Why?
The film begins as a proper horror film with this mysterious ghostly ship coming through the mists.
"And the score cycles through all of it's motifs; there is a suspense score, and there is a mysterious music track."
"And then, The extra-diagetic music goes away and we start to listen to what's on the set of this dock."
And that's where things start to get interesting.
So let's watch and listen to how Robson and Lewton set up sound at the beginning of Ghost Ship.
[music]
It's the beginning of our score.
[music]
And now we hear the harpsichord and the blind man off screen.
What we see are these knives.
So that violent motif is set up right away.
And there's a distance between what we see and what we hear. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [music]
"Me, give me some time to blow the man down. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Good luck. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Thank you, sir."
"Being a sailor, you'll need luck."
"A young sailor, too. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Now so, the blind man cannot see, but he hears very well."
Speaker:[inaudible] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And he seems to speak the truth.
"He knows that a hero is an officer by the sound of his bag, that will come in a moment."
"And he also knows that this is a bad ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; You've got a blind man's tricks for telling what men are like, but ships [inaudible]. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; So, it begins with this foreboding of a man who cannot see but hears, and as our hero walks up the plank listen."
"Blow the Man Down, the song reappears."
Now Blow the Man Down is an interesting song.
It's a song about beating a sailor who's been insubordinate and it's also a song about ships on rough seas.
There's a song of great foreboding and terror.
"And yet it's introduced gently here as though it's just a man singing about a, a quaint song about going out to sea."
"Now, things get even stranger and more interesting when we are introduced to Finn."
So listen to how the music works at this moment.
Speaker:[music]
I'm the third officer.
Where can I find the Captain? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; There's our knife again.
Gestures with the knife.
"Now watch when we cut around, and listen to the music."
[music]
"Hear that as that smoke comes in, we get the mysterium theme."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"My name is Marianne Thieme and I'm a Member of Parliaments for the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, and our party is the very first in the world to champion the rights of non-humans in a national parliament."
"However, there are other problems in the world aside from animal welfare."
So tonight I am going to tell you some very hard truths about what we are doing to our planet.
And I am so pleased that you are ready to face up to these realities ...
"If you look at the ten hottest years ever measured, they have all occurred in the last fourteen years."
The world is heating up fast and we have ourselves to blame.
Global warming is real and we humans are almost certainly the cause.
"Global warming, that's the world's greatest current concern."
Everyone finds themselves in its grip.
From scientists to politicians to the
Secretary General of the UN and even Leonardo di Caprio.
We face a convergence of crises.
Industrial civilisation has caused irreparable damage.
"By the middle of the century, there may be 150 million environmental refugees."
"Not only is it the 11th hour, it's 11.59."
"But, it's that other film, made by Nobel Prize Winner Al Gore, which has truly succeeded in putting this global problem on the map."
An Inconvenient Truth was a real wake-up call to the world!
This was a great achievement for Al Gore.
"However, he forgot something rather important."
The consequences of global warming are enormous.
The climate researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have estimated that by the year 2100 one to three billion people will be in dire need of fresh water.
Hunger will increase throughout large parts of the globe.
"So, it should come as no surprise that global warming is currently our foremost concern."
Everyone who has seen Al Gore's film knows that our Earth is in bad shape.
Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced.
This is on the agenda of every world leader.
The causes of global warming must be dealt with now.
And so together we must identify the greatest emitters of greenhouse gasses in our society.
What do you think?
What are the sources of greenhouse gasses?
"We're saying that it's a negative emotion because it does, and I've seen it many times, actually stop a person's growth for weeks, for years."
"You're disabled for the time that you're grieving, until there usually comes a time when you transcend that, you go through it, past it."
"And the quicker that happens, the better.."
I would say.
And certainly if you look in the Buddhist texts the grief was never encouraged by the Buddha.
"He would always actually say that the wise person is beyond that grief, could understand the nature of life and death, and in that understanding could let that nature be."
And never fight battles which you can't win.
"There's a famous Buddhist story, it's in the Dhammapada, I'll just go on with this, it's a man who cried for the moon."
"A man who lost his only son, and would go to the cremation ground every evening to cry and cry and cry, and his family let him cry for a while."
"But when he was crying overmuch they wanted to find some way of overcoming his grief which was going on far too long, ruining his health and his business as I've seen happen."
"They hired an actor and the actor went to the cremation ground also, and the actor was crying more than the father who'd lost his son."
"When they met together, these two men crying their eyes out, the actor crying more, the actor asked, ""what are you crying for?"" He said, ""I've"
lost my son.
"He's dead..""."
"""What are you crying for,"" said the father to the actor."
"""I'm crying for the moon""."
"""What do you mean, crying for the moon?"" ""It's my birthday last week, and my father asked me - what do you want?"
And I said I want the moon please.
"And my father wouldn't get it for me, and I'm so upset.. I'm crying for the moon."" And the father said,"
"""You're stupid."
You're crazy!
Why are you crying for?
"No-one can give you the moon!"""
"""You call me crazy,"" said the actor, ""You're crying for your dead son."
At least you can see the moon!
"Where is your dead son?"" [laughter]."
"And at that, this is a story, an old story, in the Buddhist texts, at that, the man realised what he was doing, he was crying for something you can never get."
Grieving for something which you can't change.
"And that was enough for him to stop his grief, go back to work, and move on with his life."
"The story of the man who cried for the moon, in the Dhammapada."
"But as for John Howard, yeah we respect him, but we crack jokes about him."
People crack jokes about everybody in Australia.
I'm not sure what I've seen.
- Who chose the epitaph?
- I did.
"It's from the second chapter of Philippians, verse 12."
Emily recited it to me the night before she died.

"Now, I'd like to ask you about what happens as the number of flips or events, in general, becomes a very large number."
Check all that apply.
The probability of every individual sequence becomes small
The probability of every number of heads becomes small.
"So for example, does the probability of having one head or hundred heads or million heads, any specific number does that becomes small."
"Does the probability of every given proportion, for example, one head out of 100 flips, 10 heads out of 100 flips or 1500 heads out of a billion flips becomes small."
Does every given range of proportions have a smaller and smaller probability.
Are there some ranges of proportions for which the probability becomes small as we have many flips.
Check all that apply.
"Also, assume that the probability of heads is neither 0 or 1."
"That is, we can get both heads and tails from this coin."

How to make giant soap bubbles
"We prepare a mixture of water, Marseilles soap, paper glue, sugar and a little of glycerine."
"This mixture is poured into a flat bottom container, where we dip a hoop and then lift it."
"Better than any comment, the video shows the successful development of the experiment in front of a young audience."
"The soap and sugar in the mixture has reduced the surface tension of water, which allows to create thin films of a huge surface and that can last long."

Still today the number one  cash crop in the world.
"And it's the best crop for keeping indigenous people in the jungle, so that we don't cut down our sacred forests."
"Every time you choose to buy chocolate, organic chocolate, and or,  what I prefer -- raw chocolate, you are voting with your money  to save the rain forest, and it is a vote that counts."
It's the best vote you can have.
It grows in a little pod.
What an interesting looking plant.
It grows right off the trunk.
The fruit does.
And inside -- there's the flower.
This is the glory of chocolate.
Look at the different colors there.
Inside we see this.
"These are the cacao nuts,  or the beans, or the nut that all chocolate is made out of inside."
And around each nut is a white pulp.
"And that pulp was traditionally  in Amazonia and Central America where chocolate is from,  was only eaten by women."
But men ate the nut on the inside.
This is what that pulp looks like.
That's what we call 'The best day ever'.
"When you have that much chocolate,  real chocolate, original chocolate, raw chocolate, the fruit than nut,  the pulp, everything, but you gotta watch out,  because all the creatures in the forest eat it."
"And in fact, it is known that if you have a forest with 140 species of different birds then when you put a cacao orchard in, and you put it right into the jungle; no trees are taken out,  nothing is cut down."
"You take your little baby cacao plants or ""chocolate trees"", you put them right in the forest, and that will attract at least  40 more species of birds."
Birds love to hang out in chocolate trees.
"It comes back to this; the coin of the realm, the great cacao bean."
The secret inside.
We had an amazing discovery early on.
"In that, that cacao bean, the thing  that all chocolate is made out of, is the highest antioxidant food in the world."
This was a discovery.
This was not known ten years ago.
It is known now.
"Chocolate contains 15 times  the amount of antioxidants as wild blueberries, 20 times the antioxidants  as what's in green tea, 30 times the antioxidants as red wine."
"All of those pigments of color,  that are captured, that beautiful purple color that's the antioxidants;  it's actually the color."
And the brown of chocolate  is the polyphenols that protect yourselves and actually  protect you from aging.
"Now, if you remember that problem, and even just to do that problem, when we thought about this statement, such that the trace of A is not divisible by p, we figured out that this was exactly equal to saying that A does not equal 0."
"So one way to view the result of problem 43 is if you assume that A is not equal to 0, there are p minus 1 squared members of T sub p where the determinant is divisible by p."
So we're starting to count some of the A's whose determinant is divisible by p.
But these are the only-- the matrix A's whose a entry is not equal to 0.
"So if we want to count all of them, we have to also count the ones where a does equal 0, so where a does equal 0."
So let's think about that case.
"We can figure out how many matrices there are where a does equal 0, and the determinant of A is divisible by p."
Add it to that.
Then we have the total number of A's whose determinants are divisible by p.
"And we could subtract that from the total number of possibilities, and hopefully, we'll get one of the answers up here."
So let's think a little bit about what will the determinant look like over here?
"So in this situation, the determinant of our matrix will be-- it's a squared."
"It's a times a minus b times c, a squared minus bc."
"Now, we're assuming that a is equal to 0."
"If a is equal to 0, it's equal to negative bc."
"And we need to think about how is this going to be a multiple, or how is this going to be divisible by p?"
So this has got to be equal to some multiple of p.
"So the first thing, just think about b's and the c's."
They are both non-negative.
So this value right here cannot be negative.
"So if you put a negative sign there, it cannot be positive."
So it can't be any positive multiples of p.
It could be 0.
So we could have negative bc.
"We could have negative bc is equal to 0, which is equivalent to saying that bc is equal to 0."
"That's one possibility, where it equals 0 times p."
That's still a multiple.
Or maybe it could be negative.
Maybe we could have negative bc is equal to negative 1 times p.
"But when you think about it here, if this was true, that would mean that bc is equal to p, so b or c would be factors of p."
"Now, we know that p is a prime number."
"Its factors are only 1 and p. b and c-- I mean, one of these guys could be 1, but then the other guy would have to be p."
"Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant  to me."

"You want to find something that you are engaged with, that you are engaged in, that something that keeps your interest because some of you are going to look back at this time in your life when you were a revolutionary radical and then you grew up and you had kids and stuff."
"I was going to transform the world, now I'm a corporate lawyer with 10 clients, making half a million dollars."
I want to come and visit you then.
"Because life is like that, but the point is you evolve."
You grow.
You deepen.
Let's end the bigotry against young people.
I know some of they sag their pants like they live in sag harbor.
"Maybe if you lift their hope, aspirations, and dreams they're pants will follow."
[Applause]
"Martin Luther King Jr. didn't just change black people, he changed America."
He made white people more human.
He made white civilization more tolerable.
And he brought the humanity of black people to bear.
But he refused to give up on white brothers and sisters and said there is something dignified and beautiful in the consciences of America when we can appeal to those consciences to transform America.
This rather unusual looking car can reach speeds of up to 180 kilometres an hour but that is not what makes it special.
All is revealed when it unfurls it propellors; this car can also fly.
The Personal Air and Land Vehicle or PAL-V is a gyrocopter that can both fly and is allowed on the road.
So what do you need to drive this machine?
"Robert Dingemanse, CEO and founder of Dutch company PAL-V, said:"
"""A normal drivers licence."
And for flying a personal or private pilot's licence and that's something you get in around 20 to 30 hours worth of lessons.
So it's pretty easy in a gyrocopter.
"It's a gyrocopter and that's the easiest way of flying, also the safest way of flying."""
"If the PAL-V sounds like the answer to the traffic jam, there is a hitch."
"It requires 165 metres of runway to take-off, 30 metres to land and can only be flown from an airport."
"It is expected to retail for somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 euros."
The Zande have dozens of names for illnesses and they also have hundreds of medicinal plants that they use to cure those illnesses.
"But when the treatment doesn't work, if the illness gets worse, they pay less attention to the medicine, and they turn their attention to the witch that is behind the person getting sick in the first place."
"For example, stubbing your toe is not extraordinary."
So if you stub your toe usually gets better after a few days.
"But if it doesn't get better, if it gets infected, if it turns into gangrene, that's witchcraft."
Or lots of people catch the flu.
And you get over the flu in a few days.
"If you don't get over the flu and it gets serious, and you catch pneumonia, that's witchcraft."
"So if the Zande can't control the illness through medicines, they turn to something they can control: social relations."
And I have a couple of stories that I'll show you how that works.
Medicines-- or caught not that one.
Here's a picture of Lucy and her son Benjamin.
Benjamin was just a few weeks old when I arrived.
And he had conjunctivitis in one eye.
And I always carry small bits of medicines with me when I travel.
So I had antibiotics and I treated him every morning; every evening.
I put a drop in his eye.
It got better.
"Lucy wasn't really concerned because it's very common for babies to get conjunctivitis, and it usually clears up, and it did."
But then the conjunctivitis came back in the other eye.
And so now she was getting a little worried.
I then treated the baby every morning; every evening for five days and the eye cleared up.
"So, Lucy was kind of wondering what was happening, but she was okay because it-- then it cleared up."
But then it came back again in the first I.
"And this was really a sign that something was going on, and that there was probably witchcraft involved."
"Now, babies are not usually victims of witchcraft because they really can't offend people."
And he was never really in danger of dying or anything.
"So Lucy interpreted his eye-- is conjunctivitis as a sign that someone was upset with her, and she knew who it was."
So now I want you all to think like a Zande.
Who could possibly be mad at Lucy and her baby?
[inaudible]
Pardon?
And yet what we are doing about?
Our State Department isn't making peaceful contact
So we must.
Our Department of Energy is not funding non-classified projects dealing with these  science and technologies
So we must
And certainly the Pentagon is not disclosing this information and therefore
We must.
So this returns this whole issue to perhaps where it should be
"And that's us, we the people"
And not just the people of America or of Europe
But of Africa and India and China.
"Every man, woman and child on earth has a stake in this."
The Disclosure of this information will enable us to move forward as a People
With all the science and technology that we need to have thousands of years of abundance and peace on this planet.
This is really what this is about and I hope you will help us.
Thank you very much.
"So if 2π radians is one full circle 360°, what do you think will be 1π radian or just π radians."

"Fifteen years ago, if anybody would have told me"
"I'd be standing in front of you guys talking about food,"
I would have said they're totally nuts.
"Because I was in Texas, in business school, on a full scholarship."
"I was about to graduate as the top woman in my class, and I was being recruited by Enron, (Laughter) and the oil and gas industry."
I so wasn't a foodie.
"But I was so type A, and I channeled that into academia, and what I decided to do - I wasn't really interested in Enron, thank goodness - and I decided to go into the investment world as an analyst, and I covered the food industry."
"And I was so completely inept at this whole food thing that when Martha Stewart came through our offices bringing her company public, and everybody had her sign the cookbooks,"
I had her sign the financial statements.
(Laughter)
I couldn't cook.
"So when my husband and I decided to move here 12 years ago,"

Martin:
"Yes, it's also one of the things we are allowed to tell you people, that you may well start thinking about everything as in movement because everything is basically motion and the more one goes into the movement, the easier life you get it is no more than a few years ago it dawned on me that our beloved Greeks didnt have a word for music"
"What is called ""musica"" is a blend of all the musical expression, so"
"If one started playing, there was of course one that began to dance, another who sang and everyone attended there was no real audience until far into antiquity"
"I think we could learn something from that, and it's also what you say that the movement becomes a part of it"
"I'm sorry to say so but if you want to continue the illusion as a earthling please do, but I would love to help you so if I may, in the other dimensions, you let me know in any case, I think we should all lean at Ole Fogh Kirkeby's wise words"
"A true philosopher, I hope it plants seeds out there in small ponds"
"And so I thank you for your participation, Kirkeby's one of the good guys in philosophy master's in human and Dr. Phil of management philosophy at Copenhagen business school. and director of the ""Centre for Art and management""."
Did I say that the right way?
Ole:
Yes
That is very much in one person

"Too-sly-for-you writes ""hey, genius!"""
"And you can see that in 2000s that 1.3 percent or yeah, 1.3 percent gap basically doubled to 2.5 percent gap in the next decade."
Health care cost mushroomed.
"Now, this is a somewhat complicated slide but I just talked to you about the fact that o ver four decades, we've have this big growth."
Basically 2.4 percent above the growth in the GDP in health care.
Taking more and more and more of the GDP into health care arena.
This is projected by the Congressional Budget Office into the future.
It's not all health care spending.
It's just federal health care spending which is predominantly what?
Medicare but also have a big portion of Medicaid.
And this is to see what happens if there is no excess cost quote.
"That means, if healthcare cost which I haven't done in 40 years equal GDP."
That solid line here is what happens over basically the next 25 years if health care cost do not rise any faster than the growth of GDP and what do you see?
Just interpret the graph.
What do you see?
It's still growing right?
"This is a percentage GDP, Medicare and the Federal portion here is about five percent and you can see, it goes over eight%, 8-1/25 in 25 years."
"This in the GDP, if it doesn't exceed GDP."
"If it exceed GDP by two percent which is slightly less and what has been doing in the last 40 years, you can see it balloons past ten, eleven%."
"And if it has slowing growth down to 1.7 percent points, okay?"
You can see that it still goes over ten%.
"So, the federal budget contribution to health care is extremely."
"Dependent on how much healthcare grows above GDP but even if it doesn't grow above GDP, it's going to be bigger and bigger drag on the federal budget, okay?"
"This is one reason people who are budget [inaudible], who worry about the healthcare, worry about the federal budget."
The predominant worry is not social security but healthcare.
"We're going to do a few international comparisons so that you could get a feel for how our healthcare spending compares to the rest and well, as [inaudible] percent, how mush more does the US spend on healthcare than the number two country in the world?"
"32%, say 30 percent were third higher."
"32%, say, 50 percent of quarter, say, 40%."
"Before we get there, who is the next highest country in the world?"
"It's Norway, that's right."
They are number two.
"And they spent we spent rough, they, we're at 50 percent higher than what they spend."
Look at this graph.
"It didn't have a clear designed aesthetic, it didn't have an approach to consumers."
So it was a very powerful product and if you couldn't figure out what was really the best user experience you'd build both and have a pref for it.
"It was known as loaded and overweight and technically good, but a poor product."
That was 2002.
"About a year later,"
AOL decided they were tired of investing in the browser.
"They still had, I don't know, 75 or a 150 people they were paying to work on the browser and they weren't really getting anywhere with it."
"At long last, they became interested in taking mozilla.org assets and giving them to those of us who'd been running the project."
"Again, to give you a sense of what life was like in those days, mozilla.org assets were the trademark, the name, mozilla.org, four big servers we fought for that ran all mozilla.org"
and some seed startup money.
That was really it.
"Yeah, Mick."
[Question]
That's definitely the timing.
"Yes, so that was why it may well have been."
What Mick said was
"""wasn't it the case that the reason AOL stopped investing in browsers and in Gecko is that they just completed a deal with Microsoft where they had agreed to use IE or the Microsoft rendering engine in their browser."""
Is that right?
"Yes, that's right."
"The AOL client, that I forgotten about."
So Microsoft managed to buy AOL out of their own browser effort.
But it was good for us.
"Because that didn't seem like a lot of assets, but it was really critical to us."
"We had thought before about starting our own effort at mozilla.org but without the name, it would have been really hard."
"And four giant servers doesn't seem like much today, but in that era it was a big deal."
"We also got some seed money from them, we got 2 million dollars."
That was a funny story too because
"I had ended up working with Mitch Kapor,"
"I don't know if you know, from Lotus, those who remember Lotus 1-2-3, and Mitch had come to see that open source was really important, after he left Lotus and he had his own open source organisation, and I was working with him."
And he really stepped in to help us.
So Mozilla has a history of things appearing when we need them.
"There is that saying that is it luck, or is it effort, or is it skill."
"When I was studying in London, I took part in Malaysian and Singapore student organizations, and I dare say a couple of them were pretty radical."
"I thought they wanted to know my activities in London, for which I was mentally prepared."
"However, I began to feel disoriented after their repeated questions."
They kept wanting to know what instructions Tan Wah Piao had given me and what he had told me to do before I left London for home.
I was puzzled to say the least.
I knew not their target was Tan Wah Piow.
I did not know that there were so many people who had been hauled up.
Let me share with you this anecdote.
"I remember in the first few days of detention, our breakfast consisted of a boiled egg, two pieces of bread and a glass of tea with milk."
Almost the same everyday.
It could be the second day when I was one of the first to be served with breakfast.
I was jolted when I saw there were more than a dozen eggs in the bag the Gurkha adjutant was carrying.
I was stunned.
"Prior to this, I knew that one of my friends had also been taken in."
But I never thought there were so many people involved.
One of the detainees asked to see her lawyer.
The cold reply she got was:
"""Your lawyer has also been invited to ""have tea"" with us."""
"It shows how unprepared we were mentally, really!"
"It was strange that when I came to know they were spinning the yarn of a ""Marxist Conspiracy"","
I kind of sighed a heave of relief.
I surmised it must be another of those stories in Arabian Nights.
That same old story!
Why the ISD bigwigs decided to pick Tan Wah Piao as the vortex to get all of us sucked in.
I have yet to find a satisfactory answer!
I told one of the senior officers in ISD that I didn't know many of those arrested.
The answer given was:
"In a conspiracy, you needn't know all of the members involved!"
We may giggle at the reply given.
"But the stark reality is that the 1987 incident did act as a dreadful deterrent to more than a generation of Singaporeans, particularly the youth."
"For over 20 years, people were so wary of politics that they exercised all-round self-censorship."
"Even now, people still recall events in those years with considerable trepidation."
"And maybe eh, the star goes first so he sets the balance to 100, 500 minus 400."
"And then the buffalo sets the balance to negative 200, 100 minus 300."
And you know what we just did?
We just robbed the bank.
[LAUGH]
And then they both report true and you've got 200 dollars ahead.
"And that's not to good Actually BYOB will try to stop most of these, and this case it does."
There's no raised condition here because
"BYOB fixes it but this code does create race case, Race Condition."
There're two more problems of concurency problems that we want to talk about.
The first one is a deadlock.
The two people or multiple threads or multiple cores are trying to grab the same information but they won't give up the information that the other needs.
"So in this case, eh, two people are, need to draw a graph and one grabs the pencil, the other grabs the paper and the guy with the pencil wont let go of his pencil until he gets the paper and draws his graph."
And the guy with the paper wont let go of the paper until he gets the pencil.
"And they're just stuck there, always waiting, and that's not to good."
There's also this image of these cars that none of them can move forward because there's a car in front of them.
"I think if this guy got out it would slowly get fixed, but it's a bit hard."
[LAUGH].
"Similarly, there's a livelock."
"When, deadlocks are very common and eh,"
"You say, okay if you've got the pencil or the paper and you can't get the other one maybe you can put yours down for a minute and come back, and that's a good way to solve it right?"
"But what happens if both people, one grabs the pencil, one grabs the paper and tries to grab the other one but they can't."
"So they both put it down at the same time, they both go away for a minute, they both come back, grab the same one and they can't get the other one again."
"So they put it down, go away, they come back and they still can't do it."
And that's a livelock.
"You're trying to get rid of it and, but because your algorithm eh, keeps matching itself, it actually doesn't work."
"The other very common example eh, that we love, and I'll let Dan and Luke show it to you guys when they do, is that if two people are trying to pass each other in a hallway sometimes you both lean in the same way and then the other, but livelock is that you infinitely do this."
That you just can't get out.
You're stuck in the hallway all night.
What to do?
Cool.
"So in summary this move to parallelism is a big sea"" change""."
"So, conversation mode will be available on Google Translate in a few months."
We just wanted to give you a sneak preview.
I have just one more demo to show you before I go.
This is actually launching this week.
"It's the new Street View Ul, which will launch as part of an update to Google Maps for Android."
"And to show you that demonstration,"
"I'd like to take a quick trip to Florence in Italy, so I'm going to click on the bookmark here on my desktop."
"So here we are in Florence, Firenze."
I'm going to zoom in a few times and move around.
"Now, to activate the Street View feature, I can click on the business so I can just hold in place anywhere on the map, so which is exactly what I'm going to do here."
Let me try a different--slightly a different place.
So here we are.
"So, I can click on this little guy here, we call him Pegman and he will just launch the UI for me."
"So what you see here is a beautiful, you know, three-dimensional panorama on Street"
"View and there's a little guy here which we just launched, and if I drag Pegman around, you'll see this little circle, we call it the pancake; and the pancake actually knows the three-dimensional structure of the scene pretty well, so you can see that it understands that there are building and facades; and I can just drag it where I want to go, just"
"like I do on the desktop, and it will just take me there."
"Pretty cool, right?"
So it looks
"like there's something interesting here down the street, so let's keep going a little bit."
Let me just try this again.
Sorry about that.
So let's take an even bigger leap here.
So
I just keep going down the street and there's a beautiful building down there which I would
love to take a closer look.
"Now, here, I just want to show off this again."
Look how amazingly well is the understanding of the 3D scene here that we have with Street View.
"So I can actually get very close to that building down there, that's the Santa Croce Cathedral here in Firenze or over in Firenze."
"Again, I can zoom at it more closely."
"So if I want to take a look at the very specific details of the facade, I can see them in high resolution."
"This is beautiful, almost as if I were right there."
So these are the demos that I wanted to share with you.
(Laughter)
"So, anyway, we started and  because I have the disability,"
"I asked a colleague to teach with me because there are days I just can't walk and there are days that  my voice is not so good, so I always worked with a colleague."
So we started off about 8 years ago.
We had no money and what we had to do  is we have to make sure that we have enough students  to be able to pay the teachers.
"So, that is one of the most important lessons for you to think about."
We keep waiting for money and  permission to do this work.
And you don't have to do that.
You just have to step into it and  you have to find a way to integrate it.
"So whether you do luncheon learns for the teachers, whether you do it after school program, whether you integrate it into the teachers' morning coffee, however you are going to do it."
There are so many different ways  to be able to start to integrate mindfulness  and mindfulness meditation.
"Jack is right; that  if you teach the teachers, it will be contagious and  it will go right through the classroom."
"So, now I teach at University of Toronto,  and I also teach APEC master."
"So, two universities  for the mindfulness program."
That's remarkable.
And why are they asking?
"Because they realize that in health care in particular, not in education that is our issue, my program is addressing the professionalism which includes education but largely is a lot  of health care professionals."
We are suffering.
"I would say that right across the board, the society is suffering."
I think the world is suffering.
And we have forgotten how it is  that we are to attend this suffering.
So this is my goal and I have 60 workshops at University of Toronto and  there are 40 faculties.
Many of them who are here today.
"Okay, go ahead, hit the gong."
(Laughter)
That is another thing  mindfulness can do for you.
It just allows you just a larger vision because you perceptual feel changes.
(Laughter)
So I want to say to you that this is easy.
You can't be stuck in your demoralization  and we are all feeling demoralized.
"When you start to think back  to the early work of Thay around the Vietnamese war or Martin Luther King we worked with, you can imagine their demoralization  around seeing so many people injured."
We have gone the longest  of any civilization without war.
"""Driven to the last necessity, and obliged to have recourse to arms in defense of our lives and"
"liberties."""
"So they're saying, 'We're not rebels who are out to rebel against the King."
"We're actually--We've been driven to this by what's going on in Massachusetts and we're protecting ourselves, but this is a defensive act and not an aggressive act.'"
"And then when you read a little further on in the statement, after all of this sort of noble, lofty sentiment, they then promise each other they're not going to get drunk or gamble or swear."
[laughs]
It's down to practicalities.
"Now that we've declared our purpose to the world, no heavy drinking."
Okay.
"The next day, April 22,1775, classes at Yale were suspended and a lot of students went home."
"Some, a few, actually, went off to fight."
So you can kind of see the way that the wind is blowing in New
Haven.
"You can imagine, given these sorts of events potentially how much fun it would have been to be a college student with Loyalist leanings at this particular moment."
It would not have been very fun--and sure enough in 1775 there was that student.
I discovered that student this morning.
"There was a--I don't know if he's the only one, but he's the guy who got in trouble."
There was one college student here at Yale who was a declared
"Loyalist, 1775."
He did not make other Yale students very happy.
He must have been loud about being a Loyalist.
"Otherwise don't know how it would have been so obvious to everyone that he was a Loyalist, but the--a large chunk of the"
Yale student body decided to have a meeting to debate what should be done about this student.
Okay.
"Obviously, things are not going to go well for the student."
'What should we do about this student?'
"They decide that they are going to formally denounce him as-- publicly, as, quote, ""an enemy to his country""-- and that no one will be allowed to socialize with this student ever again."
Okay.
They've just ostracized this--Can you imagine?
Sorry.
'You've just been entirely ostracized from every other person at Yale University [laughs] because we don't like your politics.'
"So when I first found this this morning, I was like: oh, poor guy, and I couldn't figure out what happened next and I just felt sorry for him."
Telemachus basically undoes any doubt that we had about whether he's grown up.
"Remember at the very beginning of the, of the epic, Athena comes up to Telemachus and says basically, just come on, grow up."
"It's time for you to get going, take responsibility."
"On book eighteen he says, I used to think as a child, but not anymore."
"My heart takes note of everything, feels it too, both the good and the bad."
The boy you knew is gone.
So Telemachus is now stepping into a different stage of life.
"And he is ready to take on responsibility for, not just his own messes, but other people's messes."
"That's probably a pretty strong part of what it is to grow up, is taking on other people's messes."
"Who knows, maybe there should be a universal law built into this one."
To grow up means to take on other people's messes.
"But Telemachus is stepping up to do that and ready to, ready to do it."
Others seem to notice that this is going on.
"At the close of eighteen, he makes threats on page 389 that the suitors take seriously."
People are recognizing that he's talking more stringently.
"Page 419, we see another example of this."
"The suitors bite their lips, amazed at Telemachus stepping up and getting his, getting his more grown up person to take responsibility for what's happening around him."
Then we also see some close-up with what the suitors are all about.
We see this through Odysseus's eyes.
"We've heard from them, we've seen the misery and threats to Telemachus."
We've seen Penelope have some very small interactions with them.
But we really get to see them at work.
"See them, see the suitors being the suitors through Odysseus' eyes."
"And this starts opening up to us in this section of the, of the text through book seventeen and eighteen."
Odysseus makes his way in and makes contact and we get to see what they're
like.
"So these suitors, who are eating Odysseus out of house and home and helping themself to whatever they feel like that belongs to someone else."
"When a beggar comes in and ask them for their scraps, they turn him away similarly."
The suitor's not only abused the xenia that they expect is going to be offered them as sort of guests who horribly overstay their welcome in Odysseus' house.
"But, they've not only pervert that xenia but they also refuse to offer the xenia they should offer to the stranger that washes up into their, into their region in this courtyard of Odysseus' house."
They treated him with abuse.
They don't give him any food.
"A load of pople, and suddenly a sofa flying over everybody."
A sofa appeared through the street and they carried it into the square.
JL:
(laughs) Yes!
There have been precious moments that I didn't experience but they've told me about them.
"Like the first morning they ate rice with prawns, because the neighbours' were so supportive, or people who came from far away, brought a pot, and although they couldn't stay, they left it there so others could eat."
"And I remember the first or second night, they brought nine pizzas that someone had ordered for us from Galicia."
Someone in Galicia called a pizzeria close to Sol and put 9 pizzas on their credit card and asked them to be delivered to the kids that were there.
"That doesn't happen in real life, or maybe it does and we don't see it, that there are people that generous."
ST:
"I remember, maybe on the 17th, the second or third day, people from a restaurant came with beans and rice pudding."
"And I was so happy, for a few moments..."
JL:
"That was the Asturian, he also took cider."
He also took some of his own cider.
"I don't know if it's the same asturian, but a co-worker of mine interviewed that gentleman."
And he took his lorry.
"He took a lorry full of soft drinks of a particular brand, maybe we'll find out if it was the brand or the bar that sent them."
But there were very beautiful moments of true solidarity and communal generosity.
But that's not what it's all about.
Although it allowed the atmosphere to be very pacific.
"And the atmosphere swallowed up the very few who maybe would have liked to cause problems, because that was their way of fighting the system."
But that's not the debate
I want to go into.
"What I mean is that soon those people who usually do that kind of thing, they didn't because they were swallowed up by the multitude which said: ""we don't do that kind of thing here, we've decided that's not how we want to protest for now""."
That's an important force.
"And then the third moment of emotion was during the confluence of the ""northwest march"" and the ""northeast march"" on the 19th of July which was the first authentically hetergeneous demostration."
They came from different neighbourhoods and cities.
The moment they joined together at a roundabout on the Castellana.
Patricia:
Gregorio Marañón [in the background]
JL:
"Not turn the mindfulness  into another ought, because we can do that  if we are not careful."
"I guess I'll advice you to get support and to say that of course there is a great deal of it about, really."
There is a lot of mindfulness happening  in many ways and under many titles.
"So let's not get obsessed with any  particular approach, sect or language."
Let's reach out to people in social emotional learning.
"There are many mindfulness programs happening at the moment, very good curriculum being already developed."
"If you want to know what is around,  go on the Garrison website."
There are 37 programs to draw and  lots of fascinating stuffs around.
"I think we should really see science as an ally, not the enemy and I am sure I am preaching to the converted here."
But I think things like randomized control trials can be our friend not our enemy.
"I said that to someone  who is just being part of a group who published the randomised control trial or the .b program, and found very effective changes in terms of stress and anxiety and so on."
"Neuroscience is our friend, not our enemy."
We don't want too much 'do-wellism' here.
We don't want to start thinking  nice people teach mindfulness and nasty people teach physics and math.
(Laughter)
(Bell)
It is the same in classrooms.
"I am going to take 2 minutes  to say a couple of things, if I may."
"The final thing I'd like  to say really is to make sure that we bring mindfulness to people, not to expect people to come to it."
"And to be aware that for some people, the kind of stuff we do is very off-putting and very weird and very odd."
"We need to stop where they are, not where we'd like them to be."
"If we want to talk to teens,  for example, it may be 'singing songs about flowers' is not going down well with some tough teenagers."
(Laughter)
"Mad, dare I say."
Don't we get any more minutes  for laughter time?
No?
Okay.
(Laughter)
"Just to make sure that we express things in ways, in the language and imagery and use things like films and pop music and so on to really appeal to teens."
"Similarly, if we are talking to  administrators, let's talk where they are."
"Let's talk the language of stress  and number of days saved if people learn mindfulness, not to expect them to get into the spiritual side."
"They will get there, it is a path, we can start anywhere, as these people said."
"Nomads don't generally produce manufactured goods, which means they need to trade, so they almost always live near settled people."
And 3.
"Because they generally live close to nature and in harsh conditions, pastoralists tend to be tougher than diamond-plated differential calculus."
"Think of the Huns, or the Xiongnu, or the Mongols."
(wild galloping music) Okay.
"Stan, that's enough."
Back to me.
Come.
STAN!
"I AM THE STAR OF THE SHOW, NOT THE MONGOLS!"
Hi.
Sorry about that.
So one last thing.
"Pastoral people also tend to be more egalitarian, especially where women are concerned."
"Paradoxically, when there's less to go around, humans tend to share more, and when both men and women must work, for the social order to survive, there tends to be"
"less patriarchal domination of women, although Mongol women rarely went to war."
I can't tell your gender.
"I mean you've got the pants, but then you also have the [floopity] flop, so that's the technical term, by the way."
I'm [an] historian.
"If you had to choose a pastoral nomadic group to come out of central Asia and dominate the world, you probably wouldn't have chosen the Mongols, because, for most of the history we've been discussing, they just hung out in the foothills, bordering the Siberian forest, mixing herding and hunting, quietly getting really good at archery and riding horses."
"Also, the Mongols were much smaller than other pastoral groups,"
like the Tatars or the Uighurs.
"And, not to get all great man history on you or anything, but the reason the Mongols came to dominate the world really started with one guy, Genghis Khan."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"The story goes that Genghis, or Chinggis, Khan was born around 1162, with the name Temujin, to a lowly clan."
"His father was poisoned to death,"
"leaving Temujin under the control of his older brothers, one of whom he soon killed during an argument."
"By 19, he was married to his first, and most important, wife, Börte, who was later kidnapped."
This was pretty common among the Mongols;
Temujin's mom had also been kidnapped.
"In rescuing his wife, Temujin proved his military mettle and he soon became a leader of his tribe, but uniting the Mongol confederations required a civil war, which he won,"
largely thanks to two innovations.
(Bell)
"(R. Brady) Thank you John, thank you all."
Thank you all.
We now have about 25 minutes  for questions and answers.
"Please, there are some microphones in the center aisle."
"Please make your question brief, the answers also may also be brief."
Please ask your question  of the whole group and whoever feels led to respond would do so.
"It maybe that no one feels ready to respond and your question needs just to sit with you, which is a wonderful form  of contemplation."
Rilke talks about it in a very famous  quotation about living the questions.
"We all have questions that will take years for us to get answers to, so we might not get them today."
Let's begin with the first question.
"(Man in the audience) Hello,"
I grew up and started practicing as a child in a discipline which is quite different  than anything you do.
And actually I became a teacher  of this tradition.
That tradition was alloted to and added to science.
"Science as a tradition, as a discipline, has become the dominant one  in our culture today."
"Now, one of the interesting things is that over the time that I was teaching,"
I was trying to teach the students one thing.
That is to understand reality.
"And I find that the Buddhist tradition is essentially trying to allow you  to do the same thing, to see reality clearly  and to understand it."
"I wonder whether you teach the students using the Four Noble Truths, etc, to do that."
"(M. Chaban) The new science is going to be something that doesn't divide subject and object, is not reductive and all the paradigms  that went with scientific materialism have been proven inaccurate."
"We have lived for 500 years with one world view and we are at the tipping point of what Michel Foucault, a French  philosopher would say is a new episteme."
If you look at and this is more... because I am sure you understand this if you are asking the question.
"But if you look at Dan Siegel's work,  he has done a breathless presentation  on what the new sciences will be."
It would include the subject 'the voice'.
"So, part of what we did today  is we talked about ourselves."
That wouldn't be allowed a few years ago in any kind of scientific presentation.
"Secondly of all,  we are polished scholarships."
"Some of us are Buddhists,  some of us are not."
"Yet, we deep into different traditions and use them because they counter and form each other in a positive way."
His Holiness said that Buddhism  is very scientific.
"By one measure, the US stock of money is now $8.7 trillion--up 12% since last year."
And some people are still pocketing a huge share of that cash.
"Last year, despite the onset of the biggest financial crisis since the Depression, his hedge fund paid George Soros a cool $2.5 billion."
That's roughly 41 000 times more than the average American family earned.
"As they say on Wall Street,"
"""Way to go."""
"Now however, imagine a world with no money."
"500 years ago, the most powerful society in South America, the Inca Empire, had no real concept of money."
The Incas appreciated the aesthetic qualities of rare metals.
Gold was the sweat of the sun.
"Silver, the tears of the moon."
"Labour was the unit of value in the Inca Empire, just as it was later supposed to be in a Communist society."
"But in 1532, the Incas ran into a man whose hunger for money had led him across an ocean."
Francisco Pizarro and his fellow conquistadors had come from Spain to what the called
"Upper Peru, inspired by the legend of Eldorado-- the realm of the gold-covered king."
"After defeating the Inca army at the Battle of Cajamarca, their quest began in earnest."
"At Potosi, in what is now Bolivia, the Spaniards struck it rich."
They discovered the Cerro Rico--
"literally, the ""rich hill""."
"Towering nearly 16 000 feet above sea level, it was a money mountain."
"In that 250 years of Spanish rule, more than 2 billion ounces of silver were extracted from mines like this one-- 14 000 feet up in the Andes."
What the Incas couldn't grasp was why the Europeans had such an insatiable lust for gold and silver.
They couldn't understand that to
"Pizarro and the Conquistadors, silver was much more than just shiny metal."
"It could be made into money-- a store of value, a unit of account-- portable power."
"I must say, I find this place pretty harrowing."
"Spaniards had a system of forced labour, which meant that every able-bodied male in the native population had to do a stint down in these mines."
And you can see why 1 in 8 of them didn't survive the ordeal.
"Today, 500 years later, conditions for miners in the Cerro Rico haven't improved much."
But at least they get paid for the work they do.
"In those days, it was a way of making money but verged on genocide."
"The silver ore was ground up, refined with mercury, and then shipped to Europe as bars and coins. made the Spanish crown rich beyond the dreams of avarice."
"I thought to myself,  ""That is a good idea."""
"Mindfulness Without Borders not only develops programs  for health-care provider, professionals and the adults that surround youth, but let's do something for youth as well."
"And in time, with a group  of wonderful practitioners, and educators and lay people, and the younger generation thinkers, we developed curriculum called  The Mindfulness Ambassador Council."
"What separates us, I believe,  from the strictly mindfulness curriculum is that we wed social and emotional  competencies into the program."
It is 12 weeks.
"We teach and facilitate conversations in a council, where we value everybody's voice equally,  where there is no discrimination."
No discrimination.
(Laughs)
"And where we appreciate diversity, where we build self-esteem and, more than ever, where we hear people, we hear anyone who is in our council."
"We hear their voices, and we value them."
"So, our core values in the organization  are core concepts of mindfulness."
Our programs that we built  are core concepts of mindfulness.
"And we start off with breathing,"
We start off with using the breath  to bring us into the present moment.
We move into understanding and  talking about some of the challenges that prevent us from being our best self.
"We develop conversation around being compassionate, empathetic, understanding."
And all through the council process where  we just deeply listen to one another.
"It has been remarkable journey, and I think that if we all begin to take what we know best, model mindfulness to others, and advocate for that together as a community,"
I think we will be stronger.
I know we are in 23 states of Toronto  capital and district school board.
"And had it not for two lovely women who  are here, Rita Mamon and Diane Benasco, we would have never gone  as deep as we have there."
We plan to expand the roots  and we look to you as advocates.
"So, thank you and if you want  to learn more, we have a faculty here and we are in the bookstore there."
Thank you very very much.
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Theo."
Can we have one bell?
(Half bell) (Bell)
(R. Brady) Our next speaker  will be Jon Kristian Salunga.
Jon is a classroom teacher  in a high school in San Diego.
"He teaches English and like many of you, he teaches in public schools."
It is probably not so easy  to actually teach a practice so that may not be  the door you come in.
We will hear from Jon  about the door he has entered.
Hand out of the frame!
What is this fractal snake doing here?
"Vi uses speed ramps and transitions, effects available in Adobe Premiere to produce a fluid switch between her hands and the intern's hands."
"My video includes snippets of Vi's video and  her video includes snippets of my video so our two videos are intertwined, like Escher's Drawing Hands"
"When I began watching Vi's videos, I wanted to know where Vi sets her camera and desk when shooting her doodling videos."
Alright!
So I got my tripod with my camera.
Looking at my notebook.
And I guess usually you don't know what else is on my desk.
In this case...Well there is always going to be sharpies everywhere on all sides... and possibly some snakes...
I have this pen holder for holding my sharpies...but  very quickly they end up screwing around.
My script is here for reference.
I have some lights clipped  to random things...That I may or may not use.

Many of you may be wondering whether she storyboards her doodling?
No!
She just draws whatever fits her script.
"After shooting, she does a voiceover, typically at home  because it is quieter than her office."
She uses a Blue Microphone to capture the best possible sound.
"She records straight into Audacity, a free audio editor and recorder."
As you'll learn later on in this video the vlogbrothers appreciated vi's videos and as a present gave  her a mic and a higher resolution camera than the one she had been using before.
"If you look closely at my video, you can see  Vi is shooting on a Canon VlXIA HF M40."
Next Vi edits her video.
She uses Adobe Premiere on her Toshiba laptop.
She speeds up videos so you can see in just  a few minutes what takes hours to shoot.
Then she syncs it to her voiceover so that her  narration correlates to the images in the video.
Next she uploads her new creation to YouTube.
"Vi has a ""cool"" interface on YouTube because she is a partner."
"Following up on the theme of this video, recursion, Vi  and I point our cameras at each other."
"On the basis of viewers"" and fans"" comments and questions, Vi  and I decided to do a short interview."
"If you have questions about Vi's videos that aren't answered in my video, please let me know by writing a comment  below and I will answer them on a live chat, see the description below for the date and time."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high They reach the sky
And like my dreams They fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles

United!
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.
(Laughter)
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.
"And you're on the outside, you're at home."
"You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water."
And -- (Laughter) -- you just play with your fingers all day.
And then you get invited.
"And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be."
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over.
And it's only taken five minutes.
And you want to go back and do it again.
But I really appreciate being here.
"And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible."
"So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism."
"And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about."
"You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z."
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
"But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us."
"Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?"
And our own opportunity to make something new there?
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
"I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation."
"And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur."
And everybody's happy about that.
(Laughter)
And they're happy over and over again.
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
"And then, then, then, and then ..."
"Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire."
"And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around."
"So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos."
(Laughter) (Applause)
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
"Now if you want dinosaur DNA,"
I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
"Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen."
"And one of my former doctoral students,"
"Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing."
"And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there."
"They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world,"
like red blood cells.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
"And so she thought, well, what the heck."
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
"But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin."
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
"So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project."
"And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them."
"And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff."
This experience allows us to take the concepts we've learned and put them to work in the practical world.
At the end of the class we collaborate with Damon Lee's Film Scoring class to create a music score that fits the style and tone of our film.
This class was a great opportunity to learn the art of film-making and come out with a work of my own.

Glamour Lighting Setups
Catalogue Photo Biz Part 2
"Hey fellow photographer, how's it going?"
I'm Michael Zelbel.
Welcome to Glamour Lighting Setups.
"Even though, today's setup is actually not so glamorous after all."
We don't even have a model.
What we have is two mannequins.
And those are not even my mannequins.
"I just borrowed them from a fashion designer in the neighbourhood, who was kind enough to give them to me for a little fashion catalogue shoot, that I did for another client."
I used that last time as an example in another video of mine in which I explained to you how I think that such a catalogue shoot is so much easier for us amateurs in case we want to earn some money with photography so much easier than let's say wedding photography or let's say microstock photography.
"If you didn't watch that video please go back, watch it right now, but what you won't find in that video is explanation of the lighting setup."
"But you told me that you want to have this explanation, so today I'm doing the video with the lighting setup."
"What you want to do if you want to do such photos really really good is: you want to enable the viewer of your photos the reader of the catalogue or the user on the website wherever your photos are, you want to enable them to really feel the fabric."
You want to bring across the fabric and the three dimensionality of the garmet and what you also want is clear separation from the background.
Ideally the background is 100% white.
But be careful!
"If you too overexpose the background, then you easily get lensflare, and that really reduces the quality of the image."
So look carefully when you are shooting.
I will now show you the basic setup.
"What I used was a big white sweep, a paper backdrop, but you could also use a white wall."
Just make sure nothing in the room is really colored and could throw a color cast onto your clothes.
"All I was doing was paying off the interest on the debt I had, which was £30,000."
"I was basically rocking around the clock, really."
My standard of living wasn't good at all.
I didn't go out and the amount of money that I had for food was £40 for the month.
I came to a time when I thought enough was enough and at the time I was working in a hospital.
I started going to the chapel there and that's where I then found a book called 'Word for Today'.
I read that book and at the back of it it had a salvation prayer.
I read that salvation prayer and I gave my life to God.
I put my heart and soul in a letter and I sent it off to the address that was at the back of that book.
I got a phone call from somebody called Pastor Sheila.
She invited me to the church and she counselled me and I told her about my debt problems and she gave me some information for Christians Against Poverty.
"At that stage I was so relieved because of the fact that I knew then that I would get support, and the burden just lifted."
"Any letters, any correspondance that I had with my creditors,"
"I just directed them to Christians Against Poverty, which was a relief, basically; it just took away the stress."
"As a consequence to becoming a CAP client, I also now support people who are also in debt."
"I've learned how to budget, my standard of living has improved because I'm able to go out and socialise, which I couldn't do before."
The fellowship with the people at church is crucial as well because they also offered support.
"When you are going through debt you sort of withdraw and you don't socialise because of the lack of money, but once the stress has been taken away you're able to talk about it and testify about how good God is and how stressless you are."
"The home stretch, we're on problem 18."
And this diagram actually looks like something that this little tool I'm using is well-suited to draw.
"Let me try-- I'll draw the one in the back first, so I can do different colors and everything."
"So I'll do the one in the back in yellow, and it looks something like this."
"Goes like this, then it switches over like that."
"And then I'll draw the next one, this orange color, and it looks something-- no, I'll do it in a more drastic color."
So it does something like this.
"It goes like this, crosses over, dips down, then it goes over again."
"And then finally, this last one, and it looks something like this."
"Crosses over and it goes like that, very pretty."
Now let me switch to a smaller-- OK.
"Why don't we do white, I never write in white."
In the figure above--so they say this is the start.
And this is step 1.
"And as the internet grew to encompass millions around the world, a new problem emerged."
"At the time, encryption required two parties to first share a secret random number, known as a key."
"So how could two people who have never met agree on a secret shared key without letting Eve, who's always listening, also obtain a copy?"
"In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman devised an amazing trick to do this."
"First, let's explore how this trick is done using colours."
How could Alice and Bob agree on a secret colour without Eve finding it out?
The trick is based on two facts:
"One, it's easy to mix two colours together to make a third colour, and Two, given a mixed colour it's hard to reverse it in order to find the exact original colors."
"This is the basis for a lock, easy in one direction, hard in the reverse direction."
This is known as a one-way function.
Now the solution works as follows:
"First, they agreed publicly on a starting colour, say yellow."
"Next, Alice and Bob both randomly select private colours, and mixed them into the public yellow, in order to disguise their private colours."
"Now, Alice keeps her private colour, and sends her mixture to Bob, and Bob keeps his private colour, and sends his mixture to Alice."
"Now, the heart of the trick."
"Alice and Bob add their private colours to the other person's mixture, and arrived at a shared secret colour."
"Notice how Eve is unable to determine this exact colour, since she needs one of their private colours to do so."
And that is the trick.
"Now, to do this with numbers, we need a numerical procedure which is easy in one direction and hard in the other."
"This brings us to modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic."
"For example, to find ""46 mod 12"", we could take a rope of length 46 units, and wrap it around a clock of 12 units, which is called the modulus, and where the rope ends is the solution."
"So we say ""46 mod 12"" is congruent to 10."
Easy.
"Now, to make this work, we use a prime modulus, such as 17 then we find a primitive root of 17."
"In this case, 3, which has this important property that when raised to different exponents, the solution distributes to uniformly around the clock."
3 is known as the generator.
"If we raised 3 to any exponent X, then the solution is equally likely to be any integer between 0 and 17."
"Now, the reverse procedure is hard."
"Say given 12, find the exponent 3 needs to be raised to."
This is called the discrete logarithm problem.
And now we have our one-way function.
"Easy to perform, but hard to reverse."
I hope you try them all and enjoy them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Thank you, Hugo."
"Now, you know, what we've talked about is we've talked about the importance of mobile, and we've also talked about the mobile--the importance of the connection with the super computer."
We've not talked about much about entertainment and YouTube and so forth.
"But we, in fact, do want to talk a little bit about Google Television. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
"Yes, of course, we've saved the best for last."
"So with no further ado, I'd"
"like you to welcome my colleague from the Google TV team, Brittany Bohnet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BOHNET:"
Thank you.
So you would never want to buy a computer without an Internet browser.
"In these days, especially after that demo, you'd probably never want to buy a mobile phone without an Internet browser."
"Soon, you're never going to want to buy a TV without an"
Internet browser.
And I'm here today to show you a few examples of what's possible when you have an Internet browser on TV.
"First, a few notes before I get started."
I want you to understand the context here.
Google TV is launching this fall in the US only.
"And while we're very excited to bring Google TV over to places like Europe, unfortunately, we don't have anything specific to announce at this time."
So consider this a sneak preview.
"Now, I'm actually not demoing on any of the final hardware today."
You see here a dish satellite box that I'm using to control my DVR recordings in the presentation.
The box on top of it is a generic development box that we're testing the Google TV software on right now.
I'm even using a random wired keyboard that I picked up at an electronic store a few days ago.
"It has full QWERTY keyboard functionalities, a pointing device and some"
TV specific buttons.
"Now, when we come to market in the US this fall, we'll be launching with three devices from Sony and Logitech."
"Sony is launching a Google TV powered HDTV, as well as a Google TV powered Blu-ray player."
Logitech is launching a Google TV powered box that connects to the TV you already have.
"Now, both of these OEMs are going to be building incredible remote controls that you can use with the TV."
"However, you can also use your"
"Android phone or iPhone as a remote control as well, and, yes, you may be able to do some of these incredible voice commands, that Hugo just demonstrated, on your TV."
Can you imagine searching for a channel name and watching your TV tuned to the channel?
"""You have a serious hearing problem"",  she tells me."
"""You have a serious invasive problem"",  I tell her"
"""When I talk to you,  you don't listen..."""
"""When I'm focused in my work you talk to me and I don't know whether you're talking to me  or you're just talking!"""
"And then began the crossed accusations, you, you ,you."
"Now, how would it be  if instead of this accusations of speaking in second person, we could  reverse it and talk in first person?"
"This is how I see it,  maybe I am wrong but it is what I believe."
"How would it be if instead of  always trying to dominate, we could look into what is happening?"
What do you need?
What do we have to talk about?
"And, how would it be if instead  of trying to always impose ourselves, we could propose."
"Making it neither your opinion nor mine, but finding a creative way  of making it ""our"" opinion, right?"
What we're talking about is a misterious art.
The art of handling filters.
And it has at least three parts.
"The first,  is to recognise that I have my filters, it has to do with me, it is a biased sight of a much wider reallity, from where humility emerges."
"On the other hand,  recognising that you have your filters too and you also have a biased sight  of a much wider reallity and maybe even you have some information  that can be useful for me and that is where respect appears."
"And finally taking your filters and mine and construct a bigger filter,  which is more useful, more complete, more valuable."
There is where collaboration appears.
"How are our relationships seen  when they are based in values such as humility,  respect and collaboration?"
"Taking this into my example, with humility,  the matter would be of recognising that, okay, it is true that I have  an irritating capability sometimes to isolate from the exterior world, I respect the fact that it bothers you, as well as I ask you to listen  to the needs I have."
"Lets collaborate together  and find an option, when you want to tell me something,  ring the bell, text me, wait, clap your hands, or hit the cymbals."
"And tomorrow at the end  of the school day, I will willingly pick-up the kids, sit them in the park and we'll make balls of glue and we'll take them to the 24/7 guy across the peninsula of Yucatán."
(Aplause)
You ever been to Miami Beach?
Yes.
With a girl?
Yes.
Particular girl?
"Particular, yes, but she didn't carry a gun."
I've heard about those nights down there.
"They're warm, very warm."
"""You can't store it at the house cuz eventually it just corrodes through the containers and stuff."" ""It's gonna be a good thing for us to take used motor oil from the customers that are coming and dropping it off to us, instead of the customers dropping it off and leaving the used motor oil out on the streets."
We h ave a 55 gallon tank that we use and then we have someone else come and recycle it and take it from here.
"""So far we've gotten about 35 people and we've collected about 78 gallons, if not more."" ""And here are o ther locations where you can go and drop off if you're not in this area."
And it's absolutely free.

"I'm just very quickly going to cover the Safe Harbor statement, and then turn it over to Mary and Eric."
"So, before we begin, I would like to note that our comments and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements regarding Google's business outlook."
Our actual results may differ from those made in any forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
These risks are detailed in our public filings with the FCC.
"Also, please note that a web case replay of this session will be available on our investor relations web site in a few hours."
"We routinely post important information on our investor relations web site,"
"located at investor.google.com, and we encourage you to make use of that resource."
"So, with that, I'll turn it over to Mary. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Thank you, Krista, Maria, Vic, David, and Eric for coming."
We've moved the schedule back 10 minutes.
"Eric's been in the building for 15, but we finally got him in the room."
"For my disclosure, go to our web site for all information you need to have."
"So, Eric, thanks for coming."

Ole:
"I think thats true and in many ways thay actually realized an ideal life in relation to the cultural and there have been lots of them who have been talented musicians, I can promise you and painters ... christ what is this all about, right? and they didn't have to be professional cause to be proffesional's a compulsion right?"
"If you have enough money, you can always grow it as an amateur, in German called ""Lieb haber"" someone who does something because he enjoys it"
Martin:
"""Amo"" does mean ""I love"""
Ole:
Yes thats true
Martin:
"So if I have to pick up on your totalitarian leadership of the world, if we are to achieve it all before the crisis ..."
We need small units and within the small units we could make a cultural revival we could institutionalize one in any case and then hope that rises a culture in light of the disaster which might also be repentance and then the music very well could play a larger role in the formation project but also as quality of life
Ole:
"Yes, Community Project"
Martin:
Community Project yes.
What else could be included?
Ole:
"Also painting, I think."
Children are phenomenal painters .. many of them have a sense of color that is ever so good
Arts's a way where people generally don't have to harm each other when unfolding
And I think limited sports can be too when it doesn't mean that you have to be wonderful
Martin:
"There's also some sports that potentially could be artistic but thats still about who can make the most twists in the air and jump highest and things like that, right?"
"So that has also been taken out of the artistic of those who potentially had it, perhaps?"
Ole:
"I remember that long ago I read, that in Brazil were a tribe they played out on the criterion that it was important to get the other team to win"
It can of course be a good sport but I like that way of thinking
Martin:
So the competition culture does not benefit anything at the moment?
Ole:
"No, I do not think it has benefited anyone anything ever"
Martin:
But you could say that this Greek way of compeeding to the arts might have helped them become so good? or helped them become so good in so little time.. thats what some thinks..
"As you can see at the bottom, there is the chip."
I'm sorry.
"The middle is the chip, the bottom is in the package."
"It's usually the size of a quarter, which is not too big, sometimes smaller even."
And this does all the work in your computer.
Some key terms that you don't need to know are feature size.
Feature size is the distance between two consecutive wires in the CPU.
"In this case, this computer has feature size of 45 nanometers."
That's so small that it's way too close.
"And nowadays, I believe they have a 22 and maybe sixteen coming up soon."
"Who? other things you need to know about this, that the CPUs have hundreds of thousands if not millions of transistors on them so that they could do all the computation really fast."
"And they have a multiple layers, so just"
looking at the top doesn't make much difference.
That's basically it.
One of the biggest topics when you learn
"Computer Science and when you do research in work in the development is Moore's Law, and, if you take anything away from this lecture, it should be Moore's Law."
"And Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on your chip is doubled about every two years, actually every eighteen months."
"What's Moore did, sorry, Moore is the [INAUDlBLE]."
"What Moore did was that he plotted the computers before his time for like two years and he said, you know, this has been happening so far and I'm going to predict that it's going to happen in the future and so far it has."
"As you can see in the slide, you can see a really nice straight line in a linear-log curve."
"It's a line in a linear-log curve, as you, go along it multiplies by two as every increment."
"Again, Moore's Law is super important that the transistors of a chip are multiplied by two and then they're twice as small every eighteen months."
Awesome.
A very common mistake about Moore's Law is thinking that a lot of exponential growth in computers are also relevant to Moore's Law and that's not true.
"So, here are, are a few."
"Moore's Law only talks about transistors, the top graph, And you can see that over the years, say, you can see more data points that it's held true."
Other things that have also held true is the power consumption How much power you take?
And that has basically doubled over time.
"So has the frequency, how fast your computer runs, the clocksped."
"What happens to this computers, go, have steps and every time the clock changes, they take another step."
"And as you raise the clockspeed, you make the computer faster and that has gone up."
"And the single thread performance, the speed of the computer doing one thing has also increases exponentially."
(Applause)
"You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something."
"Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, ""I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"" they would say, ""Thank you very much, we have other things to do."""
And that is the astonishing power of art.
Art can go through where other things can't.
"You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, ""I am this, I am that, I am that."""
No.
It breaks through those.
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
"And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through."
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
"And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth."
"And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts."
For me it came very early.
"When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her."
"It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families."
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
"He came to talk to her and said, ""What is this about?"""
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance.
Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.
"Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in ""The Mahabharata"" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences."
"Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, ""Hey girl, that's it!"""
"And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,"
"""Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça?"
"Ça!"""
"And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, ""This is it!"""
"And I thought, ""This is what we need, as a language."""
We had somebody from public health.
And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
"Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year."
"And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation."
"So, what do they do?"
ladder.
"Remember, this was the instant when the right side of the ladder pokes out of the right side of the garage, and so I look at this equation and I say x prime two is equal to L, so I say L over here."
"And that is going to be equal to'x',"
'x' is'g' because it's at the right side of the garage and then minus'v' times't2' and then divided by the square root'1' minus'v' squared of over'c' squared.
"And okay from this I can solve, everything here is known, except for T2."
"So I multiply by the square root as I'm always doing, move the square root over to here."
"Notice I get the foreshortened length here, and what I find moving things around is that vt2 is G - L * the square root of one - v^2 / c^2 by construction we said that this is less than G so vt2 is positive because I was running fast enough."
"This number is small enough, the Lorentz constructed ladder fits into the garage."
"That means its right end will emerge from the garage after the left end entered. perfect that's what we set up in the garage's frame, the ladder fits into the garage."
How does this look in the ladder's frame?
Well and indeed there is this whole time as I said between the time the left end enters and the time that the right end exits that the ladder is completely contained in the garage.
Good for us.
"On the other hand, what happens if I look at the same thing from the point of view of the ladder, what I want to know is at what time did as measured by the"
"ladder, did the right end of the ladder exit the garage, so I want't' prime at this same event."
That turns out to be easier to extract from the inverse transformations.
So again x is equal to g.
So I put it g over here.
Over here x prime is equal to l.
"And I want T prime, so again I can solve for T prime."
And I find that V T prime again multiplying through the square root.
"I find that'vt' prime is one over, the square root of one minus'v' squared over'c' squared times'g' minus'l'."
"Now, G is less than L, this is a number less than one."
"T2 prime is negative. remember that T2, T prime = zero and also, Tzero, = zero was the time when the left end of the garage entered the garage."
"But here, the right end of the garage emerged before."
"So indeed, in the I adder's frame of reference, the ladder was never in the garage."
You couldn't close both doors.
"Because, as far as the ladder is concerned, before the tail end of the ladder entered the garage, the front end of the ladder was protruding."
"So what happens you ask if the garage owner in his frame when the ladder is completely as he sees it contained in the garage, swiftly closes both doors."
"Well, lets follow that in a graphic representation which will give us a chance to play with space time diagrams and see some of their strengths and limitations."
We could also do the calculation this way but I wanna demonstrate a graphic method of solution.
So hopefully.
"What we, what did we get from here?"
"Now, I think the parties are afraid, because people are so outraged."
"I would say, on the left and the right, knowing this presidential election is going to cost $2.5 billion dollars--obscene--the--if you add the congressional races, you're up to $5.8 billion--that just says that our system is broken."
"And I think that the two parties are worried about it, because the American people are starting to realize that it's very hard to keep calling our system a democracy when it's being run by a very small elite that is the shadow government."
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
"I don't have much money, but boy if I did"
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
"If I was a sculptor, but then again, no"

My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done"
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
"Well, a few of the verses"
"Well, they've got me quite cross"
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see
I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done"
I hope you don't mind
Last Probe for HuK!
"Three hit points left on this Stalker, it is trying to get around to the smoke."
"The Zealot is coming around, to try and swing it."
"Going into the smoke, the Zealot, will it kill the Stalker?"
"It is regenerating a lot of shields, now up to 20 shields is the Stalker, and NaNiwa might have done the impossible!"
"- His shields are coming back, that's exactly what he needed."
"The Probe are trying to get a surround, the Zealots are getting some shots off, down to 13 shields."
"NaNiwa, be careful, please!"
He needs those shields to come back.
"HuK trying to track down that Stalker, it is going to come down to micro here, trying to trap him."
One miss click and one of these players will lose the game.
And the Probe going for the kill.
"Down to eight shields and three HP, this is absolutely the most insane game I have ever seen."
Insane micro from both of these two players.
"The Stalker running around, trying to stay alive, trying to micro the best he can."
"HuK is hilariously trying to mine with the one Probe he has, trying to get more units on the field."
"But, this is an insane game Kibbles."
"- Axel, what has happened here?"
"While all of this is occurring, HuK is currently taking, he has taken out the Nexus with a Zealot, and NaNiwa has no chance of having an economic recovery."
This Stalker is his last hope to victory.
All the buildings could eventually be killed here by the Zealot in the main base.
NaNiwa has a clock ticking.
But he is managing to maybe kill one of these Zealots here.
"HuK, ultimately may end up needing to bring the Zealot from home."
This type of situation is called a dominant strategy in that confess is a dominant strategy for player 2 meaning it's always the best regardless of what the other guy does.
"Think about this the other way around, say we make some guesses as to what player 2 is going to do and then when we say in each case what's player 1's best response in that situation."
"So if player 2 confesses, what's the best thing for player 1 to do?"
"Say if player 2 confesses we're over here on the right somewhere we say player 1 can either get 5 by confessing or 0 for being quiet this problem is looking strangely familiar, say well 5 is better than 0 so player 1 is going to want to confess."
Now if player 2 doesn't confess what should player 1 do?
"So if player 2 doesn't confess, we're over here on the left somewhere and player 1 can either get 10 by being quiet or 15 by ratting out his buddy, well 15 is greater than 10 so he's going to want to confess."
Notice here that because we confessed in both cases confessing is also a dominant strategy for player 1.
So here I've circled player 2's best responses in green and I've circled player 1's best responses in blue and you'll notice there's one place here where they over lap to say that in this situation where both parties confess both of them are responding as best they can to what they think the other person is going to be doing.
I can't feed everyone that comes up to me so he's going to have to beg some scraps from the suitors.
"Now, in doing that on page 354, what Telemachus is doing is positioning his father, disguised as the beggar."
And positioning his father in such a place that he can now get to know what the lay of the land is hanging around with the suitors.
"And then, Telemachus shows his responsibility, kind of stepping up a little bit more."
"His first conversation with Penelope, he says I need to go meet my friend,"
"Theoclymenus, whom I brought with me and I need to take care of him."
He says on page 356.
"So he's starting to, sort of, step up."
He's been educated.
Let's see here in this picture of the young Telemachus getting schooled.
He's been educated and he's now ready to start taking responsibility for some of the things in this house.
"Closing off, book seventeen, there's a different statement that comes out"
Telemachus' mouth than the one that we're used to seeing him.
"Remember in those early books, he's constantly talking about how the gods are not on my side, if only the gods were on my side, the gods are giving awful things to me."
"He now says what heroes say at the close of seventeen, page 374."
"I'll tend to all things here, I and the deathless gods."
Now this is what a hero does.
"Yeah, sure, it's up to the gods, but it's also up to me."
There's an understood double determination in the events that go on for a hero in the events that a hero is responsible for.
"Yeah, sure, the gods steers all things but that doesn't mean that the hero is not, therefore, also responsible for what happens in, in the, the, the purview of the hero, what's going on in their terrain."
The theme carries on in book eighteen.
"Telemachus is still hovering around the center of the city, and when he sees"
"Odysseus as this beggar, and Iris, the other lowly beggar."
"The two of them are about to get into a fight and there's nasty words back and forth and they take oaths at the beginning So if I win, this happens."
"If you win, that happens."
This all unfolds on page 377.
"Odysseus, Telemachus at that point steps up and says okay, you all can, can count on me to guarantee the oaths that you've just taken."
I am going to be the guarantor of the oaths that you all just taken so go ahead and have your fight but under the understanding that I'm going to make sure that what you all agree to is going to get executed in the end.
That kind of authority to execute on someone else's promises is the kind of thing that someone who's in charge of a situation takes.
So Telemachus is showing himself to be that way.
"After Penelope in Book eighteen points out how this stranger Odysseus was abused by the suitors, he jumps in and starts to take responsibility for that situation too."
"And so at this point on, page 383, that"
"Now in the interest of time, I'm going to leap to 1777, because in 1777 warfare now is unfolding throughout the northern states and some people then began to conclude that actually staying in New Haven and studying at Yale might be just too dangerous for Yale students-- because New Haven was an exposed port, which we're going to see in about five minutes."
It is an exposed port.
So the Yale authorities sent students out to different towns.
They didn't close Yale.
"They just said, 'Okay."
We're going to send students to random places in Connecticut where they will be safer than they are in New Haven.'
"So freshmen went to Farmington, sophomores and juniors went to"
"Glastonbury, and seniors went to Wethersfield."
I cannot tell you why those particular places seemed like
"logical places, but you and your class were sent to a random place to continue your studies."
"On their way out, Yale officials asked the town to please protect the abandoned college buildings from troops--"
"American or British--troops, and some library books were moved inland to protect them in case troops came to New Haven."
"So again, people are feeling there's a potential real threat here."
"Yale eventually did come back into session in New Haven, not without serious problems--and again you're going to see the playing out here of something I've talked about before."
I've talked before about the problems of supplying the army.
It was hard to get food.
People weren't sort of giving up food and supplies to the army.
"Apparently, they--it was really hard for people to get food and supplies into Yale too, that people just weren't--whatever sources of supplies had been serving Yale in the past were no longer doing that in a time of war."
"So in 1778, Yale sent out the following notice to parents of"
Yale students.
"September 30,1778:"
"""The steward of Yale"
College hereby requests the Parents and Guardians of the
"Students to assist in furnishing a supply of Provisions""-- okay, 'parents, would you please send food?"
[laughs]
"We don't have a lot; we really need it'--'""without which it will be very difficult if not impracticable for him to subsist the Scholars the ensuing winter."
A generous and full Price shall be allowed and paid either in
"Money, or their Son's Quarter Bills, shall be most agreeable."""
Okay.
'Please send us food.
"We don't have any, and if you do we'll either pay you or we won't charge you tuition for your son so please give us food'-- which again--Can you imagine being the parent who gets the sorry, there's no food for your son; [laughter] send some now?"
"While you're sending the homespun clothes, send the food too."
"Even if you're just depressed, I'm sure, I'm sure that you're hanging out with people, who probably aren't good for you."
This could even be a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
Somebody who tears you down instead of builds you up.
"What I'd encourage you to do is take out that journal, that I told you to purchase, hopefully a long time ago you go it, you've been jotting down notes."
But today
"I'd like you to make a list of the people that you spend the most time with, and just make note, take note of what they say to you, take note of how you feel when you leave them, when you've spent a couple hours,"
I hope you feel better not worse.
"And so we'll stop, you know, we'll stop torturing ourselves when we surround ourselves with bad negative energy."
"It's much more refreshing to spend time around people who, just build us up, they're there to support."
"So, I hope that's helpful."
"Continue to make your comments and to share this, if you're on Linkedln, if your on Tumbler, if you're on Google+, share this with people."
This can be helpful for anybody!
"This can be helpful for your mom, your friend, your brother all of us need to be supported by people who love us and care for us."
"And also don't forget to subscribe, so that when I post other tips and helpful things, you know about it right away."
"And we'll keep taking one step after another, to a healthy mind, healthy body."

"The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago, and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits."
This is Riversleigh.
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.
We found marsupial lions.
We found carnivorous kangaroos.
"It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo, but these are meat-eating kangaroos."
"We found the biggest bird in the world, bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar, and it too was a flesh eater."
"It was a giant, weird duck."
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.
"You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing, sitting in a pool of water."
These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.
"We had, in Australia, drop crocs."
They really do exist.
(Laughter)
But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines.
"There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests, and they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua."
"Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag, until a drop croc landed on her."
"At any rate, it was a fascinating place, but unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way."
"Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time, and gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out, and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline, until by five million years ago, only one left."
"By 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea, and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was, introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog -- into Australia."
"And as you can see, dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines."
That similarity meant they probably competed.
They were eating the same kinds of foods.
"It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets, and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival."
"All we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in, thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland, and after that they only survived in Tasmania."
"Then, unfortunately, the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788, and they brought with them the things they valued, and that included sheep."
"They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania, and they thought, hang on, this is not going to work."
That guy is going to eat all our sheep.
"That was not what happened, actually."
"Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap."
"But immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them, and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw."
"By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered."
But I like to do it because I think it'll give you the intuition on what's going on when we take our surface integrals.
"So I'm going to say that this whole thing right here, that that is equal to r of s plus the differential of s-- a super small change in s-- t minus r of s and t, all of that over that same super small change in s."
So hopefully you understand at least why I view things this way.
"When I take the limit as delta s approaches 0, these delta s's are going to get super duper duper small."
"And in my head, that's how I imagine differentials."
When someone writes the derivative of y with respect to x-- and let's say that they say that that is 2-- and we've done a little bit of math with differentials before.
"You can imagine multiplying both sides by dx, and you could get dy is equal to 2dx."
We've done this throughout calculus.
"The way I imagine it is super small change in y-- infinitely small change in y-- is equal to 2 times-- though, you can imagine an equally small change in x."
"So it's a-- well, if you have a super small change in x, your change in y is going to be still super small, but it's going to be 2 times that."
I guess that's the best way to view it.
"But in general, I view differentials as super small changes in a variable."
"So with that out of the way, and me explaining to you that many mathematicians would cringe at what I just wrote, hopefully this gives you a little-- this isn't like some crazy thing I did."
"I'm just saying, oh, delta s as delta approaches 0, I kind of imagine that as ds."
"And the whole reason I did that, is if you take this side and that side, and multiply both sides times this differential ds, then what happens?"
"The left hand side, you get the partial of r with respect to s is equal to this times ds."
I'll do ds in maybe pink.
"Times ds-- this is just a regular differential, super small change in s."
"This is a kind of a partial, with respect to s."
"That's going to be equal to-- well, if you multiply this side of the equation times ds, this guy's going to disappear."
"So it's going to be r of s, plus our super small change in s, t minus r of s and t."
Now let me put a little square around this.
This is going to be valuable for us in the next video.
We're going to actually think about what this means and how to visualize this on a surface.
"As you can imagine, this is a vector right here."
You have 2 vector valued functions and you're taking the difference.
And we're going to visualize it in the next video.
It's going to really help us with surface integrals.
"By the same exact logic, we can do everything we did here with s, we can do it with t, as well."
"So we can define the partial-- I'll draw a little-- I can define the partial of r with respect-- let me do it in a different color, completely different color."
It's orange.
The partial of r with respect to t-- the definition is just right here.
I can't believe this is happening.

Call the number of copies M.
"That is, M, the number of copies, well this is the number of copies N raised to the D power."
"So now, we take the logarithm of both sides and here it doesn't matter what base the logarithm it's to, it will work if you do it Base 10, or Base 2, or the natural log, or whatever you want."
"We can take the log of both sides and then we can solve for D, and now we have our definition of dimension."
"D = log M / log N that is, dimension is the logarithm of the number of copies we get divided by the logarithm of how much we divided the sides by... how much we shrank the side."
Let's check this to make sure it works.
"We have D = log M / log N, and you can think of this as log Base 10 if you like."
"As I said, it doesn't matter what the base is."
"OK, to check it, for Dimension-1, we have the bisecting version where N is 2."
"That is, we divided each line into two equal halves, then M, the number of copies, was two."
"And so D equals log two divided by log two, which equals one (D = log 2/log 2 = 1), so that works because that gives us the dimension, Dimension-1."
"So, for the trisecting version, similarly, we had N equals three (N=3), and we divided the side into three equal parts, and"
"M, the number of copies, was three (M=3), so D equals log three over log three, which again equals one (D = log 3/log 3 = 1), so our formula works for 1-dimensional objects."
"OK, for 2-dimensional objects, we have a similar kind of check, where we have for bisecting we have dimension equals log four divided by log two which you can check is two (D = log 4/log 2 = 2)."
You can check that on your calculator if you like.
"And for trisecting, N equals three (N=3), M equals nine (M=9), and"
"D equals log nine over log three, which is also equal to two (D = log 9/log 3 = 2)."
"Finally, for Dimension-3...well, I'll let you check that, but I promise you it works."
"Now all of this has been building up to what we really want to do, which is to calculate the dimension of the Koch Curve."
"So, if you remember, for the Koch Curve we draw a segment, then we erase its middle third, and then we draw an angle to replace that middle third by an angle whose sides are the same length as the other two sides."
"That is, 1/3 the length of the original segment."
"Then we iterate that, again and again, until we finally come up with something that looks something like this."
And we can keep going as long as we want.
"So for the Koch Curve, N here equals three (N=3) ."
"That is, remember we're reducing the size of the segments by a factor of three (3)."
"M, the number of copies of the original, is four (M=4)."
"At each level, we replace the original with four copies arrayed in this configuration."
"So according to our definition, our dimension D is equal to log of four divided by log three--that is log M divided by log N--which is approximately 1.26 (D = log 4/log 3 = log M/log N = 1.26)."
What exactly does this mean?
"Well, for one thing, it means that the dimension of this curve approximates 1.26."
It gets closer and closer to 1.26 as we iterate it through more levels.
But what does the 1.26 mean?
(Jon K. Salunga) I will read a little something for all of us here.
"I wanted to read that and have some other notes too, but I'll be talking instead."
"Dear beloved educators,  I am writing just to say I see you."
"I see you and recognise the fullness  of your life of service, your expertise, your care and hard work, your wakefulness,  your sacrifice, your great offerings found day in  and day out of your classroom, in your lecture halls,  in your offices."
"I see you here,  I see you breathing in and out, connecting with the source of innate wisdom and peace, and power of inner source called mindfulness, our inner curriculum."
"I see you breathing in and out  to give birth to the change, to be the teachers you wish  to see in the world,"
I see you here.
"Breathing in, I am aware  of the daily acts of compassion you contribute in the world through your classroom."
"All the seen and unseen things that you hold, you endure, you balance, you tolerate,  you skillfully negotiate, to keep open the paths of possibility, promise and potential for all our youth."
"Breathing in, I bow deeply  to your immeasurable generosity, fortitude and creativity."
"I see you, I know you are here, and I am happy."
"May we be fully present to engage the collective shift and transformation taking place during this time, this right time on our planet and may we courageously  and creatively participate in bringing the heart back  to the art of teaching."
"May we breathe this new life in ourselves and our work, in the most creative, affirmative, expressive or subtle of ways in countless places for the benefit of our students,  our communities and the planet."
"I offer a lotus to you,  the Bodhisattva Educator in you."
Thank you for being here.
"I work at a high school in San Diego,"
I just want to share my experience  of practicing and bringing in the mindfulness practice more to myself and my work.
"Not necessarily to share with the students, but bringing the field of my own work into my scope of view from mindfulness."
"So, I am going to share something that  I learn from that, maybe might be helpful."
"I am working, in what we call an inner city school, with 95% of the students of color,  African-American students,Latino students,"
"Filipinos, South-East Asian,  Somalian students."
I am just sharing that because that is the context from where I teach.
That is my cushion.
(Laughter)
And I am just sharing today - I have 10 years of teaching so I know there is a lot of other  experienced educators here.
It is just to share my process  and to enter into a dialog.
I guess I use a little of teacher-talk.
"I'll start with an essential question, that's kind of thing that  we say in our role, right?"
"So, what shows up  when I bring my work life into the field of view of my mindfulness practice?"
"And actually one of the things  that I have been experiencing is that actually there is a lot  of unlearning like I am doing, a lot of the habit energy that are part  of school, part of our work."
I am unlearning that.
"The way that we are unlearning maybe, our relationship to eating very fast."
"They're coming to meetings, they're learning this stuff then doing outreach work."
"On their own, you know."
"It's like, when you meet people who really care, who want to make a difference, it kind of empowers you, it inspires you to do more. while at the same time honing your professional skills different areas of the city and people and actually getting out there and working really kind of enhanced your view of the city."
I can actually see my work start growing. and I would have liked to have given back to the community by working within the community of Rochester. and working with other nonprofits as well.
"Yes, 0.4 is the product of these two values over here."
"So, in reality the solution is just to apply the product p1 * p2, and hitting the 1 button gives me indeed 0.4."
I can now go and change this probability to 0.1 and 0.8.
"You probably already figured out that the answer is now 0.08, and indeed, my code gives me the following result, 0.08."
"On July 4th, 2012, physicists in Geneva, Switzerland, made an earth-shattering announcement."
They discovered what we call the Higgs boson.
"A particle, an elementary piece of nature, that we've been searching for for over 40 years."
"And around the world, hundreds of millions of people tuned in and said to themselves,"
What in the world is a Higgs boson?
It's a very good question.
"The Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman once called the Higgs boson the God particle, and for years thereafter, physicists have been shaking their fists at him, because the Higgs boson has nothing whatsoever to do with God."
But it is very very important.
"It's important enough that the world spent over 9 billion dollars to build the Large Hadron Collider, the most complicated machine ever built, to search for the Higgs and particles like it."
"It's a ring, 17 miles around, 300 feet under ground, that goes beneath the border of France and Switzerland."
"If you are walking around in the fields, you would see just mountains, and fields, and cows, but underneath your feet, there'd be this machine that takes protons and accelerates them close to the speed of light, smashes them together to make new particles."
And we found one: the Higgs boson.
I'm Sean Carroll.
"I'm a physicist at CalTech, and I was there in Geneva on July 4th, 2012, for the Higgs discovery announcements."
"I saw the young physicists camping out overnight, waiting for good seats in the seminar room."
I heard the standing ovation when the announcements of the discovery were made.
"[Joe Incandela:] ""...five standard deviations."""
"I saw people get a little emotional, a little teared-up, at this discovery that we've waited decades to achieve."
"In one sense, the Higgs is the end an era."
"In my new book, ""The Particle At The End Of The Universe"", I try to explain why this was so important."
"Why this smart, dedicated people put so much effort into finding this little particle."
"What it is is the completion of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the atoms that make up you, and me, and everything we see in our everyday lives."
But understanding that part doesn't give us all the answers to the questions we have.
We still want to know:
- We're to end on this one because everyone has learned this watching the show
'cause I've helped them.

"So student Lisa asks, what would be different in world where almost everyone was programming"
literate.
So this is the core question and obviously
I feel that it would be great to have such a world thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are trying to encourage as many people as possible to take this class and hope youÃ¢ÂÂil encourage any non programming literate people that you know to take the next version in this class starting in April.
"There are lots of things that understanding programming even at just a basic level and I think many of you are beyond the basic level now if youÃ¢ÂÂve made it this far in CS101, but in terms of the things that you interact with and the things that you see in the world, almost all of them are controlled by programs these days and people who understand programming can relate to those things and have better way than people who donÃ¢ÂÂt."
"And some of this can be sort of fairly obvious things when you interact with a website and you can tell, well theyÃ¢ÂÂve got some bugging it because the programmer didnÃ¢ÂÂt think of that both branches of the NlFT test and if you are a programmer or you at least understand about programming that you maybe have a better sense of what is going on but you also can get a lot more familiar by it because you know well this is something any programmer who knows what they are doing should have test before and understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on and itÃ¢ÂÂs really annoying that you have to deal with their mistake."
Other things you probably have a better understanding of how complicated it is and how hard it is to get things right that you might be a
"little more forgiving when things break and have better ideas about well this is probably why itÃ¢ÂÂs breaking, letÃ¢ÂÂs try to use this tool or use this product in some slightly different way."
So thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the reasons.
The other reason I think is there are lots of things that people encounter every day that if you know a little bit about programming instead of doing a lot of tedious work as a human you can find a way to automate that and save yourself a lot ofÃ¢ÂÂ¦
There is a good example of this right here in our office.
"So when recording these video we generate hundreds every week to get the classes out for all these courses and they are all named kind of default things by the video camera and video X, X,"
"I am English so I find claiming to be successful difficult, we are very self-deprecating."
But I was doing okay ( )
"Then I got a condition like lupus,  an autoimmune condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and I hope no one here ever gets it but if you do, it is similar, horribly painful."
I was just outraged at this.
I was in terrible pain and couldn't walk very well and my life was being very narrowed by this.
"My reaction to this was just to feel outraged, that my life was being spoiled in this way."
Actually ugly enough I became quite suicidal in a sort of way.
"What is the point of life, really?"
"You know, this is not right and  I became quite depressed about this and discovered mindfulness  which actually, to be serious about it, really did save my life and it gave me my life back."
I took early retirement from a job  that was driving me nuts and decided to re-train in mindfulness  at the University of Exeter.
"Now, my job before this was in social and emotional learning and I was training to  be a mindfulness instructor for adults."
"Suddenly, it occurred to me that there might be a link between mindfulness for adults and mindfulness for kids and social emotional learning."
I don't know what took me  so long to point that out.
"Then I started developing work on mindfulness in schools and discovered, of course, that there was a lot already happening."
"As it has been said, I got involved in a major program in United Kingdom which is a lovely program  called .b (dot-be)."
"I became involved  with the work of Thich Nhat Hanh, by muscling my way into a educators retreat in London."
"I was just a substitute to a person  who was supposed to turn up, so I kept hoping that he  would turn up and take over."
"Recently, I have been advising  the Mind and Life Institute where the Dalai Lama is developing a very similar initiative to Wake Up Schools."
"So, rather like your car driver, in a way"
I thank the condition I got.
It's strange really how life can turn out.
How suffering can turn  into something such good.
"Anyway, to stop talking about myself which we the English find very difficult,"
-you guys find it very easy  but we feel embarrassed by all these hard stuff- I'll get more pragmatic now.
"And in a sense just give you a few messages from what I guess,"
"I have gathered with working  with people in schools, particularly in Europe but across the world, really."
"I think it has been said many times but this is essentially about you, as teachers, educators and administrators."
"Just to add a thought to that, which  is to bring this kindness and compassion to yourself, including the bits where it doesn't work very well, where you are not as mindful  as you should be."
Because we really need not turn mindfulness into another ought.
"So if we don't practice,  we don't feel very guilty."
"I know some of the adults that I teach, when they stop practicing  for a while and get back into it, the first rumination they say is, ""Why I don't do this more often, it is awfully good for me, I am really  a bad person if I don't keep this up""."
"So, let's be kind to ourselves, including when we aren't as mindful as we should be."
You adjust.
And you just settle from I'd like him to graduate from college to I hope he graduates from high school.
"And then you change from well, I hope he graduates from high school to I hope he makes it."
You've seen kids that are in jail one day and the next year they're in college and doing great.
So he still has a shot at it.
I'm not saying it's all over for him.
You can't give up hope.
That's about all you do have is hope.
"Hope is what has motivated each of these families to share their stories tonight, hope that we can all learn from their experiences and realize that no child with learning problems has to become a lost child."
"It's a lesson that's been a long time coming, including to families like mine, that with the right diagnosis, the proper management, and lots of hard work and ongoing support, none of our children is beyond rescue."
There really are so many different ways to solve this problem called life.
"I mean, there really are."
"And if you look at successful people, nine times out of ten they will tell you of stories of tremendous struggle."
"If you've got a different kind of brain, and I submit the most interesting people do, that's great."
"And as you're remediating all this stuff and learning how to be on time and all this stuff that you got to learn how to do, never lose sight of those strengths, those talents, because that is what is going to take you to great places."

"Hello, my name is Tyler Shadick, and I'm the Digital Media Specialist for Concordia University."
"I'm here today to share some tips, words of advice, for instructors that wish to add digital media content, specifically video content, to their online learning course."
"Before we can add content to your course, any form of content that we would add, we first need to know the learning objectives."
"Now, to develop the learning objectives for a video piece, it involves 3 people."
"The first person is you, you are the subject matter expert."
"You know the content, and you know the goals that your media piece is aiming to achieve."
I am the Digital Media Specialist.
"I know the possibilities that our equipment has, and the capabilities that we can run with."
"Three hops to G, one, two, three."
Yep.
There's no faster way to get to G.
"This actually does the right thing in terms of number of hops, but let's take a look at what happen when we went to expand B."
"At this point, even though we have a shortest hop path to B, we don't have a shortest link path to B."
"All we know is that from A, you can reach C in three steps."
"Well, that's really all we know."
"Even this A to D, we don't know, there might be like a half weight path that goes from C to D, but we do know that there's going to be no faster way to get to C right because that is the shortest edge out of A."
Any of the longer edges we're assuming we can't take negative weight edges that would cause this four to get smaller than the three.
All we really know is that this three is the smallest.
"What we should do is not expand B, but we should focus on C."
We now know that there's a path that actually can get us there in 13.
This 10 edge plus the three that it takes to get to C.
We can get to B faster than 15.
We can get to B in 13.
"Now, is that the shortest possible path for B?"
"We don't know cause we know that we could get to D in four and maybe there's a link one,"
I mean ignoring the graph for a second.
"Maybe, there's a link one path that would get us to B, which would be even shorter."
All we know from what we've done so far is that the shortest path from A to D is four.
"Let's lock that down and pull D off of the open list, and let's focus on D."
"D has edges to B, F, and E. Here's B, and here's F and E."
"This path to F through D is going to add another seven for a total of 11, and this path to E through D is going to add another three for a length of seven, and remember there's also a D to B link, which would add nine to this, which would get us there in 13, and we already knew how to get there in 13, so that doesn't really change anything."
"Based on these three, we know the fastest way to A, C, and D, and once that we have also been able to reach, we know that E has the shortest distance, which is seven, and there isn't going to be any faster way to get to E cause there aren't any other nodes that we could get to and then get to E faster than seven."
"We can lock that one down, pull off the open list, add all its edges to the non-completed nodes."
"E can go to F, and it has a link of five."
We could go seven steps to E and then another five to F for a total of 12.
"No, we can already get there in 11."
That's probably not a good idea.
"From E, we can also get to G in one step, which would have been seven plus the additional step for a total of eight, and that's all we can reach from E."
"Looking things over, we now know that the fastest way to get to G is eight steps because the only other way we could get to G would be to visit one of the other nodes, and then go to G, and that would have to be longer than eight."
"We're going to lock it down, and now we pull of the open list and look at the edges out of G."
"Likewise, the things behind you,  those are redshifted, and those look like they move more slowly."
Now that's all 99.9% but it's not faster than the speed of light.
The idea of warp drive is something that physicists have absolutely  thought about.
"In what we call Einstein's  Special Theory of Relativity, it is simply impossible."
That was his 1905 theory about space and time being together.
But then in 1916 Einstein said that space and time can be warped.
So we realized more recently  that you can imagine warping space-time in a little bubble around you  and have that bubble move in such a way that to an outside observer it looks like  you're moving faster than the speed of light.
"However it looks, we're not sure, but it looks like this  is not actually possible in the real world."
To make this happen would require tremendous amounts of energy and some negative amounts of energy.
So you would need an enormous  space-time warping field around you and we don't know how to make the kind of negative energy that it would require.
So the smart money is that there is  no warp drive in the real laws of physics.
"But we don't yet have a proof, we're working on it you should check back  to see where things go."
"The next question is, ""If you did travel  faster than the speed of light,"
"""would you be able to visit the past"
"""or if an object were moving faster than the speed of light,"
"""would it look like it was in the past?"""
And this is a great question because this goes right to the heart of Einstein's way of looking  at space and time versus Newton's way  of looking at space and time.
"Before Einstein came along, Isaac Newton  had laid down the law about space and time."
"They were both fixed,  separate, and absolute."
"And what that means is that if you know  that it's 2 pm right here, right now, you can say it is also 2 pm on Alpha Centauri 4 lightyears away."
"It's also 2 pm in the Andromeda Galaxy, and so forth."
That's Newton's way of looking at the world but then Einstein comes along  and says there's no such thing as what time it is right now in some far away place.
"It's not that there's no such thing, it's more that it depends on who's asking the question."
"So to you, there's something  called 2 pm on Alpha Centauri but to somebody else moving  at some speed relative to you, what counts as 2 pm on Alpha Centauri is completely different."
"And what that means is  if you could travel faster than light, in Einstein's universe — and he says  you can't and he's probably right, you probably can't."
"But if you could, imagine you said,"
"""I was able to move so fast that I got to Alpha Centauri 5 minutes from now."
"""It only takes me 5 minutes to get there."""
"What that means is that, from someone else's point of view, you went from here, now, to Alpha Centauri some time before you left, some time in the past."
"So according to Einstein,  if he has the last word and we're never sure about that,  if he has the last word, then the ability to go faster than the speed of light is the same as the ability  to go backwards in time."
You could go faster  than the speed of light and come back and you could come back before you left.
Now we don't think that there's anything that actually does that in the universe.
Everything has an explanation as  to why it is so.
"""Who is wise?He who learns from every person"""
There is much guidance in Pirkei Avot.
"A student in Be'er Sheva once told me that when he started studying psychology he suddenly discovered that the nicest phrases he ever heard in his life and  didn't know where they originated,they were all from Pirkei Avot."
So a person studies Pirkei Avot then psychology.He then studies the Chulin Tractate which  is all about anatomy.
"He becomes proficient in anatomy, in all the internal organs and systems that are all related to animals and the laws of slaughtering and Kashrut.So he studies the  internal systems of the anatomy."
When he studies the Baba Kama Baba Metzia and Baba Batra tractates
It's as though he has studied law.All the complex monetary laws are there and they sharpen the mind in a wonderful way.
Did you now that the South Korean TV arrived at the Ponovich Yeshiva in Israel in order to discover the secret of the Gemara that makes
Jews so smart and worthy of Nobel prizes.
"These tractates,Baba Metzia,Baba Kama Baba Batra of monetary laws sharpen the mind and logic.A person who  studies tractates of Orla,Kilaim studies the world of vegetation and botany.There's a lot in there about the world of vegetation and so on."
In the laws of Shabbat there are many issues concerning medicine.
"There are matters of the world in every aspect,as it says"
"""Turn it and turn it and you'll find  everything within it"""
"So let us now see a Mishnah  from Pirkei Avot that is connected to our topic,the world of vegetation."
"The Mishna is in Chapter 3,Mishna 17. ""whosever's wisdom is more than his actions,what does he resemble?"
"To a tree who's branches are many and its roots are few. and the wind comes,uproots it and turns it over."
"As it says,""For he shall be like a  tamarisk in the desert and shall not see when good comes but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land  and not inhabited"""
"""But he whose deeds are more than his wisdom resembles a tree whose branches are few but his roots are many and even when all the winds in the world blow on him they can not move him from his place.As it says"
"""And it is like a tree planted on water and that spreads out its roots by the river and shall not see when heat comes but its foliage shall be luxuriant and shall not be anxious in the year  of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit."""
"Here,the Mishnah in Pirkei Avot is teaching us a great lesson with  a great principle for life."
"Oftentimes,a person gives up on  the performance of deeds."
"He says,it doesn't matter what  I do,as long as I'm learning,as"
"long as I'm smart.He sits and learns Torah,becomes wise."
"But practically,he doesn't strengthen himself with actual Mitzvot."
"Let us read the words of the  Tiferet Israel and how he explains this Mishnah,but we will first preface what the Mishnah says in a general way.The Mishnah says that a person whose wisdom is greater than his actions,meaning he knows a lot but barely fulfills."
"What is this like?It's like a tree with many branches,which is the wisdom but his actions,which are the roots are few."
What happens to a tree that's  full of branches but has few roots?
When a strong wind comes what happens?
"It uproots it and turns it upside down.Which means that now,the branches damage him even more!"
Because why did he fall?
"Because he has many branches and few roots.But if it is the opposite where he has few branches but many roots,he is strong and stable."
"So I see this as an attack not so much on Assata herself, although of course she deserves to be brought home."
"She deserves to be able to live out her life, and with justice and peace."
"It was wonderful that you allowed people, through this program, to hear Assata's words, because, 40 years later, people really don't know the details of the case and are not aware of the extent to which she was targeted by the FBI by the COlNTEL Program, as Lennox pointed out."
"And it's amazing that in 2013, where she is living in Cuba as a political refugee, having given— having been given political asylum by Cuba, she is still pursued."
"And actually, this is an invitation for anyone to travel to Cuba illegally and to kidnap her and bring her back to the United States, if not shoot her dead."
"This is—as I said, was an extremely shocking revelation."
JG:
"And, Angela Davis, the government statement that she remains a threat to the United States, the implication being that she's somehow still trying to organize attacks on the country, it really is mind-boggling."
"It's one thing to say, ""We have a case here of someone who's still wanted."""
"It's another thing to say that they're still a threat to the United States, when there's been no indication over the last 30, 40 years that Assata Shakur has been involved in any type of movements or organizations directed against the United States government."
AD:
"Well, see, there's always this slippage between what should be protected free speech—that is to say, the advocacy of revolution, the advocacy of radical change— and what the FBI represents as terrorism."
"You know, certainly, Assata continues to advocate radical transformation of this country, as many of us do."
"You know, I continue to say that we need revolutionary change."
"This is why it seems to me that the attack on her reflects the logic of terrorism, because it precisely is designed to frighten young people, especially today, who would be involved in the kind of radical activism that might lead to change."
"But you're absolutely right, Assata is not a threat."
"If anything, this is a—this is a vendetta."
"She is innocent, and many of us have looked at the evidence."
"And as Lennox pointed out, there's no way that she could have possibly been the person who killed Foerster, because she had her hands up and was shot in the back with her hands in the air and could not have used a gun at that time."
"And so, to represent her as a person who continues to be a threat to the U.S. government in the way that is described is, it seems to me, an effort to strike fear in the hearts of young people who would be active in the struggles that are represented historically by Assata and struggles that continue today."
"Struggles against police violence, for example, continue."
The fact—consider the fact that so many people have been killed by the police in recent years.
And I'm thinking about Kimani Gray in New York.
"I'm thinking about Alan Blueford in Oakland, of course Oscar Grant in Oakland."
I'm thinking about—there's some 63 people who were killed last year in Chicago by the Chicago police.
AG:
"Lennox Hinds, this issue of what this allows the U.S. government to do?"
"To be on the Most Wanted Terrorists list, I mean, does this mean the government could move in, like they moved in on Osama bin Laden, for example?"
Could—
LH:
I think what Angela said was right on point.
"It is an open invitation, not only with respect to the United States government, but for anyone, in Cuba or elsewhere, to become a vigilante, to go there and to not only apprehend and bring her back, or to kill her."
Eat me!
"Calm down, dad will be back soon"
"Ok well it seems like your dad's going to leave us without food again you're wrong Federica -dad, dad. come on did you bring us fish this time, dad? erm, fish? no, well I found a few but they were all wet and full of bones what's more, seen as you kids have always loved coconuts I decided to bring you coconuts coconuts? for 4 years now since the plane crashed the only thiong we've eaten is coconuts don't lie Junior, we've also had coconut milk, coconut skin and the house speciality 'crazy coconut on the beach' hey dad...."
"Ludiquito, you're dad's not as stupid as you think this time I just stabbed myself in the foot with the... good at least your dad can say he's stabbed something on this island arg I hate being here don't start this again, saying you want to leave the island"
"-get used to the good life, -the good life?! give me 3 good things about life on this island that I don't have to wash, I don't have to go to work, and our marriage is better than ever better? what are you on about? how long has it been since we've argued about leaving the toilet seat up yes because now you just pee like a dog under palm trees and it still gets to that you walk around in pee-soaked sandals ok but it's been ages since I've complained about you emitting toxic gases in the night yes because we pretty much sleep outside and the wind blows them away excuses, excuses, I can't make you happy with anything plus, you take for granted that I'm giving you all you ever wanted... to live by the beach ahh yes on the beach, but on a civilised beach idiot, in Puerto Vallarta or Xtapa"
I miss banana boats and paragliding and here there's no bananas and definitely no Paragliding well how's it fault that we landed on this island? don't you remember whose fault it is that we're here?
-Nacho doesn't live here -sorry
-who is it?
"-Capitan, the kids are here to see the cabin come on in here are the kids Capitan"
"Welcome to the cabin my little friends, do any of you have any questions?"
How high up are we?
"We are flying at 36,000 feet kids' feet or adults' feet? -he snook in - any other questions, kids? and this screen with little lights on it, what's it for? it's the main computer which controls all the plane's systems"
"-and it's fizzy-pop proof? -no, it's not fizzy-pop proof who's smart idea was it to ask that? the idiot's who spilt his pop on it it was only a little bit... and it was diet! well anyone could have spilt that you didn't drop a drink, stupid, you dropped a plane with 95 passengers well yes but it doesn't count  because nobody died plus they were all cowards who decided  to run away instead of forming 'Ludovic-Land' with us we should have done the same and gone to the other side of the island to get help but why if they never came back? they were probably eaten by cannibals!"
I don't think there's cannibals on the other side
"Bibi, why wouldn't there be cannibals on the other side, if there's actors on the other side modistos., even politicians. why wouldn't there be cannibals on the other side?"
Why aren't you a normal castaway girl?
"But dad, seriously, you have to get us off of this island, now! -yes -yeah ok ok I promise I'll have a plan before nightfall, a plan to get away from here this is the plan, look."
"ludoviquito, shut up with your drum hurry up dad, tell us the plan!"
"look, the plan is to wait until a Russian submarine goes by, one of the old-fashioned ones when they stick the peroscope out  ludoviquito is going to smash the viewing glass with a stone and then they'll have to get out to repair it, AND WHlLE THEY DO THAT..."
Junior will distract them dressed as a woman and while he gives them a lap dance...
"I'll get in and nick an atomic bomb, which is when you'll enter Federica you'll talk to ... and say 'gentlemen, we have kidnapped your atomic bomb' and then they'll send us a raft/wooden boat to get off the island and you'll drive the submarine in circles until it runs out of petrol and blows up into millions of pieces how's that? wow what a great plan! or we could just wait for the sea to freeze over and we could skate off ahh, how did I not think of that? oii dad, and if the sea freezes can I skate off dressed as a woman? kids, will you give me a minute with your dad?"
(Right) Now!
"Ludovico P.Luche, we can't stay here! what will we eat when the coconuts run out? -have you thought about the kids? -eat the kids? what a brute! think about them, about what's happening, the poor things"
Ludoviquito for example now has...
"-Pelicans! -now he has his first few chin hairs he's a teenager now, and Bibi has grown... coconuts, the coconuts have run out already."
Now what are going to eat?
"I don't know, ask your dad -Dad, what are we going to eat? ask your dad, you're adopted remember"
"Ludovico, Ludovico -yes, I heard."
"It's the... again what do we do? -......... no, don't worry. sleep, I'll keep watch."
"Don't snore though, ok?"
"A plane, dad, a plane!"
"-Well kill it, let me sleep -A plane! we're saved. look!"
"Remember 2 to the power of n minus 1 is the size of the bet on the nth game, so therefor these are our winnings at time n, if we win for the first time on the nth bet."
"If you actually compute this sum, just using the, the formula for summing a geometric series, remember it's a to the 1 minus r to the power of n, all over 1 minus r, that's the general formula."
"In this case, this translates to 1 times 1 minus 2 to the power of n minus 1 divided by 1 minus 2, and that is equal to 2 to the power of n minus 1 minus 1, which is what we have here."
"So W n, if we win for the first time on the nth bet, is equal to minus 2 to the n minus 1 minus 1, plus 2 to the n minus 1, this term cancels with this term and we're left With 1."
"Thereafter of course, we're always left with 1 because we stop playing the game as soon as we win."
"So the other situation that can arise, is that we have not yet won after n bets, in that case, the winnings, Wn is equal to minus 1 plus 2 and so on up to 2 to the n minus 1."
"It's 2 to the n minus 1 because we also lost the nth bet, so in fact this is a minus, this becomes a minus down here, and we get this quantity here, we sum it up and we get a sum of minus 2 to the n plus 1."
"So therefore these are the two possible values of Wn, 1 and minus 2 to the power of n plus 1."
"To show Wn as a martingale, we only need to show the following, that the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn, is equal to"
Wn.
And this follows by an iterated expectations argument.
"And the reason is as follows, suppose we want to calculate the expected value of Wn plus 2 given Wn."
"Well in that case, we can write this as the following, the expected value of the expected value of Wn plus 2, given Wn plus 1, all given Wn."
"Now this term inside here, is equal to Wn plus 1 by this result here."
"So by star, with n equals m plus 1, so by evaluating star but not taking n equals m plus 1 we get that this inner expectation here equals Wn plus 1."
"So therefore, this is equal to the expected value of Wn plus 1, given wn and of course, this is equal to Wn again by star."
"So in fact, for any value of little n, we can show that this result holds, just using this iterated expectations argument we did here."
"So all we need to do to show that Wn is martingale, is to establish star, and that's what we'll do now."
There are two cases to consider.
The first case is where Wn equals 1.
"Recall, we have shown that Wn can only take on two values, the first value is 1."
"So if Wn equals 1, then actually we stop playing the game, because it means we've already won at some point, we've stopped playing the game and therefore, Wn is always equal to 1 in every period after we have first won."
"So in this case, the probability that Wn plus 1 equals 1, given Wn equals 1, is indeed equal to 1."
"Which means, the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn equals 1 well it must be equal to 1 because that's the only value it can take."
"It takes on this value 1 with probability 1, so the, this expected value equals 1, which is equal to Wn."
"The other situation that can occur, is that Wn equals minus 2 to the power of n plus 1."
"If that's the case, then we will bet 2 to the power of n, on the n plus first toss."
"So in that case, Wn plus 1 will be either 1, if we win the n plus first toss, or it will be minus 2 to the power of n plus 1 plus 1, and this follows from our arguments on the previous slides."
"Wn plus 1 will take on this value with probability a half and it'll take on this value with probability half, and that follows because it's a fair coin, we win with probability a half and we lose with probability half."
"So therefore, we have these two expressions here, from which it immediately follows that the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn equals minus 2 to the power of n plus 1, it is equal to 1, with prob-, with probability a half and is equal to minus 2 to the n plus 1, plus 1 of probability a half."
"If we sum these two together, we get minus 2 to the n plus 1, and that of course is equal to Wn."
"So in both possible cases, case 1 and case 2, we have shown that the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn, is equal to Wn."
The State Energy Program was increased to $57 million as part of the OWlP Weatherization and
"Intergovernmental Affairs Office which is part of EERE, and that total office, which included tribal programs, went from $145 million to $248 million."
"And as you see we did get a very modest step in the right direction, an increase in the weatherization budget to $184 million."
"That is an increase over the enacted level for 2013: right now $68 million, which is, of course, unacceptably low."
"And that is a carry-over from the FY ""12 Continuing Resolution, and more about that number in a minute."
But let's come back and look at the $184 million ask for weatherization.
That's an increase over last year's
"White House ask in FY ""13 of $139 million."
Of course that never went anywhere because we wound up on a continuing resolution.
And it's very important to note that we will learn more about this in the next few days and weeks and as the budget justification is released.
The $184 million includes a $24 million set-aside for the multi-housing weatherization.
"So, exactly how this is going to work out is unclear right now, but it is $24 million set-aside to fund alternate financial strategies for low-income multi-family buildings."
This is something that the administration has made a priority.
"This is a financing mechanism, details to be released."
The one detail that we know is that it is going to be a competitive process of determining who gets the financing for doing weatherization in the multi-family buildings.
"So it will be interesting to see exactly how that comes together, and, of course, that is sustained by"
"Congress as part of the FY ""14 budget."
"Just because the administration has asked for it it doesn't mean it will remain in the final package, and interesting that it is a set-aside on an Appropriations Bill, it's not an authorizing measure."
"So, the fate of that on the Hill remains to be seen."
"Now, all important to folks who are involved with weatherization who are on this call is the decision that we expect now within a matter of days on the amount of the reallocation within the balance of Fiscal Year ""13 for weatherization."
"As I believe everyone on the call may be aware of, NASCSP was instrumental in getting 34 Senators to sign on to a request for the Secretary of Energy to use his authority to reallocate funding within the EERE account (Energy Efficiency Renewable Energy), the 2013 Continuing Resolution to bring weatherization up to a more realistic level above the just completely unacceptable level of $68 million which would put the continuation of the program in all 50 states and territories very much in jeopardy."
So we do not know the amount of the reallocation.
"Numbers have been thrown about, speculation somewhere in the range of $50-52 million, and we don't know the source of that funding within EERE but we do know that the Department has been very carefully investigating how they may cobble together this reallocation with 34 Senators making the request."
"There's a similar letter going in the House of Representatives right now for which NASCSP has been able to get, surprisingly, some very good Republicans on board: people"
"like Congressman Dent of Pennsylvania, Congressman McKinley of West Virginia, and Congressman"
Hanna of New York who is critical to have the Republican support.
"So, we are cautiously optimistic."
"There will be a reallocation, that we believe we'll hear in a matter of days, and we believe that whatever the number is it will at least enable weatherization to hopefully remain intact as all states and territories program for the balancing act of FY ""13, and then hopefully we can go above the administration ask of $184 million in the Senate."
"When we get to the 2014 budget we would try to go well above that $184 million level, and, as you recall, last year the Senate did make a modest bump up on the weatherization ask to put it at $145 million in the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Bill."
Obviously we'll try to go well beyond that this year.
"And, as I think, those of you who have been with us on our earlier webinars know Arley Johnson and I have been doing a great deal of retail lobbying in both the House and Senate concentrating on Republicans, rebuilding bipartisan support for the weatherization program."
We were successful in getting an amendment on the non-binding Budget Resolution in March.
"To embrace their self-worth, and their self-esteem, and not to fear being laughed at."
"'Cuz I think for a lot of women, if you're laughed at then, that's like, the worst thing ever,"
"Like, you can just never go outside again, because it's just so embarrassing, and horrible, as opposed to seeing it as like a social status thing,"
In the way that men have to see it.
"We can also change it by supporting our favourite women comedians,"
"Sharing jokes, and humour with our friends, without kind of, fear, and supporting friends when they do make jokes,"
"And just being brave and making up our own content as well, like things with, you know, youtube, we've got a vast media that we never had before,"
"Which gives us a kind of, scope, to express ourselves, to an audience that will listen, because there are women out there who want to see comedy made by women,"
"So on that note, how about you tell me what your favourite joke is?"
Maybe make a video about it?
"I'm going to post loads of links to like, people who I frickin' love, down below,"
"And also some kind of, articles about humour and this whole idea of you know, women not being as funny as men,"
"And I will see you next week,"

continuing in the tradition of our Seyh
Sahib ul Seyf Seyh AbdulKerim Kibrisi Hz ar Rabbani ar Rabbani
Elhamdurillah that we're under him
First let us renew our Sahadat
Eshedu en La ilahe il Allah ve Eshedu enne Muhammad en Resullulah
"if the man begins his day with a Sahadat if the muslim the mumin if the murid begins his day with a sahadat renewing his sahadat renewing his religion renewing his promise to his Lord how can his Lord then let his whole day to be in disaster impossible because the man who says the sahadat he has already won dunya and ahiret he has renewed himself he has become pure he has become that one that if the angel of death would have take him right there he's going to be free from all wrong things from all sins that is a guarantee given to us by Allah SWT by his Prophet SAV tought to us by our Seyh if an unbeliever all his life he commits all wrong things he never remembered his Lord one time he'd never made secde for his Lord one time and someway somehow in his last breath something touched him through the mercy of his Lord maybe he said something that pleases that EvliyaAllah the friend of Allah, that his Lord likes in which in these days so many unbelievers they going to find safety because they like and they love the friends of Allah for no real reason but they're like the way he looks they like the way he speaks they feel good next this man, this is a holly man and we don't know anything about religion about spirituality but this man we feel good with him we don't know what holiness is but this is a holy man that one is going to find safety because Evliyaullah he's not going to"
leave him on his deathbed when he is loving that friend of Allah is putting that friend of Allah in his heart very easy for Evliyaullah to touch him and to bring out from the fire into safety by making his tongue and heart to turn to say as Eshedu en la ilahe il Allah ve eshedu enne Muhammeden Abduhu ve Resuluhu it's very simple for Evliyaullah to do there are so many in these days so-called
Muslims so-called Mumins maybe even so-called Murids belonging two different Seyhs belonging to Sultan ul Evliya but they are looking to that one who's beloved Allah who is beloved to Prophet SAV and they're looking with bad eyes for no real reason too
looking with bad eyes having wrong ideas having wrong suspicions and not sitting down to think to understand to have intelligence to show them the way but to let their ego trick them and not liking that friend of Allah having wrong thoughts t0 that friend of Allah possibility they may find themselves in a lot of trouble in a very dangerous areas before they passed and if they are in dangerous areas before they pass than in the grave and the judgment day
Allah u Alem there are those too because Allah SWT he is not saying for nothing in the Quran-i Kerim he is not saying for nothing in the Hadis-i Kutsi in Hadis and in the sayings of Saints of Allah they're teaching us yes if you are enemies to my friends i will declare war on you if you are enemies to my friends
Allah SWT is saying i will declare war on you
For us whether we believe or we don't believe it does not change that reality for us saying that we are declaring war on Allah is very different from Allah SWT declaring if you touch that one that I love

"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality cooking television show that airs on Food Network. It began on August 11, 2013. It is hosted by Alton Brown."
Format.
"Four chefs are given three cooking challenges. Each challenge has a type of dish that the chefs have to make in 30 minutes. Before then, the chefs have one minute to get ingredients out of a pantry. After 30 minutes, a judge tastes each dish, and the chef with the worst dish is eliminated."
"At the start of the game, the chefs are each given $25,000. In the first two challenges, Brown shows items that are put up to auction for the chefs to buy using their money. The chefs can use these items on other chefs to change their ingredients, what cooking tools they can use, and other things. For example, an item may force a chef to cook using canned ingredients instead of fresh ones. The chef who is eliminated has to give back the money that they have. In the last challenge, no items are shown at first, but during the first minutes of the challenge, Brown will put items up for auction. This makes it so the person who gets the item has to change their dish based on what the item does. The chef that wins keeps the money that they have left."

"As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her."
"Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba."
"Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky."
"Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods."
"Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or ""on her food"" in another version). The golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease."
"Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi."

Chicken
"Chicken (""Gallus gallus domesticus"") is a term which refers to a species of poultry. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around)."
"A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). Roosters do not have penises. A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks."
"When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this."
Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.
Eggs.
Chickens are well known for their eggs. Many people eat them for their breakfast. The eggs can be prepared in many different ways.
Meat.
"Because of their low cost, chicken meat (also called ""chicken"") is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year. Some popular dishes with chicken are: Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, chicken soup, fried chicken (see picture), roasted chicken and tandoori chicken."

"There are different cuts of chicken. Chicken meat can also be bought whole. The leanest part is known as the breast. Sliced pieces of the breast are known as the tender(loin). There are also wings, thighs, and legs (also known as drumsticks)."
Chicken and chickenpox.
"Chickenpox has nothing to do with chickens. When chickenpox was first described, people thought that the pox spots looked like chickpeas placed upon the skin. The Latin word for chickpeas is ""grana"". That is the original word that chickenpox got its name from."
Gaming.
In some parts of the world people breed chickens to fight. They bet money on which of two birds will win. In many places this is illegal.

Hohmann transfer orbit
"In orbital mechanics, a Hohmann transfer orbit moves a spacecraft between orbiting heights. It is the most fuel-efficient method to do so, because the spacecraft is not trying to escape the planet's gravity, using an elliptical orbit for the transfer."
"A ship using this would have to apply two velocities, one to enter the elliptical orbit, and one to enter the second orbit."
Calculation.
"Assuming the mass of the spacecraft is much lower than that of the orbiting planet, the two velocities, formula_1 and formula_2, can be solved for as:formula_3formula_4where"

"The Mongol empire conquered Goryeo and forced Korea to pay a tribute in Korean girls and eunuchs to the Mongol court with about 500,000 Korean girls and eunuchs taken to Yuan China. Mongol and Central Asian Semu Hui Tammachi army officials in Korea itself also took Korean women as concubines and Korea officials complained about it, begging the Mongol court to withdraw them from Korea. Koreans wrote erotic songs about how Korean women were seduced by Central Asian Muslims in their bakeries."
"An amusing incident is reported as having occurred about this time. A courtier named Pa-gyu observed to the king, “The male population of the country has been decimated but there are still plenty of women. For this reason it is that the Mongols take so many of them. There is danger that the pure Koryŭ stock will become vitiated by the intermixture of wild blood. The king should let each man take several wives and should remove the restrictions under which the sons of concubines labor."" When the news of this came to the ears of the women they were up in arms, as least the married portion ; and each one read to her spouse such a lecture that the subject was soon dropped as being too warm to handle. When the king passed through the streets with Pa-gyu in his retinue the women would point to the latter and say “There goes the man who would make concubines of us all."""

Scram
"A scram or SCRAM is a quick shutdown of a nuclear reactor. It is done in an emergency (a dangerous situation). A scram is performed by quickly inserting all of the control rods, or, if this fails, injecting boric acid into the reactor. A reactor that has been shut down still requires cooling due to decay heat. If the cooling system fails, the core can still melt down even if the reactor has been shut down. This has happened during several nuclear accidents, including Three Mile Island and Fukushima. The RBMK reactors used in the Soviet Union had graphite-tipped control rods, a design flaw which caused the reactivity to increase for a moment when the reactor was scrammed. This design flaw contributed to the Chernobyl disaster."

Khrushchev's Secret Speech
Krushchev's Secret Speech was the speech in which Nikita Krushchev denounced Joseph Stalin after the latter's death. The speech was a spoken report to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 25 February 1956. Its title was On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.
"The report was known as the ""Secret Speech"" because it was delivered at a closed session of Communist Party delegates, with guests and members of the press excluded. Although the text of the Khrushchev report leaked almost immediately, the official Russian text was published only in 1989 during the glasnost campaign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev."
"The speech was based on an investigation of the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 XVII Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They were victims of the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. Estimates of Stalin's role in history were quite changed by the speech. Many in the West who had been Communist Party member, or at least sympathetic fellow-travellers, resigned their memberships and no longer defended the reputation of Stalin. Russian writers like Solzhenitsyn found they were treated with more sympathy. The speech was a significant turning-point in history."
"The speech caused such shock to the audience that, according to some reports, some of those present suffered heart attacks, and others later committed suicide. Many Soviet citizens were confused by De-Stalinization. They had been fed on praise of the ""genius"" of Stalin. This was especially obvious in the Georgian SSR, Stalin's homeland, where rioting ended with the Soviet Red Army crackdown on 9 March 1956."

"A featherfoot is so named because they are believed to have supernatural powers, including the ability to fly and move inter-dimensionaly when threatened as means of escape. He wears special shoes made of feathers (usually emu) and hair, stuck together with human blood. Scholars say that the shoes leave no tracks (footprints)."
"South-West of Western Australia, which includes the Noongar people, have a local scary story to tell at night. When the featherfoot is hunting you, it waits till you’re alone or in a small group, at night walking to a destination. The person or the group will start to get a sense of foreboding, followed by a strong sense they are being followed. The featherfoot is close behind, following. Its steps are silent and leave not tracks. The only way to survive a feathfoot attack is to never look behind you until you get back to a light source. Keep walking and don’t look back, it’s when the person looks behind them, is when it attacks. Often the reason the spirit will follow and attack someone is because they have committed a crime, or something as heinous or evil."
"All that is left behind after an attack, is a single large unknown bird feather and a small amount of the victims blood."

The miners came from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Italy, Hungary, France, Germany, China and Australia. The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax, and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament. Irish miner Peter Lalor became the leader of the miners. They built a fort, or stockade, on Bakery Hill above the gold diggings on the Eureka gold lead. They were attacked by the British Army. More than 30 people were killed. The battle went for 20 minutes."
Flag.
"The miners made their own flag which was flown at the Eureka Stockade. The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers. It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890s. Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat. It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece. In the 1973 the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery. The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. The flag has been put on the Victorian Heritage Register and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006. In August 2010, the Ballarat Art Gallery said that the flag needed further work to keep it safe. It was sent to South Australia to be restored at a cost of more than AU$100,000. The Gallery has built a new airtight case to hold the flag."
The symbol.
"The flag has often been used as a symbol of rebelion. Trade unions used the flag in their marches. The Prime Minister, John Howard, banned the flag from being flown on building sites."
"In 2008, the Football Federation of Australia tried to stop the flag from being flown by supporters of the soccer team, Melbourne Victory. They said it was against their rules for teams to use political symbols. People with the flag would be made to leave the football ground"
"In 2018, the Eureka flag again divided people in some workplaces. The published examples of slogans and logos that were against the Federal Government's building codes. These images were not allowed to be displayed by workers on projects run by the government. The list of banned images included the Eureka flag."
"Many nationalist groups have started to use the flag as a symbol. It was used during the racial riots at Cronulla, New South Wales. People are concerned that it will become a symbol of leaving people out, and not a symbol of Australian democracy."
Eddie Vedder
"Eddie Vedder (born Edward Louis Severson III; December 23, 1964) is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is best known for being the lead singer and one of three guitarists of the alternative rock band Pearl Jam. He is commonly seen as an icon of alternative rock."

"In the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. However, for the third place match, no extra time was played and the winner was determined by kicks from the penalty mark."
"In the round of 16, the four third-placed teams were matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D. The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:"
Final.
"This was the first ever final for both England and Venezuela in the history of the tournament, in their 11th and 2nd appearances respectively. England's previous best result was in 1993 when they finished third, while Venezuela were eliminated in the round of 16 in 2009. This was England's first appearance and victory in the final of a global football tournament since their senior side's 1966 FIFA World Cup victory, ending 51 years of waiting for a global tournament trophy."

Pureiromba
Pureiromba () or Puleilompa () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the giver of rain and good luck in farming. He is one of the major Umang Lai deities. He is the Ancestor God of the Angom clan of the Meitei ethnicity.
History.
"According to the Thalon text, Pureiromba () was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill (Nongmaiching Hill). Before the Meitei King Ura Konthouba (c. 7th century CE) killed all the Selloi Langmai people, the cults of these five gods were put together into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the other names or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people became one chiefdom. This chiefdom later became the Angom clan."
Description.
"The people who worship Pureiromba () think of him as their ancestor. However, no one knows if he was a real person from history or a god that acted like a human. But the ancient texts that show his adventures in the human world show him as a strong, powerful and able founding ancestor. He was initially associated with a Loi village of Andro, Manipur. But in later times, the people of Moirang worshipped him as one of their deified ancestors."
Festival.
"Aqua is a Danish-Norwegian group who sing dance-pop music. The group were first signed in 1994. They have made two studio albums, two compilation albums, two remix albums and sixteen singles. The group split up in 2001 and reformed in 2007."

"The Saturn Vue was a car. It was a compact crossover SUV. General Motors' made it. The Vue was part of the Saturn brand. The Saturn Corporation made it from 2002 to 2005. The Vue was the first GM vehicle to use the Theta platform. Theta has become global since it replaced the GM SUV frames, especially the Chevrolet Blazer frame."
"In 2006 GM introduced the second generation of the Vue, built by Opel. It was a rebadged Opel Antara with changes for the American market. This generation of the Vue was sold from 2007-2009 until Saturn stopped selling cars in 2010. The Vue is still being made by the General Motors company. General Motors reintroduced the Vue to fleets and companies as the Chevrolet Captiva Sport. In September 2014 GM announced that it would stop making the Captiva Sport and start selling its new subcompact CUV the Trax instead. Until 2012 the Vue was the only Saturn model that was re-introduced later followed by the Outlook's body style being used on the Acadia."
Blister
"A blister is a small pocket of fluid in an upper layer of the skin caused by friction, burning or freezing. Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid called serum or plasma (blister water). Some blisters, however, are filled with blood; they are called blood blisters."
Saturn Outlook
The Saturn Outlook was a full-size crossover SUV that was built by General Motors' Saturn brand. The Outlook was made by the Saturn Corporation from 2006 to 2010 until Saturn went defunct in 2010. The Saturn Outlook replaced the Relay minivan which was discontinued due to its unsuccessful sales. The vehicle received a 5 out of 5 stars for both frontal and side by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and was also named Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Top Safety Pick in both 2008 and 2009. Although the Saturn brand is no longer active GM has decided to use the bodyshell of the Outlook on the redesigned GMC Acadia.
Saturn Relay
The Saturn Relay was a minivan that was built by General Motor's Saturn brand. The Relay was made by the Saturn Corporation from 2005 to 2007. The Relay was the first and only minivan made by the Saturn company. The Relay is also the only Saturn vehicle that was a badge engineered vehicle. Due to poor sales the Relay was replaced by the Saturn Outlook in 2006.

Highwayman
A highwayman was a type of robber who attacked people who were travelling. They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I to the 1800s. Highwaymen rode on horses. They were thought to be socially superior to footpads (who robbed on foot).
"Some highwaymen robbed alone but others worked in gangs. They often targeted coaches because they did not have much defence, They stole money, jewellery and other valuable items. The penalty for robbery with violence was execution by hanging. The 17th century highwayman James Hind was hanged, drawn and quartered. As a supporter of King Charles, the Protectorate charged him with treason."
"One of the most famous highwaymen was Dick Turpin, who was hanged for his crimes in 1739. The Australian bushranger Ben Hall was said to be one too."
The worst place for highwayman were Shooter’s Hill and Finchely Common.
Sounds.
"The Waray language has sixteen consonants: . There are three main vowels: ""a"" , ""i"" , and ""u"" . Consonants and were once allophone but cannot interchange, like ""palaron"" (to be lucky) [from ""palad"", palm (because someone's luck is seen in the palm)] but not ""paladon"" and ""tagadiín"" (from where) [from ""diín"", where] but not ""tagariín""."
Numbers.
"Native numbers are used for numbers one through ten. From eleven onwards, Spanish numbers are exclusively used in Waray today, their native counterparts being almost unheard of by the majority of native speakers numbers (except for gatus for ""hundred"" and yukot for ""thousand""). Some, specially the old ones, are spoken alongside the Spanish counterparts."
Some common words and phrases.
Below are examples of the Waray spoken in Metropolitan Tacloban and the nearby areas:
J.E.B. Stuart
"James Ewell Brown Stuart (1833-1864) was a general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. He was from Virginia. During the war, he was known for dangerous things he did while riding a horse. He was killed at the Battle of Yellow Tavern in 1864."
Riodinidae
"Riodinidae is a family of butterflies. They are commonly known as riodinids or metalmarks. Metalmarks get their name from the bright, metallic (looking like metal) markings found on the wings of most species. The family has nearly 2,000 species in it. The metalmarks are mostly found in the Neotropical region. Most metalmarks are small. Their wingspan ranges from 20mm to 65mm. Metalmarks vary greatly in wing shape, pattern, and color."
Riodinidae was formerly known as the family Nemeobiidae and as the family Erycinidae. It was also once thought to be a subfamily of Lycaenidae.
Taxicab number
"A taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a sequence of special numbers: 2, 1729 etc. A taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in ""n"" distinct ways. It has nothing to do with taxis, but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians: Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan."
The story about Godfrey Hardy’s taxi.
"Godfrey Hardy was a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. One day he went to visit a friend, the brilliant young Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was ill. Both men were mathematicians and liked to think about numbers."
When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was. Hardy said that it was just a boring number: 1729. Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all: it was a very interesting one. He explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
This story is very famous among mathematicians. 1729 is sometimes called the “Hardy-Ramanujan number”.
Explanation of the Hardy-Ramanujan's number.
There are two ways to say that 1729 is the sum of two cubes.
1x1x1=1; 12x12x12=1728. So 1+1728=1729
But also: 9x9x9=729; 10x10x10=1000. So 729+1000=1729
"There are other numbers that can be shown to be the sum of two cubes in more than one way, but 1729 is the smallest of them."
Known taxicab numbers.
"Since the famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan, mathematicians have tried to find other interesting numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed by the sum of two cubes in three/four/five etc. different ways. These numbers are very, very big, and have been found by computers."
"So far, the following six taxicab numbers are known :"
Bernard Frénicle de Bessy
"Bernard Frénicle de Bessy (about 1605–1675), was a French mathematician. He was born in Paris. He wrote many papers about mathematics, number theory and combinatorics. The Frénicle standard form, a standard representation of magic squares, is named after him. He solved many problems created by Fermat. He also discovered a taxicab number and in 1693, he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4."
"Like Fermat, Frénicle was an amateur mathematician, but he wrote letters to famous people such as Descartes, Christiaan Huygens, Mersenne and also Fermat, who was his friend. He is mainly remembered for his discoveries about number theory."
"Cain went to a campaign rally of President Donald Trump in Tulsa on June 20 without wearing a mask or socially distancing. He was hospitalized in Atlanta, Georgia and was diagnosed with COVID-19. He died from the infection on July 30, 2020 at the age of 74."
Madame de Lafayette
"Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, countess of La Fayette (or Lafayette) was a French writer. She is commonly known as Madame de Lafayette. She was born on 18 March 1634 in Paris, and died there, on 26 May 1693. In 1678, she published the novel ""La Princesse de Clèves"" (the Princess of Clèves). This book is regarded as one of the first psychological novels."
Adrienne de La Fayette
"""Marie Adrienne"" Françoise de Noailles, madame de La Fayette (2 November 1759 – 24 December 1807). She was born in Paris at the family home, the Hôtel de Noailles. Known as ""Mademoiselle d'Ayen-""she was the second daughter of the duc d'Ayen, a powerful French noble-prior to her marriage to Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette, in the chapel of the Hôtel de Noailles on April 11, 1774. The couple lived there for the first few years of their marriage. They had four children."
Lake Torrens National Park
"Lake Torrens National Park is a national park in South Australia, 345 km north of Adelaide. The park protects the area around Lake Torrens, which is a large, dry, salt lake covering an area of 5,700 square kilometres. The lake is part of a large rift valley that also includes Spencer Gulf. Lake Torrens has been filled with water twice in the last 150 years."
"The lake filled in 2010 and attracted a large number of birds, including 150,000 Banded Stilts. This bird can only breed on islands in flooded salt lakes and have only bred in South Australia seven times in the last 70 years. The last known breeding was at Lake Eyre in 2000. During dry times the stilts live at the Coorong Lakes waiting for the salt lakes to flood."
History.
The first European to find Lake Torrens was Edward John Eyre in 1839. For many years it was believed that Lake Torrens was a large horseshoe-shaped salt lake in the northern Flinders Ranges. This salt lake blocked any path to the interior. The first European to get through this barrier was A. C. Gregory from the north in March 1858.
"Later in 1858, an expedition under Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Major Warburton in the north-west also crossed the non-existent barrier near modern Marree. Eyre's horseshoe lake was actually made up of six large salt lakes; Lake Frome, Lake Callabonna, Lake Blanche, Lake Gregory, Lake Eyre South, and Lake Torrens itself."
Hominin
"Hominini is the tribe of african apes that comprises humans (""Homo""), and all ancestors of ""Homo sapiens"" back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with ""Sahelanthropus"" as a key fossil."
"A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus ""Pan"" (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the ""human"" branch, including genus ""Homo"" and its close relatives, but not ""Pan"". All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species."
Genera.
Subtribe Panina
Subtribe Hominina
Hominina
"Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus ""Homo""."
"If an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe Hominini, then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put Australopithecines and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is:"
"If used, the group includes ""Sahelanthropus"" six to eight million years ago."
Taxonomy.
"Even today, the genus ""Homo"" has not been properly defined."
"Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define ""Homo"" when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthals brought the first addition."
"The genus ""Homo"" was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human."
"Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times."
"Classifying a fossil as ""Homo"" means evidence of:"
Root (disambiguation)
Root may refer to:
Root of a function
"In mathematics, a root of a function ""f"" is a number x that turns the value of ""f"" to 0:"
"Because polynomials are also functions, roots are real things."
"The fundamental theorem of algebra says every polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one (complex) root. Using the fundamental theorem of algebra and the polynomial remainder theorem together shows that every complex polynomial of degree ""n"" has exactly ""n"" complex roots, and some of them may be equal."
De Moivre's formula
"In mathematics, de Moivre's formula or de Moivre's theorem is an equation named after Abraham de Moivre. It states that for any real number ""x"" and integer ""n"","
formula_1
The formulation of De Moivre's formula for any complex numbers formula_2 (with modulus formula_3 and angle formula_4) is as follows:
formula_5
"Here, formula_6 is Euler's number, and formula_7 is often called the polar form of the complex number formula_2."
"The formula is very important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry. It can be proved using the trigonometry form of complex numbers by mathematical induction, with the help of some trigonometrical identities. It can also be proved using Euler's formula as well."
"By using this formula, any equation of the form formula_9, where ""w"" is complex, can be solved."

"Port Lincoln, South Australia"
Port Lincoln is a city in South Australia. It is a coastal city on Boston Bay at the southern end of the Eyre Peninsula. It is the largest city in the region. It is about 280 kilometres (straight line – 646 km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.
History.
"The first people to live in the area were the Barngarla (Parnkalla) people, who are Indigenous Australian people. The name they used to call this area was Galinyala."
European people settled in the area in 1836.
"British Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it ""Port"" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from."
Fresh water.
"Port Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water."
Demographics.
"About 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006. Aboriginal people made up 5.4% of Port Lincoln's 2006 population."
Geography.
"Port Lincoln has different coastal areas, from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline."
Government.
Port Lincoln and its suburbs comprise the City of Port Lincoln local government area. Port Lincoln is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.
Economy.
"The economy is based on loading wheat onto ships. The port can handle over 337,500 tonnes) of wheat. There is also the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. The port is home to a large commercial fishing fleet. There is also fish farming (aquaculture) of the following species: tuna, kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the introduction of fish farming, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna."
"Port Lincoln is the end of an isolated narrow gauge railway system to bring the wheat to port. Iron ore traffic may be added in the future, although this has been the topic of protest and debate in the community."
Tourism.
"Tourism is becoming more important, thanks to the scenic beauty and coastal locality. Easy access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight make Port Lincoln a good place for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. The city also is the regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula. However, many State Government functions are gradually being closed as State Government becomes more centralised in Adelaide. During the past decade, there has been a big increase in building houses and commercial buildings."
"Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within easy driving distance."
Transport.
Port Lincoln is the port for the isolated narrow gauge () Eyre Peninsular Railway.
There is also a smaller port at Proper Bay which may be restored to use for iron ore traffic. The export of iron ore through Port Lincoln has been approved by the South Australian Government. (c. Oct 2009)
Port Lincoln Airport is located a few kilometers north of the city. Regional Express and Qantaslink provide several daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide.
Culture.
"The book ""Blue Fin"" by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln. The movie of the same name was filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of the shark scenes of ""Jaws"" and Anzac Cove scenes in ""Gallipoli"", were also filmed near Port Lincoln."
"""Australian Survivor"", the Australian-produced series of the US television series, ""Survivor"", was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001."
"""Hearts Apart"" by Caitlin Jones was written on a farm in Port Lincoln."
"Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the four-masted barque ""Moshulu"", which anchored off Boston Island. ""Moshulu"" had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer). But there was no grain to be had there, even though ""Moshulu"" waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. ""Moshulu"" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo."
"During the 1939 season, ""Passat"" and ""Lawhill"" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book ""The Last Grain Race"" (1956). Several pictures of Port Lincoln in 1939 are in his photo-essay of his voyage, ""Learning the Ropes""."
Media.
"Nat’s daughter, Natalie followed her father as a singer. She recorded many songs after her father died. In 1991, Natalie Cole recorded an album called ""Unforgettable"". It contains 22 of Nat King Cole’s songs, including the song “Unforgettable.” Modern technology made it possible to mix her voice with a recording of her father singing the same song."
Voice of America

Along with English, VOA broadcasts in many other languages. VOA's broadcasts are made to share a positive view of the United States with the world. Americans in the United States are not part of VOA's intended audience, but many Americans do listen to the program."
History.
"VOA was organized in 1942 under the Office of War Information with news programs aimed at Europe and North Africa occupied by Germany. VOA began broadcasting on February 24, 1942, but VOA noted in its site that it began broadcasting on February 1, 1942. Transmitters used by VOA came from shortwave transmitters used by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Voice of America began to transmit radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union on February 17, 1947."
"During the Cold War, VOA's budget was reduced. On August 1, 1953, VOA was separated from the Department of State and it was included under the Information Agency. VOA moved its headquarters from New York to Washington, DC. next year. In 1959 VOA started ""Special English"" programs. In the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Marti and TV Marti."
"One of VOA's famous programs was remembered as ""Jazz Hour"" presented by Willis Conover. This program continued for 40 years, and its record remains at the National Museum of American History, also known as """"Smithsonian""."

George Gershwin
"George Gershwin (September 26, 1898; Brooklyn, New York – July 11, 1937; Hollywood, California) was an American composer and a pianist."
Story of his life.
Childhood.
"George Gershwin was born on September 26, 1898, in Brooklyn, New York."
"His family immigrated to the United States. Gershwin, his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city, but he did not like school or studying."
"While exploring the city, Gershwin heard jazz and blues music spilling out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. Gershwin began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized Gershwin's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: ""I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt."""
Younger days as a student.
"Gershwin studied classical piano, and he was a first-rate pianist,but his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. He loved playing piano and it was his passion. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business. The New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called ""Tin Pan Alley."""
"The phonograph and radio had been invented in the late 1800s. But it would be many years before there were musical recordings or regular radio broadcasts. Tin Pan Alley publishers needed another way to sell new songs, so they employed people to play the piano to do this."
"The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only 18 years old. It had a long title: ""When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get ‘Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em. """
Success as a songwriter.
"Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. ""There is plenty more where that came from,"" he said."
"Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called ""Swanee."" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. ""Swanee"" was made into one of the first musical recordings. Gershwin was suddenly famous. He also was in the Grammy Hall of Fame."
"Music critics note that ""Swanee"" is not like most of Gershwin's music. Later, he wrote true love songs. Some were light and funny. Some were full of intense feeling. Many of these songs were written for the popular musical theater. One of his most emotional love songs never became part of a musical play, however. It is called ""The Man I love."" The song was sung by the Francine Evans role [played by Liza Minnelli in Martin Scorsese's film, New York, New York] and supposedly 'written' by her character for her soon to be husband, Jimmy Doyle [superbly played by Robert De Niro], of the Jimmy Doyle Orchestra. His character also 'wrote' the title song, New York, New York, who was actually written by Fred Ebb, music by Kanter, his partner. The song became New York's official anthem in 1985."
His brother Ira.
"Gershwin's older brother, Ira, wrote the words to ""The Man I Love"". As George became famous, Ira wrote the words to more and more of his songs."
"The two brothers were very different. Ira, the writer, was quiet and serious. George, the musician, was outgoing—the life of any party. When they had to finish a new musical Ira locked George in a hotel room until it was done. But George wrote better songs with Ira than with anyone else."
Music of Gershwin.
As a songwriter.
"One of many examples of the Gershwin's combined work is the song ""They Can't Take That Away From Me."" The Gershwins wrote the song for dancer and actor Fred Astaire for the film ""Shall We Dance."" That was George and Ira Gershwin's first movie musical."

In thanks, the fairy causes diamonds and roses to drop from the girl's mouth whenever she speaks. At home, her mother is amazed. She sends her elder daughter to the spring. The girl meets a grandly-dressed lady (the fairy) who asks for a drink of water. The girl responds rudely. The fairy causes snakes and toads to drop from her mouth. At home, her mother is furious. She blames the younger sister. The girl runs into the woods. She meets a prince who falls in love and marries her. The elder sister dies after running away from home.

Until the 24th king's period, it had had its golden age, expanding the range of the nation and driving away all the attacks from ouside. The most famous king was King Gwanggaeto the Great ()."
"However, when it was under the control of 27th king, Youngryou (), Goguryeo was becoming a vassal of the Tang Dynasty. Because of this, the king was killed by Yoen Gaesomoon () and a new king, Bojang () succeeded.

Cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in major cities of Turkey are overwhelmingly liberal and secular. Cities like Hatay and Mardin, where different religions coexist, and Eskişehir, which is the prominent college town of the country, also have cosmopolitan characteristics."
"Collectivism is dominant in society rather than individualism. This is seen in everything from a civilian's worldview to the socio-political and socio-economic order of the country. People care a lot about what others think of them or their related ones. Sociologist Şerif Mardin, who argues that there is neighborhood watch in Turkish society, states that ""There is no tolerance for deviations from norms in the Turkish tradition, a watching oppression is applied against individuals in this situation and this is not new."""

Père Goriot
"Le Père Goriot (, ""Old Goriot"" or ""Father Goriot"") is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850). It is in the ""Scènes de la vie privée"" section of his novel sequence ""La Comédie humaine"". It is set in Paris in 1819. It follows the lives of three characters: the elderly Goriot, a mysterious criminal named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac."
The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration. It brought major changes to French society. The struggle by individuals to reach a higher social status is a major theme in the book. Balzac analyzes through Goriot and others the nature of family and marriage that provides a pessimistic view of them.
Publication.
"In the first book edition, the novel had seven chapters:"
"The character Eugène de Rastignac had appeared as an old man in Balzac's earlier philosophical fantasy novel ""La Peau de chagrin"". While writing the first version of ""Le Père Goriot"", Balzac named the character ""Massiac"", but he decided to use the same character from ""La Peau de chagrin"". Other characters were changed in a similar way."
Legacy.
"""Le Père Goriot"" is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau's remark: ""We are all children of ""Le Père Goriot""."""
"In his book ""Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World"", Martin Kanes calls it ""the keystone of the ""Comédie humaine"". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's study ""Balzac's Recurring Characters"". Entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer."
"Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, ""Goriot"" is one of the novels of ""La Comédie humaine"" that can safely be read in English for what it is."""
"According to the editor of the Norton Critical Edition, Peter Brooks, the book is now seen as ""the most endurable and popular of Balzac's myriad works"" and a ""classic of the [18th]-century European novel""."
"A well-known line of this book by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, ""In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline."""
"This has been reworked by Mario Puzo in the novel ""The Godfather"" (1969) and its movie adaptation (1972) as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""."
It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.

He does not think of himself to be ""English in anyway"". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a ""foreign guy that lives in Camden"". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called ""Dappy hats"". He normally turns up one side of the hat."
Early life and current status.
"Dappy was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of 1970s band Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was ""rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights"". Dappy showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard ""Fazer"" Rawson and Tula ""Tulisa"" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the ""Lickle Rinsers Crew"". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the ""inspiration behind the band"". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote ""Papa (Can You Hear Me?)"" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy later had the words ""RIP Dad"" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as ""B"" or ""Uncle B""."
He is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK).
Personal life.
"N-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it ""was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear."""
Criticism.
"In 2007 Dappy released ""Love For My Slum"" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a ""rich kid"" who is trying to look like a gangster. ""The Independent"" wrote ""His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement..."", they then went on to put ""Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?"". Other newspapers put that he was ""idolising thuggery"". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said ""these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got""."
"In December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 to the girl and her friend, and £300 costs."
"Critics of Putin say that he has taken away people's freedoms, and that he has failed to make the country more developed. Russia makes lots of money from selling oil and gas to other countries, but because of corruption, this money is not used for improving living conditions."
"Recently, the Russian opposition has held anti-government rallies, campaigned against Putin on the Internet, and published independent reports for the general public. Because of censorship in the mass media, it's very difficult to get different information out to the public."
Putin was against invading Libya in 2011. He is also against invading Syria and Iran.
"On March 24, 2014, Putin and Russia were suspended from the G8. This was because the United States thought that the Ukraine crisis was Putin's fault."
"According to the Constitution of Russia, no-one can be president three times in a row. Because of this, Putin didn't put himself forward for the March 2008 election. However, you're allowed to be president as many times as you want, as long as it's not for more than two times in a row. In March 2012, Putin put himself forward for the elections, and won 64% of the vote. This means that he was the president of Russia until 2018."
"On December 6, 2017 Russia President Vladimir Putin announced he would run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, 2018 Russian Presidential Election."
"In July 2020, Russian voters backed a referendum that would allow Putin to serve as president until 2036."
"On 24 February 2022, Putin announced that his military was going to invade Ukraine. This happened after a year of tension and military buildup between the two countries. The invasion led to many calling Putin a war criminal and wanting him to be prosecuted as a war criminal."
Personal life.
"He is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is divorced with two daughters."
Henry VII of England
Henry VII or Henry Tudor (28 January 1457–21 April 1509) was King of England from 1485 to 1509. He founded the Tudor dynasty by winning the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. His son became king Henry VIII of England.
Biography.
"Henry VII was born in 1457 to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort. His father died two months before he was born, leaving his 13-year-old mother as his only parent. After Henry's birth, he spent a lot of time with his uncle Jasper Tudor. Jasper took Henry to France, where he spent most of his youth. Henry had a claim to the throne of England, but it was not a very good one, and he had to wait a long time for a chance to take the throne."
"In 1483, a new king came to the throne in England, called Richard III. King Richard was not popular with everyone. Some thought he had stolen the throne from his young nephews and had killed them. This gave Henry the chance he had been waiting for. With help from the French, he raised an army. They landed at Dale in Pembrokeshire, close to where Henry had been born, so he was able to gather more supporters on the way."
"The Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) had been going on for years. They were fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house, tracing their descent from King Edward III."
King Henry VI and his family the House of Lancaster fought against their enemies for many years. The wars finally came to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1485
"On 22 August 1485, Henry's army defeated Richard III's army at the Battle of Bosworth Field. When Richard III died in this battle, Henry VII became king. Other people also had a claim on the throne, and Henry did his best to stop them from taking it from him, either by executing them, putting them in prison, or trying to make friends of them, as he did with the Earl of Lincoln. Another step he took was to marry Elizabeth of York, the niece of King Richard III, who would herself have been the heir to the throne if she had not been a girl."
"There were also people who pretended to be long-lost members of the royal family, so that they could try to take the throne. One of these was a little boy called Lambert Simnel, who looked very like Edward, Earl of Warwick. The real Earl of Warwick was Henry's prisoner, but this did not stop other people from believing that Lambert was him. The Earl of Lincoln rebelled against King Henry and raised an army to make Lambert king, thinking that he himself could rule the country. There was a battle, and the Earl of Lincoln was killed. Lambert Simnel was captured, but, because he was only a child, Henry spared his life and he became a royal servant."
"Henry married Elizabeth of York, and by this action put an end to the Wars of the Roses. They had six children, but only four survived infancy:"
Henry VII increased taxes so future kings would have enough money. People disliked that.
Death.
"Henry VII died of tuberculosis in 1509 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his son, Henry VIII on 21 April 1509."

Dover History.
"The Romans first tried to invade Dover in 55BC, under Julius Caesar. They were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended the coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Romans' most important naval town."

Penda had placed Oswine of Deira on the throne of Deira. But Oswine did not get along with his overlord Oswiu. He raised an army against Oswiu but then realized his army wasn't large enough and he sent them home. He was betrayed by one of his nobleman to Oswiu and was murdered in 651.
King of Deira.
"After Oswine's death, Athelwald became king. It is uncertain whether Oswiu (who was Athelwald's uncle) installed him as king or whether Athelwald took the kingship in opposition to Oswiu. At some point he allied himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda of Mercia. He guided Penda during his invasion of Northumbria in 655. But, when the armies of Oswiu and Penda met on 15 November at the Battle of the Winwaed, Athelwald withdrew to safety. Penda was defeated and killed. perhaps in part because of this desertion, and afterward Athelwald was not heard of again."
King Athelwald gave St. Cedd the lands of Lastingham to build a monastery.
Department
Department can mean several things:
Polar vortex
"The polar vortex (alternate names: Arctic cyclone or polar vortice) is a persistent large-scale cyclone located near geographical poles of a planet. On Earth, a polar vortex is usually in the middle and upper troposphere and stratosphere. The cyclone surrounds the polar highs. Polar storms lie in the wake of the polar front. They strengthen in the winter and weaken near summer. These vortexes span usually between 620 to 1,240 miles. They circulate counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere."
"Similar to hurricanes, a Coriolis effect causes the rotation of a polar vortex. The Arctic vortex has two main centers: one is over the Baffin Island, the other is over northeastern Siberia."
Climate change may be increasing Arctic polar vortex stretching events. This would cause more extreme cold in the United States.
Department of Alto Adige
"The Department of Alto Adige (, ) was a department of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy. It was named after the river Adige (Etsch), which flowed through it. The capital of the department was Trento."
"The department's territory was not the same as that of the modern Italian province of Alto Adige. Some of the territory is the same, such as the city of Bolzano, but most of the rest is now part of the province of Trento. These two provinces form the region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol."
History.
"The name ""Alto Adige"" was created in the late 18th century by Napoleon Bonaparte, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps. This was the name of the French administrative division known as the ""Department of Alto Adige"" (""Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige""), created during Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 1810. It was officially named ""Haut Adige"" to get rid of relation to the historic ""County of Tyrol"" of Austria. The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic."
"Some years later, Napoleon created the Department of Alto Adige further north. This department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814. It was created with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino). The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, who said that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians."

Eublepharinae
"The Eublepharinae are one of the five subfamilies of the Gekkonidae, or geckos. The Eublepharinae subfamily has 27 species in five genera. Also called eyelid geckos, the eublepharines have more simple features than other geckos. For example, they don't have the ability to climb surfaces. Unlike other geckos, they also have movable eyelids. They are generally active at night or at twilight. These lizards often eat insects and similar creatures. They lay a pair of leathery eggs, and, in most species, the gender of the young is determined by the temperature of the egg; just like crocodiles."
The subfamily contains the following genera:
Brunhilde
"Brunhilde was a mighty female warrior, one of the Valkyries. She was also a heroine from the German epics, especially in the Nibelungen saga, in which she is an Icelandic princess."
"She defied Odin and in punishment he imprisoned her within a ring of fire on earth. She had to stay there until someone rescued her. Siegfied (Sigurd) braved the fire, woke her, and fell in love with her."
"He gave her the ring Andvarinaut, unaware of its curse. Eventually she killed herself when she learned that Sigurd had betrayed her with another woman (Gudrun), not knowing he had been bewitched into doing so by Grimhild."
1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens
"On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens in Washington erupted. The eruption was recorded as a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. Throughout the two months before the eruption, there was a series of earthquakes and steam was vented from the mouth of the volcano. A total of 57 people died in the eruption. Including Harry R. Truman, who ran Spirit Lake, and volcano expert David A. Johnston."
Property management
"Property management is the process of managing and taking care of property. Property management can be applied to personal, business and public properties. Property management is used in various situations, like building a home, where property manager looks over the process of construction, management of resources and security. The process of property management can be carried using both people (onsite management, security) and machines (cameras, detectors and alarms). An example of property management will be hiring security company. They might be allowed to enter property and check for any issues while the owners are not present. In business, property management is extremely important to achieve safety and improve work environment of employees."
"The kererū (""Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae"") is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kererū were an important type of food for Māori. There are much fewer kererū now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kererū any more, it is against the law to hunt them."
Name.
"'Kererū' is the most common name for this bird, but in some parts of the North Island it is called ""kūkū"" or ""kūkupa."" Kererū are also called ""wood pigeon"", but they are a different type of bird to the wood pigeon (""Columba palumbus"") of the Northern Hemisphere."
Description.
"Kererū are big and generally weigh between 550 and 850 grams. They have a white underbelly and dark green/blue head, shoulders, and wings. The green/blue colour is iridescent, meaning it is shiny and shows lots of different blues, greens, and purples in the sunlight."
Henotheism
"Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group."
"Henotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god."
A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be worshipped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.

Second Industrial Revolution
"The Second Industrial Revolution was a period when advances in steel production, electricity and petroleum caused a series of innovations that changed society. With the production of cost effective steel, railroads were expanded and more industrial machines were built. Women become a bigger part of the work industry, getting jobs as white collar workers including secretaries and clerks."

The Brittas Empire
The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.
Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.
The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes — including two Christmas specials — from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.
"""The Brittas Empire"" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's ""Britain's Best Sitcom"" poll."
"The show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in ""The Brittas Empire""."
Plot summary.
"Gordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives."
"Helen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it hard to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent."
"Brittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss."
Episodes.
"""The Brittas Empire"" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called ""Get Fit with Brittas""."
"For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank."
"However, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent."
"'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre."
"In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix."
DVD and VHS releases.
"All seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s."
Critical response.
Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that:
"In its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, ""The Brittas Empire"" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch."
Influence.
"The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and ""The Office""."
Setting.
"The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire."
Teen Titans Go!
"Teen Titans Go! is an American television show. It airs on Cartoon Network. It first aired on April 23, 2013. It is currently airing ""its 8th season."""
"The production companies of the series are DC Entertainment and Warner Bros.

Yukultji Napangati
Yukultji Napangati is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Papunya Tula group of artists. She is part of a generation of female painters who followed in the footsteps of the original male Papunya Tula artists.
"Yukultji grew up around Marruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay. She grew up without knowing about places like Kiwirrkurra, or her relatives living there. She had never met anyone from outside her own family. Her family lived a completely traditional nomadic way of life. Her father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Yukultji's father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as ""the last nomads"". Yukultji was the youngest of this group."
"Yukultji experienced major culture shock when first coming out of the desert. She often found new things difficult to understand. In an interview once, she remembers, ""I hopped into a car and crouched down, and I saw the trees move. I was frightened. I was scared. I jumped right off because the trees were racing around the place."""
"Yukultji began painting in the early 1990s. Before this, she had watched her brothers painting and later decided to try it for herself. She paints stories and songs from her and her mother's dreaming. These stories are about her traditional country, around Marruwa, Ngaminya and Marrapinti."
"Her paintings are shown in several public collections in Australia. Her work has been shown in over 80 exhibitions in Australia and overseas. She was a finalist in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2012, Yukultji won the Alice Prize, an award for Australian artists in Alice Springs."
Yalti Napangati
"Yalti Napangati (born around 1970) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Western Desert style of art, and paints for the Papunya Tula school. Her husband, Warlimpirrnga, is also a well-known artist. They were both members of the infamous Pintupi Nine, the last group of Aborigines living a traditional way of life in Australia."
"Yalti was born in the Great Sandy Desert, sometime around 1970. She and her family lived as nomads in the desert, travelling along the western side of Lake Mackay. Most other Pintupi families had moved into settlements during the 1950s, but Yalti's father kept the family away from these. Her parents were Lanti (or ""Joshua"") and Nanu. She has an older brother, Tamayinya, and a younger sister, Yukultji. She married Warlimpirrnga sometime during the early 1980s, possibly when she was as young as 12. She and her family came out of the desert in 1984. She now lives at Kiwirrkurra, and has two sons and two daughters."
"Yalti finished her first paintings for Papunya Tula in June 1996. She makes acrylic paintings of landscapes associated with Pintupi dreaming stories. Her paintings are of important places in her country, around Marruwa, Laurryi, Wirrulnga and Patjarr."

1972 Summer Olympics
"The 1972 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad, were held in Munich, West Germany (in what is now Germany), from 26 August to 11 September 1972. Munich won its Olympic bid in April 1966 over the cities of Detroit, Michigan, USA; Madrid, Spain; and Montreal, Canada. The 1972 Summer Olympics are one of 2 Olympic Games that had a significant criminal incident — the Munich massacre, in which a group of Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and killed several Israeli athletes. (The other Olympics with a significant criminal event was the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, USA — the Centennial Olympic Park bombing). A movie about the Israeli response to this was made called Munich."

Pygmy peoples
"Pygmy is a word that describes several ethnic groups with unusually short people. According to anthropologists, pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efé and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies."
"The word ""pygmy"" is sometimes thought to be pejorative (an insult). It is, however, the only word that is used to call ""all"" African Midgets."
"The word Bayaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. In the Congo Basin, pygmies are called the Kongo word Bambenga."
Name.
"The name ""pygmy"" comes from the Greek word (""pygmaios""). This word was derived from (came from) the word which is the length between a person's elbow and knuckles. The Latin word (pl. ""pygmaei"") came from this older Greek word."
"The word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer. He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called ""Pygmies"" who lived in India and Ethiopia."
Origins.
"There are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short. It has been proved that their height is hereditary, and is passed on from parents to children. It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests, where many pygmies live. This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones to grow. Since the pygmies would get less calcium, they would have smaller bones and skeletons."
There are other explanations for why pygmies are so short. Some explanations are:
Some research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes. These genes are important for humans to grow tall.
Africa.
"Pygmies can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. Most of these groups are partly hunter-gatherers. They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers. From the farmers they get crops and tools. There are about 250,000-600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest."
"James Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791 in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, into a prosperous merchant family. He had four sisters and three brothers, and studied at the Old Stone Academy before entering Dickinson College in 1807. There he studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1812."
"Buchanan was engaged to Anne C. Coleman, but she died early, and he never had children. He is the only U.S. president who was never married."
"Buchanan served in both the House and Senate, representing Pennsylvania, as well as the Minister to Russia, under Andrew Jackson, before stepping taking the presidential career."
Presidency.
"During the beginning of his presidency, he called slavery an issue of little importance. This was clearly not the case at the time; Northerners and Southerners were very divided on slavery, almost to the point of war."
The Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not American citizens and that the states were allowed to keep slavery legal. James Buchanan supported that decision because he did not want the pro-slavery states to stop being part of the United States.
"Buchanan supported the rights of slave owners to keep their slaves and wanted Kansas to adopt a constitution that allowed slavery. Because of that, the Democratic Party was divided on that issue and after the 1858 Congressional election, there were more Republicans in Congress than Democrats. He did not get along with the Republicans."
He ordered troops to fight against Utah based on untrue information that Utah was planning a revolt. Buchanan later realized that he made a mistake and apologized.
"During his term, the country was becoming more and more divided over the slavery issue. A few months before his term ended, some of the southern states decided that they were going to not be a part of the United States any more."
"Buchanan believed that it was a bad thing, but he did nothing about it because he felt that using force against the south was against the Constitution. He did not even prepare the country for war."
Legacy.
"At the end of his term, he left the next president, Abraham Lincoln, to face the greatest crises in United States history, the Civil War."
"Some historians think that Buchanan was the worst president of the United States in the history, because he did nothing to prevent the Civil war."
Hand
A hand is the part of the body at the end of an arm. Most humans have two hands. Each hand usually has four fingers and a thumb. On the inside of the hand is the palm. The five bones inside this part of the hand are called metacarpals. The wrist connects the hand to the arm. The hand has 27 bones including the wrist bones.
"When the fingers are all bent tightly, the hand forms a fist. The joints that are the hardest part of the fist are called knuckles. Many other animals, especially other primates, have hands that can hold things. Human hands can do things other hands cannot."

Bahrain
"Bahrain (officially called Kingdom of Bahrain) is an island country in the Arabian Gulf. Saudi Arabia is to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway, and Qatar is to the south across the Persian Gulf. The Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge, not yet built, will link Bahrain to Qatar as the longest fixed bridge in the world. Qatar and Bahrain's flag is the same design but not the same colors because Qatar is white and maroon and Bahrain is white and red."
History.
"People have lived in Bahrain before there was writing. It has been ruled and influenced by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and the Arabs, who made the island Muslim. Bahrain was in old times known as Dilmun, Tylos, Awal and Mishmahig."
"The islands of Bahrain, set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf, have attracted many invaders in history. The word ""Bahrain"", ""Two Seas"", means that the islands contain two kinds of water, sweet water springs and salty water in the sea."
"A location between East and West, fertile lands, fresh water, and pearls made Bahrain important in history. About 2300 BC, Bahrain started trading with Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Indus Valley (now near India). It was then called Delmon, and was linked to the Sumerian Civilization about 2000 BC. Bahrain also became part of the Babylonian empire about 600 BC. Historical records called Bahrain the ""Life of Eternity"", ""Paradise"", the ""Pearl of the Persian Gulf"" and other names."
"Until 1521, Bahrain also ruled Al-Hasa and Qatif (both are now the eastern province of Saudi Arabia) and Awal (now the Bahrain Islands). The country had all of the land from what is now Kuwait to Oman. This was called ""Iqlim Al-Bahrain"" (Province of Bahrain). In 1521, the Portuguese took Awal (now Bahrain) from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means today's Bahrain."

Kuwait
"Kuwait is a small Arab country (about 17,819 square kilometers) in the Middle East."
"Kuwait is the most socially progressive country in the Gulf region. It has a small and rich economy. It has about 96 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. Crude oil reserves are the oil that is still under the ground and has not yet been cleaned up. Kuwait has 10% of all of the oil reserves in the world. The country makes a lot of money by selling oil. This money is almost half of all the money the country makes. The oil money is also 95% of the money made by selling things to different countries (people call that exports). Also, the oil money is 80% of the money the government makes. Kuwait is now talking with oil companies of other countries to make oil fields in the northern part of the country."
"Kuwait's weather makes farming hard (too little rain). Instead of farming, the country catches fish and buys food from other countries. About 75% of the country's water to drink has to be distilled (have the salt removed) or purchased from other countries."
"In 1990, Iraq invaded (brought an army in to fight against) Kuwait. This started the first Gulf War. Kuwait's official religion is Islam, although 15% of its population are Christian or Hindu. Arabic is mostly spoken in Kuwait but English is widespread among Kuwaitis (residents of Kuwait). Kuwait is one of the few nations that has education for every age."
Another interesting fact about Kuwait is that a lot of people speak English.

Governorates.
"Kuwait is divided into 6 governorates. The governorates are divided into districts, And the establishment of the governorates of Kuwait dates back to the Emiri Decree No. 6 issued in 1962, which divided Kuwait into three governorates: the Capital Governorate, Hawalli Governorate and Al-Ahmadi Governorate. The decree clarified the work of the governor, his subordination of the governor to the Ministry of Interior, and his responsibility towards security, provided that the Ministry of Interior issues the necessary decisions to indicate the limits of the governor's jurisdiction. There have been some changes regarding the governorates of Kuwait, which we summarize as follows:"
". On November 14, 1979: Some provisions of the administrative division decree were amended so that a fourth governorate, Al-Jahra Governorate, was added."
". On October 12, 1988: The first article of the article was amended to divide Kuwait into five governorates by adding Al-Farwaniyah Governorate."
". On November 27, 1999: Emiri Decree No. 290 was issued to add a sixth governorate, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate."
"Thus, Kuwait has become administratively divided into six governorates, each affiliated with several regions. Warba Island and Bubiyan Island belong to the Jahra Governorate, while the rest of the islands belong to the Capital Governorate."
Tiny Tim
"Herbert Buckingham Khaury, better known as Tiny Tim (April 12, 1932–November 30, 1996), was an American singer and musician. He became popular in the late 1960s due to his appearances on television, and songs played on ukulele with a falsetto voice. His most famous song was ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"". His best-remembered television appearances were on ""Laugh-In"" and ""The Tonight Show"". His first wedding took place on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1969, at host Johnny Carson's suggestion."
Career.
"Not just a performer, he was also an expert , who studied American music from the earliest days of the United States, and performed many historic songs in his act. Over time, he used his falsetto voice less, and performed most songs in his natural, baritone voice."
"When his popularity as a """" lessened, he performed in small nightclubs and other places, as he had earlier. During the 1980s, he toured with a circus, and appeared in a movie as a circus performer who turned to crime. In the 1990s, he recorded new music (including a Christmas album), and joined comedian Pat Paulsen in his latest mock campaign to become President of the United States, as Paulsen's ."
"Changing how addends are grouped in an addition does not change its sum either. This is called the ""associative property of addition""."

formula_17
formula_18
formula_19
formula_20
formula_21
"Because of the ""additive identity"", any number minus zero is the same number (formula_22)."
"In a subtraction of two terms, switching the minuend and the subtrahend changes the sign of the answer, meaning subtraction is anticommutative."
For example: formula_23 and formula_24
Multiplication.
"Multiplication is the third arithmetic operation and the second hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of division. The terms in a multiplication are called ""factors"", and the result of a multiplication is called a ""product""."
Multiplication is repeated addition.
The symbol for multiplication is × (• in algebra)
Examples of multiplications:
formula_25
formula_26
formula_27
formula_28
formula_29
"Any number times one is the same number (formula_30). This is called the ""multiplicative identity""."
For example: formula_31
"Changing the order of the factors in a multiplication does not change its product. This is called the ""commutative property of multiplication""."

They then were known as the National Basketball Association. The league's head offices are in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Its international offices are in the same place. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are in Atlanta, Georgia."
"The NBA is widely considered the top level of competition in the world for basketball. With an average player height of about 6 foot 6 inches, it is also the world's tallest sports league."
History of the NBA.
Creation and merger.
"In 1946, The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. Its founders were owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers. This was the first game played in NBA history. There were earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues. Examples are the American Basketball League and the NBL. The BAA was the first league to play in major cities. They played in large arenas. The level of play in the BAA was not very good. Competing leagues and other teams had similar talent. The Harlem Globetrotters are an example."
"On August 3, 1949, the BAA combined with the NBL. The National Basketball Association was born. The new league had 17 teams. They came from cities of different sizes. The league got rid of several teams. It reached its smallest size of eight teams in the 1954–55 season. They were the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors (now Golden State Warriors), Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles Lakers), Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (now Detroit Pistons), Milwaukee Hawks (now Atlanta Hawks), and Syracuse Nationals (now Philadelphia 76ers). Teams in small cities moved to larger cities."
"Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in 1947–48. He played for the New York Knicks. But 1950 is recognized as when the NBA integrated. African Americans joined several teams. Those players included Chuck Cooper, Nathaniel ""Sweetwater"" Clifton, and Earl Lloyd. They joined three different teams. During the 1950s, the Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA Championships. George Mikan was their leader. He played the center position. The Lakers were the league's first dynasty. In 1954, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock. A team must try a shot in 24 seconds. If they cannot, the other team gets the ball."
Teams.
The NBA contains 30 teams. 15 are in the Eastern Conference and 15 are in the Western Conference. Each conference has three divisions with 5 teams. Teams play other teams in their division often. All teams play all other teams in a season.
The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have won 17 championships each. No other teams have won more championships. Some teams have never won a championship.
29 teams are in the United States. The Toronto Raptors are in Canada. David Stern wants the league to expand to Europe. Some teams have played games in the United Kingdom.
Regular Season.
"Teams begin training camps in September. This allows the coaching staff to observe their players. Teams play preseason games. These do not count for a team's final season record. The weaker players get cut. Other players stay on the team and get paid. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October. All teams play 82 games during a normal season. There are 41 home games and 41 road (away) games. Home games offer benefits to teams. They generally play better due to fan support and lack of travel. Teams play every other team during the regular season. The best players play in the NBA All-Star game in February. Fans vote for the starters. The coaches vote for the reserve (substitute) players. There is a pause in the season during the All-Star Game. Teams do not play games for about a week. Other events occur during the All-Star break. These include the Three-Point contest, the Skills course, and the Slam Dunk contest. Players participate in part due to fan interest."
"Before the trade deadline, teams can trade players. This can cause changes in the balance of power. Team bosses want to get the best players for their team. Other bosses want to lower their costs. Trades often happen on the last day."
Culture.
"The way boys are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures. Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls. It is their job to do work which is physically hard, including fighting in the army when they are grown up. However, people’s attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys. In Western cultures boys traditionally wear trousers (pants) while girls wear dresses or skirts. However, many girls also wear trousers these days, like boys, especially when dressed informally. Boys often have shorter hair than girls, although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions."
"Traditionally boys like rough games (such as soccer or rugby) and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains. People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that, or because that is the way society expects them to behave."
"The traditional colour for a boy is blue. For girls it is pink. When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its wrist or ankle, according to whether it is a boy or a girl."
Names.
"Some names are boys’ names, others are girls’ names. There are some names which can be for boys and girls (although they may be spelt differently, e.g. “Lesley” for a boy and “Leslie” for a girl)."
"In some countries such as Britain an “old boy” means a grown up who used to be a pupil at a particular school (e.g. “He is an old boy of Cransbury High School”). The expression can also be used in a very informal, friendly way, e.g. “Nice to see you, old boy!”."

Paul McCartney
"Sir James Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and composer. He is internationally known as a singer and bassist of the Beatles. With singer and guitarist John Lennon, he contributed music and lyrics to a lot of the band's songs."
Early Life.
"Paul was born at Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery (Past is Walton Hospital) in Walton, Liverpool, England, He was son of Jim and Mary McCartney, He had one brother is Michael McCartney and stepsister is called Ruth."
The Beatles (1962–1970).
"McCartney began writing songs before he was sixteen, and has written well over two hundred. His most famous song is ""Yesterday"", recorded by the Beatles in 1965. Since then around 2000 artists have recorded the song. Other songs written by McCartney for The Beatles include ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Penny Lane"", ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Let It Be""."
"Often, Beatles songs would have ""Lennon/McCartney"" written on the record, and it would look like that they had written it together. In fact, most Lennon/McCartney songs were written by only one of them, or with one adding only small parts to the other's work. Each counted on the other to help make their songs better, so they agreed to share the credit equally."
Solo music.
"Since the Beatles had stopped working together in 1971, McCartney started a new band called Wings with his wife Linda. Wings also had many hit records, including ""Band On The Run"" and ""Mull Of Kintyre"". McCartney wrote ""Live and Let Die"", which became the theme song to a James Bond film with the same title. Wings disbanded in 1981."
"Later McCartney recorded a single called ""Ebony and Ivory"" with Stevie Wonder, then ""The Girl is Mine"" and ""Say, Say, Say"" with Michael Jackson. A song with Jackson called ""The Man"" was released on McCartney's fifth solo album ""Pipes of Peace"". He and Jackson became friends, but this ended after Jackson outbid McCartney for ownership of the publishing company which owned most of the Beatles's music."
"McCartney had other hit songs, and also wrote and starred in the movie, ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"", with Linda. The theme song from the movie, ""No More Lonely Nights"", was also a hit, but the movie did poorly, and McCartney's popularity suffered. He had to work hard to prove his talent was still strong. He co-wrote new songs with Elvis Costello, and began touring more often than he had in years."
"Along with popular music, McCartney also began composing classical music, including an oratorio about Liverpool. McCartney was knighted for his contributions to music and to British culture, and for his charity work. He bought John Lennon's former school, Quarry Bank, which he then turned into a performing arts school."
"In 1990, the minor planet 4148 was named ""McCartney"" in his honour. In 2010, he was honoured by President Barack Obama with the Gershwin Prize for his contributions to popular music. He returned to the White House later that year as a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2012, he became the last Beatle to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
Personal life.
"McCartney married Linda Eastman, a photographer, in 1969. She had a daughter, Heather, whom he adopted. McCartney and Linda had three more children together, named Mary, Stella and James. Stella became a popular fashion designer after she grew up."
"Linda died in 1998 of breast cancer (McCartney's mother also died from the same disease in 1956). He married model Heather Mills in 2002; the couple's child Beatrice was born in 2003. McCartney and Mills separated in 2006, and, after a long battle over a settlement, McCartney and Mills divorced in March 2008."
"McCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell, 51, in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The couple had been dating since November 2007."
Paul is dead.
There was an urban legend that said that McCartney died in a car crash in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike.

Reuben
Reuben was the son of Jacob and Leah in the Book of Genesis.
Birth.
"Jacob was in love with Rachel, the daughter of Laban and asked to marry her. Laban said he would let Jacob marry her if he worked for him as a shepherd for seven years. Jacob worked for those years but they felt like they were only seven days because of how much he loved Rachel. But then, Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Rachel’s older sister Leah instead of marrying her and said he didn’t believe in the younger daughter marrying before her older sister married so Jacob had to work for Laban for another seven years so that Laban would let him marry Rachel. Jacob loved Rachel but he did not love Leah so Leah prayed to the Lord saying “give me children, for I am despised”. So the Lord had mercy on her and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. And Leah said “now my husband shall love me” and named her son Reuben."
Mandrakes.
"After Leah gave birth to Simeon, Levi and Judah (Biblical personage), Bilhah gave birth to Gad and Asher, Zilpah gave birth to Dan and Naphtali and Leah gave birth to Zebulun and Issachar, then Reuben found mandrakes and gave them to his mother Leah. When Rachel asked Leah for the mandrakes,Leah said “first you take from me my husband and now the mandrakes of my son” and agreed to give Rachel the mandrakes if Leah became Jacob’s main wife."
Bilhah.
It’s written in the Torah that Reuben lay down with Bilhah and that his father Jacob heard about it. (Genesis 35:22) Though the Talmud says that this was a metaphor and that Reuben actually took Bilhah’s bed from his father’s tent but that this was seen as being like the sin of incest (Shabbat 55) and says that this works because in the Book of Job wanting to commit incest is seen as committing incest.
The story of Joseph.
"In the story of Joseph, when the brothers are about to kill Joseph, Reuben tells them that instead of murdering him they should throw him into a big hole in the ground and leave him to die. But Reuben secretly planned to rescue Joseph and so when Reuben came back to save Joseph and found out that he had already been sold into slavery, Reuben tore his clothes in mourning for Joseph. And after Simeon was jailed, Reuben told his brothers that the Lord was punishing them all for what they did to Joseph."
Inheritance.
"According to Jewish tradition, Reuben didn’t get the inheritance that a firstborn son would usually get because he was being punished for the sin with Bilhah."
Talmud.
"Rabbi Shimon son of Eliezer teaches that after Leah died and Jacob moved his bed to the tent of Bilhah, Reuben took the bed from Bilhah’s tent and put in the tent of his mother Leah to honour his mother’s memory and the sin Reuben committed by doing that was compared to incest but Reuben did not actually have sex with Bilhah. Though there are also Rabbis in the Talmud who say that he did."
The Zohar.
"According to the Zohar, Reuben lying down with Bilhah cannot be wikt:literally true because then Reuben wouldn’t have become the father of a tribe of the Israelites. It says that Reuben knew from prophecy that there were supposed to be only twelve tribes of Israel so he moved his father’s bed from Bilhah’s tent even though the Shechina is there whenever married people do their religious duty to have sex with each other but by meddling Reuben made the Shechina leave that tent and that was Reuben’s sin."
Affenpinscher
"The Affenpinscher is a small breed of dog in the toy group. These dogs originally came from Germany. They are known to have existed since the 1600s. Their name comes from the German word ""Affe,"" which means ""monkey,"" because their faces remind people of monkeys. Originally, the dog was bred to be a ""ratter,"" a type of dog that kills rats and mice in homes, farms, and stables. Now that mice are not so commonly found in the home, Affenpinschers are usually just kept as pets."
Appearance.
"The Affenpinscher is a very small kind of dog. It weighs between . Its height is between at the shoulder. Their face is flat and ""monkey-like."" The most common and preferred colour of fur for this breed is black, but they can also come in grey, beige, and other colours. In the American Kennel Club, a good example of these dogs could be any colour. In the French and British Kennel Clubs they must only be black."
MAC address
"Computers that use a computer network or internet network need to be identified. For this reason, many network connection types, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi, use unique addresses to identify the network card, a part of a computer, to access the network. These addresses are usually called the Media Access Control address or MAC address."
"Each computer is given a MAC address by its computer maker. The way for giving MAC addresses to computers, created by Xerox, is used. MAC addresses have 48-bits (how many 1s or 0s it has in it). As each of the twelve entries can have 16 possible values (0 through 9 and A through F), there are 1612 or 248 (or 281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. MAC addresses identify many things, such as the type of device being used."
A MAC address is used by the network to send and receive data (computer information) to the right place almost like mail being sent and received from a home mail address. The MAC address is like door number or street number.
Chloë Sevigny

As her father put it, child analysis had received a powerful impetus through ""the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter, Anna Freud"". Her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially."
Key moments in life.
"After a somewhat troubled childhood, Anna was psychoanalysed by her father. When her analysis was completed in 1922, she became a psychoanalyist herself. She taught at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis. From 1925 until 1934, she was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association. She continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject."
"After the Anschluss in 1938 the Freuds fled Vienna and came to London. Freud himself was dying of cancer, so Anna ran the household. Anna had a professional disagreement with Melanie Klein, who had come to London much earlier, and was already established as a child psychologist. A series of 'controversial discussions' were held by the British Psychoanalytical Society. The discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties. Eventually agreement was reached that both 'schools' should co-exist inside the Society. The Society now has three training divisions: Kleinian, Freudian and Independent."
"During the war, Freud studied the effect of deprivation of parental care on children. She set up a centre for young war victims, called ""The Hampstead War Nursery"". Here the children got foster care, with mothers"
encouraged to visit as often as possible.
"In 1947, Freud and Kate Friedlaender established the Hampstead Child Therapy Courses. Five years later, a children's clinic was added. Freud started lecturing on child psychology."
"From the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture, teach and visit friends. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family."
Freud died in London on 9 October 1982. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes placed in a marble shelf next to her parents' ancient Greek funeral urn. Her lifelong friend Dorothy Burlingham and several other members of the Freud family also rest there.
Personal life.
"Anna Freud lived with her close friend Dorothy Burlingham, daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany, for years."

Book of Esther
"Esther is the name of a book in the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and the Old Testament, and also its title heroine. It is the basis for the Jewish celebration Purim."
Author and Date.
"Although it is never said who wrote the book of Esther, from inside evidence it is possible to make some guesses about the author and when it was written. The author was a Jew, because he emphasizes where the Jewish festival came from and from the Jewish nationalism inside the story. The author probably lived in a Persian city, because he knew Persian customs well, and does not say anything about the land of Judah or Jerusalem. The earliest date of the book would be a little while after the events were told, for instance, about 460 B.C. (before Ezra's return to Jerusalem). It is also thought that the festival of Purim had been celebrated some time before this book was written."
"Purpose, Themes, and Features."
Purpose.
The author's main purpose was to write about how the yearly festival of Purim started and to make people remember the saving of the Jewish people during King Ahaseurus' reign. The book shows both the start of the festival and why it should continue to be celebrated.
Themes.
"In the book, the author repeatedly talks about the conflict between Israel and the Amalekites, a conflict that began during the exodus and continued through Israel's history. The author of Esther views them as the symbol of all the powers of the world against God's people. Now that Israel has been released from captivity, Haman's dangerous edict is the final try in the Old Testament time to get rid of them. When Haman is defeated, Israel enjoys a time of rest."
"Feasting is another important theme in Esther, as seen in the picture on the left. Banquets are the setting for important parts of the story. There are ten banquets."
Style and Features.
Repetition is one of the main stylistic features of the book of Esther. The three groups of banquets come in pairs; there are two lists of the king's servants; two reports that Esther hid her identity; two gatherings of women; two houses for the women; two fasts; two talks by Haman with his wife and friends; two sudden visits to the king by Esther; two coverings of Haman's face; two royal commands; two cool-downs of the king's anger; two days for the Jews to protect themselves and take vengeance; and two letters about how Purim started.
"Another important feature of this book that has often been wondered about is that it never directly talks about God, worship, prayer, or sacrifice. This has made some people think the book is not as religious as other books. However, it is possible that the author purposefully did not say anything about God or anything religious to show more clearly that it is God who controls all the ""unimportant"" coincidences that are in the story and ends in saving the Jews."
Content.
"The Book of Esther is about a Jewish girl adopted by her cousin, Mordecai, after her parents died."
"The Persian King Ahaseurus kicked out his wife, Queen Vashti, after she refused his demand, and fell in love with Esther at a beauty contest. He took Esther as the new Persian queen, not knowing she was a Jew."
"Haman, Ahaseurus' prime minister, developed a grudge against Mordecai because he would not bow down to him, but only to the God of Israel. He despised Mordecai because he was a Jew, and tried to trick the king into making a law to kill all Jews. Haman was unaware that Queen Esther herself was a Jew."
"The Martian is a favorite character of classical science fiction; he was frequently found away from his home planet, often invading Earth, but sometimes simply a lonely character representing alienness from his surroundings. Martians, other than human beings transplanted to Mars, became rare in fiction after Mariner, except in exercises of deliberate nostalgia – more frequently in some genres, such as comics and animation, than in written literature."

"The first iPod was named the iPod Classic. This iPod was released on October 23, 2001. Apple Inc. made the iPod like this until September 9, 2014."
"Apple made a smaller iPod called the iPod mini. It was much smaller than the iPod Classic, but did not hold as many songs. It used flash memory, a special kind of memory for very small electronics, instead of a hard drive. It was replaced by a version of the iPod called the iPod nano."
"Another type of iPod, called the iPod shuffle, was very small, and it used flash memory, like the iPod mini but it had no screen. It was the least expensive iPod."
"The most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. It's very similar to the IPhone, but it's not a smartphone. The first generation of iPod touch was released on September 5, 2007 and was discontinued on May 10, 2022."
"iPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.)

Costa Rica
"Costa Rica (officially called Republic of Costa Rica), is a country in Central America. It is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The official language of Costa Rica is Spanish. The official currency is the colón. It has enjoyed a long period of peace since the 1863 civil war. Because of its natural beauty and political stability, it is nicknamed the ""Switzerland of Latin America"". Costa Rica has had no army since December 1, 1948. Instead of spending money on the military, the government spends money on education and health."
"5,094,118 people live in Costa Rica. The capital city is San José. The current President is Carlos Alvarado Quesada. He was elected in 2018"
History.
Pre-Columbian period.
The indigenous people of Costa Rica belong to the Intermediate Area. This Intermediate Area is where the Mesoamerican and Andean indigenous cultures mixed together. The country was influenced by various Chibcha speaking indigenous people.
The impact of indigenous peoples' culture on modern Costa Rica has been small. The country did not have a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the indigenous population was absorbed into the Spanish colony. There are still some small indigenous groups. The largest is the Bribri and Boruca tribes in south Costa Rica.
Spanish colonization.
Christopher Columbus sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his last trip in 1502. He reported large amounts of gold jewelry among the indigenous people.
"During the colonial period, Costa Rica was the most southern province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. But it mostly ruled itself as a part of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition to trade with the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and the lack of gold and silver made Costa Rica into a poor, little populated region of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was called ""the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America"" by a Spanish governor in 1719."
"Costa Rica's poverty was also because there were not enough indigenous people available for slavery. Most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land. There were no large ""haciendas"" (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was unappreciated and forgotten by the Spanish Crown. It had to develop on its own."
"Costa Rica became a ""rural democracy"" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a better climate."
Independence.
"Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the last Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica."
"Costa Rica joined the First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide. After its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became a province of the new Federal Republic of Central America. it existed from 1823 to 1839. It had a very loose authority over its provinces, especially the poor and remote Costa Rica."
"In 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to San José. This led to a brief battle with the old capital, Cartago."
"While civil wars were common in the Federal Republic of Central America, Costa Rica was largely peaceful."
"In 1838, Costa Rica formally proclaimed itself an independent country. The local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration."
Outstation (Aboriginal community)
"In Australia, the outstation movement is the movement of Australian Aboriginal people from large towns to much smaller communities, called outstations. It is mostly seen in the Northern Territory and amongst the people of the Western Desert."
"Before the 20th century, most Aboriginal families lived by themselves or in groups of 20–30 people. They were nomadic (moving from place to place), hunting and foraging across the deserts. As Euro-Australians started to build roads, towns and farms on Aboriginal lands, the native people were forced out. They had to move off their lands into towns or missions. There, the government would give them food, water and clothes."
"This way of life did not suit them. In the towns, there were many conflicts between different ethnic groups, people became addicted to alcohol, and many of them died from foreign diseases. Many groups were also far away from their traditional homelands, which were important to them and their spirituality. From the 1970s, many families started to move away from the towns. They returned to the places they grew up, and set up smaller communities."
"One of the main reasons behind the movement is for Aboriginal people to get back autonomy and self-sufficiency. The communities manage themselves, as nomadic groups (or ""tribe"") did many years before. Hunting and foraging – getting their own food, and food for everybody – is still important."
Santa Catalina rattlesnake
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake (""Crotalus catalinensis""), also known as the """"Santa Catalina Island Rattlesnake"", is a species of venomous Pit viper found only on Santa Catalina Island in the Gulf of California. There are currently no subspecies recognized."
Description.
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is a small and slender species of rattlesnake. It can grow up to the length of 73.1 centimeters (28.8 in), and is known for being one of the few rattlesnakes which don't have a rattle on the end of their tail. Some Santa Catalina Rattlesnakes are light cream in color with reddish-brown blotches down their back, while some are ash gray with dark gray blotches on them."
Behavior.
"While other rattlesnakes of the genus ""Crotalus"""" are mainly terrestrial (live on land), the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's small size makes it very good climber. In July, the hottest month on Santa Catalina Island, the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is found on branches of bushes and trees so they can escape the heat on the ground."
Feeding.
"Since the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake lives mainly in trees, scientist first thought this rattlesnake eats birds, but scientist have now found out that around 70% of the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's diet is made up of small mammals like the Santa Catalina Deer Mouse, and around 30% is made up of lizards like the Santa Catalina Desert Iguana and the Santa Catalina Side-blotched lizard."

Youth Riding a Rooster (Epiktetos)
Youth Riding a Rooster is a red-figure plate painted by Epiktetos about 520–510 BC. Its diameter measures 7 3/8 in. (18.7 cm). The plate is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It shows a boy riding a rooster. It was a rare subject among ancient artists. It probably references homosexual relations between older men and youths. It also references the practice among Greek males of giving a rooster as a love gift.
"The vase scholar Sir John Beazley wrote in 1918 in ""Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums"" (p. 18): ""The best of [Epiktetos] is in his plates. You cannot draw better, you can only draw differently. Epiktetos' people are all lightness and fairy grace, as if they belonged to a world where passion and pain were unknown, to those 'woods of Athens' where Oberon reigned in the days before 'the middle summer's spring'""."
"The plate was discovered in Vulci in 1828. Twenty years later it became the possession of the second marquess of Northampton. On July 2, 1980, his great-great-grandson, the seventh marquess, sold it with other pottery at Christie's in London."
Punishment
"Punishment is when something is done to a person (or animal) that they do not like. It may be because they broke a rule. There are many kinds of punishment, from a death penalty for very bad crimes, to things that parents may do to punish children, like spanking them or taking away their toys. People are often sent to prison as punishment for a crime."
Punishment can be seen as good in society to prevent people from doing bad things. It can also be seen as cruel and unnecessary. It can also be seen to do more harm than good.
Om
The two letters OM can mean
Blue whale
"The blue whale (""Balaenoptera musculus"") is a marine mammal of the suborder of baleen whales (called Mysticeti). They grow to be about 30 meters long. The biggest blue whale found was 190 tons and measured 98 feet long. Larger specimens have been measured at 110 feet, but never weighed. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs."
"The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures, like krill. These inch-long, shrimp-like crustacean swim in swarms. In the Antarctic summer, there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters orange. A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day."
"The blue whale's body is long and slender. It can be various shades of bluish-grey above and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: ""B. m. musculus"" of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, ""B. m. intermedia"" of the Southern Ocean and ""B. m. brevicauda"" (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. ""B. m. indica"", found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small krill."
"Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic group of Blue Whales can be seen in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park near Tadoussac QC, Canada."
Cetacea
"The order Cetacea are marine mammals that live in oceans, seas and even a few rivers around the world. Whales, dolphins and porpoises are part of this group. These common names refer to size: whales are the largest, porpoises the smallest. How and what they eat is a better guide to their relationships. The study of cetaceans is called cetology."
"Cetaceans are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates."
Scottish Gaelic language
"Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig, pronounced ""Gah-lick"") is a Celtic language. It is commonly called just Scots Gaelic in Scottish English. It is a sister language of Irish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic; all three are Goidelic languages. These are related to the Welsh language, Cornish language and the Breton language (these three are Brittonic or Brythonic languages)."
History.
"In past times, the Scottish Gaelic was spoken across all of Scotland except for the Northern Islands (Orkney and Shetland). In the later part of the Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland began to speak Scottish English and looked down on the Scottish Gaelic. After the union of England and Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic was snubbed and looked down on even more, and Scottish English took over."
Today.
"Scottish Gaelic today is basically spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Scottish Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group, but there is some regional variation."
"A census in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed that a total of 58,652 (1.2% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could then speak some amount of Scottish Gaelic. Only the Western Isles have more people who can speak the Scottish Gaelic than not (61% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic). The place in Scotland with the largest percentage of speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis, where, 74.7% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic."
"Children in Scotland do not have to learn Scottish Gaelic in schools, but it is becoming a more popular subject as Scottish Gaelic is an important part of their Scottish culture."
"Scottish Gaelic is also used overseas. It is estimated that 1,000–2,000 in Nova Scotia, Canada, can speak some Scottish Gaelic."
Scottish language
Scottish language can mean:
West Germanic languages
"The West Germanic Languages are a branch of Germanic languages first spoken in Central Europe and the British Isles.

"He was born on 9 January 1834 at Courtfield, Ross, Herefordshire, England, second son of the fourteen children. Five of his brothers also became priests. Herbert, the eldest, became a cardinal and archbishop of Westminster, and John, the youngest, auxiliary bishop of Salford. Another brother, Reginald, married Julia Shanahan, sister-in-law of Sir Patrick Jennings. Four of his five sisters became nuns."
"Because of his health he was educated at home in a religious atmosphere. In 1850 he was sent to St Gregory's College at Downside near Bath. His mother's death in 1853 made him think of a religious life and on 12 September he joined the Benedictines, becoming Brother Bede. In 1855 at his father's request and expense, he was sent to Rome for further study under the guidance of the Italian scholar and reformer, Angelo Zelli-Jacuzzi. He was ordained priest by Cardinal Patrizi in the basilica of St John Lateran on 9 April 1859."

"Dulles was head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War. He oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, Operation Ajax, the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission."
"Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer. His older brother, John Foster Dulles, was the Secretary of State during the Eisenhower Administration."
Exosome complex
"The exosome complex is a protein complex which can degrade RNA strands (~stop them working). In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus."
"The core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases, the 'RNase PH-like proteins'."
"Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea. In bacteria a simpler complex called the ""degradosome"" carries out similar functions."
Royal National Lifeboat Institution
"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is an agency which rescues people at sea in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, as well as on some large rivers."
"The RNLI is a charity. Two-thirds of its funding comes from money left in people's wills. Most of its crew members are volunteers. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and 444 lifeboats. These are boats that travel from the shore to rescue people at sea, rather than lifeboats that are used for escaping from a ship. Their crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. The RNLI also provides beach lifeguards and flood rescue teams."
"The RNLI cannot be called for help directly. In the event that someone is in danger at sea, the coastguard of the country or territory should be called on 999 or 112. The coastguard organize the search for those in danger. They will then call the RNLI if their help is needed. Not all lifeboats in the UK and Ireland are run by the RNLI; there are some independent lifeboat agencies."
Puppeteer
"A puppeteer is a person who makes an inanimate object that might be shaped like a human, animal, legendary creature, or another object to create the illusion that the puppet is ""alive"". The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs."

Hurricane Ida (2009)
"Hurricane Ida was the last storm in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 4 after being in that area for a few days. After becoming a depression it quickly got stronger and became a tropical storm and a hurricane shortly before it struck Nicaragua. Over Central America, Hurricane Ida weakened very fast, becoming downgraded to a tropical depression before the end of the day on November 5."
"By November 6, Ida went back into the Caribbean and later became a hurricane again. Its strength changed a few times before it died on November 10 off the coast of Alabama. Reports show that Hurricane Ida caused $5.6 million in damage and caused 2 deaths."
Storm history.
"Ida was tracked back to a tropical wave that entered the western Caribbean Sea on November 1. A low soon formed near the tropical wave. This low did not move very much and it also got a lot of clouds near the middle of it. There was hardly any wind shear, which allowed for more clouds to form."
"On November 4, the tropical wave National Hurricane Center began call it Tropical Depression Eleven. The new tropical depression quickly got stronger and became Tropical Storm Ida soon after that. An Aircraft went into Ida and soon found winds at 65 miles per hour, which meant it was nearly a hurricane."
"Continuing to the northwest, Tropical Storm Ida was upgraded to Hurricane Ida when winds got to 80 miles per hour; at the time, it was put at only 75 miles per hour. Soon after this, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua on November 5. Ida weakened quickly over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm just after landfall. Near the end of the day on November 5, Tropical Storm Ida weakened to a tropical depression."
"Tropical Depression Ida survived its passage over land and went back into the Caribbean on November 6. Over the western Caribbean, it quickly became a tropical storm again. After moving north, Tropical Storm Ida became a hurricane again. &lt;ref name=""update11/7/09""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its highest winds on November 8 while it crossed between Cuba and Mexico; they were measured at 105 miles per hour, making it a category 2 hurricane. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were not warm enough to keep Ida at this strength. so it quickly weakened back to a tropical storm."
"For only six hours, it became a hurricane again before it became extratropical on November 10 while it was just south of Alabama. At the time, it looked like it stayed as a tropical storm and made landfall in Alabama, this was later noted as incorrect. Its remnants formed a strong nor'easter that affected some of the states of the East Coast of the United States."
Impact.
"Damage in Nicaragua was near $2.1 million and there were no people killed. In El Salvador, it seemed at first that killed over 100 people, this was discovered as a mistake later on."

The Rugby Championship
"The Rugby Championship is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of the sport's four strongest Southern Hemisphere nations—New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Argentina. It began in 1996, a year after the sport became professional, as the Tri Nations. At the time, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa competed for the Tri Nations Trophy. Beginning in 2012, Argentina joined the competition."
"During the Tri Nations era, the contest began in July, during the Southern Hemisphere winter, and ran through September. For most of that era, each team played every other team twice, once at home and once away. Later on, each team played the others three times. When the competition added Argentina, it returned to a pure home-and-away format, with a total of 12 games played. Also, due to a slight change in the sport's calendar, The Rugby Championship now begins in August and runs through October. This format is used except in years in which the Rugby World Cup is played (every four years, in the year before the Summer Olympics). In those years, each team plays the others only once, with a total of six games played."
"Teams are awarded competition points for a win, but can also earn 'bonus' points. At the end of the series, the team with the most competition points wins the trophy. The team that wins the competition is usually considered to be the best rugby union team in the Southern Hemisphere for that year."

Grosvenor Bridge
"Grosvenor Bridge, also called Victoria Railway Bridge, is a railway bridge over the River Thames in London, between Vauxhall Bridge and Chelsea Bridge."
"It is made up of two bridges that were both built in the mid-19th century. The eastern side was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858-60 to carry trains into Victoria Station. This was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London. The western side was built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1865/66."
"Both bridges were rebuilt in steel in 1963–67, the original piers now being wrapped in concrete. The designer for this work was Freeman Fox &amp; Partners."
"On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west. The Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital are immediately to the north west. On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west. Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge, and Battersea Park to the south west."
Vauxhall Bridge
Vauxhall Bridge is a steel and granite bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a north-west south-east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank.
History.
Vauzhall Bridge in 1906. It replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry.
"The building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane."
The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.
"In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames."
Ambrose Burnside
"Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824 – September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, railroad executive and politician. He served as governor of Rhode Island (1866-1869) and U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. As a Union Army general in the American Civil War, he fought successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee but was defeated in the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. Burnside commanded the IX Corps, the Department of Ohio, and also the Army of the Potomac for a few months. His distinctive style of facial hair is now known as sideburns, derived from his last name."
List of crossings of the River Thames
"This is a list of crossings of the River Thames including bridges, tunnels and ferries. There are almost 214 bridges, over 20 tunnels, six public ferries and one ford. The list starts at the downstream (Estuary) end and follows the river upstream towards the start of the river."
"A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed."
"Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in the city of London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so."

Wage
A wage is money that is paid by an employer to an employee in exchange for work. The amount may be fixed for each task completed (this is called piece rate); or it may be based on time or other measurable quantity of work done.
"Work for wages is the most common form of work. Because of this, the term ""wage"" sometimes refers to all forms of employee payment. However, a wage is different to a salary or commission. A salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done. Commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product. Waged employees may also receive ""tips"" paid directly by clients. They will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary, such as annual leave and sick leave."
"Wages are usually paid by the hour. This is called an hourly wage. Wages paid by the day are still common. Wage rates may be influenced by market forces (supply and demand), laws, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the United States, while tradition, social structure and seniority, perhaps play a greater role in Japan. In many countries, laws set a minimum wage that all employers must pay their workers. This means that employers cannot pay workers a lower rate than the minimum wage; however, they can pay them a higher rate. The minimum wage rate is there to protect the working class."
"Wages were paid in the Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome."
Aubrey McClendon

The label was founded by Lyor Cohen, Kevin Liles, Roger Gold and Todd Moscowitz, as well as a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. The song ""Trap Queen"" is about a woman dealing and cooking crack cocaine. His first mixtape, ""Fetty Wap: The Mixtape"" was originally set for release in February 2015. It was delayed because he continued to create new songs. In June 2015, Wap was included in ""XXL""'s 2015 Freshman Class."
"On June 29, 2015, Wap released his second single ""679"".

Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born American scientist. He worked on theoretical physics. He developed the theory of relativity. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics.
"His famous equation is formula_1 (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light (energy = mass × speed of light²)."
"At the start of his career, Einstein didn't think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to bring together the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he made the theory of special relativity to fix it."
"Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916, he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of gravitation."
"In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States but in Germany, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power (this is before World War II). Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not return to Germany due to Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies. He lived in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the beginning of World War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the process of making a nuclear weapon; so Einstein recommended that the U.S. should also make one. This led to the Manhattan Project, and the U.S. became the first nation in history to create and use the atomic bomb (not on Germany but on Japan). Einstein and other physicists like Richard Feynman who worked on the Manhattan Project later regretted that the bomb was used on Japan."
"Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first members invited to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked for the remainder of his life."
He is now thought to be one of the greatest scientists of all time.
"His contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity."
Life.
Early life.
"Einstein was born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, on 14 March 1879. His family was Jewish, but was not very . However, later in life Einstein became very interested in his Judaism. Einstein did not begin speaking until he was 3 years old. According to his younger sister, Maja, ""He had such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn"". When Einstein was around 4 years old, his father gave him a magnetic compass. He tried hard to understand how the needle could seem to move itself so that it always pointed north. The needle was in a closed case, so clearly nothing like wind could be pushing the needle around, and yet it moved. So in this way Einstein became interested in studying science and mathematics. His compass gave him ideas to the world of science."
"When he became older, he went to school in Switzerland. After he graduated, he got a job in the patent office there. While he was working there, he wrote the papers that first made him famous as a great scientist."
Einstein married with a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić in January 1903.
"In 1917, Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost killed him, fortunately he survived. His cousin Elsa Löwenthal nursed him back to health. After this happened, Einstein divorced Mileva in 14 February 1919, and married Elsa on 2 June 1919."
Children.
"Einstein's first daughter was Lieserl Einstein. She was born in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Austria-Hungary on January 27, 1902. She spent her first years in the care of Serbian grandparents because her father Albert did not want her to be brought to Switzerland, where he had a job offer at the patent office. Some historians believe she died from scarlet fever."
Festival.
"During the Lai Haraoba festival, devotees dance to please various deities. Among them, male dancers act after the styles of Haraba (alias Pakhangba) and female dancers act after the styles of goddess Nongthang Leima. Goddess Nongthang Leima represents the lightning."
Identification with other deities.
Goddess Nongthang Leima is often identified as Leimarel Sidabi. The former is considered as an incarnation of the latter.

Hoseff
"Hoffish(also called hoseff) is a dialect of swedish mostly spoken in the north of scandinavia. It is often called hoffish or hope language, although locals call it by hoseff. It is one of the most least spoken languages with 642 speakers world wide. It is commonly confused with the sami language but both languages have common similarity in grammer and noun pronunciation. The language was proclaimed as a dialect of sami in 1937 although the noted differences. Little has been done to help this dying language in the past century other then a few people trying to make the language more public. As of 2021, all of its speakers speak it as a secondary language with finnish or plain sami being first."
History.
"Hoffish originally started off as a dialect of the sami language in what is guessed to be in the middle ages. All we know about its history is from Mina Napoi, who interviewed many people of the sami culture. Her findings are at the helsinki central library in finland which are currently being approved for digitalization as of February 2021. In her last two pages of her article titled, ""Saamen murre nimeltä hoseff"", she talks about how the language most likely formed as a dialect of sami in the late middle ages but then over time reformed due to the hoffish-sami group's migration. The hoffish-sami people she interviewed said that their ancestors moved a lot from northern finland to as far as southern norway while trading furs. She finally states because of this common migration that the people must of picked up a lot of new nordic words and grammer which in time turned the sami language into what the hoffish people speak today."

Tannhäuser
"Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg (En: ""Tannhäuser and the Singers' Contest at Wartburg"") is a three-act opera with words and music by Richard Wagner. It was Wagner's fifth opera. He worked on it between 1842 and 1845. It was first performed at the Dresden Royal Opera on 19 October 1845 with Wagner conducting. The opera was a success. It became hugely popular in Germany."
"In 1859, ""Tannhäuser"" was the first Wagner opera to be performed in the United States of America. By 1861, the opera had been performed many times in Germany when Wagner was asked to revise the work for the Paris Opéra. Despite his best efforts, Wagner failed. He was not popular. Anti-Wagner riots broke out. He withdrew the work. It was not staged again in France until 1895. Meanwhile, the opera opened the second season of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in November 1884."
Background.
"Wagner was in Paris completing ""The Flying Dutchman"" when he began thinking about writing another opera. A friend suggested Tannhäuser as a subject. Wagner did not like the tale. Back in Germany however, he gathered materials by Tieck, Heine, and others about Tannhäuser. Vacationing in Bohemia, he had a change of heart. He began preparing an outline for ""Tannhäuser"". Returning home to Dresden, he immersed himself in the tale. He completed the opera in October 1845. He conducted the first performance that month at the Royal Opera House."
"His Venus said, ""You are a genius, but you write such eccentric stuff that it is impossible to sing."" His Tannhäuser was completely baffled. The audience was puzzled. The reception was lukewarm. Wagner began revisions at once. The second performance played to a near empty house. In 1859, Wagner offered ""Tannhäuser"" to the Paris Opéra. They wanted it sung in French. They also wanted a ballet in the second act. This so the Jockey Club had time to finish dinner and arrive at the Opéra just in time to ogle the dancers. Wagner refused to move the ballet from the first act to the second act. There were complaints. Jockey Club members interrupted the performance whenever possible. It was a disaster."
"The opera disappeared from the French stage for 34 years. A few years after the Jockey Club incident, Wagner began revising the Paris version. He produced a sophisticated sound version that was superior to the first draft. Though there are several set pieces in the opera, the opera is closer to Wagner's vision of complete independence from such set pieces. ""Tannhäuser"" is on the threshold of the leitmotif, and the diminishing of the sound power of the orchestra in favor of the sung word."
Sources.
"Wagner's sources for the opera are spread over 600 year time span. In 1391, and again at the beginning of the 15th century, tales were in circulation about a paradise within a German mountain and a traveler who idles with a Sybil before heading to Rome for the Pope's forgiveness. The ""Song of Tannhäuser"" of 1515 combines moralizing with the adventures of an historical Minnesinger named Danhuser, Tanhuser, or Tannenhauser. This Minnesinger's songs told of erotic love and its opposite, holy love."
"Wagner was an insatiable reader, always on the alert for material that could be adapted to an opera. For ""Tannhäuser"", he combined elements not only from traditional tales but material from C. J. L. Lukas's ""Essay"" (1838) on the character of Tannhäuser and Ludwig Tieck's ""Faithful Eckart"" (1799). Ludwig Bechstein's ""Thuringian Legends"" (1835) included the story of the song contest. Wagner was familiar with the song contest through E. T. A. Hoffmann's ""Serapion Brothers"", Friedrich de la Motte-Fouque's drama ""The Singers Dispute in the Wartburg"" (1828), and Wagensil's ""Nuremberg Chronicle""."""
Story of the opera.
"The story is about the struggle between sacred love and profane love, and redemption (salvation) through love. The story is based on the historical character of Tannhäuser, about whom very little is known except the myths about him. It is also about the myth of Venus, but it also deals with the medieval Minnesinger (minstrel). Half of the opera takes place in a historical setting, and half takes place in the mythological Venusberg."
Criticism.
"The critics took Wagner to task for his historical inaccuracies. First, the real Tannhauser was only a boy at the supposed time of the song contest. Secondly, they regarded Wagner's Elisabeth with scorn: Wagner had made the character an amalgamation of several historical women."
Production.
"Cuts to the original were made almost immediately because the singers were not capable of understanding and thus acting their roles. The Prelude to Act 3 was cut from 155 bars to 92. In the original final scene, neither Elisabeth or Venus appeared on stage. The audience was puzzled."
"The original final scene was retained until the 13th performance in 1847. Wagner then recast the final pages to make Venus visible on stage. The Venusberg did not appear however. This new ending disturbed the audience because they were used to the older version. Wagner had also cut the pilgrim's chorus, further antagonizing the audience. Another version was made restoring the chorus."
Early productions.
"The first performance outside Dresden occurred at Weimar. This production demonstrated to small theaters that they could stage the opera. Other productions took place in Schwerin, Breslau, Prague, Wiesbaden, and other small houses. The opera played in New York in 1859. It played in London (in Italian) in 1876. In Vienna, Johann Strauss performed excerpts in 1853. The first Austrian staging occurred at Graz in 1854. Vienna mounted the opera in 1857. The opera was performed at the Vienna court opera in 1875. In 1860, the Paris Opera wanted the work in a revised version in French. Wagner made extensive revisions for Paris."

Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to vote in the presidential election to citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District electors in the Electoral college, as if it were a state. The amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961."
"According to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than the least populous state (currently Wyoming, which has three electors); thus, the district cannot have more than three electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would entitle it to only three electors. Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in every election."
Background.
"When the Constitution was ratified, the nation's capital was New York City. However, Article one, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution states:"
"Selecting the site for the new capital was a political compromise. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury and bankers, mainly from the northeast, got the Bank of the United States located in Philadelphia. In exchange, a special District of Columbia would be located on the Potomac River, closer to the southern states and controlled by Congress."
"Washington DC was founded on July 16, 1790 on a site selected by George Washington. He appointed three commissioners to prepare the city for the new government, scheduled for 1800. While this was taking place, from 1790 until 1800, the capital was Philadelphia."
"In 1800, as planned, the District of Columbia became the nation's capital. At the time the population was only about 5,000 residents. As a district and federal territory, the population did not have a local or state government. They also could not vote in federal elections."
"Passed by Congress on June 17, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961, Amendment XXIII, for the purposes of the Electoral College, treats the District of Columbia the same as if it were a state. This gives the citizens of the District the right to vote in presidential elections. The Amendment does not make the district a state, it gives the residents the same number of electors the same number as if it were a state. But, per the amendment, no more than the smallest state. The Amendment does not give district citizens any representation in Congress. Congress continues to govern the district."
Political impact.
"While the District of Columbia is considered politically neutral at the time of passage in 1961, the District swung dramatically toward the Democratic Party since. African-Americans have voted in greater numbers than they had in the 1940s and 1950s. According to the 1970 census, 71% of the Federal District was black, a dramatic jump. As a result, the District has sent its 3 electoral votes to the Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964. However, the District's electoral votes have yet to prove decisive in a presidential election. The smallest Electoral College majority won by a Democratic president since the Twenty-third Amendment's ratification was the 56 vote majority achieved by Jimmy Carter in 1976."

Election history.
Phouoibi Waron
"The Phouoibi Waron () or the Phouoibi Warol () is an old Meitei text (PuYa) written in a period between 13th and 14th century AD. It deals with the life story of the lovers of Phouoibi, the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism)."
The story in the text is a very usual product of the agriculture of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). Phouoibi is believed to be very fickle in love. She has multiple lovers. Her lovers are generally mortals. She doesn't live with anyone of them forever. She travels from place to place and makes love with many mortals. But she leaves them after some time. She lives with some of her favourite lovers for some time but she leaves them too. The nature of the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest is imagined to be fickle or tricky. This symbolises that wealth isn't a permanent property. It doesn't last long to a certain place. Devastations due to battles and natural disasters were common in ancient times. It is the reason why the paddy goddess was considered to be very irregular in bestowing her favor to the mankind.
"The Phouoibi Waron and many other PuYas reveal much about the Meitei rites and rituals of ancient times. These rites and rituals are still widely practiced by the maibas, maibis and others."

Worship as a god.
In traditional Meitei religion.
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was considered as an ancestor, later worshipped as a God. Some scholars opined that people of later generations wove mythological stories around him. However, some are of the opinion that he was a God living with the human beings and behaving like a normal human."
"According to superstitious people, Pakhangba was a demigod, appearing ""divine"" in daytime and appearing ""humanly"" in nighttime. With this, the theory of Meitei kings being of ""divine origin"" started. The identity of the historical king Pakhangba got mingled up with that of the serpentine dragon god Pakhangba of ancient Meitei mythology and religion."
In Hinduism.
"According to 's ""The Meitheis"" (1908), with the influence of Hinduism, new mythological tales tainted the identity of King Pakhangba. According to one Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was said to be born to ""Enoog Howba Chonoo"", who was said to be the wife of Babrubahana, by the end of the Dvapara Yuga (""Dapar Jug"") and by the beginning of the Kali Yuga (""Kali Jug""), which is estimated to be around the year 3435. Hindu names were given as aliases to King Pakhangba. For example, ""Jobista"" (also spelled as ""Yavista"") was given as a synonym for King Pakhangba. According to another Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was claimed as the grandson of Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) and the son of Sooprabahoo (Babruvahana's son), thereby drawing relationship with the characters in the Mahabharata."
"In the 18th century AD, the ""Vijay Panchali"" (also spelled as ""Bijoy Panchali"") composed by Shantidas Goswami, a Hindu missionary, attempting to erase the history and the culture of Manipur, projected the land of northeast India's Manipur as the Manipur of the Mahabharata and claimed Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) as the father of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, by identifying him as ""Yavistha""."
"Notably, in the year 2020, ""A Short History of Manipur"", a book written by Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh, was banned from publishing and selling by the author's own family members, because the book misleads the readers that the Manipuris are the descendants of Arjuna of the Mahabharata."
In art and culture.
"In the Kangla of Imphal, Manipur, there is an annual flag hoisting ceremony of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" organised by Nahanong Kanglei Laining Liklam (NKLL)."

"Unlike the early sauropsids, ""Hylonomus"" and its kin, ""Archaeothyris"" was relatively large, measuring head to tail. It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids (~reptiles), with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids. Its sharp teeth were all of the same shape, and it had a pair of enlarged canines, suggesting that it was a carnivore."
"""Archaeothyris"" lived in what is now Nova Scotia, about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period (Pennsylvanian). Nova Scotia at this time was a swamp, similar to today's Everglades in Florida. The 'trees' (actually giant clubmosses) were very tall. Some, such as ""Lepidodendron"", were up to tall. ""Archaeothyris"" and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor."

"In the 1950s he starred in the Alfred Hitchcock film ""Dial M for Murder"" (1954)."
"Another performance was as Oliver Barrett III (1970), in the Arthur Hiller film ""Love Story"" (1970), with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal."
Sci-fi movies.
"In early 1960, Ray Milland started much to play evil characters, in horror and sci-fi movies such as ""Panic in Year Zero!"" (1962), he also directed. ""Premature Burial"" (1962) and """" (1963), by Roger Corman, in ""Frogs"" (1972), he played a man who is attacked by a plague of mutant frogs, ""The Thing with Two Heads"" (1972), he played a doctor who had a head transplant, ""Terror in the Wax Museum"" (1973)."
Television.
"He had a long career in television, including his TV series ""Meet Mr. McNutley"" (1953–54), as Ray McNulty, and the Crime TV series ""Markham"" (1959–60), as Roy Markham a former lawyer, who works as a detective."
"He was a special guest star in ""General Electric Theater"", ""Night Gallery"", ""Columbo"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Fantasy Island"", ""The Love Boat"", ""Hart to Hart"", and many more."
Canine tooth
"Canine teeth are found in mammals. They are the eye teeth, fangs or dogteeth. They are on either side of the incisors. Their main function is to hold food firmly in order to tear it apart, and also attack and defence."
"In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence. Examples are: wolves and dogs; the cat family; walrus. Baboons and the great apes have large canines, especially the adult males. In humans they are much reduced, and sit in line with the other teeth."
Premolar
The premolar teeth of mammals are the teeth between the canines and the molars. There are at most a total of eight of them. The number is reduced in the dental formula of many species.
"As the name suggests, they are like smaller molars, and their function is to crush and grind food."
Water park
"A water park (occasionally written as ""waterpark"") is an theme park that features water play areas, such as water slides, splash pads, spraygrounds (water playgrounds), lazy rivers, or other recreational bathing, swimming, and barefooting environments. Water parks in more current states of development may also have some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider."
Evolution of water parks.
"Water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association)."
"Water parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four-season destinations-for example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort, a member of the World Water Park Association, is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the communities' destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides. A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented; e.g. Schwaben Quellen, a member of European Waterparks Association (EWA) has no water slides, but instead has many saunas, steam rooms, ""adventure showers"", and relaxation-oriented water play areas."
"From 2000's, popular water parks were disclosed by long wait line problems of attractions. To solve this problem, some water parks adapt conveyor belt to lift passengers or use water jets."
A unique feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Waterpark in northwestern Indiana features ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their massive plaza during a recent expansion.
Indoor water parks.
"The first ever indoor water park was built in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1985 at the West Edmonton Mall as part of the $1.2 billion dollar Phase III expansion. Called World Waterpark, it is over in size. It also includes one of the world's largest indoor wave pool, waterslides of varying degrees, tube rides, bungee jumping, and hot tubs."
Bill Hicks
"William 'Bill' Hicks (16 December 1961 - 26 February 1994) was an American stand-up comedian known for his controversial act which made fun of religion and politics amongst other areas. Since then, many other stand-up comedians in the United States and United Kingdom have said they have been very influenced by his work, which is still very popular today."
"Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia and raised in Houston, Texas. He died of pancreatic cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas."
Gene Wilder
"Gene Wilder (Jerome Silberman; June 11, 1933 – August 29, 2016) was an American actor, author, comedian, director and screenwriter. He was most famous for his acting work and in particular for the movies he made with Mel Brooks which include ""The Producers"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"". He also played the part of Willy Wonka in the musical movie ""Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory""."
Wilder studied Communication and Theatre Arts at the University of Iowa.
"Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10, 1956."
"An unauthorized biography of Wilder called ""Gene Wilder: Funny and Sad"" by Brian Scott Mednick was published in December 2010 by BearManor Media."
"Wilder died from Alzheimer's disease on August 29, 2016 in Stamford, Connecticut at age 83."
Exeter City F.C.
Exeter City F.C. is an English association football club currently competing in the English Football League. They were founded in 1904 and currently play at the St James Park ground.
Possibly their most famous game was when they drew 0-0 against Manchester United in an FA Cup match in 2005 at United's home ground of Old Trafford.
Die Lollipops
"Die Lollipops is a children's band which formed in Germany in the summer of 2000 under the Edelkids label, a division of a German company named Edel Music. According to the label's website, the primary intended audience for the band is German-speaking children between 4 and 10 years old."
Music.
Their music can be divided into three basic types:
Examples of famous international children's songs whose melody has been borrowed and given entirely new lyrics:
History.
"""Die"" is German for ""the"" (plural); ""Lollipops"" is a loanword from English. The most common German word for lollipop is ""Lutscher"", but Germans now also use ""Lollipop"". The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called ""die Lollipops"" and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum. Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000."
"Die Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called ""Einfach tierisch"" in March 2008, and plan to release another one called ""Immer in Bewegung"" in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus Büchner had written a song about drinking alcohol called ""Wir feiern wieder Feste"" in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus &amp; Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus."
"Due to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com."
Water opossum
"The water opossum (""Chironectes minimus"") is also known as the yapok. It is an aquatic marsupial and a member of the opossum family. It has black and grey waterproof fur and webbed hind feet. It is ""the only living marsupial where both sexes have a backward-pointing pouch""."
"The animal is found in the freshwater streams and lakes in Mexico, Central and South America. The water opossum lives in bankside burrows. It comes out after dusk to search for fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, which it eats on the bank."
The yapok's webbed back feet helps it chase its prey in the water.
Blazing Saddles
"Blazing Saddles is a 1974 comedy western movie directed by Mel Brooks starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder and Harvey Korman. It tells the story of a black Sheriff, played by Little, who is appointed Sheriff of a small Western town and how he must try to make friends with the racist towns people and stop a ruthless businessman from knocking down the town to make way for a railway line."
"Then in 627, Abu Sufyan led the Quraysh and its allies to attack Medina itself. However, they could not pass the trench that the Muslims had dug around Medina. After several weeks, the coalition broke up and went home. The Medinians were considered victors."
The truce with Mecca.
"After the pagans of Mecca failed to gain control of Medina, the Muslims became stronger. The pagans then decided to sign a truce with the Muslims. This means that they would not fight each other for ten years. The Muslims used this as a chance to talk to other people all over Arabia. In three years, many people changed their religions to Islam."
"But, this truce did not last for long. After three years of it, a small group of horsemen from Mecca attacked a Muslim camp and killed a few of them. The Muslims in Medina heard of this, and the truce was canceled. Abu Sufyan, the third leader of Mecca in Muhammad's lifetime, tried to resume the truce, but Muhammad politely refused the offer. Muhammad told his followers to be ready to capture Mecca. After Mecca was captured, they went on to capture the Torkan."
The capture of Mecca.
"In 630, most people in Arabia had become Muslims, and they became part of Muhammad's large army to capture Mecca. Because of the big size of the army, the people of Mecca were afraid to fight back. Abu Sufyan, who was feeling unhappy over the broken truce, went to Muhammad's camp outside Mecca to ask for forgiveness. Muhammad did not say that he would forgive him, so he returned home. While he was with Muhammad, he changed his religion to Islam by saying the Testimony (ash-Ashaada):"
"""I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."""
"The next day, the Muslim army walked towards Mecca. Everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Ka'aba, believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal ibn Ribah, a former Ethiopian slave, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""
"Abu Sufyan heard this in his home. From this, he learns that Muhammad forgave him. At that time, Muhammad and his followers removed and broke all idols from the Kaaba. The idols were statues that were worshiped as gods. Muhammad forgave all citizens of Mecca. In the end, Bilal climbed to the top of the Kaaba and called for prayer. This was Muhammad's victory in spreading Islam all over Arabia. But, because he was old, he would not live for long."
His death.
"In 632 AD, on June 8, Muhammad became very sick. Before he died, he told his followers about his death. He is buried in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina, where the Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) is. In Medina, his friend Abu Bakr went to the Masjid al-Nabawi and shouted to the people:"
"""If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah(SWT) (God), let it be known that Allah(SWT) (God) is alive and cannot die."""
"Although Muhammad died, Islam soon spread all over the Middle East. Then, centuries later, it continued till it reached Africa, Asia and Europe. Islam has become one of the world's biggest and fastest-growing religions."
Relations.
"When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with ""Peace and Blessings be upon him"" (Arabic: ""sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam""). For example, ""Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him)"". In printed matter, a calligraphic symbol is frequently used instead of printing the phrase. Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr succeeded Muhammad. Shias believe that Ali should have succeeded."
Legacy.
Images of Muhammad.
"Most Muslims do not make or show images of Muhammad. The Qur'an does not state that images of Muhammad must not ever be made, but it does contain passages that forbid the creation of idols. There are also passages against the creation of images of God in the Hadith. Muslims, especially Sunni Muslims, believe there should be no pictures of Muhammad. When people create images of Muhammad, some Muslims may view this as disrespectful, offensive, and emotionally injurious."
"In 2005, a Danish newspaper published political cartoons of Muhammad. More than 100 people died during the ensuing demonstrations. Johan Galtung, a Norwegian mathematician and peace activist, tried to help both sides come together and talk about this. According to Galtung, the attacks against Danish institutions ended after the government had invited talks."
"On 7th January 2015 the Kouachi brothers, hooded and armed with Kalashnikovs, burst into the editorial meeting of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, shooting at the assembled people. They killed cartoonists Cabu, Charb, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski, psychoanalyst Elsa Cayat, economist Bernard Maris, proof-reader Mustapha Ourrad, police officer Frank Brinsolaro who was protecting Charb, Michel Renaud, founder of the Rendez-vous du Carnet de voyage festival invited to the meeting, and caretaker Frédéric Boisseau. They also seriously wounded cartoonist Riss, journalists Philippe Lançon and Fabrice Nicolino, and webmaster Simon Fieschi."
"As they left the building, just before killing policeman Ahmed Merabet who was lying on the pavement wounded and begging for mercy, the terrorists shouted: “We’ve avenged the prophet, Muhammad”."
"In addition, the following murders have been officially linked to the Charlie Hebdo massacre: Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, a policewoman was killed in the suburb of Montrouge. Four people were taken hostage at a supermarket in the east of Paris. These were Yohan Cohen, 20, who worked at the supermarket, Philippe Braham, 45, a business manager for an IT firm, Yoav Hattab, 21, a student and the youngest supermarket victim, Francois-Michel Saada, 64, was a former pension fund manager."
"Amedy Coulibaly, 32, the hostage-taker in the supermarket, has also been linked by Paris prosecutors to the shooting and wounding of a 32-year-old jogger in a park in south-west Paris, on the day of the Charlie Hebdo attack."
Wives.
A list of his wives' names in chronological order
Khadijah bint Khuwaylid.
"Abdullah ibn Jafar reported that he heard Sayyiduna Ali saying in Kufa that Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""The best of the women of her time was Maryam, daughter of Imran, and the best of women of her time was Khadijah, daughter of Khuwaylid."" She was 40 years old when they got married."
Sawda bint Zamʿa.
Sawda bint Zam'a was the first woman to immigrate to Abyssinia in the way of Allah.
Aisha.
"Aisha was a young girl. She is described as very intelligent with a very good memory. Aisha spent the next nine years of her life with Muhammad, she remembered all that she saw and heard with great clarity, and reported a lot of Muhammad's narrations. She married Muhammad when she was nine years old."
Hafsa bint Umar.
Matthew Flinders (16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer. He was the leader of the first circumnavigation of Australia and identified it as a continent.
"Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree."
"Heading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie."
"Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, ""A Voyage to Terra Australis""."
Induction coil
"An induction coil or ""spark coil"" is a type of electrical transformer. It is used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter."
"The induction coil was the first type of transformer. It was widely used in X-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Today its only common use is for ignition coils in internal combustion engines and in physics education to demonstrate induction."
Frodsham
"Frodsham is a small market town in the county of Cheshire in the north west of England, north west of Chester, on the River Weaver, and overlooking the River Mersey estuary."
"The town is of Saxon origin, its 11th century church is mentioned in the Domesday Book. When a salt refinery was opened in 1964, salt was brought by river from Northwich."
Great Western main line
"The Great Western main line is a main line railway in England, that runs westwards from London Paddington to . It opened in 1841 and was the original route of the old Great Western Railway. In 1948 it became the Western Region of British Railways. It is now part of the national rail system managed by Network Rail."
Electrification.
"The line was electrified from Paddington to Heathrow Airport in the late 1990s. Work to electrify the rest of the route started in 2011. The aim was to complete the work all the way to Bristol by 2016. Parts of the programme have been deferred because costs have tripled. The four sections deferred are: Didcot to Oxford, Bristol Parkway to Bristol Temple Meads, Royal Wootton Bassett Junction to Bristol Temple Meads and the Thames Valley branches to Henley-on-Thames and Windsor."

"In the late 1950s, Banco Galicia launched the capital investment fund FIMA Acciones and founded the predecessor of the asset manager Galicia Asset Managment."
"As part of its growth strategy, Banco Galicia began to expand into rural areas in the interior of the country, where it was believed that there was high growth potential. Access to financial services in the interior was limited compared to Buenos Aires and its surroundings, and its population used fewer banking services."
"In 1979, it launched the first ATM network in the country, together with 4 of the main banks in the financial system. In order to expand its network throughout Argentina, in 1986 Banco Galicia offered to open 13 branches with ATMs in the province of Santiago del Estero in exchange for placing the Bank's characteristic symbol on the province's flag, as well as It is how today the cross of Santiago can be seen on the provincial flag."

Gustave Courbet
Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. His paintings made social comment on the world around him.
"Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters."
Early life.
"Courbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting."
"When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life."
"In 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did. He did not want to paint scenes from literature, history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time.83"
Success.
"Courbet painted a large picture of everday-life at Ornans. The painting, called ""After Dinner at Ornans"", shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table, which is perhaps in an inn. One man is playing his violin, one man is lighting his pipe. Courbet sits listening, with his head leaning on his hand. A large dog is curled under a chair. Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. It was a great success. It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government.32 Because of the gold medal, Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first. This rule was changed in 1857.55 Courbet's work, and the work of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as ""Realism"". Like the Dutch painters he admired, Courbet often painted in broad, rough brush strokes. He often used dark earthy colours, particularly brown, in his paintings."
"""Stone Breakers""."
"In 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside, using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel. One was an old man and the other was a young boy. Courbet painted a picture of this scene. He explained it to a friend ""It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning."""
The picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted. It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden.31
"""A Burial at Ornans""."
"Courbet's other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village. Beginning in 1849, he painted the funeral of his great-uncle who had died the previous year. Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him, one by one, until the painting was complete. The painting was very large, 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters). The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way. David's picture was of the ""Coronation of Napoleon"" and showed all the people who were present."
"Some people praised ""The Funeral at Ornans"" but other people were very angry about it. They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting, as if he was as important as an emperor. They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village, with their old clothes and dirty boots, as if they were all as important as lords and ladies.4 Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness. Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting. Courbet said: ""The Burial at Ornans was ... the burial of Romanticism."""
"Courbet became a celebrity. (He became famous and written about in the newspapers- like a film star.) People said he was a genius, a ""terrible socialist"", and a ""savage"".8"
Courbet wrote to a friend in 1850:
"During the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as ""Village Damsels"" (1852), the ""Wrestlers"" (1853), ""Bathers"" (1853), ""The Sleeping Spinner"" (1853), and ""The Wheat Sifters"" (1854)."
"""The Artist's Studio""."
"Courbet then painted another huge picture. This painting is called ""The Artist's Studio"" and is about seven years in his life as a painter. He shows himself at the centre of the picture, working on a large landscape painting. Behind him is an artists' model, who is naked. All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village. His mother stands to one side of the picture. Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby. A little boy watches the artist, while a white cat plays on the floor."
"In 1855 Coubet took this picture, with ""Burial at Ornan"" and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called ""Exposition Universelle"". The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room. Courbet was angry. He had his own building put up, and showed forty of his paintings.52 Many other artists praised Courbet, but some people laughed at him, and the public did not buy very many of his pictures.84 Because of what he had done, younger artists heard about him and admired him. These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as Édouard Manet in France."
Later life.
In 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition. One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris. Many people came to the exhibition. The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses.52
"For the rest of his life, Courbet painted erotic pictures like the picture of the prostitutes, and also many more hunting scenes. His last erotic painting was called ""The Origin of the World"" and was a close-up painting of female genitals. This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988. He also painted many landscapes, which he began by doing outdoor sketches, then made into large paintings in his studio. By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France. The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Légion d'honneur which was the highest honour in France, but Courbet refused to accept it. He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people, not to the high and mighty."
"At this time, there were many political problems in France. Courbet became involved in the political problems. In 1871, he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendôme Column had been demolished. He was put in prison for six months. In 1873, the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back. He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland. The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10,000 francs for 33 years. Courbet died at La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, on 31 December 1877, one day before the first payment was due. He was 58 and died of liver disease, made worse by heavy drinking."

"On 22 April 1834, the island of St Helena became a colony of the British crown."
"A local industry using the fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully reestablished in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War. However, the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres and the last flax industry closed in 1965."
"In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938."
1981 to present.
"In 1981, the British governmente changed the status of Saint Helena and the other Crown colonies to ""British Dependent Territories""."
"In 2009, Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution, and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha."
"Geography, plants and animals."
"The island of Saint Helena has a total area of . The centre is covered by forest, of which some has been planted. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena Plover or Wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the islets near the coast."
"The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak () at . In 1996 it became the island's first national park. In 2000 a project began to replant part of the lost Great Wood, called the Millennium Forest, and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust, established in 2002."
"There are several rocks and islets off the coast, including: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast), all of which are within one kilometre of the shore."
"The national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena Plover, known locally as the Wirebird. It appears on the coat of arms of Saint Helena and on the flag."
Climate.
"The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by trade winds that blow almost continuously."
Administrative divisions.
"Saint Helena is divided into eight districts. People that works and lives in the Jamestown Harbour and in the Royal Mail Ship ""St. Helena"" (RMS) are included in the census in their work places (see reference)."
Economy.
"The island had an economy of only one crop until 1966, based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string. St Helena's economy is now weak, and is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government."
The tourist industry is heavily based on the presence of Napoleon in the island.
"Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world. It also produces and exports ""Tungi Spirit"", made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears, ""Opuntia ficus-indica"" (""Tungi"" is the local St Helenian name for the plant). Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income."
Banking and currency.
"Saint Helena has its own currency, the Saint Helena pound, which is at parity with the pound sterling. The government of Saint Helena produces coins and banknotes. The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena, and in Georgetown, Ascension Island."
Helicopter
A helicopter (also often used: chopper or heli) is a kind of flying machine or aircraft. A helicopter lifts up off
"of the ground and moves because of its rotors. A rotor is several small wings, called rotor blades, that spin together around a shaft. For that reason, helicopters are sometimes called ""rotary-wing aircraft"". A helicopter flies differently from an airplane. An airplane must move forward to stay in the air, but because the helicopter's rotor blades are always moving, the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground. Not needing a runway, they can land in places where an airplane cannot. Helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades, which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted."
History.
"Since around 400 BC, the Chinese had a flying top that was used as a children's toy. The flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air. Later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick. Leonardo da Vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in 1490, and drew pictures of his ideas. It was hundreds of years later (in the early 20th century) before anyone built one that could really fly. The first practical helicopters were built by Frenchman Louis Breguet in 1935 and by German Henrich Focke in 1936. A Russian immigrant, Igor Sikorsky, built and perfected the first practical helicopter in America in 1939."
Uses.
"Helicopters are especially useful when there are disasters when infrastructure is damaged. Food packets, water, medicines and clothes are dropped from the air to people on the ground who cannot be reached by road. When people are injured, helicopters can carry them to hospitals faster than an ambulance on the road."
"Helicopters are also used by the military, because they can move troops and equipment to places an airplane cannot take them. Attack helicopters act as attack aircraft carrying and shooting guns and missiles."
Training helicopter is used for learning how to be a helicopter pilot.
"Taipei 101 has some of the most modern safety security of anything ever built, requiring a challenging combination of strength and flexibility, which allow it to withstand winds up to 216 km/h (134 mph), and earthquakes of a magnitude of 9.0. It has higher safer ratings than Taiwan’s nuclear power plants."
"The ""double stairstep"" design reduce the potentially dangerous oscillations caused by high winds by about 30-40%, allowing the structure to stand, even under the force of relentless typhoons. And by now, they’ve become a recognizable design element of the structure."
September 1
"This day is the first day of the last third of the year as well as the two thirds point of the common year because there are 243 days before and 121 days after it in common years. There are 244 days before and 121 after it in leap years. The exact time the second third of the year starts is 8:00 a.m. In countries that use summer time the actual exact time of the midpoint in a common year is at 9:00 a.m. for locations in the northern hemisphere, or 7:00 a.m. for locations in the southern hemisphere; this is when 243 days and 8 hours have elapsed and there are 121 days and 16 hours remaining. In a leap year in those countries, the last third of the year starts at midnight. In countries that use summer time, the second third starts at 1:00 a.m. on September, or 11:00 p.m. on August 31 in the southern hemisphere. This is due to summer time having advanced the time by one hour."
Sergio Aragonés
"Sergio Aragonés Domenech (; born September 6, 1937) is a popular cartoonist. He was born in Spain and grew up in Mexico. He is most famous for his cartoons for ""MAD Magazine"" and the comic book ""Groo the Wanderer""."

Tobacco
"Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus ""Nicotiana"" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family."
History.
"Native Americans used tobacco before Europeans arrived in the Americas. The earliest know use of tobacco comes from nicotine residue from a pipe in the Southeastern United States. It is Radiocarbon dated at 1685-1530 BC. Europeans in the Americas learned to smoke and brought it back to Europe, where it became very popular. At that time tobacco was usually smoked in a pipe."
"The Europeans who moved to America started to farm tobacco so that they could sell it in Europe. This became one of the main causes of the African slave trade. In 1610 a European man called John Rolfe arrived in the American state of Virginia and set up a tobacco farm which made him very rich. Rolfe was the first non-native farmer to use ""nicotiana tabacum"", which is the type of tobacco most commonly smoked today. He also married Pocahontas, a Native American woman who became famous when she went to live in London."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries tobacco made farmers very rich and towns quickly grew in the states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1883 one third of United States tax money came from tobacco."
In 1864 the first American tobacco factory opened to produce 20 million cigarettes annually. By 1964 the cigarette contained over 500 added chemicals. Today tobacco manufacturers are still not required by law to list the 500+ ingredients.
Tobacco and health.
"Tobacco users (especially smokers) and people around them (with passive smoking) risk many very serious and often deadly illnesses, such as cancer, strokes, heart disease, and lung disease. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes tobacco use as ""the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature (early) death worldwide"". There are over 4800 chemicals in tobacco, including arsenic. Sixty-four of them are known to cause cancer. Smoking can also make men lose erections, and make their penises a bit smaller."
Jerusalem
"Jerusalem (; ; ) is one of the oldest cities in the world that people have lived in continuously. It is important to many major religions. Jews consider Jerusalem a holy city because it was their religious and political center during Biblical times and was the place where the Temple of God stood. Christians consider Jerusalem holy because many events in the life of Jesus took place there. Muslims believe that Muhammad rose to heaven from Jerusalem, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the first Qibla of Muslims after Mecca."
"Jerusalem is the capital city of both Israel and Palestine, under their laws. Most other countries disagree. Most countries have their embassies with Israel in Tel Aviv."
Jerusalem is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a hilly city with many valleys around it.
History.
"Jerusalem is a very old city. It has great importance for three religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Bible says King David, the second king of Israel, took this city from pagans and settled his palace there. King Solomon, David's son and the next king, built the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Later, as capital of Judah, Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, the king of Babylon. The Palace of King David and the Temple of Solomon were burned, and the Jews were captured and taken to Babylon. Seventy years later, the Persian King Cyrus allowed them to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple."
"Later the area was occupied by Romans. King Herod the Great, who ruled for the Roman Emperor, made the Temple larger to try and win Jewish favor. The Temple was famous for its greatness and beauty."
"Jesus died in Jerusalem around 33 CE. In 70 CE, the Jews rebelled against the Romans, but the Romans destroyed the city and the Temple. Jewish people who lived in Jerusalem were caught and became slaves. The Romans renamed Jerusalem with a Latin name. Since then, the Temple has not been rebuilt, and only a part of its wall remains until today."
"After the Roman Empire was split into two, the Byzantine Empire ruled Jerusalem. Later, Muslims took over the city from them. The Muslims believed Muhammad went to heaven from Jerusalem."
"Later, the Pope in Rome sent the Crusaders from Western Europe to try and take Jerusalem back. They succeeded for a while, but eventually the city fell again to the Saracens. Until the 20th century, Jerusalem was a part of the Ottoman Empire. There were some Jews in Jerusalem all along, even though they were ruled by other people."
"Filming took place in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas from May to October 1996. Nava posted fliers in Texas asking Selena fans to attend the Houston Astrodome scene. News of this event spread throughout the United States and Mexico. Over 35,000 people attended, some coming from as far as Japan and South America. It took over 3 hours to put makeup on everyone who attended. Producing the Astrodome scene cost about $2 million. The budget of the movie was $20 million."
"The movie's trailer was released worldwide in December 1996. Nava spent $1 million on promotions for ""Selena""."
Music.
"The soundtrack of the movie was released on March 11, 1997 by EMI Latin. The soundtrack included two songs that Selena did not release when she was alive: ""Is It the Beat?"" and ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"". It included two medleys — ""Disco Medley"" and the ""Cumbia Medley"". They are live versions Selena sang during her Houston Astrodome concert. Two tribute songs were also in the album. ""Viviras Selena"" includes Tejano singers and the Barrio Boyzz. ""One More Time"", which was composed by Olmos is performed by Lil'Ray. The ""Oldies Medley"" was performed by the Vidal Brothers. The soundtrack reached at number seven on the US ""Billboard"" 200 chart and number 36 on Canada's ""RPM"". It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album was produced by Selena's brother, Quintanilla III."
"Chuck Eddy of ""Entertainment Weekly"" gave the soundtrack an ""A"" rating and stated that the soundtrack had everything a ""right posthumous"" album should have. Eddy also stated that listening to the album reveals why Selena's death impacted many Americans. Enrique Lopetegui of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that ""One More Time"" was a ""corny but effective"" tribute to Selena. Lopetegui commented that ""Viviras Selena"" was the ""weakest track"" of the album and that ""Is It the Beat?"" was one of the ""best songs"" of ""Selena"". He believed that ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"" was one of the ""strongest"". Lopetegui also stated that ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"" was similar to ""Vision of Love"" which was recorded by Mariah Carey. Lopetegui compared ""Is It the Beat?"" to the song ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" by Whitney Houston, which had similar beats and sounds. A ""Miami Herald"" writer believed the soundtrack was ""uneven"" and stated that Selena's unreleased recordings ""outshines"" the rest of the songs on the album. A score was released in the summer of 1997 and had music by Dave Grusin."
Release and reception.
"Before the movie was released, Selena fans were not happy that a Puerto Rican would play the part of a Mexican American singer. Many fans changed their views on Lopez after the Houston Astrodome scene was done filming. The movie opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide. ""Selena"" was released on March 21, 1997, and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest debut for that week. It grossed $15,599,598 during its first week and became the number-one movie for that week. The next week, the movie grossed $24,285,142. In total, ""Selena"" grossed $35,281,794. It became the first and only movie directed by Nava to reach the 30 millionth mark.

She became very popular after the movie was released. ""Selena"" was released on VHS and DVD in fall 1997. On September 18, 2007, Warner Bros. released a 10th anniversary of the movie. It featured unreleased ""behind the scenes"" and extras."
"The movie had mostly positive feedback from critics. Enrique Fernandez of the ""Sun Sentinel"" wrote that Nava did a great job in ""catching the audience"" with ""Selena"". Fernandez also stated that Lopez had a ""terrific characterization"" of Selena. Steve Persall of the ""St. Petersburg Times"" believed that Nava did not do a good job in retelling Selena's murder. Persall believed Nava was under pressure by Selena's family and fans to tell a more ""fairy tale"" movie then a ""real life event"". Daisann McLane of ""Sun Sentinel"" agreed that the movie was more of a ""fairy tale"" and that ""the movie is the family's version of the story"". McLane believed that ""Selena"" ""lie[d]"" about Selena's ""real life"". Stuart Elliott of ""Austin American-Statesmen"" wrote that ""Selena"" became a ""breakthrough success"" in Selena's career. Elliott believed that Nava had ""perfect[ed]"" every scene and that female Hispanics in America can relate to the conflicts and the climax of the story."

Development.
"After years of rumors and speculation, the game was confirmed to be in development at E3 2013. Director Tetsuya Nomura said that the game will finish the ""Xehanort Saga"" but that it would not be the final game in the series."
"In a June 2013 interview with ""Famitsu"", Nomura discussed the visuals that were seen in the teaser trailer. He said that they tried to remember that the ""Kingdom Hearts characters were originally paintbrush art from Disney productions, a texture that was one of our original aims, and that it was time to return to that. So [chief creative director Takeshi] Nozue went through a series of tests, and the results are the visuals that we refer to in the team as the Kingdom Shader. It may look like a pretty drastic change, but I see it as a rich evolution of everything we've shown you up to now."" In September 2013, producer Shinji Hashimoto said that since both ""Kingdom Hearts III"" and ""Final Fantasy XV"" are being directed by Nomura, there would be a big gap between the release of the two games, ""as [they] want each game to be perfect in terms of quality."" Hashimoto repeated Nomura's statements about the game's announcement at E3 2013, and said that ""the company thought it was about time it addressed speculation about the long-awaited conclusion to the trilogy."" In October 2013, Teruzane Utada, the father of singer Hikaru Utada, said that Hikaru would once again be involved in the theme song, as she did with ""Kingdom Hearts"" and ""Kingdom Hearts II"". He later stated that it is still undecided on their involvement. In January 2014, actor Haley Joel Osment, the English voice of Sora in the series, said that he was in talks with the development team after the announcement and said that since dialogue was one of the last parts of the process, he believed he would not begin recording until mid-2014 at the earliest."
Controversy.
"After the announcement of SQUARE ENIX that there would be no French Spanish and German voice (present in the 1 and 2) European fans launched the movement # EUDubbingForKH3 which aims to change his opinion SE and he includes (real) German and Spanish French voice through petition, letter etc."
Watchman
"Watchmen were groups of men who discouraged crime and enforced the law. They were usually authorised by the state or government. Watchmen have existed in many places around the world throughout history. Today, the job of law enforcement has generally been taken over by organised police."
An early reference to a watch can be found in the Bible. Ezekiel says that it was the watchmen's duty to sound the alarm to warn the people that they were under attack (Ezekiel 33:1-6). The Roman Empire turned the role of a watchman into a profession. The Vigiles was the city watch in Rome. It was the city's police force.
"In England, the Ordinance of 1233 required the appointment of watchmen. The Assize of Arms of 1252 and the Statute of Winchester of 1285 are considered among the earliest examples of a police in England. The Assize of Arms required that constables be appointed to call men to fight when the town was under attack. It also required them to stop disturbances of the peace, and to take criminals to the sheriff. By 1415, a watch was appointed to the Parliament of England. King Henry VII appointed a watch for his house, the Tower of London, in 1485. These watchmen became known as the Beefeaters."
SpaceShipOne
"SpaceShipOne is a vehicle built to travel to the lower limits of outer space. It completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004. That same year, it won the US$10 million Ansari X Prize and has not flown since winning. It was carried high into the air by a specially designed plane named ""White Knight"". Both vehicles were built and flown by Mojave Aerospace Ventures. This was a joint project between Paul Allen and Scaled Composites, Burt Rutan's flying machine company. Allen provided the money to build and fly SpaceShipOne, about US$25 million."
"Rutan has said that ideas about the project began as early as 1994. The full-time work towards the 2004 accomplishments took about three years. The vehicle first flew faster than the speed of sound on December 17, 2003. This date was also the one-hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers' historic first powered flight. SpaceShipOne's first official spaceflight, was piloted by Mike Melvill. A few days before that flight, the Mojave Air and Space Port was the first commercial spaceport licensed in the United States. A few hours after that flight, Melvill became the first licensed U.S. commercial astronaut. The overall project name was ""Tier One"". It has evolved into Tier 1b with a goal of taking a new, but similar ship's first paying passengers into space within the next few years."
"Caracas is the capital city of Venezuela. Santiago de Leòn de Losada founded the city in 1567. It is where Simon Bolivar was born. The city has nearly 6 million people, who live in the metropolitan area. Caracas is the center of the economical activity of the country and also hosts the main government offices of Venezuela."
"After WW2 the city has experienced a huge growth, thanks to the oil revenues of the country. Nearly half a million Europeans immigrated to the city in the 1950s ( that had in those years only one million inhabitants) and so Caracas developed a typical western-European look in the new modern areas."
Sports.
All the best teams of the sports done in Venezuela are concentrated in the metropolitan area of Caracas. Between those teams we have:
Buildings.
Many beautiful modern buildings can be seen in the city. Here there are some of them:
Homestar Runner
"Homestar Runner, also called H*R, is an Internet surreal comedy cartoon that was made using Adobe Flash. It usually gets updated every Monday (but, except for an update on April Fools' Day of 2014 and a few cartoons since, it has not been actively updated since December 2010) with a cartoon, a game, or a Strong Bad Email. The people that made the website are Mike Chapman and Matt Chapman. They are brothers and are called The Brothers Chaps. The cartoons on the website normally show Homestar Runner or Strong Bad, who are the main characters on the cartoon."
Video games.
"Telltale Games, the makers of video games based on the Sam &amp; Max comic book, made a game called ""Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People"" for Windows and the Wii's WiiWare. It's an episodic game with five episodes, and it is made with 3 dimensions instead of 2 dimensions like Homestar Runner is. The first episode was called ""Homestar Ruiner"", and ended with ""8-Bit is Enough""."
Horst Köhler
"Horst Köhler (born 22 February 1943) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union. He was President of Germany from 2004 to 2010. He was the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the CDU and the CSU, and the liberal FDP, for becoming president. Köhler was elected to his first five-year term by the Federal Assembly on 23 May 2004. He was reelected to a second term on 23 May 2009. About one year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the Bundeswehr in light of a visit to the troops in Afghanistan."
"Köhler is an economist by profession. Prior to his election as president, Köhler had a career in politics, the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1998 to 2000. He also served as the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2000 to 2004."
"Although the office of President is less influential than that of the Chancellor and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician during his term. He has called for more influence for the President and has suggested the President should be directly elected. This was the case under Germany's Weimar Constitution."
Early life.
"Köhler was born in Skierbieszów (later named Heidenstein), in the General Government area of German-occupied Poland. He was the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler. His family were Bessarabian Germans from Rîşcani in Romanian Bessarabia (near Bălţi, present-day Moldova). Horst Köhler's parents had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940. As part of the Generalplan Ost, they were resettled in 1942 at Skierbieszów. This was a village near Zamość, Poland (then part of the General Government). When the Wehrmacht was pushed back during World War Two, the Köhler family fled to Leipzig. In 1953, they left the Soviet Zone to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in refugee camps until 1957. Then, they settled in Ludwigsburg. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee."
Studies and military service.
"A teacher proposed that the refugee boy should apply for the Gymnasium. Köhler took his ""Abitur"" in 1963. After a two-year military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen, he left the Bundeswehr as reserve officer. He studied and finally earned a doctorate in economics and political sciences from University of Tübingen. There, he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976."
Career in the civil service.
"Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellery of the state government in Schleswig-Holstein. He served there under Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. In 1982, Köhler was made head of the Ministers office in the Federal Ministry of Finance.

Domitian
"Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus, 24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was a Roman emperor who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death in AD 96."
Biography.
"Domitian was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 and 96, This included the reigns of Domitian's father Vespasian (69–79), his elder brother Titus (79–81), and that of Domitian himself."
"When Titus died (he was struck down by a fatal illness in 81), the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius."
"As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome."
"Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus."
"Domitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, as an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate."
"Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant."
"Modern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century."

"In classical antiquity, the river was known as the ""Ōxus"" in Latin and Ὦξος ""Oxos"" in Greek."
"The name ""Amu"" is said to have come from the medieval city of ""Āmul"", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as ""Türkmenabat""), in modern Turkmenistan. ""Darya"" is the Persian word for ""river""."
"Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse. It gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of Afghanistan's ""Wakhan Corridor"", and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of Turkmenistan's"" Kyzyl Kum"" desert instead of the inland Aral Sea as it did in former times."
In hadith.
"In the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (Arabic form of its ancient name Gozan)."
As the river Jayhan.
"Historians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Jayhan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghanastan historians. ."
Description.
"The river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D."
"Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the Caspian Sea (from the east) or both, similar to the ""Syr Darya"" (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek)."
Watershed.
"About of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea endorheic basin. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of western Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan."
"Of the area drained by the Amu Darya, only about actively contribute water to the river."
"This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the ""Zeravshan River"") have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying desert and steppe."
"The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and ""Tian Shan"","
"which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about ."
History.
The Amu Darya is (also theJayhan river)
"was called the ""Oxus"" by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river Jayhan was regarded as the boundary between Irān and Tūrān. The river Jayhan drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Jayhan river northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea."
"It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian."
"People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities."
"The first British explorer who reached the region was a naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Viné collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862."
"The Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was never built."
Literature.
"The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, provide a literary background for the 1930s children's book The Far-Distant Oxus."
Founding Fathers of the United States
"The Founding Fathers refers to certain men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era. These men signed the Declaration of Independence, either helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term ""Founding Fathers"" was first used for these people in 1916."
"There were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison."
"Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. Most of them owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government. Five of them, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, were later elected president of the United States."

Gifted education
Gifted education is a term for special ways to educate (teach) children who have been identified as gifted. There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on.
"Gifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427–c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage."
"In 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word ""gifted,"" describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An ""aptitude"" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. ""Competence"" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10 percent of the population."

Maurice Yaméogo
"Maurice Yaméogo (31 December 1921 – 15 September 1993) was the first President of the Republic of Upper Volta, now called Burkina Faso, from 1959 until 1966."
Biography.
"""Monsieur Maurice"" incarnated the Voltaic state at the time of independence. As a member of the colonial administration, Maurice Yaméogo began his career in 1946 in the dense political landscape of Upper Volta thanks to his oratory skills. In May 1957, as part of the formation of the first Volta Government established by the framework law Defferre, he joined the coalition government formed by Ouezzin Coulibaly, as Minister of Agriculture under the label of the Movement Voltaic Democratic (MDV) . In January 1958, threatened by a motion of censure, Ouezzin Coulibaly debauched in favor of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) Maurice Yaméogo and his allies at the assembly against the insurance of a promotion in the government. Maurice Yaméogo thus raises No. 2 of the government with the portfolio of the Interior, a key position that allows him when in September 1958 Ouezzin Coulibaly dies, to act as interim head of government."
"Maurice Yaméogo quickly imposes his choices. After the proclamation of the Republic on December 11, 1958, it operates in 1959 a surprising reversal of position vis-à-vis the proposed Federation of Mali defended by Léopold Sédar Senghor. Although the Voltaic constituent assembly wanted Haute-Volta to join the Federation, Maurice Yaméogo opted for international sovereignty and regional integration limited to the economic sphere with the Entente Council. Then Yaméogo neutralizes any parliamentary opposition. The UDV-RDA purified of its adversaries, imposes in single party. Upper Volta is even before independence, on August 5, 1960, under the yoke of his dictatorship."
"In foreign politics, jealous and admiring of the international success of his Ivorian colleague Félix Houphouët-Boigny, he challenged him by establishing an ephemeral customs union (1961-1962) with the very progressive Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah. Houphouët-Boigny quickly became his best ally in December 1965. Yaméogo signed with him an agreement to establish dual citizenship for Ivorian and Voltaic nationals. This project does not have time to succeed. On January 3, 1966, in a context of severe financial austerity measures, his corrupt regime was overthrown by a peaceful demonstration organized by the forces of the Voltaic nation: the unions, the so-called traditional chieftaincy and the clergy. The result is Maurice Yaméogo, an austerity linked to his dubious management of finances. In 1993, he died after being rehabilitated by the President of the Republic Blaise Compaore."

Don McCarthy
"Donald McCarthy, CBE (19 June 1955 – 21 July 2018) was a British entrepreneur and philanthropist. He was known for being the chairman of House of Fraser from 2006 to 2014. From 2007 until 2012 McCarthy also was chairman of Aurum, a British watch and jewellery retailer."
"After Muhammad died in 632, a new head of the state, called caliph, was named: Abu Bakr. He was the first of the four caliphs whose caliphate was called that of the Rashidun, which means 'rightly guided.' After dealing with the Ridda wars, wars against rebellious tribes who rebelled after Muhammad's death, he started to campaign against the Byzantines. Abu Bakr himself did not live to see the results of his initiative after suffering a natural death in 634. But his successors sure did."
"Umar was the second caliph and managed to lead the Muslims to conquer Roman Egypt and even expand to present day Libya in the west. All the way to eventually the Indus River in the east after conquering the Sassanid Empire. Eventually in 644 it was neither the past famines or plagues that killed Umar, but a Persian slave."
"Uthman ibn Affan followed Umar as a caliph and ruled the longest of the four caliphs. In his twelve years of rule he standardized the Qur'an, spread the empire westwards to the Maghreb and even a part of Spain and eastward further into Central Asia. He was also assasinated which lead to Ali ibn Abi Talib being the fourth Sunni caliph and the first Shia imam."
The Umayyad and Abbasid Empire.
The death and assassination of Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 gave birth to a new era where the Umayyad Caliphate thrived and continued to expand the land left by the Rashidun.
Modern history.
Wahhabism and the First Saudi State.
"After Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab got exiled from Uyaynah, he sought refuge in Diriyah, where some of his followers were residing. At that time, Muhammad bin Saud was the local chieftain of Diriyah. Two brothers and the wife of Muhammad bin Saud were followers of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab's ideology. They encouraged cooperation between Muhammad bin Saud and Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab. Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab needed military support to secure his ideology and preaching, while Muhammad bin Saud needed pastoral support. Fulfilling these needs eventually led to an alliance between the scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and the local ruler Muhammad bin Saud creating the First Saudi State, the Emirate of Diriyah."
"When Muhammad bin Saud died in 1765, his son Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud who was a dedicated student of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, became the leader of the Emirate of Diriyah. In his reign, the Emirate of Diriyah expanded in territory throughout the Arabian Peninsula. In the eastern part of the peninsula, Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud got Al-Hasa, Qatar, Al-Buraimi and Bahrain under his influence. In the western part of the Peninsula, Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud conquered parts of the Hejaz region. During the conquests of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud, the Saudi State got involved in a war with the Ottomans. At this stage, the campaigns of the Ottomans against the Saudi State failed, and Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud was expanding his territory inside Ottoman territories. With the death of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud in 1803, his son Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud became ruler. Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud conquered the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a few years, which gave him the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Eventually the Egyptians, who were supported and led by the Ottomans, destroyed the powers of Al Saud in 1818. It marked the end of the First Saudi State."
Ottoman domination.
"By 1824, the Al Saud family regained control over parts of the Nejd region. This is seen as the beginning of the Second Saudi State, the Emirate of Nejd. The Saudi ruler, Turki bin Ali, made Riyadh the capital of its state. It remains the capital of the Saudi State today. Turki bin Ali succeeded in retaking most of the lands lost to the Ottomans. In 1865 the Ottomans launched an attack on the Saudi State again. This time with help from the Al Rasheed family of Ha'il, who are another powerful family of the Nejd region. The Al Rasheed family defeated the Saudi State in 1891, which marked the end of the Second Saudi State. Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud, who was the Saudi leader at that time, retreated into the desert and eventually to Kuwait with his family."
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
"In 1902, Abdul Rahman's son Abdulaziz regained Saudi territory from the Al Rasheed family. He even regained control over Mecca and Medina from 1924 to 1925. In 1932 he declared the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as it is known till today."
Boundaries.
"The discussion for Saudi Arabia to fixate definite boundaries with its neighboring countries started from 1920 onwards. It finalized its boundaries with Iraq, Jordan, and Kuwait. On borders with Iraq and Kuwait, two neutral zones were created – one with Iraq and the other one with Kuwait. In 1934, borders with Yemen were almost finalized.In 1965, Saudi Arabia gave some of its areas to Jordan, and Jordan gave some of its areas to Saudi Arabia. In 1971, the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was split between these two countries. Likewise, Saudi Arabia and Iraq decided in 1981 to split the neutral zone between them. This zone was split between the two countries in 1984."
"Still, Saudi Arabia's borders with the United Arab Emirates and Oman were not final. The border with Qatar was finalized in 2001."
Politics.
"King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud died in 1953. His son, who was named Saud, became the king. He reigned for 11 years. In 1964, he was forced to step down, and his half-brother, Faisal, became the king. Faisal had the support of the senior members of the royal family and the religious leaders. Faisal also held the post of the Prime Minister. This tradition of being both the King and the Prime Minister still continues in Saudi Arabia. All Kings after Faisal have followed this practice."
"Faisal took several new steps for economic development of Saudi Arabia. During his reign, many important political events also happened like the ones noted below:"
"In 1975, King Faisal was assassinated by one of his nephews. The nephew was found guilty, and he was sentenced to death. King Faisal's half-brother Khalid became the King and the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of King Khalid, Saudi Arabia's importance in regional politics increased. The economic growth of the country also continued at a steady rate until his death."
King Fahd's period.
"King Khalid died in 1982. After his death, Fahd became the King. At the same time, he also became the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. His half-brother Prince Abdullah became the Crown Prince."
The income of Saudi Arabia became less during King Fahd's reign. This was a result of lower price of petroleum oil. King Fahd's government used an economic policy that helped the country to survive with a lower income.
King Fahd helped Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's economy had become terrible on account of this war. The King also discussed with these two countries to stop fighting. Both countries (Iran and Iraq) stopped the fight in August 1988. The King also helped in making the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) a more vital organization. The GCC is an organization of six countries Persian Gulf. The purpose of the organization is to increase the development of and cooperation among the member countries.
Gulf War.
"In 1990, Saddam Hussain was ruling Iraq. The Gulf War of 1991 was when he invaded Kuwait. Many people thought that his army would also invade Saudi Arabia. King Fahd allowed some Western countries and the USA to send their forces to the country. Many Muslims were against that their most holy land was used by non-Muslim soldiers."
"During and after the Gulf War, King Fahd’s role was vital. During the war, he allowed the entry of the royal family of Kuwait inside Saudi Arabia and was followed by 400,000 other persons from Kuwait to stay temporarily. The King let the troops of countries like the USA mount attacks on Kuwait to liberate it. He also helped arrange support from former Muslim countries for the liberation of Kuwait. Iraqi forces were eventually ousted from Kuwait."
Terrorism.
"The presence of troops from Western countries has angered many Muslims. One of them was the rich man Osama bin Laden. He was forced to leave Saudi Arabia when he disagreed and opposed the King of Saudi Arabia. Other than Osma bin Laden and his followers, several other persons and groups did not like the presence of Western troops inside Saudi Arabia."
Those who opposed the presence of Western troops were persons and groups who attacked people. They tried mainly to attack the foreign forces in Saudi Arabia. Some examples of such attacks are given below:
"The September 11, 2001 attacks in New York had resulted into many deaths and big destruction. After enquiry, it came to light that out of 19 suspected persons for these attacks, 15 were from Saudi Arabia."
"Such things attracted the attention of the government of Saudi Arabia. The government started a policy to check such activities. Even then, terrorist activities of such persons and groups continued."

Afrikaner people
"Afrikaners are white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as mother tongue and follow the Afrikaans culture. Most of them have Dutch, German, French Huguenot, ancestors. Also known as Boere, Voortrekkers and Burgers, although under slightly different contexts. In South Africa there are about 3 million white people with Afrikaans as mother tongue, that can be assumed to be Afrikaners if they chose to follow the Afrikaans culture."
John Lennon
"John Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter. He became famous as a singer and guitarist of the English rock band The Beatles. After the Beatles stopped making records in 1970, he lived in the United States with his wife Yoko Ono. He continued his music career up until his murder."
Early life.
"John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, the son of Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon."
"He started the Beatles in his hometown of Liverpool, with Paul McCartney and George Harrison. After Ringo Starr joined the band, they started to be very successful. People were excited by their music, and their live performances always pleased audiences. Manager Brian Epstein and record producer George Martin helped the Beatles become the most popular act in entertainment."
"Lennon played the guitar, and later learned to play the piano. Most of the songs the Beatles recorded were written by Lennon and McCartney. Their songs were always credited as by ""Lennon/McCartney"" on Beatles records, but in fact they usually wrote their songs on their own. The two men often helped to make each other's songs better, so they liked to share writing credit. Famous songs written by Lennon for the Beatles are ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Help!"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""A Day In The Life"" and many others."
"The Beatles grew apart as the members got older. Lennon divorced his first wife, Cynthia Powell, and married Yoko Ono, while McCartney married Linda Eastman. Each wife had different ideas, and encouraged their husbands to depend less on each other. Later, some fans blamed Yoko and Linda for breaking the Beatles up."
"Lennon loved his wife so much that he added her surname Ono to his own name, since she became Yoko Ono Lennon when she married him. He had never liked his middle name Winston (given him by his mother after Winston Churchill) and wanted to change it, but was told he could not under British law. He could add a new name though, so he did that. He never used the name Winston again, unless he had to for legal reasons (such as when he travelled to America). Otherwise he gave his ""full name"" as John Ono Lennon."
Career and family life.
"Lennon recorded several albums and singles after the Beatles disbanded. The best-known one was ""Imagine"". He made many records with Yoko Ono. On some records they called themselves the Plastic Ono Band. Lennon and Ono worked with different musician friends, including Ringo Starr, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voormann, Harry Nilsson, Eric Clapton and Elton John. Lennon's solo music was different from his Beatles songs. He spoke more directly about his own feelings, and sometimes used harsh language or loud sounds. This upset a few fans, who wished for more Beatles music from him."
"Lennon and Ono moved to the United States in 1971, and settled in New York City. Ono had a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from an earlier husband, Anthony Cox, a filmmaker, who took her and disappeared. It was easier to look for Kyoko, and get the law's help to look, if they stayed in America. Ono and Lennon were also hurt emotionally by the way Ono was treated by many people in England. Some insulted Ono, and asked Lennon why he was with her. On the other hand, most of the people they met in America accepted them together."
"Lennon and Ono were also campaigners for peace in the world. They used Lennon's famous name to talk to the media (television, radio and newspapers) about their beliefs. Lennon and Ono were sometimes in trouble with people like politicians, who did not like the things they said. President Richard Nixon's administration even tried to deport Lennon, because of his political views."
"The two things Lennon and Ono wanted most were to live permanently in the United States, and to have a child together. Their lives were stressful in the early 1970s for several reasons. There were the problems with immigrating to the United States, and with the search for Kyoko. The public were also sometimes negative toward Ono, her music, and her ideas. The couple had several miscarriages, caused partly by the stress."
"Lennon also had business problems, because leaving the Beatles was not as simple as quitting an ordinary job. The Beatles had signed many contracts. They promised to do things in a certain way, meet deadlines, and work together, to be paid as musicians and songwriters. Many business deals had to be finished or changed, and new deals had to be made, to continue their music careers apart. This took time, and meant making many hard decisions. The four former Beatles could not always agree on what to do with the things they owned together. It took years to work out what to still own in common, what to divide up, and what to let go. The choices they had to make sometimes hurt their friendship."
"Lennon and Ono separated for over a year, from late 1973 until early 1975, because of the stress in their lives, and their relationship. Each of them dated another person (Lennon pairing off with May Pang, his and Ono's personal assistant, and Ono with guitarist David Spinozza), and they were nearly divorced. They spoke nearly every day by telephone, however, and tried to work things out. They decided that they wanted to be together more than anyone else could want them apart, and they reunited."
"When Richard Nixon faced the Watergate crisis in 1974, it became more important than pushing Lennon out of the country. The deportation case against him was dropped. Lennon won the right to stay in America in 1975. Lennon and Ono also finally had a son, Sean Lennon, that October. Father and son shared the same birthday."
"Lennon and Ono stopped making music for five years, to be able to spend more time together, and give Sean as much attention as he needed. They lived on Lennon's income from the music he already made. Ono became Lennon's business manager, and invested his money in real estate and organic farming. Her office was downstairs in the Dakota, the apartment building where they lived, so they were never far apart. Lennon became a full-time father to Sean, and he was proud to call himself a ""househusband"". They also visited Ono's family in Japan several times, and made other trips."
"In 1980 Lennon and Ono began to write new music, as Sean got old enough to begin school. They recorded a new album titled ""Double Fantasy"" that year. A single from the album, ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", was a hit, and people welcomed Lennon back. Even people who had not liked Ono earlier now respected her, and more of them began to like her music. Lennon and Ono planned to start fresh, do a world tour, and record more albums."
Death.
"On 8 December 1980, Lennon was shot dead as he was going into his home, by a man named Mark David Chapman who was mentally ill. Even though he was ill, Chapman was still prosecuted for murdering Lennon. Chapman pled guilty to the murder the next year, and is still in prison today. He admitted later he was jealous of Lennon's fame and success, while his own life disappointed him. Chapman thought that killing Lennon would give his own life more meaning. He is always refused for parole, and is infamous (hated by many people)."
"Fans all over the world mourned Lennon's death. It made them feel that a special part of their lives was gone. Many met in New York's Central Park, near where Lennon and Ono lived, to say their goodbyes. Some played recordings of Lennon's music. Politicians and celebrities everywhere were sorry Lennon had died, even if they disliked him, because his music meant so much to so many people. Radio stations in the Soviet Union, where rock music was rarely allowed to be played, gave an hour over to Beatles recordings."
"There was no funeral for Lennon, but Yoko Ono asked people everywhere to observe ten minutes of silence and prayer for him on Sunday, December 14, 1980, at 2:00 PM. At two o'clock, the music playing in Central Park stopped, and people all over the world fell silent for ten minutes. Other tributes came later, including songs by George Harrison (""All Those Years Ago""), Paul McCartney (""Here Today""), Elton John (""Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)"") and Queen (""Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)"")."
Legacy.
"Lennon's music (with and after his Beatles years) is still played everywhere, and people are still touched by it. A series of radio programs were devoted to playing demoes of his songs. Young musicians play Lennon's records, and learn his music. Yoko Ono released an album of acoustic versions of many Lennon songs, to help musicians understand them better."
"There is now a garden in Central Park in Lennon's memory called ""Strawberry Fields"" after one of Lennon's most popular songs, which in turn was named after a Salvation Army orphanage near his childhood home. On October 9, 1990, on what would have been Lennon's fiftieth birthday, ""Imagine"" was simulcast on radio and television stations all over the world, uniting people everywhere to remember Lennon and his music."

With The Beatles.
World War I.
"When World War I started in August 1914, Romania said it was a neutral country. In 1916, the Allies promised to give Romania parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire where many Romanians lived, if Romania started a war against Austria-Hungary."
"The military campaign ended in disaster after Romania's forces were defeated in 1917 and Moldova was one of the few parts of Romania that was not captured. When the Allies eventually won the war, the Austria-Hungarian Empire was dissolved and an independent Hungarian republic was proclaimed. Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania became part of the Kingdom of Romania in 1918 as had been promised. After the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, Hungary formally gave up any claims over Transylvania. Romania and Bukovina were joined together in 1919 as a result of the Treaty of Saint Germain. Bessarabia joined with Romania in 1920 when the Treaty of Paris was signed."
Greater Romania.
"After World War I was much bigger and more nationalist. The small Kingdom received (""major Transylvania""). The principalities Wallachia, Moldavia and Bessarabia (Moldova) together formed the ""Greater Romania"" 1918-1940. ""Greater Romania"" did not survive World War II."
"Romanians called their country ""România Mare"", meaning ""Great Romania"" or ""Greater Romania"", in the time between World War I and World War II. They called it so because it controlled of land."
"The Great Depression meant social unrest, high unemployment, strikes and riots, especially a miners' strike in 1929 in Valea Jiului and a strike in Griviţas maintenance workshops. By the mid-1930s, with a recovering Romanian economy, industry grew, although about 80% of Romanians still were engaged in agriculture."
Iron Guard.
"In end of 1930s, Romania's liberal democracy was slowly being replaced by the fascist dictatorship. The Archangel Michael Legion, known as the Iron Guard organization, was led by Corneliu Codreanu Zelea. In 1937 elections the party supported Adolf Hitler and Nazism and got 15.5% of the votes and became the third biggest party. In 1938 king Carol II of Romania seized power over Romania. He dissolved all political parties and executed Corneliu Codreanu Zelea along with 12 other leaders."
World War II.
"Carol II of Romania declared the country as neutral when World War II broke out in 1939, but included since the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia and northern Bukovina an alliance with Hitler's Germany. This occurred after field marshal Ion Antonescu forced the authoritarian Carol II of Romania to abdicate. Antonescu appointed himself ""conducator"", Romania's dictator, and signed at the November 23 of 1940 three-powers pact with Nazi Germany. Hitler's Germany was dependent on a continuous importation of fuel and crude oil from the Romanian oil fields of Ploesti. In 1940, yjr Kingdom of Hungary took over the legitimate domination in Northern Transylvania to the end of the World War II."
The country's troops fought together with the German Wehrmacht against the Soviet Union.
"In summer of 1941, Romania join Hitler's war against the Soviet Union in combination also Finland, Slovakia and Hungary join Hitlers war. Romania built concentration camps and began conducting a massive persecution of Jews, of which became very extreme in the city of Iasi."
Holocaust in Romania.
"Romania participated in the Holocaust. The author of the book ""The Destruction of the European Jews"" Raul Hilberg writes follow: ""There was / ... / moment when the Germans actually had to intervene and slow the speed with which the Romanian measures were taken."" The hunt for Jews in eastern Romania (including Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transnistria and the city of Iasi) had more the character of pogroms than the German, well-organized camps and transport."
"There were pogroms in the city of Iasi. The homes for the Jewish minority in Iasi were marked with crosses. On June 27, 1941, Ion Antonescu make a phone call with the city's mayor and Antonescu said into the phone: ""clean the city Iasi from the Jews."" And the Holocaust in Romania has began. Police officers and many civilians went to every Jewish home marked with a cross in the town and murdered thousands of Jews on the same day."
"In June 1941, the Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu gave an ""illegal secret order"" to the special police force. He ordered the police in cooperation with the Romanian Army and the German SS troops to kill all Jews in east Romania within the next coming years. The Jews living on the countryside was being killed right on the spot. The Jews in the cities were first collected in the ghettos and later deported away."
"On October 22, 1941 the Soviet union with bombs blow up the Romanian military headquarters in Odessa, and killed 66 Romanian soldiers. As revenge Ion Antonescu decided that for every dead Romanian officer, 200 Soviet communists must be killed and for each dead soldier, 100 communists must be killed. All other Communists were imprisoned and Jewish families were taken hostage in the hope that the partisan movement would cease its operations."
"The day after in Bucharest, on October 23, 1941, around 5 000 people and the majority were Jews was arrested who later executed by hanging. In the Soviet village Dalnik, almost 20,000 Jews were incarcerated in to several locked buildings and burned alive."
"After the massacre, many of the Jews who remained in Odessa were sent to various concentration camps. Nearby Odessa on October 25, 1941, approximately 40,000 Jews, was gathering together on a special closed military secured area, and the Jews had to stay outdoors for more than ten days without food or supply. Many died of cold and starvation. The survivors were murdered one month later."
"Totally approximately 469,000 Jews had been murdered by the military and police in Romania between 1941 and 1944, including the 325,000 murdered Jews in Bessarabia and Bukovina."
End of war.
"At the end of 1943, the Red Army liberated most of Soviet territory and started advancing westward from its borders to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies. It was in this context that the Soviet forces crossed Romania. If the Soviet Union could hit Romania, Nazi Germany's last hope is gone, said the military leadership of the Red Army. Russians deposited the entire 1.5 million soldiers in the attack against Romania and Romania last reserves consisting only of 138 000 soldiers. During the summer of 1944 it began the attack on Bessarabia (Moldova) and the Romanian army fled the area. On 2 August, the whole Bessarabia (Moldova) is captured by the Red Army. The Russians then went a long way in Romania and on 23 August they reached into the Romanian capital Bucharest. The public opinion turned in the country against Antonescu and of summer 1944 he was deposed and imprisoned. The new government signed a ceasefire and extradited itself to the Soviet Union. The Red Army killed the members from the old fascist regime (including Ion Antonescu) on June 1, 1946."
"At the end of the war, Romania was allowed to keep the whole of Transylvania in west and Dobruja from south, but lost Bessarabia/Transnistria and Odessa Oblast in the east (with rich oil reserves) which became parts of the Soviet Union. Bukovina was split in half because in the north part the majority ethnic group was Ukrainian and in the south part Romanian."
"The Soviet Union replaced the royal monarchy with a communist regime in 1947. The Soviet Union took the country's resources, which led to increased poverty in Romania."
Romania and communism.
"Michael I abdicated the throne and had to leave Romania in 1947 because of the Communists. Romania changed from a monarchy into a republic. The USSR occupied Romania until the late 1950s, when Soviet troops left Romania. During this time, resources in Romania were taken by the Soviet Union due to agreements made by Communist leaders."
"After the Soviet troops left Romania, Nicolae Ceauşescu wanted Romania to become more independent from Moscow. Romania started following slightly different foreign policies than Moscow. After the Six-Day War in 1967, Romania began talks with Israel and started relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. Romania started to have their own relations with Arab countries. Romania officials were allowed to participate in peace talks between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization."
"The national debt Romania owed to other countries went from $3 billion to almost $10 billion between 1977 and 1981. The amount of money that Romania owed other countries caused them to rely on banks and other lenders from around the world. President Nicolae Ceauşescu's autarchic ways meant he did not want to rely on other countries and Romania paid back money borrowed from other countries. This affected the Romanian economy. To try to stay in power, Ceauşescu had anyone who disagreed with him arrested and put in prison. Many people were killed or hurt. Almost 60,000 people were put in psychiatric hospitals. Ceauşescu eventually lost power and was killed in the Romanian Revolution of 1989."
1989 to 2007.
"In 1989, the National Salvation Front came into power. It was led by Ion Iliescu. When they came into power, several other parties from before World War II were remade. These included the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal Party and the Romanian Social Democrat Party. In April 1990, as a result of several rallies, protests started. The people who protested did not recognize the results of the election. This was because they thought that members of the National Salvation Front were communists. More and more people protested, and it became a demonstration – a very big protest. This was called the Golaniad, and it became very violent."
"When the National Salvation Front lost power, several other parties were made. These were the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and a couple of other parties from before the war. The Social Democratic Party ruled Romania from 1990 until 1996. Ion Iliescu was the head of state, or person in charge. After 1996, several other parties came into power and lost it. In 2004, Traian Băsescu became the president."
I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
Really.
"I mean, we're all grown,"
"all her kids are grown,"
and we have our own families
Uh-huh.
"and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?"
"Yeah,"
get out of my cabinets.
"Like, what are you doing?"
Don't you have your own house to dig through?
That's great.
"Yeah,"
"so, I guess, privacy is really,"
"and at the work place, I suppose,"
"oh, well, actually yes."
"I can say definitely, privacy at the work place."
Uh-huh.
I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
See.
Yeah.
"because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,"
"and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way."
"You could tell,"
"you know you put your stuff where it's,"
Yeah.
"That would drive, that would, that"
"It would drive, it drove me batty for a while."
Really.
"Yeah,"
"well, I worked a second shift"
Right.
"What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job."
Uh-huh.
I'm a nurse
"and I work,"
Oh
I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance
"and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that."
"To, to compensate for some of the benefits."
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
Yes.
And then I have my freedom.
I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
"Well, that, that's an excellent,"
"so actually that is a benefit, uh,"
"Well, it is to me."
"Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,"
Yeah.
and I'm just really not interested in all that.
Right.
"Right,"
"well I guess that's a good point, uh,"
"did you vote in the last, uh, national election?"
"Yes,"
"we, uh, uh, I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote."
"Oh, that's good."
Did you get to vote at the last one?
I voted in the last national one.
"Yeah,"
I'm not sure *slash error; one utt with next
if I got the last local one.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be."
"Yeah,"
you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
"Right,"
"and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents."
"Right,"
"or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that."
Right.
"So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting."
"Yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And, it's, it's, they're,"
"and also they're fed up with the system,"
"and they say, well, why should I even vote."
"Yeah,"
"or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,"
Right.
"so they think, well, you know, why vote."
Right.
The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
"Yeah,"
"and if, they should pay for it with their life."
Right.
"When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned."
Yeah.
"We just have the case,"
"I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up"
"Oh, really."
"So, I mean, his appeal was denied"
and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
"It, uh,"
Yeah.
"But, uh, that was absurd"
"There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence."
"I know that, that"
Uh-huh.
"And, I don't know."
"Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?"
"Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,"
"the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of."
"Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd."
There's no way that could work.
"Oh, yeah."
"I, I, I don't agree with that at all."
"Uh, but,"
Imagine the guilt that person would have.
I mean  burned out.
"Oh, exactly."
"There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself."
Exactly.
Right.
Yeah.
Or so it seems.
"I may just be paranoid,"
but that state income tax is just eating me alive.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
they have a state income tax in Maryland.
"But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax,"
"but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and, school taxes and property taxes,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Property taxes and,"
"Oh my God,"
ate you alive.
"Yeah,"
"well, Colorado, you know they have the state income tax,"
"but then they also have property taxes,"
"and they also have sales taxes,"
and they just get you every direction they can.
Yeah.
"And I just don't know, sir,"
but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.
"Yeah,"
"it sure does. Um,"
"there's, uh, some good books that I've read, um, that you might be interested in. Uh"
Oh yeah?
Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V
"and he's got seminars you can go to,"
"and they try to hook you into his organization, which costs about four hundred bucks."
But he's got a couple of books out.
"One of them is called, uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK."
I've heard of the book.
"And we do have a very loving cat that's, you know, kind of our baby."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and we like pets."
We like them around.
We have grandchildren that run through
"and they think we should have a dog,"
and that's because they have a Great Dane
Huh.
Yes.
They're just huge
Definitely.
"Well, we, you know,"
"if it, um, if it were just more peaceful, you know, with the little ones, we would definitely have a pet."
I just think it's nice to have around.
We had a cat that had kittens.
So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered.
"Oh, yes,"
yes.
"Because, uh, I did."
That experience was awful
"Yes,"
"I have never wanted to,"
"that's why we've never gotten a female, you know, in anything."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, uh, and our male cats, you know, we had, uh, neutered right away,"
to baby very what you doing ?
"and, of course, it, he doesn't know it."
He's still out partying.
Oh.
"But, um, you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her, have her spayed, you know."
"And, uh,"
"Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying."
"You can play with your friends,"
"he can play with his friends,"
"but you've both been out and exercised,"
and you have enjoyed the day.
"Right,"
yeah.
"Or my favorite,"
just ride around in the cart with him
"You bet,"
you get a lot of exercise that way.
"Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just look at the golf course."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, I'll tell you what, if if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long."
"Oh, yeah."
"But my husband's pretty tolerant,"
so he's not too bad to watch.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, mine had a very short fuse."
"If he did something bad, he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it."
"Oh, no,"
yeah.
He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.
"I mean, just get so mad, he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal."
Gosh.
"Now my husband has a temper,"
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course.
"He's, because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
So I guess he's real laid back about it.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
okay.
I think Florida still uses electric chair.
Yeah
"Uh, I don't, I don't know."
In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God.
Yeah.
"And that's not,"
I don't think that's right.
"But on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it."
Yeah.
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
"and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. Um,"
Yeah.
with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year.
"They,"
Yeah.
That's what's happening here.
"There is,"
"like, uh, that's,"
"in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, uh, uh, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"And it's like, you know, that's a big problem"
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
Uh-huh.
"and it's really, you know, it's, it gets to be a a big problem."
Yeah.
"Uh, go ahead."
"I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't."
Right.
"Be a little more, you know,"
"I said I don't know,"
I'll have to try it and see.
I've always watched it.
Uh-huh.
"And he said, well, fine,"
"he said, we'll just take you over to the course, he lives near Brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it."
Uh-huh
"If you do, then we can go golf together."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, whoa,"
"great,"
I get to walk all around a little green field all day.
"But those kinds of things happen, though,"
"you, you get a little taste of it"
"and you say, Hey, this is not bad."
Uh-huh.
And you really begin to develop an interest in it.
But I am not an athlete at all.
Me either.
"You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball, and, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball."
So I am not an athlete.
Maybe golf is a forgiving sport.
I don't know.
Yeah
"at least you're just you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there."
It doesn't appear to be
Uh-huh.
"I really, I, I haven't really acquired an interest in it,"
"but I'm open to try anything, you know."
Yeah
"that's, kind of the way I feel."
"The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair"
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"he's,"
"anyway, and that was just excessively violent."
I was worried
"Yeah,"
isn't it amazing.
"it's like golly,"
"if kids start imitating that they'll knock each others blocks off,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it was all bloodless
Uh-huh.
and the good guys can get hit all day long
Uh-huh.
and they have to shake it off
Yeah.
"they don't, they don't, you know, get, uh, epileptics, that sort of thing from getting hit on their head"
Right.
"you know, it's a little disturbing the violence in these films,"
"partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book on the other hand it makes it seem like,"
Uh-huh.
"I read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies, don't have very realistic upsets of the violence."
"The violence can seem very realistic,"
but the aftermath is usually not there.
Right.
"So you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions"
Uh-huh.
"they thrash around,"
"they scream, you know, uh,"
"it's just a very, very bad thing,"
"and they never present that,"
but  I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"God, it's amazing"
"And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late."
Right.
Right.
"But I, I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Two income families I think are here to stay.
"Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know, the, the people that work in big business have families"
Uh-huh.
Right.
they have children.
Yeah.
"So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and  working"
Oh sure.
"and, uh,"
You retain employees and keep them longer.
"That's, that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that  they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
Right.
"So, I, I hope it helps."
It seems to help the new mothers  not have to come back full-time.
Oh that's good.
because that's hard.
That's good to know.
"I have a couple of friends that, have, have found the, uh, you know, a a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age."
Uh-huh.
"We're just,"
"I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there."
I know.
I'm amazed.
I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.
Huh-uh.
"I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things."
"I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,"
"it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I know.
"Of course, I guess that's not bad."
Alan Alda did it on MASH.
I know.
Isn't that funny?
It hasn't hurt him at all.
"So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?"
"Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues."
"That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to, have watched, you know."
"In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP."
Yeah.
"I mean, you don't have to ..."
That's one of our favorites
Yeah.
"You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,"
"so, you know, I usually don't like that."
"Right,"
"which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,"
Uh-huh.
that's always a bummer too.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.
"Yeah,"
"exactly,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"the, the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions."
These institutions of thirty thousand students and such.
"Oh I,"
And I see some freshmen wandering around in there
"and they're they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city,"
"I mean, they, they,"
Yeah.
"I don't see them getting,"
"I mean when I was undergraduate, I went to a, relatively small school for my first two years"
and then I transferred to a very large school.
Uh-huh.
And that worked out pretty well.
"I went from a, you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution."
Uh-huh.
But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was.
I needed to make friends.
I needed to sort of learn the ropes.
"You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more"
"and I needed basic, really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years."
"Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too,"
"so,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"And, and I'm,"
"I,"
"I'd,"
"I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work."
"But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid."
"Paid, right."
"Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company."
"But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
Some that may decide not to.
"yeah,"
"Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget."
"Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure."
Uh-huh.
It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
Yes.
Exactly.
"Um,"
"There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do"
"and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course,"
"but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"Oh, which state is that?"
"Uh, State of Minnesota."
Uh-huh.
"So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages."
"I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it"
Uh-huh.
so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
Right.
Right.
"But,"
"What, what about the domestic effects"
"like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, uh, possible and even popular to, uh, criticize the government."
"And they,"
"that pendulum started to swing, uh, maybe even too far. To the point where, uh, uh, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And that tradition is still,"
"I mean it's dying now,"
"but it's still alive as opposed to,"
"this Desert Storm stuff may have, uh  killed it."
Yeah.
"But I think that was one of the biggest,"
"that, you know, the, uh, the domestic unrest,"
Are you in the middle of anything?
No.
I'm not in the middle of anything.
"I've just,"
about the last thing I did
"about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house."
"So, I guess that,"
The whole thing?
Yeah.
"That, that was fairly large undertaking."
"A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house."
Did the framing and all?
"Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking."
Huh.
"That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that"
"we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that"
and.
and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
Right.
"And it's a real big crunch, uh"
Uh-huh.
"of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course,"
"but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them."
"So,"
"Well, that's right."
"Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste"
Uh-huh.
but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
Sure.
"I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles."
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
"And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being,"
I mean it gave people jobs
Yeah.
"but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use."
"I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time"
"but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"So, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things."
So I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Right.
"Okay,"
"well, it was good talking to you"
and have a good evening.
Okay
All right.
Yeah.
"Now, I sort of take pride in, uh, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks,"
"and, uh, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore."
"Yeah,"
"so do you have a, do you have a garden,"
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?
"Well, it's, yeah, it's, it's primarily just, uh, like landscaping a little bit."
"You know, I've got some, uh, bushes around the you know, foundation planning, things like that,"
"and then there's some, just some little flower beds,"
"and my mom grows,"
"she's an avid gardener,"
"and she starts her own stuff from seed now,"
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them.
"Uh, she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden."
"They have a huge yard and a huge house,"
and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.
"Well, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"My, my sister is very over zealous, too."
She's got some really nice flower beds.
She puts a lot of time into them.
"This is my first year in a, in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff."
"Oh, we, I've always had crude ones at my father's,"
but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house.
Yeah.
His house is more like a farm house.
It's not on a main road.
Uh-huh.
"My house is on a main road,"
and it has nothing
Yeah.
"I mean, nothing."
"Yes,"
it's a very good book.
It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do with the money that you save.
Legally?
"Legally, cut money on your taxes."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
Huh.
"legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance,"
"and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, uh, you know, be wealthier. Uh,"
"he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet. Um,"
"FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it. Uh,"
"the man, uh, has a lot of good ideas,"
"some of them I already knew about,"
some of them I had already practiced.
"But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, uh,"
And that includes everyone at T I.
"Yes,"
I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one.
Yes.
"Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet."
Yet.
But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.
"You know, survival is a funny state."
"Yeah,"
I know what you mean.
"I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor,"
"and I had four non exempts, um, under me."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them."
I just couldn't believe it.
"Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now."
Uh-uh.
I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot.
Very few I would imagine.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I get,"
I just couldn't
"I mean it's more money that I make in a year,"
so
"You know, it, you know,"
"me being one person with a above the median income, for New York state, you know,"
Yeah.
"I'm a I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now,"
"and, uh, I,"
Uh-huh.
"even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into, to your child's education"
Uh-huh.
"and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"My God, I can't imagine."
"Well, my, my real feeling about, about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time,"
"yes,"
"you do get an education, you do learn some things,"
but you eventually forget most of it.
Yes.
But what you don't forget is the growing up.
It's really the period when people become adults.
I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways.
"But, really,"
"it's the entry into adulthood, I think."
"And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become, you know, as you gain new social skills, as you become, you know, more of a functioning member of society."
"And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect,"
"I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,"
"but not,"
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
"and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches."
Um
"At this time of the year,"
and we've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
"and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer."
"Yeah,"
"well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas."
Right.
"But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,"
but we have our share of cold weather as well.
"The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing."
"It didn't stay there,"
"but it was right at,"
"Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?"
Um.
"We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,"
but this year it wasn't bad at all.
I guess that's because we had so much rain.
I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.
"He said it was just,"
"and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,"
"Oh, yeah."
"and, uh,"
"Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston"
"and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,"
"and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course."
"Oh, boy."
"They have a, uh, lake cabin"
"but they were so, seemed, cold and impersonal,"
I just couldn't hack it.
Uh-huh.
"And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today."
So there  was real continuity.
Oh.
She went back as a teenager
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
"Oh, my gosh."
"So, it, it was really neat."
But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
"and  she just kept good people and  real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,"
Uh-huh.
Oh my goodness
and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that.  That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh, public schools out here. You know, to,"
Uh-huh.
you're lucky to have an art teacher
"and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know."
Or pay for it after school.
Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art
"and   you know, I willingly did it"
Oh is that right?
I had no idea.
"but I thought, this makes me angry."
This is something that ought to be in the schools  rather than some of the other stuff they do.
Uh-huh.
"And, and just watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a pattern."
"There's always something, no matter how young,"
and then that helps develop that attitude.
"Um, I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more."
"You know, I think this is certainly a possible way, um, to handle it"
"but I wish,"
that's something that I think that has been lost in families
and I think that's a good place to start again.
Yeah.
"I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going to do it for anybody else."
Yeah.
"And I do think, um, the schools,"
"if you're trying to do something, even with food drives"
"and, uh, sometimes what Richardson and Plano both,"
I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, that's, uh,"
"gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas"
"and, uh  it's,"
That's probably true.
That's probably true.
"I know our church youth group, uh, starts with projects young"
but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia  area every year.
Uh-huh.
They've done this for fourteen years now.
"Oh, that's great."
"Um, and it is, it's, uh,"
"and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close."
"Some of the things, that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it really,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And they
"usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home"
Uh-huh.
"and my future, future sister-in-law's mother does that too, full-time."
"Well in Plano though the problem is, you find,"
and this is what I found with Emily.
"I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area."
Uh-huh.
And I kept finding neighbors and friends
and they'd move.
Oh.
She ended up being in a different home every year.
Too transit.
Uh-huh.
And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.
And her surroundings.
"So this year I, I tried Kinder-Care"
"and, then she's old enough to"
Okay.
"Well, let's see,"
"well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics"
"and, uh, we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full."
I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.
"Are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling?"
"No,"
"no,"
I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.
"Well, maybe they don't."
"I, I know that was supposed to be in May"
"and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were."
"Yeah,"
"the,"
my last G M car was a seventy Chevy station wagon
and it still had the points and condenser in it.
"When I rebuilt the engine on that, about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car."
Yeah.
"I, uh, pulled that old points distributor out and got, an H E I distributor, electronic distributor put into it."
"Well, I really enjoy reading the newspaper,"
"we get the daily, uh, DALLAS MORNING NEWS"
and I try to look at it.
"If I get busy I don't get a chance to pick it up, like this week I noticed several copies have been haven't been touched"
but
"Well, do you have time to read the paper in the morning?"
"Well, not in the morning,"
"but, uh, if the,"
"well, I have two children"
"and if they, uh, go out to play or something I like to keep my eye on them so I'll, you know, maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something."
"You know, a lot, a lot of people don't take newspapers at all."
"We, we took the MORNING NEWS for a while,"
Uh-huh.
"and then, uh, well, we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages"
"and then, uh, dog just ran off with my shoe, that's off the subject, went outside, picked it up and ran off."
"Anyway, uh, and then we switched the MORNING NEWS"
but we found we couldn't read enough of it
"and by the time I got home and had time to, to read some,"
"but, but I guess the, the issue is, uh, beside the newspaper, do you take any news magazines?"
"Well, we, I don't take, like TIME, or NEWSWEEK or anything like that,"
"but I do like to watch, uh, C N N."
"I have several chores and things to do,"
"so it comes on at, like the nine o'clock p m"
and so I will turn that on while I'm doing some work
"and I can hear the news, not have to sit right down and listen to it."
= = = Romuald Peiser = = =
Romuald Désiré Peiser (born 3 August 1979) is a French former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
"Peiser was born in Phalsbourg, Moselle. After unsuccessfully emerging through Paris Saint-Germain FC's youth system – only appeared for the reserves – he played in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen II and KFC Uerdingen, both in the lower leagues; subsequently, he spent one season in the Swiss Challenge League with FC Vaduz."
"Peiser made his top flight debut in the 2003–04 campaign, only missing four Liga I games as FC Rapid Bucureşti finished in third position. He returned to his country for the following four years, spending two apiece with Troyes AC and FC Gueugnon and being part of the former team's Ligue 1 roster in 2005–06 (no league appearances)."
"In 2008, aged 29, Peiser moved countries again, going on to start for both Portuguese sides he represented, Associação Naval 1º de Maio and Académica de Coimbra, both in the Primeira Liga. His first match in the competition took place on 4 October 2008 while at the service of the former, in a 1–1 home draw to C.F. Os Belenenses."
"On 9 July 2014, Peiser signed with his first non-European club, joining Ottawa Fury FC of the North American Soccer League. In July of the following year, he broke a record in the competition – in both the original and modern-day incarnation – for the longest shutout record."
"In December 2016, 37-year-old Peiser moved to fellow league team San Francisco Deltas. He won the Soccer Bowl in his first season, keeping a clean sheet in the decisive match against New York Cosmos (2–0 at the Kezar Stadium)."
"In March 2018, Peiser signed with United Soccer League side Penn FC. After retiring later in that year, he worked as goalkeeper coach at Sacramento Republic FC."

= = = Eaton Chapel = = =
"Eaton Chapel is a private chapel to the north of Eaton Hall in Eaton Park, near the village of Eccleston, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"Building of the chapel commenced in 1869, soon after the estate was inherited by Hugh Grosvenor, the 3rd Marquess of Westminster, in conjunction with a major rebuilding of the hall. Grosvenor became the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1874. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse as architect and the building was completed in 1884. When the Waterhouse hall was demolished in 1963, the chapel was retained."
"The chapel is built in buff sandstone with a grey slate roof. Internally the stone is in pink and buff bands. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave that is continuous with a three-bay chancel. The chancel terminates with a three-sided apse containing the altar. The chapel is oriented with the altar at the west end. The last bay at the east end constitutes a narthex (ante-chapel) with a gallery. On the south of the chapel is a tower which is free-standing, but joined to the chapel at the lower two storeys, and by a bridge above. At the southeast corner is a staircase turret. On the south side of the nave and in the apse are two-light windows and at the east end behind the gallery is a four-light window. The tower has six stages and contains tall lancet bell-openings. Above these is the clock stage, corbelled out from the shaft of the tower and surmounted by pinnacles at each corner. On each side is a clock face made from vitreous enamel; each clock face is in diameter. Over this is a spire decorated with gables and pinnacles. The staircase turret is surmounted by a spire."
"The narthex at the east end has a groin vaulted oak roof, and is paved with black marble and with encaustic tiles. A stone screen leads into the nave. This also has a groin vaulted roof, but built in stone. Between the nave and the chancel is a low alabaster screen. A continuation of this screen leads to the pulpit: this is also constructed in alabaster with Devonshire marble columns. The reredos and the font are also made in alabaster. The benches in the nave and chancel are in walnut and have carved ends. In the chancel is a recumbent effigy in alabaster of Constance, 1st Duchess of Westminster, by Joseph Boehm. For the effigy, Boehm worked from plaster casts of the face and hands taken after her death."
"The stained glass in the windows of the south side of the nave and the apse, and the mosaics in the blank on the north side of the nave were designed by Frederic Shields. These were commissioned in 1876 and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The two-manual organ is in an alcove on the south side of the chancel. It was built in 1870–71 by Charles Whitley of Chester and is still in good working order. The clock tower contains a carillon of 28 bells which were cast by Chavalier Severian Van Aerschodt of Louvain; it plays 31 tunes. The clock was manufactured by Gillet's of Croydon."
"The chapel continues to be the private chapel of the Grosvenor family and is used for family christenings, confirmations and memorial services. Each December it is made available for up to eight charities to arrange carol concerts. The chapel is also open to the general public on three annual open days."

"The Thought and Daniel meet in Belshazzar's palace gardens. The Thought informs Daniel that Belshazzar has married Idolatry, even though he is already married to Vanity. Daniel cries woe for God's people."
"Belshazzar enters with Vanity and his new bride, Idolatry. He wants them to embrace each other. They do so and ask him what is on his mind. He relates the story of the Great Flood and also the Tower of Babel. After he tells his stories, his two wives decree that he is their king and god. Belshazzar asks what can break their bond, and Daniel informs him that “The Hand of God,” can break up Belshazzar, Vanity, and Idolatry. Belshazzar gets upset with Daniel and threatens his life. Daniel says that God will save him. Vanity and Idolatry tell Belshazzar that Daniel is annoying them and they want to leave. As they leave, Belshazzar tells Daniel he owes his life to the two queens, not to God. The Thought tells Daniel that he has learned a valuable lesson – by invoking the hand of God, his life can be spared in future situations."
"Death and Daniel enter and discuss Belshazzar and his sins of vanity and idolatry. Death offers to kill Belshazzar for Daniel, as an agent of an angry God. Daniel gives Death permission to visit Belshazzar and scare him, but not kill him. Daniel wants to save his soul. Death is upset about only being allowed to show himself to and warn Belshazzar and not take his soul. He calls for Thought. Thought joins Death and is scared of him. Death asks Thought where Belshazzar is. Thought tells Death that Belshazzar is with his two wives in the garden. Death asks Thought to take him there. Thought does because he doesn't have the courage to say no."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, and Vanity enter. The ask Belshazzar why he looks so sad and stops talking so suddenly. Belshazzar says he doesn't know the source of the intense pain he feels. It is Death approaching that none of the trio can see. Death shows himself to Belshazzar who is shocked and terrified. He asks Death who he is; Death tells Belshazzar that he is a creditor here to collect a debt that Belshazzar owes. Thought rethinks his decision to lead Death to Belshazzar. Belshazzar asks what he owes. Death shows him a book that has the debt listed, but Belshazzar states that the book is one he lost. Death says the debt was written down by Belshazzar himself. He reads back what Belshazzar wrote about owing his life to Death. Death tells Belshazzar that today is not the day that he has come to collect the debt, but that the day is coming. Death exits."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought are still together. The two queens want to know what is troubling Belshazzar. He says he is not sure – some phantom visited him. To please Belshazzar, the queens take turns complimenting each other. They all sit down and Idolatry fans Belshazzar with the feather from her hat while Vanity sings to him about his greatness to continue to soothe him."
"Death is angry because the queens have soothed Belshazzar into a sleep. Death says he will haunt Belshazzar in his dream. The queens leave the garden and Thought also falls asleep. Death sees Belshazzar asleep and decides to kill him. He draws his sword, but Daniel enters and says, “No,” while holding back the arms of Death. Death inquires why he cannot kill the king. Daniel says Belshazzar has not lived his whole life and it is not time yet for him to die. Death argues that Belshazzar's life is a mockery to both God and Death."
"While Belshazzar is asleep, in his dream the queens enter with a Statue – it is Belshazzar as a god. The queens praise Belshazzar and build him up. The Statue warns Belshazzar in his sleep that he needs to leave Idolatry and Vanity behind or else he will suffer because of them. The Statue tells the dream queens that the great God decrees them gone. Belshazzar wakes up and is troubled by what he saw and felt in his sleep. He starts to question keeping so much stock in Idolatry and Vanity. However, Idolatry seduces him again and he returns to his former self. Thought suggests Belshazzar throw a feast to shake off all of the melancholy. Belshazzar calls for the gold wine glasses and wine reserved for presenting the Eucharist to be used, because he deserves the best. Idolatry and Vanity set the table for the feast while Thought sings."
"Death comes to the feast in a disguise and makes a plea to God to loose his hand in order to kill Belshazzar due to his sacrilegious behavior against the Eucharist on top of his sins of Idolatry and Vanity. Belshazzar demands wine, and Death, being mistaken for a servant, brings him a golden cup of poisoned wine declaring that in the cup is both Life and Death. Belshazzar toasts himself, drinks the wine, and then there are several increasingly loud thunder claps. A hand appears in the clouds and writes nonsense words that neither Idolatry, Vanity, Belshazzar, nor Thought can decipher. Idolatry says Daniel can read them and calls him to do it."
"Daniel comes and interrupts the words that translate to mean that: One, God has numbered Belshazzar's days on earth. Two, Belshazzar has been weighed in the balance and been found wanting. Three, Belshazzar's kingdom will be a wasteland ravaged by his enemies when Belshazzar dies. All this because Belshazzar has profaned the sacred golden sacramental cups meant only to be used for the Eucharist. Death tells Belshazzar know that there was “death,” or poison, in the cups. Belshazzar cries out for Idolatry to save him, but she cannot. He calls out to Vanity to help him, but she cannot. Belshazzar asks Thought to help him, but Thought reminds him that he did not take heed of the warnings he received. Belshazzar finally calls on Daniel. Daniels says he is God's agent and Belshazzar must take his punishment. Belshazzar wonders who could save him – Death says no one. Death says “Die, thou sinner,” draws his sword, and stabs Belshazzar in the heart. As Death and Belshazzar wrestle, Belshazzar calls out a warning to all men. Idolatry lays down her worship of all other gods for God Himself, asks for forgiveness for Calderón's faults, and says that his intentions as the playwright was to point back to God."

The rock is privately owned and is located southwest of Sconticut Neck and Wilbur's Point. The island is home to a number of sea birds as well as a nonfunctional windmill structure."
"The Town of Fairhaven refers to it as ""Angelica Island,"" while official nautical charts refer to it as ""Angelica Rock."""
"In the early 1970s, the island was purchased by Dr. Aris T. Papas, a clinical psychologist and professor who intended to build a summer home there. Papas and his son constructed the windmill by hauling materials via rowboat, and the windmill was functional until it was destroyed by a storm months later. However, the summer home plans were abandoned and a concrete slab from the project remains there today."

"Sesame Street is a nationally syndicated comic strip inspired by ""Sesame Street"". Written and drawn by veteran Sesame animator Cliff Roberts, the earliest concept art was created in 1970, and by 1971, a promotional booklet was created as the comic entered the market, courtesy of King Features. The strip debuted on November 15, 1971, in more than 175 newspapers, and ran until 1975. The strip, which ran both daily and on Sundays, was conceptually similar to the series in its pedagogical goals, but, in the first year of the strip, conspicuous by the absence of the Muppets."
"Instead, the strip featured several new characters created by Roberts, such as Jasper and Julius, Christopher Clumsy, and Miss Fortune; in 1972, all of these characters appeared in animated inserts on ""Sesame Street"" itself. Also regularly seen was Professor Drummond Bugle, a lecturer, similar to more generic characters used in Roberts' animated segments. Roberts fleshed out the strip's cast with a vast menagerie of newly minted animal characters. Amongst them were Lotta Elephant, Richard Bird, Hedda the frog, Balderdash the mouse, Titus the snake, Thomas Turtle, Crawley the worm, and an errant spider. A pair of nameless, Muppet-esque monsters also skulked through on occasion."
"Though the earlier version of the strip avoided the Muppets, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and Cookie Monster joined the cast in December 1972, and appeared through the end of the strip's run in 1975."
"Like ""Sesame Street"", the comic strip was largely educational, using broad humor to relate learning concepts. The most frequent topics were parts of the body, shapes, and identification of objects. Other subjects included opposites or pairings (up and down, here and there, etc.) and emotions. Letters and numbers surfaced rarely, presumably because the strip's target audience was different from the largely pre-literate television audience. However, many strips were pure comedy, revolving around the characters' eccentricities and foibles."

"Marguerite Bellanger (10 June 1838 - 23 November 1886) was a French stage actress and courtesan. She was a celebrity of Second Empire France and known for her relationship with Napoleon III of France. She was often caricatured in contemporary press and is considered to be the model for Émile Zola's ""Nana"". A candy is also named after her. She was reputedly the most universally loathed of Napoleon III's mistresses, though perhaps his favorite. She outlived Napoleon's deposal in 1870 and died in 1886 aged 48."
"Marguerite Bellanger was born Julie Justine Marine Lebœuf on 10 June 1838 in Saint-Lambert-des-Levées, Maine-et-Loire to François Lebœuf and Julie Hanot. Born into poverty, she began working as a laundress in Saumur at the age of 15."
"After an affair with a lieutenant opened her eyes to the wider world, she became an acrobat and trick rider in a provincial circus, she travelled to Paris where she made her debut as an actress at the theater ""La Tour d'Auvergne"", under the name of Marguerite Bellanger (the surname of an uncle)."
"Although her acting talent was limited, she was cunning. She became one of the most sought-after cocottes of all Paris. She led a princely lifestyle, and the climax of her gallant life took place in the years 1862-1866.

Author and playwright, Ludovic Halévy, is reputed to have said that Bellanger had the ""daintiest feet in Paris""."
Her celebrity status was such that she became a figure in the literary and artistic world. Zola quoted her as a friend of Nana.

"Gaustatoppen is the highest mountain in the county Telemark in Norway which lies in the municipality Tinn and Hjartdal. The view from the summit is impressive, as one can see an area of approximately 60,000 km², one sixth of Norway's mainland. The mountain is popular for downhill skiing in winter, and competitions have been held on its slopes. These competitions include the ""Norseman triathlon"", billed as ""the world's most brutal iron-distance triathlon"". It starts in Eidfjord and finishes at the top of Gaustatoppen. The summit is accessible on foot in the summer, on a rocky pathway of medium difficulty, although the southern side of the mountain is very dangerous and inaccessible. The wreckage of an airplane crash lies there, as it is too difficult to remove it."
"The first element is ""Gausta"", the name of the whole mountain, the last element is the finite form of ""topp"" m 'top, summit'. The name ""Gausta"" is probably a shortened form for ""*Gaustafjell"" (Gausta mountain), because Gausta originally was the name of a farm beneath the mountain. (For the same development see Dovre.) The Old Norse form of the name was maybe ""*Gautstǫð"", the name is then a compound of ""gaut"" f 'flooded place', and ""stǫð"" f 'stead, landing place for boat'. (The farm lies at Rjukan river.)"
"There is a funicular railway inside the mountain, built for military purposes. This ascends from the base of the mountain almost to the summit. A short railway takes the passengers from the mountain base horizontally to the lower station deep inside the mountain. It was built to access the military radio relay station built at and inside the mountain top. The installation is now a tourist attraction. It was financed mainly by American military grants, and cost one million US dollars to build from 1954 to 1959."

The harbour is run by a committee, the chair of which is Charles Williams. Visitors are attracted to Portloe by its fishing, scenery, and walks."
"Portloe lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The South West Coast Path passes through the village."
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Portloe in 1870 but it was withdrawn in 1887 without ever having performed a rescue. It was kept at first in a boat house built at the end of the road above the beach. It proved difficult to move the boat across the beach so a new house was built in 1877 nearer the water. The first house was converted into a church; the second was a school for a while but has since become a private dwelling house.

It is known for espousing the causes of Dalits, encouraging women's empowerment and taking pro-poor positions on economic issues. It has managed to maintain an independent position, despite an increasingly polarized media landscape in Karnataka. Prajavani uses the tagline ""the most trusted Kannada daily newspaper"", which appears below its masthead."
"Prajavani was the leading Kannada newspaper for decades, until it was overtaken in circulation by ""Vijaya Karnataka"" (VK) in 2004. The gulf between PV and the upstart VK became huge for a while, but the two newspapers appear to be competing much more closely as of 2014, with PV having significantly recovered ground according to industry numbers. Some analysts have also attributed this to the launch of Vijaya Vani, by the original owner of Vijaya Karnataka, Vijay Sankeshwar and his VRL Group, which has apparently eaten into the readership of ""Vijaya Karnataka"".

"In 2011, the film spawned a sequel, under the title of ""Double Dhamaal"", with the lead cast reprising their roles."
"A third sequel, under the name ""Total Dhamaal"" was released in February 2019, with only Deshmukh, Warsi and Jaffrey returning with an entirely new cast and a fresh story, having no connections to ""Dhamaal"" and ""Double Dhamaal."""
"Four good-for-nothing friends - Roy (Ritesh Deshmukh), Adi (Arshad Warsi), Boman (Aashish Chaudhary), and Manav(Javed Jaffrey) - are kicked out of their house by their landlady (Suhasini Mulay) for not paying their rents. Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan. Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. However, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to Dwiwedi. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal, not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni (Murli Sharma). He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered, he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words ""horse"" and ""grass."" He interprets these words to be some code language. The four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass on the painting, he immediately arrests them."
"On the highway, Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realizing that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of Don Bose (Prem Chopra). He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 crore in the St. Sebastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree, breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile, all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. They manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off."
"Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently, a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money."
"All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. All of them except Kabir reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'. Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow defecates on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened. Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends. They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination."
"The film's soundtrack is composed by Adnan Sami with lyrics penned by Sameer. The songs, ""Dekho Dekho"" and ""Miss India Marthi Mujhpe"", were both known as the title song, since the main chorus of both the songs included the title ""Dhamaal""."

"Bill grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah and as a child, his mother was a prostitute and drug addict who was often beaten in front of him. He had to steal, to eat from trash cans, and once was caught trying to break into a bicycle store to try to steal something to sell for food."
"The few friends he had were mostly in street gangs, and Bill drank and smoked cannabis often. His mother was often evicted, and he lived in foster homes. Schuffenhauer's maternal grandmother, Sadie Muniz, took him in as he was about to enter junior high in Roy, Utah. ""She reminded me to never give up and always push on,"" he said."

= = = Trams in New Zealand = = =
"Trams in New Zealand were a major form of transport from the 19th century into the mid-20th century. New Zealand's first (horse) tramway was established in 1862 (Nelson), followed by a steam tramway in 1871 (Thames), and the first electric tramway in 1900 (Maori Hill, Dunedin). The tram systems in the main centres, and in some smaller towns, were soon electrified. By the 1950s, all systems were in the process of being replaced by trolley-buses or buses. The last tram service closed in 1964, in Wellington. A tram running parallel with a public road opened in Western Springs, Auckland, in 1980 and a central city loop line in Christchurch in 1995. Both are heritage lines."
"Some moves are proceeding to extend tram use in New Zealand again. In Auckland, the MOTAT line was extended in 2006–07 to reach a second site of the museum, and the former Auckland Regional Council promoted the creation of an Auckland waterfront tram line, originally with MOTAT vehicles, but will initially operate former Melbourne trams leased from Bendigo Tramways Company Limited. The Auckland Tramway Limited opened 6 August 2011 with the support of Waterfront Auckland (later merged into Panuku Development Auckland) and the new Auckland Council."
"In Christchurch, the city loop is currently operating on a limited circuit after being reopened 27 November 2013 following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011 which halted services while the CBD was closed off. The tramway was being extended in several small stages starting late 2000s and was nearly complete when the 2011 earthquake struck. While these proposals are all officially heritage / tourist lines, there is some investigation into later extension or conversion for normal transport use. This line was extended in 2014 with the reopening of the full pre-earthquake circuit and the opening of the nearly complete extension through the mall and High Street."
"In 1862 the first horse tramway in New Zealand, between Nelson and the port, opened as part of the Dun Mountain Railway, built to export ore from the mine in the hills above Nelson. Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864."
"Horse-drawn lines also opened in the main centres; Auckland and Devonport in 1886, Dunedin 1879, Christchurch 1880 and Dunedin 1879."
"At Grahamstown (now Thames) in the North Island where gold had also been found, a steam tramway to Tararu was opened on 2 December 1871, but closed on 11 November 1874, due to 'not sufficient traffic'. A steam locomotive for the tramway was built at Mechanics Bay in 1872 by Fraser and Tinne."
"Suleman had tapped into Sydney's Assyrian community, many of whom had remortgaged their homes."
"In April 2004, Suleman was jailed for 21 months, with a 12-month non-parole period, for four fraud offences."
"Two days shy of being released from a 21-month jail term in 2005 the corporate regulator struck again, laying 26 new charges."
Karl Suleman Enterprizes fleeced 2062 investors who committed $130.7 million between them – by inviting them to invest in a trolley collection business that promised investors returns of 100 per cent a year.
"But instead of their money going into that business, the money was used to fund Suleman's extravagant lifestyle."
"Suleman and his wife Vivienne bought properties, luxury cars, boats and planes, sponsored charity events and gave lavish gifts as well as dinners for former United States presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton."
Some of the money was used to service a $13 million loan taken out to finance a range of IT and mobile phone ventures under the Froggy Group banner.
"Documents filed with the court by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed that investors, mostly from Sydney's Assyrian community, were induced to put between $50,000 and $150,000 into the trolley business on the promise that they would receive fortnightly returns of between $4000 and $25,000."
"While investors received some fortnightly payments as promised, the money earned by the trolley collection business fell well short of being sufficient to sustain the promised payments."
"The company's liquidators said in their report that between July 2000 and November 2001 the business made a net profit of $275,096 but was paying out $2 million a week to investors seeking high returns."
"Suleman started the trolley business in 1993, providing trolley collections from supermarkets stretching from Cairns to Adelaide. Supermarkets paid Suleman an agreed fee out of which he paid subcontractors to do the work."
The District Court heard 15 people invested more than $3 million in Suleman's supermarket trolley collection business in 2000 and 2001.
"Thirteen of them lost a total of more than $800,000."
The founder of the Froggy Group – was sentenced to 7 and a half years jail after pleading guilty to 26 charges.
The judge found Suleman knew the income from his business was not enough to repay the investors.
"He said it was serious white collar crime, and that Suleman had breached the trust of naive investors so he could live a lifestyle far beyond his legitimate income."

"Burstall was inspired to establish the theatre after returning from New York City. She introduced off-Broadway contemporary theatre to Melbourne through La Mama. Numerous actors and writers have appeared and worked at La Mama, including Graeme Blundell, Kerry Dwyer, Jack Hibberd, and John Romeril, all of whom formed the Australian Performing Group. In 1976, Burstall turned over the day-to-day operations of La Mama to Liz Jones, who remains the theatre's artistic director as of 2013. Burstall remained the chief script adviser until about 1998."
"Betty Burstall was predeceased by husband, film director Tim Burstall, in 2004. She died on 14 June 2013, at the age of 87, survived by two sons and their wives, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The actress Sigrid Thornton is her daughter-in-law."
"A distinctive feature of many Australasian trams was the ""drop-centre"", a lowered central section between bogies (wheel-sets), to make passenger access easier by reducing the number of steps required to get inside of the vehicle."
"Californian combination cars had an enclosed centre section, with open-sided sections at each end. Hong Kong or toast rack (toastrack) cars were open, with the roof supported by a row of stanchions on each side. Most electric trams were single-deck, but Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and initially Dunedin had some open-top double-deck trams. These were popular with courting couples! The Wellington Fiducia trams had access at each end only, with no separate middle section or centre doors."
"The Engineers of the Auckland Electric Tramway Company, BET Company designed their own tramcars, earlier models were built by Brush Engineering in Loughborough, construction post the Great War was exclusively by Auckland Coach Builders and increasingly the Tramway's own workshops at Royal Oak on Manukau Road. Rear entrance Dinghy ""A type"" four wheelers, and toast rack trams were trialled in the early years and a small number of C type double deckers used until the 1920s. The ""Combo"" or B type design pretty much laid the basic design of Auckland tram down from 1902. Entrances at either end, platform steps within the bodyline of the tramcar. The in-house design progression moved to the addition of windscreens, a separate Motorman's compartment from the M type in 1908 and a seat design and layout for 52 seated passengers that remained standard until closure in 1956. Dalliance with riveted steel construction with the Art Deco ""Semi-steel"" N type in the 1920s which included butterfly [double set] destinations set in a V shape which could be read even when trams were parked bumper to bumper, double set saloon doorways a return to traditional wooden construction with the 1929/30 Big Cars with minor improvements to seating design and finally the 1930s Streamliner design, which had curving pillar frames, 7'6"" over the chassis and 8' at the window sill level and reducing again to the roofline. The design change of the bodies was cosmetically pleasing, but still seated only 52 passengers on wooden seats. Six of the streamliners used EMB trucks imported from the UK, primarily where they were used under Double Deckers. The remainder used Brush Improved Trucks, a design little changed for 30 years which were the mainstay of the Auckland fleet."
"Trams were standard gauge (), except for Wellington and Gisborne, ; Dunedin, ; Napier and the Maori Hill (Dunedin) , the New Zealand railway gauge."

"Alfapop (, transliteration for: ""Alphapop"") is a Serbian power pop band from Belgrade."
"The band was formed in 2000 under the name Tir na n'Og (after Tír na nÓg, the land of eternal youth in Irish mythology). Initially, the band performed Irish folk and Celtic rock, and released one Celtic rock-oriented album. In 2008, the band changed the name to Alfapop and turned towards power pop sound, releasing their second album in 2010."
"The band was formed in 2000 by a group of Irish music enthusiasts. At first mostly playing Irish folk and songs by The Pogues and Young Dubliners, they gained audience's attention. Having changed a number of members the band got a stable lineup featuring Jovana Vujnović (vocals), Jovan Dragumilo (guitar and vocals), Miroslav Kočić (violin), Damir Žigić (drums) and Ranko Radovanov (bass guitar)."
"The band started recording their debut self-titled album in the autumn of 2005, and it was released in 2006 through One Records. The album featured songs both in English and Serbian language, with elements of punk rock and both Irish and Serbian folk music. Three promotional videos were recorded, for the tracks ""Brodovi"", ""Danny Boy"" and ""River""."
"In 2008, the band, now consisting of Vujnović, Dragumilo and Radovanov only, changed the name to Alfapop and started playing power pop, continuing, however, to perform songs they recorded as Tir na n'Og. In 2010, the band released the album ""Alfapop"" through Bulgarian record label AMAdea Records. The album featured nine songs in Serbian language, and the electronic music song ""Fantasy"", recorded by Vujnović, as the bonus track. Promotional videos were recorded for the songs ""Sati"" (""Hours"") and ""Hoću još"" (""I Want More""). The song ""Kao prvi put"" (""Like the First Time"") is a duet recorded with Charlie B singer Lazar Drecun."
"Soon after ""Alfapop"" release, Dragumilo stated that the band is planning to record a live album."

Sarm East Studios is a recording studio that was located on Osborn Street at the southern end of Brick Lane in east London.
The studio was established by Jill Sinclair and her brother John Sinclair with the help of engineers Mike Stone and Gary Lyons in 1973. It was previously called The City of London Recording Studios.
"The studio played host to artists such as Queen, Madonna, the Clash, Depeche Mode, Rush, Yes, ABC, INXS, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal and the Hoosiers."
"SARM East was later owned by SPZ Group, a holding company belonging to Jill Sinclair and her husband, producer Trevor Horn. It was closed down in the late 1990s, but Sarm Music Village belonging to SPZ group continues its legacy."
The studio had an early Solid State Logic (SSL) 4000E mixing console and was one of the first studios in London to install one. The SSL replaced an earlier Trident console with Allison automation.

Steel balls, screws, and nails were found in the bombs."
Uyghur separatists had committed the bombings. Responsibility for the attacks was claimed and acknowledged by factions of certain diaspora Uyghurs.
"Continuing tensions in Xinjiang have been a source of terrorism in China. Conflicts over Uyghur cultural aspirations resurfaced during the 1960s. In early February 1997 the execution of 30 suspected separatists who had been involved in the organisation of Meshrep during Ramadan resulted in large demonstrations, which culminated in the Gulja incident on 5 February, in which at least nine protesters were killed."

"The is an embankment dam near Ibigawa, Ibi District, Gifu Prefecture in Japan. The dam was completed in 2008 and will support a 153 MW hydroelectric power station that is expected to be fully operational in 2015. Currently, Unit 1 at 23 MW was commissioned in May 2014. The dam was originally intended to withhold the upper reservoir of a 400 MW pumped-storage power station until a design change in 2004. The dam is also intended for flood control and water supply. It is the largest dam by structural volume in Japan and withholds the country's largest reservoir by volume as well."
"In December 1957, Electric Power Development Company (J-Power) selected the Ibi River for study at the 23rd Electric Power Development Coordinating Meeting. By May 1976, the Ministry of Construction released their bulletin ""Policy on Tokuyama Dam Construction Project"". In December 1982, the project was incorporated into the Electric Power Development Basic Plan. It was approved by the government in 1998. The original project was a pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme which consisted of the Tokuyama Dam as the upper reservoir, the Sugihara Dam as the lower and the 400 MW Sugihara Power Plant."
"Construction on the dam started in May 2000 but by May 2004 J-Power and Chubu Electric announced they had changed the design of the project due to the concerns and protests of locals and groups. Instead of the pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, only the Tokuyama Dam would be constructed with a 153 MW conventional power station. Subsequently, the Sugihara Dam and Sugihara Power Plant were scrapped from the project. During construction, the long Tokunoyama"

Filling was complete in September. In October of the same year, J-Power passed oversight of the power station construction to Chubu. The first generator, Unit 1, was commissioned on 15 May 2014. Unit 2 should be commissioned by June 2015."
"The Tokuyama Dam is a long and high rock-fill embankment dam with a clay core. The total structural volume of the dam is . The dam creates a reservoir with a capacity, surface area of and catchment area of . The dam will support two Francis turbine-generators, one with a 130 MW capacity which will be located in an underground power station downstream.

"The Meridian Highway Bridge is a bridge that formerly carried U.S. Route 81 across the Missouri River between Nebraska and South Dakota. The Meridian Highway Bridge connects Yankton, South Dakota with rural Cedar County, Nebraska. The Meridian Bridge is a double deck bridge, with the top level having carried traffic into South Dakota from Nebraska, and the lower level having carried traffic into Nebraska from South Dakota."
"The bridge crosses the Missouri River, connecting Yankton, South Dakota to the north with Cedar County, Nebraska to the south. Prior to the construction of the bridge, traffic moved between these two points via a ferry service, started in 1870, and a seasonal pontoon bridge, first installed in 1890. The pontoon bridge was disassembled and rebuilt twice a year, once to float on open water, and once to be placed on solid ice. After a 1915 initiative to build a permanent bridge faltered with the U.S. entrance into World War I, a new effort was started by the Yankton Chamber of Commerce 1919. Though fundraising problems caused a temporary halt in 1922, the new bridge, featuring a movable span to allow for river navigation, was completed during the summer of 1924."
"The dedication ceremony was held on October 11, 1924 and the bridge opened as a toll bridge. It was the last link of the Meridian Highway, which became U.S. Route 81, to be completed. It was designed for use by trains on the lower level of the bridge and vehicular traffic on the upper level; a lift mechanism allowed river traffic to pass below. However, trains never used the lower level. In 1953, all tolls were lifted and the two levels were converted to one-way traffic, northbound on the top, southbound on the bottom."
"In the 1980s, the lift mechanism and counterweights were removed, and the decorative iron railings on the upper level were replaced by Jersey barricades."
The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
"On May 9, 2008, a 10-ton gross weight limit was placed on the bridge after an inspection found corrosion on the gusset plates. It was replaced by the Discovery Bridge upon its opening on October 11, 2008, exactly 84 years after the dedication of the Meridian Highway Bridge."
"The bridge was used as location for filming a scene of the 2016 film ""Until Forever""."
"With completion of the Discovery Bridge, the Meridian Bridge has been converted into a pedestrian/bike trail. The bridge reopened in November 2011 to non-motorized traffic only. A two block-long pedestrian plaza has been added."

"The Prometheus is traveling back to Earth with a Hyperspace engine from an Al'kesh. Every couple of hours, the Prometheus has to jump out of hyperspace to cool down the Al'kesh hyperspace engine. The Prometheus comes near a nebula that Samantha Carter thinks doesn't conform to nebulae she has previously studied. When they jump out of hyperspace, the Prometheus is attacked by an unknown vessel. They can't jump into hyperspace because the engines need to cool down. The Prometheus is chased into a gas cloud by the alien ship. Samantha Carter is knocked out when she tries to convert power from auxiliary to the hyperspace engine to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud. When she wakes up, all the crew members other than her have disappeared. She alone must get herself and them to safety. She has visions of a little girl running around the ship, playing with bubbles and of her friends, who vocalize her worries and theories about her predicament. Teal'c at one point grabs Carter by the arm and warns her that if she falls asleep she will die."
"The hallucination of Daniel Jackson frankly confesses that he is unreal but he is present because there is something she has overlooked. The hallucination of Teal'c warns her that this whole scenario could be a result of the hostile alien species mind-probing, with a view to her inadvertently surrendering information about the Prometheus' engine technology. Daniel then reappears and tells her that the 'nebula' may be a living being which is why she and the alien ship are stuck inside."
"The hallucinations of Jacob Carter and of Jack O'Neill serve as a means by which Carter confronts her personal life and her relationships (in particular when talking to 'Jack', her feelings for him). 'Jack' tells her he will always be there for her, no matter what."
After an encounter with the small girl who is playing with bubbles Carter hits on a solution. She engages the hyperspace engines with only a fraction of the usual amount of power. This has the effect of rendering the ship partially intangible.
"She contacts the alien ship and offers them the solution to escaping the nebula in exchange for the return of the crew and safe passage. After a confused crew are beamed back in to the Prometheus, Carter creates a hyperspace bubble large enough to encompass both the Prometheus and the alien ship and they both exit the nebula safely. The aliens keep their end of the bargain and jet away. Carter relieves herself of duty and is escorted to the infirmary for massive concussion."

The building has 39 floors of tenant space and the two spires at the top cover the main roof and HVAC equipment."
"Although the building looks as though it is split down the middle, the two sides are only slightly disjointed until nearing the top, where there is a gap between them. At times, its slanted roof—which has been likened to a skyscraper slashed with a knife—displays local sports slogans on its face, such as ""GO BEARS"" and ""GO SOX"". It also displayed ""VOTE 2008"" during the 2008 election day rally at Grant Park."

(By TCL bus: lines 3, 89, and by train, from the Saint-Paul suburb, - Lozanne)."
"Dardilly, with its , includes three valleys oriented north south: the valley of ruisseau de la Beffe to the west, the valley of the ruisseau des Planches and the valley of the ruisseau de Serres to the east. Its altitude varies between 260 and 390 metres, allowing exceptional views over the , the Monts du Lyonnais and even on clear days the Alps, from Vercors to Mont Blanc."
"The Town also possesses 1.73 km of leafy forests of ones and of farmland. Many paths for walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers criss-cross these spaces:"
Bordering communes include:
"The name Dardilly may originate from the Gallo-Roman name Dardiliacus, if the town was founded in that period, but there is no historic proof for this hypothesis, although the remains of an aqueduct built by Claudius to bring the waters of the Brévenne River (a tributary of the Azergues, itself a tributary of the Saône) to Lyon have been found nearby. More likely, the name Dardilly originated at the time of its first surviving mention, in the 10th century cartulary of Ainay Abbey, which possessed several lands here."
"In the Middle Ages, the village, constructed on a mound, was made up of a church dedicated to Saint Pancras, an adjacent cemetery and about twenty houses. In 1210, at the time of the feudal wars, the Count of Beaujeu tried to seize the city of Lyon and its then archbishop, Renaud II de Forez, fortified Dardilly as part of his defence of Lyon by building a wall and ditch around the existing settlement."
"In the time of Jean-Marie Vianney - the late 18th and early to middle 19th centuries - Dardilly was an agricultural and wine-growing town, with some beautiful houses built by wealthy people from Lyons who spent the summer months here. The population was about 1500 inhabitants. At the end of the 19th century the vines were ravaged by phylloxera and many of the town's inhabitants left for Lyons to find work, bringing the population down to 982 in 1911. The vine-growers that remained went over to growing fruit."
In 1986 Pope John-Paul II visited Dardilly to see Vianney's birthplace on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth.
"The active population of Dardilly is 3546. Out of the employed residents of the commune, 25.6% work in Dardilly, 17.4% work in another TECHLID (Technopole économique de l'Ouest Lyonnais - Technopolis of West Lyonnais) commune, 52.3% work in another (non-TECHLID) commune within the département and 4.7% work outside the département."

"The William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center is the long-distance ground travel (rail and bus) terminal serving the Syracuse, New York area. It is served by Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, Megabus, and Trailways. Local and regional bus transportation is provided by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (CENTRO). Various taxi firms service the Center, as well. The Regional Transportation Center is located on the north side of Syracuse, adjacent to the Central New York Regional Market and near Destiny USA."
"Syracuse is served by two trains daily on the ""Lake Shore Limited"", four trains daily of the ""Empire Service"", and two trains daily on the ""Maple Leaf""."
"When the financially desperate New York Central Railroad sold off its elevated right-of-way through downtown Syracuse to the State of New York in 1962, all rail service was re-routed onto a former freight bypass to the north of the city center. The elevated line and train station had been in service for less than 30 years, having replaced tracks that ran at-grade through the center of Washington Street."
"From this time until the late 1990s, bus service remained at the former train station downtown, but with the former train route converted into Interstate 690 (a downtown freeway, in vogue among mid-century urban planners), rail passengers were forced to use a ""temporary"" structure near the freight yards in East Syracuse, opened on August 29, 1962. Both options proved decidedly unpopular, with the train station in particular becoming synonymous with Amtrak's many woes."
"Opened in 1998, the Regional Transportation Center replaced both venues, re-integrating bus and rail service for the first time since the early 1960s. There were provisions built for OnTrack, Syracuse's commuter train line built on the former Lackawanna right-of-way through Armory Square, to call at the station. However, a bridge that was intended to connect the two lines was never built after CSX claimed construction could destabilize its freight rail bridge, and the OnTrack program was axed due to low ridership. The station is named for William F. Walsh, a former mayor of Syracuse and representative in the U.S. Congress."
"The station is built at ground level, with bus loading/unloading areas in front of the main entrance, and stairs and an elevator leading up to the tracks, which are on an embankment. A central concourse with shops and a waiting room links the two areas. Trains call at a single high-level island platform serving one (nominally eastbound) track; provisions were made for cross-platform transfers with OnTrack on the other side, but the program was canceled before service ever reached the station."
"Fifteen CENTRO bus routes serve the Walsh Regional Transportation Center from Auburn, Fulton, Liverpool, Oswego, Phoenix, Skaneateles, Syracuse, and nearby areas."
"The most frequently serviced corridor is between the Regional Transportation Center and the Downtown Syracuse CENTRO Transit Hub (at Salina and Adams Streets), via Route Nos. 16, 46, 50, 116, 216, 316, and 550. Transfers to buses serving other routes may be made at Destiny USA or the Downtown Transit Hub. Standard local fares are $2.00 per person; with children aged 6-9, seniors 65+ and persons with disabilities at $1.00 per person. Children under 6 are free. Fares for the longer distance regional bus routes are on a zone basis, up to $4.00 each way per person for the Auburn (Aub36) line, and $5.00 for the Oswego (Osw46) line."

It can be divided into three smaller halls, and, when used for concerts with a 60 foot by 40 foot stage, can seat 2,000 (in one of the smaller halls), 3,000 (in two of the smaller halls) or 5,900 (in the entire hall) for concerts, stage shows, and other shows, this so that there are no bad seats in the house. Many of those seats used for concerts are in telescopic risers; there are 18 telescopic units at the arena, set up in sections of six; as a result, there are six sections of riser seating and a total of 3,216 in the risers (536 per section)."
SeaGate Convention Centre also features of meeting space.

"The Rising of the North of 1569, also called the Revolt of the Northern Earls or Northern Rebellion, was an unsuccessful attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots."
"Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as queen of England in 1558. Elizabeth's accession was disputed due to the questioned legitimacy of the marriage of her parents – Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Under Henry VIII and his advisor Thomas Cromwell, power was gradually shifted from regional institutions to royal control. This course was encouraged by Elizabeth's counsellors such as William Cecil and a policy of centralization was the approach favoured by Elizabeth herself at least in regards to the northern border region."
"Opponents of Elizabeth looked to Mary, Queen of Scots, the descendant of Henry VIII's sister Margaret. The claims were initially put forward by Mary's father-in-law, King Henry II of France, and Mary upheld them after her return to Scotland in 1561."
"Many English Catholics, then a significant portion of the population, supported Mary's claim as a way to restore Roman Catholicism. This position was especially strong in Northern England, where several powerful nobles were Roman Catholics; there had been similar risings against Henry VIII; the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536 and Bigod's Rebellion of 1537. Supporters of Mary hoped for aid from France (among Scots) and possibly Spain (among English). Mary's position was strengthened by the birth of her son, James, in 1566 but weakened again when she was deposed in July 1567."
"The rebellion was led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. Seven hundred knights assembled at Brancepeth Castle. In November 1569 Westmorland and Northumberland occupied Durham. Thomas Plumtree celebrated Mass in Durham Cathedral. From Durham, the rebels marched south to Bramham Moor, while Elizabeth struggled to raise forces sufficient to confront them. But, hearing of a large force being raised by the Earl of Sussex, the rebels abandoned plans to besiege York, and captured Barnard Castle instead. They proceeded to Clifford Moor, but found little popular support. Sussex marched out from York on 13 December 1569 with 10,000 men against the rebels' 6,000, and was followed by 12,000 men under Baron Clinton. The rebel earls retreated northward and finally dispersed their forces, fleeing into Scotland."
"A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear."
"After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River. Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300–400 and capturing 200–300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile."
"Two of the rebellion's leaders, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, had fled into Scotland. Northumberland was captured by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and turned over to Elizabeth in 1572, who had him beheaded at York. After having been hidden at Ferniehirst Castle, Westmorland escaped to Flanders, where he died impoverished. His family lost their ancestral homes and his wife, Jane Howard, also fled to the Continent. She lived the rest of her life under house arrest. Her brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was first imprisoned, then pardoned. He was imprisoned again following the Ridolfi plot in 1571 and finally executed in 1572. Norfolk's treason charges included ""comforting and relieving of the English rebels that stirred the Rebellion in the North since they have fled out of the realm."" Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile."
"Queen Elizabeth declared martial law, exacting terrible retribution on the ordinary folk of the Yorkshire Dales, despite the lack of any popular support for the Earls' Rising, with her demand for at least 700 executions. The victims of this purge were, as a contemporary account said ""wholly of the meanest sort of people"", so that hardly a village escaped the sight of a public hanging. (Source: )"
"In 1570, Pope Pius V had tried to aid the rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in the papal bull ""Regnans in Excelsis"", but the document did not arrive until the rebellion had been suppressed. The bull gave Elizabeth more reason to view Catholics with suspicion. It inspired conspiracies to assassinate her, starting with the Ridolfi plot."
"In 1587, Elizabeth brought Mary, Queen of Scots, to trial for treason; she was convicted by the court and executed."
"The Rising of the North is the main conflict in the historical drama film ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018)."

The station airs the syndicated Kidd Kraddick Morning Show from KHKS Dallas on weekdays."
"WEZB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for FM radio stations. The transmitter site is off Behrman Highway in the city's Algiers neighborhood. The signal covers much of Southeastern Louisiana and Southwestern Mississippi. WEZB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries Entercom's Channel Q service, primarily for LGBTQ listeners."
"On September 1, 1945, 97.1 signed on the air. This was WRCM, the FM simulcast of AM 990 WJMR (now WGSO) and sister station to WJMR-TV 12 (now WVUE channel 8), all owned by George J. Mayoral. Then, around 1966–67 after the TV station had already been sold, the Supreme Broadcasting Company bought the two radio stations and changed the call signs to WNNR and WNNR-FM. At the time, the stations were located in the Jung Hotel at 1500 Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. WNNR-FM had a power of only 20,500 watts from an antenna 310 feet atop the building, a fraction of its current wattage and antenna height."
"On January 2, 1972, EZ Communications acquired the FM station. It became WEZB, part of a chain of Beautiful Music stations such as WEZC Charlotte, WEZR Washington and others owned by EZ. While it was profitable, it was not able to best WWL-FM (now WLMG) in the easy listening format. Briefly in the 1970s when disco music became a popular genre, 97.1 became ""Disco 97 FM"" on Thursday, February 8, 1979.

"Pousa served as ispán (""comes"") of Vas County in 1225. During the reign of Andrew II, he was a faithful supporter of crown prince Béla, who held the title of Duke of Transylvania after 1226, following the agreement between the king and his son after a series of conflicts for the throne. Sometime Duke Béla acted independently of his father, as it is demonstrated by his grant of tax exemption to Transylvanian knights in 1231 and by his donation of lands situated in Wallachia in 1233. Pousa served as master of the treasury (""camerarius"") for Béla in 1225."
"He was appointed voivode of Transylvania in 1227. According to László Markó, he held the office between 1226 and 1229, however existing charters only prove the term of voivodeship in 1227. He served as master of the horse for duke Béla between 1229 and 1233."

= = = AVX-512 = = =
"AVX-512 are 512-bit extensions to the 256-bit Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instructions for x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) proposed by Intel in July 2013, and implemented in Intel's Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) and Skylake-X CPUs; this includes the Core-X series (excluding the Core i5-7640X and Core i7-7740X), as well as the new Xeon Scalable Processor Family and Xeon D-2100 Embedded Series."
"AVX-512 is not the first 512-bit SIMD instruction set that Intel has introduced in processors: the earlier 512-bit SIMD instructions used in the first generation Xeon Phi coprocessors, derived from Intel's Larrabee project, are similar but not binary compatible and only partially source compatible."
AVX-512 consists of multiple extensions that may be implemented independently. This policy is a departure from the historical requirement of implementing the entire instruction block. Only the core extension AVX-512F (AVX-512 Foundation) is required by all AVX-512 implementations.
"The AVX-512 instruction set consists of several separate sets each having their own unique CPUID feature bit; however, they are typically grouped by the processor generation that implements them."
"The VEX prefix used by AVX and AVX2, while flexible, did not leave enough room for the features Intel wanted to add to AVX-512. This has led them to define a new prefix called EVEX."
"Compared to VEX, EVEX adds the following benefits:"
"The extended registers, SIMD width bit, and opmask registers of AVX-512 are mandatory and all require support from the OS."
"The AVX-512 instructions are designed to mix with 128/256-bit AVX/AVX2 instructions without a performance penalty. However, AVX-512VL extensions allows the use of AVX-512 instructions on 128/256-bit registers XMM/YMM, so most SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions have new AVX-512 versions encoded with the EVEX prefix which allow access to new features such as opmask and additional registers. Unlike AVX-256, the new instructions do not have new mnemonics but share namespace with AVX, making the distinction between VEX and EVEX encoded versions of an instruction ambiguous in the source code. Since AVX-512F only works on 32- and 64-bit values, SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions that operate on bytes or words are available only with the AVX-512BW extension (Byte & Word support)."
"The width of the SIMD register file is increased from 256 bits to 512 bits, and expanded from 16 to a total of 32 registers ZMM0-ZMM31. These registers can be addressed as 256 bit YMM registers from AVX extensions and 128-bit XMM registers from Streaming SIMD Extensions, and legacy AVX and SSE instructions can be extended to operate on the 16 additional registers XMM16-XMM31 and YMM16-YMM31 when using EVEX encoded form."
"Most AVX-512 instructions may indicate one of 8 opmask registers (k0–k7). For instructions which use a mask register as an opmask, register `k0` is special: a hardcoded constant used to indicate unmasked operations. For other operations, such as those that write to an opmask register or perform arithmetic or logical operations, `k0` is a functioning, valid register. In most instructions, the opmask is used to control which values are written to the destination. A flag controls the opmask behavior, which can either be ""zero"", which zeros everything not selected by the mask, or ""merge"", which leaves everything not selected untouched. The merge behavior is identical to the blend instructions."
"The opmask registers are normally 16 bits wide, but can be up to 64 bits with the AVX-512BW extension. How many of the bits are actually used, though, depends on the vector type of the instructions masked. For the 32-bit single float or double words, 16 bits are used to mask the 16 elements in a 512-bit register. For double float and quad words, at most 8 mask bits are used."
"The opmask register is the reason why several bitwise instructions which naturally have no element widths had them added in AVX-512. For instance, bitwise AND, OR or 128-bit shuffle now exist in both double-word and quad-word variants with the only difference being in the final masking."
"The opmask registers have a new mini extension of instructions operating directly on them. Unlike the rest of the AVX-512 instructions, these instructions are all VEX encoded. The initial opmask instructions are all 16-bit (Word) versions. With AVX-512DQ 8-bit (Byte) versions were added to better match the needs of masking 8 64-bit values, and with AVX-512BW 32-bit (Double) and 64-bit (Quad) versions were added so they can mask up to 64 8-bit values. The instructions KORTEST and KTEST can be used to set the x86 flags based on mask registers, so that they may be used together with non-SIMD x86 branch and conditional instructions."
"Many AVX-512 instructions are simply EVEX versions of old SSE or AVX instructions. There are, however, several new instructions, and old instructions that have been replaced with new AVX-512 versions. The new or majorly reworked instructions are listed below. These ""foundation"" instructions also include the extensions from AVX-512VL and AVX-512BW since those extensions merely add new versions of these instructions instead of new instructions."

"Odette Valery (spelled Valéry in French publications), née Helene Vasilardi, (1883–?) was an Italian dancer of Greek parentage. She made her début at La Scala in 1898 at the age of fifteen. She moved to Paris where she danced with the Ballet Excelsior at the Folies Bergère. She came to regard dancing ""en pointe"" as ""old-fashioned"" and made her name doing reconstructions of ancient Greek dances in bare feet. Later she portrayed Cleopatra and did an Egyptian dance with a live asp. She was well-educated and spoke French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as some English and she played the piano well. In 1908, she caused a sensation in New York when she danced in the last act of ""Samson and Delilah"" at the Manhattan Opera House where she had been engaged by Oscar Hammerstein I. Her dance included the participation of one of three snakes (with fangs removed) which were cared for by their own groom, Robert, whom she had engaged in addition to other servants who travelled with her. In 1910 she was earning $1000 a week when dancing in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. She owned several automobiles and amassed a fortune in jewellery. She spent lavishly and by 1912, she was destitute. Her money ran out when she had to have an operation and as a result she could not work for an extended period. Although her weekly salary was what a workman earned in a year at the time, she hadn't saved a penny. She was found ill and starving in a cheap boarding house in Notting Hill, London where she was being cared for by her seven-year-old son Gaeton.

I want to do more than my environmental blog and sign petitions. I have a respect for the planet.” In line with her commitment, she left the march early to protest storage of liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas in her hometown region of Seneca Lake, New York."
"An average day’s walk was expected to be 14–15 miles. Campsites for tents were prearranged. Organizers had hoped to haul all of the gear and supplies via bicycles to minimize energy consumption and maximize sustainability, but after some intensive research this proved infeasible, so trucks running on biodiesel or vegetable oil fuel were used. Research into solar cookers, composting toilets, determined how far the marchers were able to use sustainable methods to handle food and energy needs, and human waste. Participants and volunteers shared daily chores including but not limited to setting up camp, food preparation and clean-up. Interactive workshops focused on climate change, the anthropogenic effect on the environment, and active solutions."
"Throughout history, marches have been associated with political and social change. Examples include but are not limited to: the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913, Gandhi's Salt March to defy Britain's imperial power, Martin Luther King Jr's Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights and the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament.

"""Calypso"" underwent a period of repair and was refitted at Portsmouth between July 1793 and March 1796. Her third commission began in January 1796 under Commander Andrew Smith, who took her to sea following her repair and refit to join Admiral Duncan's North Sea Fleet."
"In January 1797 Commander Richard Worsley took command and operated ""Calypso"" as a convoy escort and cruiser. Commander C. Collis succeeded Worsley in November 1797. Collis continued operating in this role until April 1798 when ""Calypso"" returned to Portsmouth for refit."
"Commander Henry Garrett took command in April 1799 and was succeeded by Commander Joseph Baker in November of that year. Baker took ""Calypso"" to the Caribbean, sailing for the Leeward Islands in February 1800. Whilst under Baker's command on this station, ""Calypso"" participated in several notable actions."
"In October 1801 Commander Robert Barrie assumed command, followed by Commander Edward Brenton in April 1802, and finally by Commander William Venour in August 1802."
"On 30 July 1803, ""Calypso"" and the 74-gun ""Goliath"" were escorting a convoy of heavily laden West Indiamen from Jamaica. The convoy was caught in a violent storm that dismasted 21 of the vessels. One of the merchantmen ran down ""Calypso"", sinking her with the loss of all hands."
"As an unrated sloop-of-war ""Calypso"" was too small a ship to warrant a Post-captain and was instead commanded by an officer in the rank of Commander, although aboard ship he was afforded the courtesy title of Captain. The commanders of HMS ""Calypso"" were:"
"From 1794 the Admiralty allowed a crew of 121 for a 16-gun sloop such as HMS ""Calypso"". The Commander and Lieutenants were professional sea officers, trained in gunnery, navigation and seamanship in equal measure and appointed to the ship by Admiralty Commission. The Lieutenants were all at least nineteen years of age, having served a minimum six-year apprenticeship as Midshipman or Master's Mate before undertaking and passing the examination for Lieutenant. The Commander would usually have been an experienced Lieutenant who had come to the attention of the Admiralty or his Commander-in-Chief through some distinction in service or by having an influential patron. The Commander's duties were almost identical to those of a Post Captain, although on a smaller scale, the exception being that as a Commander he had no automatic rights of promotion to the flag list and could quite easily remain a Commander for the rest of his career."
"The Warrant Officers were specialists appointed to the ship by Navy Board Warrant. The Wardroom Warrant Officers were allowed all the privileges of a Commissioned Officer, eating and sleeping with the Lieutenants. The Standing Warrant Officers stayed with the ship throughout its commission and remained aboard when the ship was placed in ordinary. They were heavily involved with the fitting out of the ship and general maintenance. Cockpit Officers had a higher status than the Petty Officers and could generally expect to reach the Wardroom in time, with its members aspiring to be Lieutenants, Masters, Pursers or Surgeons. Petty Officers performed particular roles that required additional skills or expertise, and they were usually rated by the Captain or First Lieutenant on joining the ship. Unlike the Warrant Officers, the Petty Officers had no security in his rank; the Captain could demote a Petty Officer for negligence. A Petty Officer could also lose his rating on moving to a new ship."

Williams made his HBO debut against then-undefeated Walter Matthysse, winning by a tenth-round technical knockout. That was followed by a victory over former junior welterweight world champion Sharmba Mitchell. He knocked Mitchell down three times en route to a fourth-round TKO."
"Williams became the mandatory challenger for WBO Welterweight Champion Antonio Margarito. The match took place July 14, 2007, in Carson, California, at the Home Depot Center with Williams winning a unanimous decision in which turned out to be a close fight where Williams' seemingly stronger finish seemed to seal him the decision victory in the eyes of boxing experts and fans alike."
"Williams fought Carlos Quintana on February 9, 2008 in his first defense of his title. Williams lost to Quintana by decision in what many considered a minor upset."
"Williams and Quintana had a rematch at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut on June 7, 2008 for the WBO Welterweight title, at Williams' request. Williams got off to a quick start when a left hand sent Quintana into a daze as several follow-up barrages put Quintana down. He got up, but Williams opened up with dozens of unanswered punches as the referee jumped in to stop the fight while Quintana was going down again."
Williams was rumored to be moving up two weight classes to fight Kelly Pavlik for the WBC Middleweight title but instead Pavlik himself decided to move up two weight classes himself to fight Bernard Hopkins. Williams fought Andy Kolle on September 25. Williams dominated the fight from the start and recorded a first-round knockout in 1:37 seconds.
"After failing to secure another meaningful contest at welterweight, Williams vacated his WBO welterweight title in order to fight Verno Phillips for the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."

"Williams was then preparing to fight Middleweight Champion Kelly Pavlik in a bout scheduled to take place on October 3, 2009 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The bout was postponed when it was discovered Pavlik had a staph infection in his knuckle and had been rescheduled for December 5. However, the bout was called off for a second time six weeks prior to the fight because Pavlik's infection had not completely healed."
"On December 5, 2009 Paul Williams fought Sergio Martínez in a war of a twelve-round main event. In the first round Martinez was knocked down due to bad balance and a grazing left hand that landed just below the ear. In the final seconds of the 1st round though Martinez scored a knockdown of his own over Williams. The next two rounds were heavily in Martinez's favor as he hit Williams with barrages of counter punches. After Martinez was seemingly won the first 3 rounds, rounds 4-7 showed Williams coming back effectively landing hard lefts to the head of Martinez. In rounds 8-10 Martinez again confused Williams with using different varieties of punches, including straight lead lefts to the body followed by right hooks to the head and straight lefts to the face. The final 2 rounds showed much fatigue in Martinez and Williams but both warriors fought through to the end, although Williams seemed to win both of the last 2 rounds by being the far more active boxer (while the punching exchanges were very closely contested during those final 2 rounds as well), which would ultimately prove to be the difference and as a result of having far superior activity during those final 2 rounds, Williams won a close majority decision over Martinez. The judges scored the fight 114-114, 115-113 for Williams and 119-110 for Williams, thus making Williams emerge as the majority decision winner."
"After his close win over Sergio Martínez, Paul Williams moved on to face Puerto Rican prospect Kermit Cintrón. The two met on May 8, 2010 Live on Saturday Night HBO Boxing. In the fourth round, Kermit Cintron fell out of the ring unintentionally and was not allowed to continue fighting due to hitting the arena floor. Williams was ahead on two of the three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage and was declared the winner by split technical decision. Cintron, who believed he should have been ahead on the scorecards, filed a complaint to have the ruling changed to a no-contest, claiming he was not given the five-minute recovery time allowed under California rules."
"A highly anticipated rematch with Sergio Martinez eventually materialized at Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey on November 20, 2010. Upon the Williams camp's insistence, the fight was contested at the catchweight limit of 158 pounds instead of the middleweight limit of 160, with Martinez's WBC Middleweight title on the line. The fight was billed as a potential ""fight-of-the-year,"" however the fight ended abruptly and dramatically when Sergio Martinez delivered a knockout blow with 2:02 left in the 2nd round. The punch was a short left cross that caught Williams right on the chin as he attempted to deliver a left-hand of his own. Williams' right hand was at his waist when the punch landed, rendering Paul Williams unconscious upon contact."
"On July 9, 2011, Paul Williams fought in a light middleweight contest in Atlantic City against former Cuban amateur sensation Erislandy Lara. Throughout the fight, Lara repeatedly hit Williams with hard left hands and appeared to have won the fight convincingly in the eyes of the HBO crew and those sitting at ringside. However, the judges awarded Williams with a narrow majority decision, a highly controversial verdict that ultimately led to the suspension of the three judges by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board."
"On May 27, 2012, Williams was severely injured when he crashed his motorcycle in Georgia. He swerved to avoid hitting a car while traveling at about 75 mph on the motorcycle and was launched sixty feet. Witnesses say he landed on his head and his body ""folded like a suitcase."" The accident left him with a part of his spinal cord severely bruised, paralyzing him from the waist down. Since it was bruised and not severed, it gives him a chance to regain sensation. The doctors told Williams the swelling could go down in a year or two, potentially giving him a chance of walking again. The accident came as Williams was preparing for his PPV main event against Canelo Alvarez on September 15. ""I'm just chilling in a wheelchair because I got tired of walking,"" Williams said in an interview with Jim Gray on ""Showtime Championship Boxing"" on the day he was supposed to fight.

Its deep cellar, lighted by oblong ground-level windows, houses a basement kitchen-dining room. On the main floor a broad central hall, with a graceful reverse-flight stairway rising to the low half-story above, separates two large rooms. Allegedly a separate brick kitchen structure once stood to the rear. When absorbed into the vast Joseph Wheeler estate in 1907, the house and surrounding farm became known as Sunnybrook.

"Operation Christmas Drop is a tradition that started in 1952 that serves as a training mission for the U.S. Air Force. It has since become the longest-running U.S. Department of Defense mission in full operation, and the longest-running humanitarian airlift in the world. Supported by the local communities of Guam, it is primarily conducted from Andersen Air Force Base and Yokota Air Base, and targets Micronesia."
"The operation was first conducted in 1951. Then, the aircrew of a WB-29 aircraft assigned to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, formerly assigned to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, was flying a mission to the south of Guam over the Micronesian atoll of Kapingamarangi. When they saw the islanders waving to them, the crew quickly gathered some items they had on the plane, placed them in a container with a parachute attached and dropped the cargo as they circled again."
"A witness to the first drop on the island of Agrigan said ""We saw these things come out of the back of the airplane and I was yelling: 'There are toys coming down'"". At the time the island had no electricity or running water, and the islands were periodically hit by typhoons. Some of the first containers failed to arrive where intended, and islanders swam out to retrieve some, while others were discovered months later some miles away."
"Today this unique Christmas tradition is continued with the donations from the residents and businesses of Guam. Each box dropped from a C-130 aircraft weighs nearly and contains items such as fishing nets, construction materials, powdered milk, canned goods, rice, coolers, clothing, shoes, toys and school supplies."
"It is the oldest ongoing Department of Defense mission which remains in full operation, and the longest running humanitarian airlift in the world. By 2006, more than of supplies were delivered. The operation gives troops the chance to practice humanitarian aid drops, as the troops will later be expected to conduct drops over Iraq or Afghanistan after deployment."
"Volunteers from Andersen Air Force Base, including 734th Air Mobility Squadron, and both crew and aircraft from the 36th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan, participate in the operation. Members of the Guam community also help the operation. Money is raised for the operation by sponsored activities such as golf tournaments and sponsored runs, as well as local businesses sponsoring individual boxes."
The 2006 operation saw 140 boxes dropped to 59 islands. The 2011 operation included dropping twenty five boxes of IV fluids to Fais Island in order to combat a local outbreak of dengue fever. The containers are dropped in water just off the beaches in order to avoid them hitting any of the locals.
"In 2014, The Pacific Air Forces delivered 50,000 pounds of supplies to 56 Micronesian Islands."

= = = John McCabe (composer) = = =
"John McCabe, (21 April 1939 – 13 February 2015) was a British composer and pianist. He created works in many different forms, including symphonies, ballets, and solo works for the piano. He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990. Guy Rickards described him as ""one of Britain's finest composers in the past half-century"" and ""a pianist of formidable gifts and wide-ranging sympathies"" ."
"McCabe was born in Huyton, Liverpool on 21 April 1939 (; ; ; ; ). His father was a physicist . McCabe was badly burned in an accident when he was a child and was home schooled for eight years . During this time, McCabe said that there was ""a lot of music in the house"", which inspired his future career . He explained ""My mother was a very good amateur violinist and there were records and printed music everywhere. I thought that if all these guys – Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert – can do it, then so can I!"" . By the age of 11 McCabe had composed 13 symphonies, but he later suppressed them, believing they were not good enough (; ). He subsequently attended Liverpool Institute ."
"After studies at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern) and in Munich, with composers Humphrey Proctor-Gregg, Thomas Pitfield, Harald Genzmer and others (; ; ), he embarked upon a career as both a composer and a virtuoso pianist (; ). Guy Rickards considers McCabe's early works to have been overlooked because he was perceived as a pianist rather than a composer . One of his early successes was the orchestral song cycle ""Notturni ed Alba"" (1970), based on a set of poems in medieval Latin about the theme of night (; ), which was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""an intoxicating creation, full of tingling atmosphere and slumbering passion"" (quoted in }}). His Concerto for Orchestra (1982) brought him international recognition , but it was not until the 1990s that he came to be viewed primarily as a composer, with the successes of the piano work ""Tenebrae"" (1992–93), which marked the deaths in 1992 of musicians Sir Charles Groves, William Mathias and Stephen Oliver, and was written for Barry Douglas; his Fourth Symphony, ""Of Time and the River"" (1993–94); and his third ballet ""Edward II"" (1995) , which won the 1998 Barclays Theatre Award ."
"He worked in almost every genre, though large-scale forms lie at the heart of his catalogue with seven symphonies, two dozen concertante works and eight ballet scores to his name . His numerous concerti include four for his own instrument, the piano (1966–76), three for one or two violins (1959, 1980, 2003) as well as for viola (1962), harpsichord (1968), oboe d'amore (1972), clarinet (1977), orchestra (1982), trumpet (1987) and flute (1990), and double concertos for viola and cello (1965) and clarinet and oboe (1988). His chamber works include seven string quartets, the third of which (1979) was inspired by the landscape of the Lake District . His solo instrumental music was mainly written for the piano; he composed 13 studies for the instrument, including ""Gaudí"" (1970), inspired by the architect; ""Mosaic"" (1980), inspired by Islamic art; and a series of seven (2000–9) each explicitly drawing inspiration from a different composer (; }. Other significant piano works include the ""Haydn Variations"" (1983), written to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth (; ; )."
"McCabe's style evolved gradually from an initial lyrical constructivism through a serialist phase, with a fascination with repetitive patterns leading to a more complex combination of processes to achieve more subtle forms of continuity . Rickards states that his influences included Vaughan Williams, Britten, Tippett and Karl Amadeus Hartmann , and he was also influenced by non-classical music including rock and jazz ."
He had a long-lasting association with the Presteigne Festival .
"McCabe first became known as a pianist. His repertoire was wide, from pre-classical to modern composers . He specialised in twentieth-century music, particularly by English composers. He gave the UK premiere of John Corigliano's Piano Concerto . Another specialism was the music of Haydn; McCabe's ""definitive"" mid-1970s recording of Haydn's complete piano sonatas was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""one of the great recorded monuments of the keyboard repertoire"" (quoted in ). He recorded several CDs with the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber ."
"From 1965 to 1968 McCabe was pianist‐in‐residence at University College, Cardiff . He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990, where his efforts to enhance the college's profile resulted in its merging with Thames Valley University (; . He also held visiting professorships at the universities of Melbourne, Australia and Cincinnati, USA during the 1990s . Among his notable pupils is Canadian composer Gary Kulesha ."
"McCabe wrote guides to the music of Haydn, Bartók and Rachmaninoff, and a book on contemporary English composer Alan Rawsthorne ."
McCabe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1985 for his services to music (; ; ) He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool .
"In 2014, McCabe won the Classical Music Award at the 59th Ivor Novello Awards ."
"He married Monica Smith, a former head of the Sittingbourne Music Society, in 1974 (; ). In December 2012 McCabe was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He continued to compose music during his treatment (; )."

In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign. The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz and 8VC."
"As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis. One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
The company currently employs 100 individuals.
"The company filed for bankruptcy on September 4, 2019 in Delaware (case number 19-11938). In an affidavit filed contemporaneously with the bankruptcy petition, Curtis Solsvig, III the acting CEO stated that the bankruptcy action was taken to allow the company to reorganize amidst ""investigations by certain federal and state investigatory bodies."""
"Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set. In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California. In 2016, uBiome received accreditation from the College of American Pathologists."
", the company first amplifies a portion of the bacterial gene that encodes 16S ribosomal RNA using PCR, then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA gene, in order to categorize the bacteria at the genus level. The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons. A 2014 report in ""Xconomy"" said the company outsources the sequencing. The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer."
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.
"uBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andMe, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley."
"Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval. The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues."
The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013.
"In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication."

Lyke, O.F.M., who had died of cancer on December 27, 1992, after only two years in office. He led the Archdiocese for over ten years. Donoghue retired as Archbishop on December 9, 2004, and was succeeded by Wilton D. Gregory, who had served as an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago."

= = = Bubba Wells = = =
"Charles Richard ""Bubba"" Wells (born July 26, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player, playing mostly for minor leagues. He played collegiately for Austin Peay State University and was named 1997 Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. Selected 34th by the Mavs in the 1997 NBA draft, the little-used small forward's NBA career was short-lived, consisting of just 39 games of the 1997–98 season. However, he did start two games in March 1998, in place of the injured Cedric Ceballos. His brief NBA career did feature one memorable game where he set the record for the shortest amount of playing time (less than 3 minutes) before fouling out, as part of a failed strategy to intentionally foul Dennis Rodman (a notoriously bad free throw shooter) to limit his scoring."
"His NBA career came to an abrupt end in 1998, after he was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Martin Müürsepp, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick in exchange for point guard Steve Nash. Wells never played a game for the Suns. He was later traded to the Chicago Bulls, also for whom he never played. He later played for the LaCrosse Bobcats of the CBA, the Oklahoma Storm of USBL, the Memphis Houn'Dawgs of the ABA, and overseas in Greece and the Philippines. He played for the Harlem Globetrotters in 2004–05. From June 2005 through May 2015, Wells was an assistant men's basketball coach at Austin Peay."
"On May 28, 2015, his appointment to the staff of Jon Harris at SIU Edwardsville was announced."
"Bubba Wells holds the dubious distinction of being the player with the quickest disqualification due to personal fouls in an NBA regular season game. In a December 29, 1997 game against the Chicago Bulls, then-Mavericks coach Don Nelson employed a desperate tactic to limit the Bulls' offense. He inserted Wells into the game with the express purpose of fouling power forward Dennis Rodman, a notoriously poor free throw shooter, away from the ball."
"The plan failed, however, when Rodman hit 9-of-12 free throws and Chicago went on to win the game 111–105. Wells fouled out late in the third quarter after registering his sixth personal foul in a total of three minutes' playing time. This strategy of intentionally fouling a bad free throw shooter is sometimes called Hack-a-Shaq, since it was later famously used against Shaquille O'Neal."
"The previous record-holder was Dick Farley of the Syracuse Nationals who was disqualified in five minutes on March 12, 1956."
"In August 2007, Wells married Tracee Jones, the former head women's basketball coach at Tennessee State University. The previous summer Wells served as a supporter to Jones on NBC TV game show, ""Deal or No Deal"". Wells has a daughter, Alyiah, and a son, Chase."
= = = Muttart Conservatory = = =
"The Muttart Conservatory is a botanical garden located in the North Saskatchewan river valley, across from the downtown core in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. One of the best-known landmarks of Edmonton, the conservatory consists of three city-operated greenhouses, public gardens, as well as four feature pyramids for display of plant species found across three biomes, with the fourth pyramid hosting as a seasonal display. A fifth minor skylight pyramid lights up the central foyer."
"A donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining funding supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department."
"The conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway, is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger pyramids are in area, and the two medium-sized ones are in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants."
"The Temperate pyramid houses plants typical of temperate climates, from such zones as the southern Great Lakes, Australia, and even the mountainous areas of Asia. Near the entrance and fed by a stream is a bog area, with white water lilies and parrot's feather. The bog merges into a woodland with mostly eastern deciduous trees and low shrubs but including redwoods, cedars and pampas grass. Eucalyptus trees and flowering shrubs complement the Australian section. In the woodland floor and alpine section are many tiny flowering plants, some native to Alberta and others from all over the world. Carefully controlled environmental conditions allow the plants to go dormant in winter and burst into spring growth of green leaves and colourful blooms."
"The plants from the Arid pyramid come from hot and cold dry areas spanning five continents. They share an ability to thrive in environments with dry air, irregular moisture and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. In spring 2013, the Arid Pyramid featured an Agave Americana plant bloom which reached a height of 30 feet before reaching the top of the pyramid. This plant was planted a year after the Muttart Conservatory first opened."
"The Tropical pyramid provides an enormous diversity of species; under a canopy of tall palms, banana and weeping fig are orchids, various hibiscus and the bird of paradise. The plants come from tropical rainforests, evergreen forests or grasslands, and are often showy and bright. A waterfall cascades into the centre of the pyramid where small fish and water lilies make their home. This pyramid has also been home in the past to a kiwi bird and a sloth. On March 11, 2013, the bud to an imported Amorphophallus titanum plant (commonly known as the corpse flower) budded and bloomed here on April 22."
"The ""Feature pyramid"" offers seasonal displays that change several times per year, focusing on themed displays and seasonal celebrations."
"Other amenities at the facility are an outdoor gazebo, gift shop, and the Culina Muttart Café. The café serves several menu items made with locally-sourced ingredients, including herbs and salad greens grown on-site at the greenhouse."
"The facility, owned and operated by the City of Edmonton, is also a popular site for special events, such as weddings. The conservatory underwent a $6.3 million renovation that was completed in June 2009."

"Toward the end of the war, Rupe resolved to get into the entertainment industry. After losing money he had invested in a small record company, he spent $200 on what were called ""race records"" at the time to systematically analyze them and determine the formula for records that would sell. He decided that the secret lay in a big band sound with a churchy feel. He found the recording talent he needed in the many after-hours clubs in the Watts district. He and Ben Siegert first started Juke Box Records in 1944 and after a few hits, he broke with his partners and started a new company, Specialty Records. The label soon thrived with Roy Milton, Percy Mayfield, and Jimmy Liggins, along with a very successful gospel catalog. The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert ""Bumps"" Blackwell, and J. W. Alexander. Johnny Vincent was a sales representative for the company."
"Rupe had a love of gospel music, and in 1947 he began recording gospel quartets such as the Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Pilgrim Travelers, Alex Bradford, Dorothy Love Coates and Sister Wynona Carr. His taste for gospel carried over into secular music and influenced his choice of artists to record, such as Guitar Slim, Don and Dewey, Lloyd Price, Larry Williams, and Little Richard. It led him to value feeling over technique in the recording studio. Concerns about religious objections to the secularization of gospel music, combined with a contract dispute, resulted in his decision not to put out a pop record with gospel singer Sam Cooke. He recorded but ultimately chose not to release two songs that later became big hits, ""You Send Me"" and ""Summertime""."
"In 1952, Rupe first traveled to New Orleans because of his attraction to the gospel sound of Fats Domino who played piano in the band of Dave Bartholomew, a former trumpeter with Duke Ellington. It was on this trip that he auditioned and then recorded Lloyd Price."
"Rupe obtained his most successful artist when Little Richard, then a little-known recording artist, followed Lloyd Price's suggestion and sent Rupe a demo record. Art sent Blackwell to New Orleans to do a recording session. During a recording break Little Richard sang an obscene song while playing the piano. Blackwell sensed that it was a hit, but after the lyrics had been cleaned up, there was no time to teach the song to a piano player. So Little Richard both played and sang the only song to emerge from that first session, done in just three takes, ""Tutti Frutti"", one of the most significant rock and roll records ever made. Rupe also recorded Guitar Slim, with a young Ray Charles on piano. In addition, Specialty issued some of wildest R&B records, such as ""Cherokee Dance"", by Froggy Landers; ""(Everytime I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone"", by Roy Montrell; ""Drunk"" by Jimmy Liggins; and the rock & roll ""Moose on the Loose"", by Roddy Jackson."
"When asked why Specialty was so successful, Rupe credited his own ability to produce rather than his business skills. In the early 1960s, he stopped producing records but remained active in the music business as a publisher. He returned during the fifties revival period in the late 1960s but only to reissue landmark recordings of the R&B era. Rupe sold Specialty to Fantasy Records in 1991. However, it is worth noting that the contracts that were given to the artists to sign left Rupe and others at the label with full ownership and publishing rights of the music. Richard signed a contract with Specialty Records in 1955. He reportedly gave the label full ownership of all the music he recorded with them in return for 50% of the royalties earned. In his authorized biography, he states that he sold his publishing rights to “Tutti Frutti” for $50, leaving him with a small half-cent royalty rate per record sold. In 1959, Little Richard left the label and filed a lawsuit claiming he never received his royalties. He settled for $11,000 and waived his rights to royalties from such hits as “Tutti Frutti” and “Long Tall Sally”."
"During the 1960s and later, Rupe became increasingly involved in oil and gas investments. Success in this area allowed him to establish the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, a philanthropy based in Santa Barbara."
He turned 100 in September 2017.
"In 2007, Rupe was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame."
"On December 15, 2010, it was announced that Rupe will be awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award (along with former Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
"= = = Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South = = ="
"Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South () is the full title of the English translation of the novel written by the French science-fiction author Jules Verne, and centers on the story of James Burbank, an antislavery northerner living near Jacksonville, Florida, and Texar, a pro-slavery southerner who holds a vendetta against Burbank. Originally published in France in 1887, the book received a tepid reaction upon its release in the United States, partly because of Verne's inexpertise regarding some details of the American Civil War, and has since fallen into obscurity compared to many of Verne's other works."
"Texar and Burbank are bitter enemies, Burbank's northern view of slavery as an evil being an unpopular stance with Texar and the rest of the community, deep in the Confederate States of America. On top of this disagreement, though, Texar is angry at Burbank for past legal troubles Burbank has brought upon Texar, and, despite Texar inventing a perfect alibi that allows him to escape conviction, Texar feels the need for vengeance and eventually becomes a prominent and powerful member of the Jacksonville community. Using this newfound power, Texar turns the townsfolk against Burbank and leads a mob that destroys the Burbank plantation, known as Camdless Bay. Burbank's daughter Dy and caretaker Zermah are both kidnapped by a man claiming to be Texar and are purportedly taken to a place in the Everglades called Carneral Island. En route, and after enlisting the help of the United States Navy, they find a separate group searching for Texar in response to crimes that apparently happened in the same time as the ones at Camdless Bay but in a distant location. This opens up the realization that there is one real Texar and one who is not, and the search continues now, not only for Dy and Zermah, but for the answer to this mystery."
"""Nord Contre Sud"", the original French title of the book, was first published in its fully illustrated edition in November, 1887, by J. Hetzel et Cie, Paris."
"In the first American (and first English) translation, ""Nord Contre Sud"" (North Against South) was relegated to a subtitle and the book's title was made ""Texar's Vengeance"", quickly re-translated as ""Texar's Revenge"". This edition was published by George Munro, New York (1887), a translation by Laura E. Kendall as part of the ""Seaside Library"". Since then, however, there have been more minor variations on the title, some editions referring to the title as ""The Texar's Revenge"", others omitting the title completely in favor of the more simple ""North Against South"". The most common and generally most accepted American version of the title is the full ""Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South"". There have also been a handful of editions that have split the book into two volumes, those being ""Burbank the Northerner"" and ""Texar the Southerner"", both of which are contained in most editions of the book. Various cheap editions were published in the U.S. for the next 20 years by W. L. Allison, Hurst, and others."
"The first fully illustrated edition in English was ""North against South"" published by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, London, December 1887. This is a different anonymous translation from the one published by George Munro. In 2007 the first fully illustrated edition of ""North against South"" in the U.S. was published by the Choptank Press of St. Michaels, Maryland as a Lulu Press book, a replica re-publication of the Sampson Low first edition."
"[In Jules Verne's] story of ""Texar""... a very thin streak of narrative is padded to almost unwieldy proportions by a quantity of remarkably inaccurate information about the rebellion. If anyone thought the game worth the candle it would be easy to point out the various comical inaccuracies in the historical part of the story... [quoted in T&M]"

= = = Ribbon category = = =
"In mathematics, a ribbon category, also called a tortile category, is a particular type of braided monoidal category."
"A monoidal category formula_1 is, loosely speaking, a category equipped with a notion resembling the tensor product (of vector spaces, say). That is, for any two objects formula_2, there is an object formula_3. The assignment formula_4 is supposed to be functorial and needs to require a number of further properties such as a unit object 1 and an associativity isomorphism. Such a category is called braided if there are isomorphisms"
"A braided monoidal category is called a ribbon category if the category is left rigid and has a family of ""twists"". The former means that for each object formula_6 there is another object (called the left dual), formula_7, with maps"
such that the compositions
"equals the identity of formula_7, and similarly with formula_6. The twists are maps"
such that
"To be a ribbon category, the duals have to be compatible with the braiding and the twists in a certain way."
"An example is the category of projective modules over a commutative ring. In this category, the monoidal structure is the tensor product, the dual object is the dual in the sense of (linear) algebra, which is again projective. The twists in this case are the identity maps. A more sophisticated example of a ribbon category are finite-dimensional representations of a quantum group."
The name ribbon category is motivated by a graphical depiction of morphisms.
A strongly ribbon category is a ribbon category C equipped with a dagger structure such that the functor †: C → C coherently preserves the ribbon structure.

"Cohoes Falls [Kahon:ios, Mohawk for ""Canoe Falls""] is a waterfall on the Mohawk River shared by the city of Cohoes and the town of Waterford, New York, United States. Discovered by the indigenous people, the falls were called ""Ga-ha-oose"" or ""Ga-ho'n'-yoos"" by the Mohawks, which is believed to mean ""The Place of the Falling Canoe."" Cohoes historian Arthur Masten wrote in his 1880 history that the phrase might mean ""Potholes in the River,"" referring to the potholes that appear in the riverbed when it is dry. In the oral tradition of the ""Haudenosaunee"" (Iroquois), the Cohoes Falls are the site where The Great Peacemaker, performed a feat of supernatural strength, convincing the Mohawk people to become the founders of the Iroquois League of Nations or Confederacy. Some historians believe the Mohawks launched the Confederacy as early as 1142 CE, though other experts report dates ranging from 1450-1650."
"Celebrated by 18th-century travelers in letters and journals, the Cohoes Falls, also called The Great Falls of the Mohawk, were regarded as the second-most beautiful cataract in New York State after Niagara. In 1804, the national poet of Ireland, Thomas Moore, visited Cohoes and wrote a paean to the waterfall's beauty: ""Lines Written at the Cohos, or Falls of the Mohawk River."""
"In 1831, town leaders built a dam across the Mohawk River to harness the power of the falls to fuel the turbines of the city's burgeoning textile industry. Over the next several decades, the predominant company, Harmony Mills, became the largest manufacturer of cotton in the United States, thanks to its control of local water rights. When all the mills closed in the wake of the Great Depression, city leaders neglected the potential of the falls for tourism. They leased the flow rights to a series of power companies, including Niagara Mohawk and Orion Power."
"The Erie Canal was planned to overcome the navigational barrier of the Cohoes Falls. The original ""Clinton's Ditch"", the Erie Canal of 1825, was built through the city of Cohoes. The later Enlarged Canal was realigned, yet still went through the City of Cohoes. The Barge Canal, which opened in 1918, bypasses Cohoes and runs though the Village of Waterford via the Waterford Flight of Locks."
"The Cohoes Falls is 90 feet (28 m) high and 1,000 feet (305 m) wide. Its flow is most impressive in springtime, sometimes running at of water per second, but as the season changes, there is less water for the falls because so much of the flow is diverted at the Crescent Dam to the Barge Canal through Lock 6. Most of the water is still diverted for power generation; some is diverted for the Cohoes water supply. During the summer, the falls are virtually dry, revealing shale rock formations that have their own distinctive beauty. The 87-year average flow of the Mohawk River at Cohoes is 34,638 cubic feet per second, but this includes water diverted to the power plant and Erie Canal locks."

"The Usambara Mountains of northeastern Tanzania in tropical East Africa, comprise the easternmost ranges of the Eastern Arc Mountains. The ranges of approximately long and about half that wide, are situated in the Lushoto District of the Tanga Region. They were formed nearly two million years ago by faulting and uplifting, and are composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks. They are split into two sub-ranges; the West Usambaras being higher than the East Usambaras, which are nearer the coast and receive more rainfall."
"The mountains are clad in virgin tropical rainforest which has been isolated for a long period and they are a centre of endemism. Historically they were inhabited by Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people but in the eighteenth century, a Shambaa kingdom was founded by Mbegha. The kingdom eventually fell apart after a succession struggle in 1862. German colonists settled in the area which was to become German East Africa, and after World War I it became part of the British mandated territory of Tanganyika."
"The Usambaras are approximately long and ranging from in width. They form part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, which stretch from Kenya through Tanzania. The range is one of the world's Biodiversity hotspots."
"The range is accessible from the towns of Lushoto in the west, and Amani in the east. The Usambaras are commonly split into two sub-ranges, the West Usambara Mountains and the East Usambara Mountains. The East Usambara are closer to the coast, receive more rainfall, and are significantly smaller than the West Usambara."
"The mountain range was formed nearly two million years ago. Due to a lack of glaciations and a relatively consistent climate, the rainforest has gone through a long term and unique evolution resulting in an impressive amount of endemism and an old growth cloud rainforests."
"The West and East Usambaras are large ranges of Precambrian metamorphic geologic formations of acid-gneisses, pyroxenes, and amphiboles. These mountains were formed by faulting and uplifting creating the drainage system of troughs that form many watersheds, which provide water to a majority of the population of northeast Tanzania."
"The Usambara Mountains are fairly unusual in East Africa with their natural regions still covered in tropical forests, which otherwise continentally remain primarily in Western Africa. Considered tremendously significant ecologically and a Biodiversity hotspot. There are many protected zones throughout the range, which are being expanded and contributed to by the Tanzanian government, associated NGO's and research teams, and donor countries such as Norway."
"Several species are endemic to the Usambara forests, including the Usambara eagle-owl (""Bubo vosseleri""), the Usambara akalat (""Sheppardia montana""), the Usambara weaver (""Ploceus nicolli""), the African violet (""Saintpaulia ionantha""), the tree species ""Calodendrum eickii""."
"Historically the Usambara Mountains have been inhabited by the Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people who were a mix of agriculturalists and pastoralists."
"A Shambaa kingdom based on Vugu was founded by Mbegha in the first half of the 18th century. His grandson Kinyashi Muanga Ike gave the kingdom a stronger political and military structure. Under Kinyashi's son Kimweri ye Nyumbai the kingdom grew to cover both the west and east Usambaras, extending down to the coast and into the Pangani River valley to the south. After Kimweri died in 1862 the kingdom fell apart in a succession struggle."
"In the late 19th century when within the Usambara District of German East Africa, German colonialists came into the area bringing with them a mix of cash crops like lumber trees, coffee, tea, and quinine, and also designated forests as reserves for either water conservation or timber use. They also brought many new Western concepts, which often were diametrically opposed to traditional beliefs, such as coexistence with the forest versus forest as a ""separate wilderness"". The result of colonialism was a massive change in the way forests were perceived in the community, and conversion of traditional agriculture to cultivating cash crops such as quinine, pine trees, bananas, maize, tea, and coffee."
"In 1882 Adalbert Emil Walter Redliffe le Tanneux von St. Paul-Ilaire (known as Baron Walter), the Governor of the Usambara District of German East Africa, collected seed and plants of a small herb which were sent to Hermann Wendland, Director of the Berlin Royal Botanic Garden. Wendland cultivated the plants and recognized them as representing a new species in a new genus, ""Saintpaulia ionantha"", with the English common name African violet. In the generic name. Saintpaulia he recognized von St. Paul-Ilaire; the specific name he assigned means violet (Gr. ion) flower (Gr. anthos). In their native Usambara Mountains cloudforests, the plants are threatened with extinction."
"Ourense Cathedral (Catedral de Ourense or Catedral do San Martiño) is a Roman Catholic church located in Ourense in northwestern Spain. Dedicated to St Martin, it was founded in 550. The first structure was restored by Alonso el Casto. The present mainly Gothic building was raised with the support of Bishop Lorenzo in 1220. Its local patroness is Saint Euphemia. There is a silver-plated shrine, and others of St Facundus and St Primitivus. The Christ's Chapel (Capilla del Cristo Crucificado) was added in 1567 by Bishop San Francisco Triccio. It contains an image of Christ, which was brought in 1330 from a small church on Cape Finisterre. John the Baptist's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan Bautista) was created in 1468 by the Conde de Benavente. The Portal of Paradise is sculptured and enriched with figures of angels and saints, while the antique cloisters were erected in 1204 by Bishop Ederonio. The Capilla de la Maria Madre was restored in 1722, and connected by the cloisters with the cathedral. The eight canons were called Cardenales, as at Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and they alone did services before the altar; this custom was recognised as ""immemorial"" by Pope Innocent III, in 1209. The cathedral, which has undergone an impressive transition of architectural styles of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical, was built to a Latin Cross plan. It has been a functional basilica since 1887. The cathedral has a crucifix that is held in great reverence all over Galicia."
"The earliest cathedral in Ourense appears to have been the church dedicated to Santa María la Madre. In 550, the Suevian king Chararic built a second church dedicated to St Martin of Tours on the site of today's cathedral of the Auriense diocese. It was also the time when the arch bridge opposite the cathedral was built over the river, facilitating access to the thermal springs. The cathedral was however repeatedly destroyed over the centuries by the Moors and the Northmen who invaded the city. Today's building was constructed as a Romanesque church in the 12th and 13th centuries. Construction was supported by Bishop Lorenzo, who also built the new Ourense bridge and the bishop's palace."
Gothic additions followed until the early 16th century. There is little historical documentation on the construction of the building but there is a clear record mentioning the consecration of the high altar in 1188.
"The cathedral was classified as a national monument in June 1931. Since 1887, it has officially been designated a basilica."
"The cathedral plan takes the form of a Latin cross, the nave being flanked by slightly lower lateral aisles. It measures in length and across the transversal transept. Completed in 1505 by Rodrigo de Badajoz, the octagonal Gothic lantern tower with its three levels of windows rises above the point where the transept crosses the nave. The former apse was later converted into an ambulatory bordered by a series of chapels including the 15th-century St John's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan) and the 16th-century Chapel of Snows (Capilla de las Nieves). After the chancel had been demolished in the 20th century, the choir stalls were moved into the body of the church and into Christ's Chapel."
"The North Door (Portada Norte), initially of Romanesque design, has a variety of Gothic additions. The tympanum is crowned by a cross where Mary takes possession of Christ's body. Other decorations include an allusion to the miracle of St Martin who is depicted tearing his cloak in two as well as the figure of James the apostle (known as Santiago in Spanish). The turrets on either side of the entrance are no doubt the result of the need to protect the doorway which had been destroyed by Rodrigo Alonso Pimentel in 1471."
"To the right of the South Door (Portada Sur) which is topped by fine decorations, there is a 16th-century clock tower. The south façade was initially symmetrical with two defensive towers but the clock tower now looks less imposing. The east gable is flanked by the unfinished 16th-century Tower of St Martin and the 40-metre-tall bell tower which was repaired at the end of the 19th century as it had been damaged by the earthquake which hit Lisbon in 1755. The 16th-century rose window can still be seen."
"The Gothic influence can be clearly seen in the nave with its decorative arches and vaulted ceiling. Repairs and additions have also led to decorations in the Renaissance and Baroque styles in the chapels. The cathedral's main altarpiece in the flamboyant Gothic style is believed to be the work of Cornielles de Holanda with five vertical panels each divided into horizontal compartments. Martin of Tours is depicted in the central panel as the cathedral's patron saint while scenes from the life of Jesus and Mary can be seen in the other panels. On either side of the main altar, there are two other altars representing the martyred saints of Ourense: Facundus, Primitivus and Euphemia."
"Christ's Chapel (La capilla del Santo Cristo), to the right of the North Door, originally presented the figure of Christ rather than today's altar bearing Our Lady of the Pillar. The chapel owes its origin to Bishop Vasco Pérez Mariño who wished to be buried as close as possible to the figure of Christ. The chapel is decorated in flamboyant Baroque style with a Renaissance screen by Juan Bautista Celma and a canopy by Domingo de Andrade while other decorations are the work of Francisco de Castro Canseco. The Renaissance choir stalls which once stood in the cathedral's chancel were crafted by Diego de Solís and Juan de Angers. The chapel also contains many other offerings including 18th-century paintings with scenes of Christ's life and the evening meal at Emmaus."
"The 13th-century Portico of Paradise (Pórtico del Paraíso) was built by students of Master Mateo who is best known for his Pórtico de la Gloria in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Its three arches are supported by slender columns with a central mullion. The apostle St James or Santiago holds a sword reminiscent of his alleged miraculous participation in the legendary Battle of Clavijo. The original 13th-century figure was replaced in the 19th century. The statue of the Virgin of Consolation (Virgen del Consuelo) with the body of Christ which tops the mullion was also added in the 19th century. Other decorations include Christ being tempted by the devil, a medallion of God the Father and a tabernacle presenting St Martin tearing his cloak. The archivolts of the central arch bear the figures of the 24 elders from the Book of Revelation. The columns themselves are sculpted with apostles and prophets while the capitals present a variety of figures including Christ's temptations in the desert, centaurs fighting mermaids, dragons and harpies with frightening faces who were said to have brought the plague. The vividly coloured pilaster figures were restored in the 18th century from the original Romanesque polychrome. The two Baroque side chapels contain a Castro Canseco altarpiece of the Nursing Madonna and a representation of San Francisco Blanco from Ourense who was crucified in Japan in 1597."
"The cathedral was the burial place for several individuals from the 13th to the 15th centuries in chapels of evolving Gothic design. The tomb of Bishop Vasco Pérez Mariño (died 1342) is in the northern transept; Bishop Lorenzo (died mid-12th century) is entombed in the nave of the epistle; Don Alonso González del Padrón is entombed next to the St Luke's chapel; the tomb of the Infantina, who may have been a Castilian princess, is next to the Capilla de las Nieves; two bishops, including Bishop Quevedo, are also entombed on the wall of the epistle."
"The cathedral museum is accessed through the Romanesque door leading to the Gothic cloisters known as Claustra Nova. Artifacts include ""El Incunable de Monterrey"", the first book published in Galicia in 1494, Enrique de Arfe's processional cross, 13th-century enamels from Limoges, the so-called Treasure of San Rosendo and the oldest Christian tombstone in Galicia from Baños de Bande."

"John Trout Greble (January 19, 1834 in Philadelphia – June 10, 1861 in Virginia) was a soldier in the United States Army. He was killed at the battle of Big Bethel, and was the first graduate of the United States Military Academy to be killed in the American Civil War."
"He graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1854, was assigned to the 2nd artillery, and stationed at Newport, Rhode Island. In September 1854 he was made 2nd lieutenant and sent to Tampa, Florida, where he served in the Indian troubles for two years. He was compelled, in consequence of a severe fever, to return home on sick leave, but in the beginning of 1856 resumed his duties, acting part of the time as quartermaster and commissary until December 1856, when he was appointed acting assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics in the U.S. Military Academy, where he remained until September 24, 1860. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on March 3, 1857."
"He was detailed for active duty at Fort Monroe in late 1860, and rendered efficient service in preventing its seizure. On May 26, 1861, he was sent to Newport News as master of ordnance, superintended the fortifications of that point, and trained the volunteers to artillery practice. When the expedition to Big Bethel was planned, he was unexpectedly detailed to accompany it with two guns, though in his own judgment it was ill-advised. When the Union Army troops were repelled, by his management of the guns he protected them from pursuit and destruction. Just at the close of the action, when he had given the orders to withdraw his guns from the field, he was struck by a rifle ball on the right temple and instantly killed. For his bravery in the two days' action, he was brevetted captain, major, and lieutenant colonel, on the day of his death. First Buried in Philadelphia's Woodland Cemetery he was later reburied in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Montgomery County Pennsylvania"
"He married Sarah Bradley French, daughter of West Point professor John W. French. Their son, Edwin St. John Greble, who was born at West Point, New York, became a major general of the U.S. Army."

"In geometry, the ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron (or ditrigonary dodecadodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It has extended Schläfli symbol b{5,5/2}, as a ""blended great dodecahedron"", and Coxeter diagram . It has 4 Schwarz triangle equivalent constructions, for example Wythoff symbol 3 | 5/3 5, and Coxeter diagram ."
"Its convex hull is a regular dodecahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common), the great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common), and the regular compound of five cubes."
"Furthermore, it may be viewed as a facetted dodecahedron: the pentagonal faces may be inscribed within the dodecahedron's pentagons. Its dual, the medial triambic icosahedron, is a stellation of the icosahedron."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-6 pentagonal tiling, by distorting the pentagrams back into regular pentagons. As such, it is a regular polyhedron of index two:"

"In geometry, the great dodecahemidodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"Aside from the regular small stellated dodecahedron {/,5} and great stellated dodecahedron {/,3}, it is the only nonconvex uniform polyhedron whose faces are all non-convex regular polygons (star polygons), namely the star polygons {/} and {/}."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 6 decagrammic faces passing through the model center.
Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosidodecahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common) and the great icosihemidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common).
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, the middle of the pentagrams are over empty space, as can be seen from the picture of the great dodecahemicosahedron above. Hence, some, such as Jonathan Bowers, do not fill in the middle of the pentagram: this filling has been called ""natural filling"". In the natural filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"The Scots Confession (also called the Scots Confession of 1560) is a Confession of Faith written in 1560 by six leaders of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland. The was the first subordinate standard for the Protestant church in Scotland. Along with the Book of Discipline and the Book of Common Order, this is considered to be a formational document for the Church of Scotland during the time."
"In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland agreed to reform the religion of the country. To enable them to decide what the Reformed Faith was to be, they set John Knox as the superintendent over John Winram, John Spottiswoode, John Willock, John Douglas, and John Row, to prepare a Confession of Faith. This they did in four days. The 25 Chapters of the Confession spell out a contemporary statement of the Christian faith as understood by the followers of John Calvin during his lifetime. Although the Confession and its accompanying documents were the product of the joint effort of the Six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to John Knox."
"While the Parliament approved the Confession on 27 August 1560, acting outside the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh to do so, Mary, Queen of Scots, a Roman Catholic, refused to agree, and the Confession was not approved by the monarch until 1567, after Mary's overthrow. It remained the Confession of the Church of Scotland until it was superseded by the Westminster Confession of Faith on 27 August 1647. However, the confession itself begins by stating that the Parliament ""ratifeit and apprevit [the confession] as wholesome and sound doctrine grounded upon the infallible truth of God's word""; thus, though changes within societies may have diminished its relevance, believers hold that the authority of its statements is rooted not in parliamentary approval but in, as it says, ""the infallible truth of God's word"". In 1967, it was included in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s ""Book of Confessions ""alongside various other confessional standards, and remains in the current Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s ""Book of Confessions""."

= = = Gilbert Ashwell = = =
"Gilbert Ashwell (July 16, 1916 – June 27, 2014) was a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health in the United States. He is a member of the National Academy of Science for his work with Anatol Morell in isolating the first cell receptor."
"Ashwell was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1916. After high school, he went to college to further his education. He attended the University of Illinois, where he earned his B.A.in 1938 and M.S. in 1941. He then went to Columbia University in New York, which was closer to his hometown, to spend two years doing research. In 1950, Ashwell joined the National Institute of Arthirtis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases. This Institute had grown and later split into two institutes, which are the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Ashwell worked at the latter as an emeritus scientist after his retirement."
"Ashwell’s goal as a researcher was to devise a labeling serum glycoproteins in order to study the role of ceruloplasmin in Wilson disease. With another researcher named Anatol G. Morell, he worked to propose that membrane lectins remove senescent circulating glycoproteins, and discovered one of the earliest known carbohydrate receptors. They were able to devise a labeling procedure which allowed them to remove enzymes of the glycoproteins' sialic acid residue. By completing this process, they were able to incorporate other substances into the protein. In 1974, Ashwell and Morell happened to discover that a certain receptor in a human’s liver is able to recognize a specific glycoprotein called asialoglycoprotein. Ashwell explained that he was not specifically looking for the asialoglycoprotein when he found it."
"Ashwell died on June 27, 2014 from pneumonia in a Washington, D.C. area hospital. He was 97."
= = = Gogaji = = =
"Gogaji (also known as Goga, Jahar Veer Gogga, Gugga, Gugga Pir, Gugga Jaharpir, Gugga Chohan, Gugga Rana, Gugga Bir and Raja Mandlik) is a folk deity, worshipped in the northern states of India especially in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab region, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Gujarat. He is a warrior-hero of the region, venerated as a saint and a 'snake-god'."
"Although there are references to him in the folklore of Rajasthan, little historical knowledge of Gugga exists other than that he ruled the small kingdom of Dadrewa (in present day Rajasthan) and was a contemporary of Prithviraj Chauhan."
"According to legend, Goga was born with the blessings of Guru Gorakhnath, who gave 'Gugal' fruit to Goga's mother Bachhal which was used to name him. Another belief is that he was called Goga because of his remarkable service to cows(Gou in Sanskrit)."
"Goga had a kingdom called Bagad Dedga near Ganganagar that spanned over to Hansi near Hisar in Haryana and included territory up to the river Sutlej in Punjab. It is believed that Goga lived during the 12th Century AD In the past, the river Sutlej flowed through the district of Bathinda in present-day Punjab in India. The capital was at Dadrewa near Ganganagar."
"Goga () (Rajasthani: (Gugo) गुग्गो) was born in c. 900 AD to queen Bachchal (the daughter of a Rajput ruler, Kanwarpala who in 1173 AD ruled over Sirsa in present-day Haryana) and king Zewar in Dadrewa of the Chauhan Clan in the Churu district of Rajasthan. The earliest parts of Goga's life were spent in the village of Dadrewa, situated on Hissar—Bikaner highway in Sadulpur tehsil of Churu district in Rajasthan. According to other legends, his father was Vachha Chauhan, the Raja of Jangal Desh, which stretched from the Sutlej to Haryana."
"When Bachal was worshipping Gorakhnath, her twin-sister decided to usurp the blessings from the Gorakhnath. In the middle of the night, she wore her sister's clothes and deceived Gorakhnath into giving her the blessing fruit. When Bachal came to know about it, she rushed to Gorakhnath and said that she had not received anything. To this, Gorakhnath replied that he had already given his blessings and said that her sister was attempting to deceive her. After repeated requests by Bachal, Gorakhnath relented and gave her two Gugal candies. She distributed these candies to ladies having no child, including the 'blue mare' who was pregnant at that time. When the Guru gave the blessing to Bachal, he foretold that her son would become very powerful and would rule over the other two sons of their aunt, Kachal."
Goga was married to Shreeyal Roz who was daughter of Tandul Nagari's King Sindha Singh.
Another story is that Arjan and Sarjan were against Goga and was a part of conspiracy with king Anangpal Tomar of Delhi. King Anganpal attacked bagad region with Arjan and Sarjan. Both of them were killed by Goga. Goga spared the king after his miserere. In a quarrel about land he killed his two brothers on which account he drew upon himself the anger of his mother.
"The cult of Goga falls within folk religion and therefore his followers include people from all faiths. Goga is popular as a Devta who protects his followers from snakes and other evils. He has been deified as a snake demigod and is a prominent figure among those who follow the Nāga cult in what is now Rajasthan and since the seventeenth century has been worshipped in the Western Himalayas also, possibly as a consequence of migration there from Rajasthan."
"He is particularly popular among those engaged in agrarian pursuits, for whom the fear of snakebite is common. Although a Hindu, he has many Muslim devotees and is chiefly considered to be a saint (""pir"") who had the power to cure the effects of poison (""jahar"")."
"He was reputed to be a disciple of Guru Gorakhnath. According to Muslim oral tradition prevalent in Punjab, he learnt the way of entering and leaving solid earth by a Muslim Pir Hazi Rattan of Bathinda. Goga is also believed to have lived for some time in Bathinda."
"The cult is prevalent in Rajasthan and other states of northern India, including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the north western districts of Uttar Pradesh. His followers can also be found in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh."
"His shrine, referred as medi (shortened colloquial term for Samādhi), consists of a one-room building with a minaret on each corner and a Hindu grave inside, marked by a Nishan (a symbol or sign), which is made up of a long bamboo with peacock plumes, a coconut, some colored threads and some handpankhas with a blue flag on the top."
"Worship of Goga starts in Bhaadra month of Hindu calendar. On the 9th of Bhadra, the people worship his symbol, a black snake painted on a wall. Worshippers take a fly-flap, known as chhari, round the village. Devotees pay their respect to it and offer churma. The Savayians sing devotional songs known as ‘Pir ke Solle’ in his honour to the accompaniment of deroos. Beating of deroos is the exclusive privilege of the Savayian community; others may sing, dance or offer charhawa. It is believed that the spirit of Gugga temporarily takes abode in the devotee dancer who lashes himself with a bunch of iron chains. People also open their rakhis on this day(bhadra krishna paksh navmi) and offer them to him. They also offer sweet puri (a type of sweet chappati) and other sweets and take his blessing."
"Grand fairs are held at samadhi sathal Gogamedi. Gogamedi is 359 km from Jaipur, in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan. It is believed that Goga went into samādhi at Gogamedi. Thousands of devotees gather to pay homage at this memorial annually in the month of Bhadrapada during the Goga fair, which lasts for 3 days. The fair is held from the ninth day of the dark half of Bhadrapada (Goga Navami) to the eleventh day of the dark half of the same month. People sing and dance to the beats of drums"
"with multicoloured flags called ""nishans"" in their hands. The songs and bhajans on the life history of Gogaji are recited accompanied by music played with traditional instruments like Damru, Chimta, etc. At his birthplace Dadrewa, the fair goes on over a month. Devotees from far eastern places of Dadrewa start arriving from the beginning of the auspicious month of Bhaadra. These devotees are commonly known as purbia (those who belong to east). It is a common sight to see people with snakes lying around their necks. According to a folklore in and around his birthplace Dadrewa it is believed that if someone picks up even a stick from johra (a barren land which has a sacred pond in Dadrewa), it would turn into a snake. Devotees of Gogaji worship him when they get a snake bite and apply sacred ash (bhabhoot) on the bite as an immediate remedy."
"In Thaneek Pura, Himachal Pradesh, a very large scale festival and fair is organized on Gugga Navami. The tale of Gugga Ji is recited, from Raksha Bandhan to Gugga Naumi, by the followers who visit every house in the region. These followers while singing the tales of Gugga Ji carry a Chhat (a wooden umbrella) and people offer them grains and other stuff. They bring all the collected offerings to the temple and then the grand festival of Gugga Navami is celebrated for three days. Apart from various pujas and rituals, the wrestling competition (Mall or Dangal) is organized for three days where participants from all over the region compete. The annual three-day fair is also a part of these festivities where people come and enjoy great food, and shop for decorative items, handicrafts, clothes, cosmetics, household goods, and toys for children."
"Goga is known as Gugga in the Punjab who has a significant following. Many Punjabi villages have a shrine dedicated to Gugga. A fair is organised annually in the village of Chhapar and is known as the Chhapar Mela. Gugga's legacy in Punjab can be seen in towns such as Bareta Mandi, which is situated at a distance of 51 km from Mansa in Punjab. ""The town is predominantly inhabited by Chauhans who trace their origin from Gugga, ‘Lord of Snakes’. It is said that nobody has ever died here on account of snakebite because of the blessings of Gugga."""
"USS ""Wildcat"" was a two masted schooner of 48 tons and was part of a naval fleet, the ""West Indies Squadron"", that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the occurrence of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. She was armed with three guns and had a crew of 31. ""Wildcat"" was commanded by Lieutenant Legare' who sailed her to Washington with a dispatch regarding the disposition of the squadron and other matters concerning the war against piracy in the Caribbean. On 28 October 1824 ""Wildcat"" was lost in a gale with all hands while sailing between Cuba and Thompson's Island, West Indies. Approximately 31 drowned."
= = = Saarbahn = = =
"The Saarbahn is a regional Stadtbahn operating on the tram-train principle in the German state of the Saarland. It consists of a core line in Saarbrücken and Riegelsberg operating under tram operating procedures (BOStrab), connected to two lines that are operated under railway operating procedures (EBO), the Lebach–Völklingen railway to the north and the Saarbrücken–Sarreguemines railway in the south. ""Stadtbahn Saar GmbH"" is responsible for the infrastructure of the central section of line, while the outer tracks are operated by the national railway infrastructure companies, DB Netz AG in Germany and Réseau Ferré de France in France. ""Saarbahn GmbH"" is the train operating company for the whole system."
"The route of the new line of the Saarbahn that was opened in central Saarbrücken in 1997 is essentially line 5 of the Saarbrücken tramway, which was closed in 1965. This line ran between Rastpfuhl and Schafbrücke and was the last line of the old metre-gauge network."
", the current network operates on of route, and serves 43 stations."
"The first considerations of building a regional rail network in and around Saarbrücken began in the 1990s. The bus service in central Saarbrücken then ran at such a high density that the vehicles sometimes operated at one-minute intervals. Following the example of the Karlsruhe model, which had operated with great success since 1992, the Saarland began to plan to build a regional Stadtbahn. The core of the concept was the building of an inner-city railway line, while the outer branches would share the existing Deutsche Bahn railway infrastructure. As early as 1992, it borrowed a light rail vehicle from the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn and ran it on the Fürstenhausen–Gersweiler Bahnhof–Saarbrücken Messebahnhof route on the Rossel Valley Railway (""Rosseltalbahn""), south of the Saar."
"Before the opening of the Saarbrücken city centre line, there was a trial operation between Saarbrücken Central Station (""Hauptbahnhof"") and Hanweiler with Saarbahn vehicles. However, as it was still in the Deutsche Bahn timetable, replacing the previously locomotive-hauled trains on this section, it was operated by Deutsche Bahn. This forward operation began on 29 September 1997 and ended on 24 October 1997, the opening day of the new line through the city centre."
"On 24 October 2007, the Saarbrücken Stadtbahn celebrated its tenth train anniversary. Since inception more than 100 million passengers had been carried, almost twice as many as originally planned. Thus, it had become a great success as a model for other cities considering the establishment of a light railway."
"The core of the Saarbahn—the new line between Brebach station and Ludwigstraße—was put into operation on 24 October 1997, after just under two and a half years of construction. Since its opening, there has been a system separation point between Römerkastell and Brebach station. This is a 90-metre-long non-energised section of the overhead line, which is traversed using momentum, while the vehicle's electric system automatically switches to the other system. Saarbahn railcars coming from central Saarbrücken change from 750 volts DC to 15,000 volts AC and run via Kleinblittersdorf to Sarreguemines, Lorraine. The French section from the border station at Hanweiler has been equipped with the German electric system since 1983. The first light rail vehicle that reached Saarguemines was two-system railcar 810 of the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), which ran there on 11 September 1993 during a presentation ride."
"The extension in the northerly direction took place in several stages. It was extended to Cottbuser Platz on 31 July 1999, to Siedlerheim on 13 November 2000, to Riegelsberg Süd on 24 September 2001 and to Walpershofen/Etzenhofen on 26 September 2009. Construction of the Riegelsberg Süd–Walpershofen/Etzenhofen section, required the contribution of additional costs of around €630,000 per year (an amount that was until recently disputed) from the city of Saarbrücken, the municipality of Riegelsberg and indirectly from the Saarland. Clearing work was performed on the former route of the Koller Valley Railway (Lebach–Völklingen railway) through Walpershofen and Dilsburg in January and February 2009, the railway overpass in the center of Walpershofen was renewed in 2009/10 and the reactivation of Heusweiler Markt was largely completed in the summer of 2011. This stretch of track was inaugurated on 30 October 2011."
"Although another system separation point between BOStrab and EEO was instituted at Walpershofen in 2011, the electrical system does not change there because the electric system for the Saarbahn on the Koller Valley Railway also runs at 750 volts DC."
"With the exception of a small section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen over which the Saarbahn runs in an east-west direction along the Russenweg (L 267), which had never been used by a railway, the Saarbahn follows two very different historical railway lines:"
"From Saarbrücken through the Köllertaler Wald (Köller valley forest) and Riegelsberg to Riegelsberg-Güchenbach, Saarbahn follows the course of the historical Riegelsberg tramway: an interurban tram line from St.Johann/Saarbrücken via Riegelsberg to Heusweiler, which was opened in 1907. The line broadly followed today's federal highway 268, which also continues directly from Güchenbach to Heusweiler. The line served the mines in Heusweiler-Dilsburg and Von der Heydt. The tramway was replaced by trolleybuses in 1953 and was replaced in turn by diesel-powered buses in 1964."
"After the new section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen, the Saarbahn reaches, at the Walpershofen/Etzenhofen stop, the line of the former Koller Valley Railway, over which it continues north through Walpershofen to its temporary terminus at Heusweiler Markt."
"A extension of the current line, from the current northern terminus, Heusweiler Markt, north to Lebach-Jabach opened for service on 5 October 2014. This extension will expand the Saarbahn line to cover a total of of route."
"Currently the cross-city route is operated as line S1 between Heusweiler Markt and Sarreguemines, with services every 7.5 minutes during the day on the core section between Siedlerheim and Brebach station. Originally, a five-minute interval service was planned for the central area, but this was rejected because it would have led to operational problems. On the sections using rail tracks between Brebach and Kleinblittersdorf and between Heusweiler Markt and Siedlerheim there is a 15-minute interval service and on the Kleinblittersdorf–Sarreguemines section services operate every 30 minutes only in the morning and every 60 minutes at other times."
"In the off peak hour, services operate at 15-minute intervals in the central section, every 30 minutes to Kleinblittersdorf or Siedlerheim and every 60 minutes to Sarreguemines. In the morning peak for professional and school transport and in the afternoon peak, coupled vehicles are used, otherwise single sets are operated. The Saarbahn carries approximately 40,000 passengers daily."
"Currently there are 28 Flexity Link tram-trains in use, which were manufactured by Bombardier in Vienna and Bruges. Six sets were temporarily loaned to Kassel, where they operated trial runs for RegioTram Kassel.

"Goldstein was the first to write a learned commentary specifically on Rebbe Nachman's teachings, giving scholarly legitimacy to the Breslov movement after the death of Reb Noson in 1844. Many of today's English-language translations of Breslover works were only made possible because of the Tcheriner Rav's meticulous research and elucidation."
"He collected and published Noson's eight-volume magnum opus, ""Likutey Halachot"", as well as an expanded version of Noson's ""Likutey Etzot"" (Advice) with additional material from Rebbe Nachman's teachings, under the title, ""Likutey Etzot HaMeshulash"". Altogether, the Tcheriner Rav authored about 20 works, including halakhic responsa. Some were only seen by Breslover Hasidim in manuscript form before they were lost during World War II. The ones that survive are:"
"Goldstein also produced a collection of source texts for ""Sefer HaMiddot"" (The Aleph-Bet Book—a collection of aphorisms on character traits), tracing Rebbe Nachman's references throughout the Bible, Talmud and Midrash. He also compiled teachings of the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of Mezeritch and their major disciples under the titles ""Leshon Hasidim"" and ""Derekh Hasidim""."
= = = Alameda Terminal = = =
"Alameda Terminal (a.k.a. Alameda Wharf) was a railroad station and ferry wharf at the foot and west of present-day Pacific Avenue and Main Street in Alameda, California, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay with ferry service to San Francisco. It was built in 1864 and operated by the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad. In 1869, it served as the original west coast terminus of the U.S. First Transcontinental Railroad, until the opening of Oakland Pier two months later. The western terminus was inaugurated September 6, 1869, when the first Western Pacific through train from Sacramento reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus completing the first transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast."
"The Pacific Railroad Act passed by the United States Congress in 1862 authorized construction of the First transcontinental railroad and telegraph line, which included connecting the Central Pacific Railroad in the west with the Union Pacific Railroad in the east. In 1863, the first construction activity took the Central Pacific line eastward from Sacramento. In October 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad assigned all the rights of the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 to the Western Pacific Railroad for the route between Sacramento and San Jose, including land grants. The plan was that the transcontinental railroad would follow the Western Pacific to San Jose and then connect with the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ), completed in 1864, to San Francisco."
"By 1866, the Western Pacific had built of track north and east from San Jose, reaching halfway into Niles Canyon, to about Farwell near MilePost33. The Western Pacific used 500 Chinese laborers to grade and construct the rail line into the rugged canyon with its tight curves and narrow banks. Construction was then halted because of disagreements between the railroad’s contractors and its financiers."
"In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of which had acquired the Western Pacific and Oakland Point in 1868, restarted work on the railroad line through Niles Canyon, also using Chinese laborers, and added a new line from the mouth of the canyon northwest towards the city of Oakland and Oakland Point. The new plan was to connect with Oakland with its ferry service to San Francisco. In June 1869, J. H. Strobridge came to Niles (then Vallejo Mills and now part of Fremont) to oversee the construction of the new line heading towards Oakland. In September 1869, a temporary connection was made at the bay side of San Leandro with the old tracks of San Francisco and Alameda Railroad, which led to the SF&A Alameda Wharf with ferry service to San Francisco."
"On September 6, 1869, the first Western Pacific train reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus achieving the transcontinental ""Pacific Railroad"" envisioned in the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act. According to the ""Daily Alta California"", this first through train left Sacramento at 10 am, got delayed by some construction trains, exited Niles Canyon late at 9:30 pm, and an hour later arrived at Alameda Terminal to a cheering crowd. Two months later, Central Pacific Railroad switched the western transcontinental terminus to its expanded Oakland Pier, which was inaugurated on November 8, 1869, in another round of celebration."
Alameda then went back to local train service only. In 1870 the SF&A was absorbed into Central Pacific and in 1873 the original SF&A pier was abandoned.
The railroads and their wharfs are gone from Alameda. The last rails were removed in 1960 from Lincoln Ave (formerly Railroad Ave and along which the SF&A rails ran).
"The achievement of the first transcontinental railroad reaching Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869 is marked by a plaque in the Naval Air Station Alameda and a California Historical Landmark (CHL #440) nearby. The GPS coordinates of the two markers are given respectively by ""37.786779,-122.30292"" (plaque); and ""37.77535,-122.276891"" (CHL #440)."
"On 6 September 2019, a ""golden spike"" ceremony was held in Niles Canyon, where the Western Pacific tracks laid in 1866 met the Central Pacific tracks laid in 1869, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 6 September 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad to the original Pacific coast terminus at Alameda Terminal. Also, the mayor of the City of Alameda issued a proclamation recognizing ""the outstanding contributions of the many Chinese immigrants who helped make the Transcontinental Railroad a reality""."

Horsetail Falls (or Horse Tail Falls) is a waterfall along the Columbia River Gorge in the U.S. state of Oregon.
"The waterfall is easily accessed, in contrast to its near neighbor Oneonta Falls, as it is right next to the Historic Columbia River Highway. The shape of the falls and the rounded rockface over which it flows cause it to resemble a horse's tail."

= = = Route poisoning = = =
"Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid within computer networks. Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use route poisoning to indicate to other routers that a route is no longer reachable and should not be considered from their routing tables. Unlike the ""split horizon with poison reverse"", route poisoning provides for sending updates with unreachable hop counts immediately to all the nodes in the network."
"When the protocol detects an invalid route, all of the routers in the network are informed that the bad route has an infinite (∞) route metric. This makes all nodes on the invalid route seem infinitely distant, preventing any of the routers from sending packets over the invalid route."
"Some distance-vector routing protocols, such as RIP, use a maximum hop count to determine how many routers the traffic must go through to reach the destination. Each route has a hop count number assigned to it which is incremented as the routing information is passed from router to router. A route is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds the maximum allowed. Route poisoning is a method of quickly forgetting outdated routing information from other router's routing tables by changing its hop count to be unreachable (higher than the maximum number of hops allowed) and sending a routing update. In the case of RIP, the maximum hop count is 15, so to perform route poisoning on a route its hop count is changed to 16, deeming it unreachable, and a routing update is sent."
"If these updates are lost, some nodes in the network would not be informed that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore route poisoning is used in conjunction with holddowns to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network."

"Victor Dalby Lord is a fictional character and patriarch of the Lord family from the American soap opera ""One Life to Live""."
"An original protagonist on the series, Victor is introduced in the first episode as the preeminent mass media magnate of fictional Philadelphia Main Line suburb Llanview, Pennsylvania. Victor was originally and most notably played by actor Ernest Graves. Graves debuted July 15, 1968, and played the role until he left the series and last appeared in March 1974."
"Series creator Agnes Nixon and executive producer Doris Quinlan subsequently recast Victor to Shepperd Strudwick, who first appeared in December 1974 and played the role until the character's initial onscreen death in June 1976."
"Series creator and then-scriptwriter Agnes Nixon originally created the character of Victor Lord based on her father, Harry Eckhardt. She crafted the role in an attempt to understand the reserved, domineering Eckhardt patriarch, an entrepreneur who financially thrived during the Great Depression manufacturing funeral garments."
"Ernest Graves played the role from show's first episode in 1968 through March 1974. Shepperd Strudwick took over the role in December 1974, playing Victor continually through the character's onscreen death June 16, 1976. Tom O'Rourke briefly stepped into the role as a mirage in 1985, and Les Tremayne played the role of Victor in Heaven in 1987. Bill Moor and Terry Caza both appeared in the role in flashbacks from 1994 to 1995. The character was briefly brought back to life 26 years after his original death in January 2003, portrayed by William Stone Mahoney; the resurrection set the soap opera record for the longest span between a character's onscreen death and resurrection. Mahoney went on to play resurrected Victor through his second onscreen death in March 2003, reappearing as a vision for an episode in 2004."
"In the summer of 1968, Victor Lord (Graves) is introduced as the owner of Lord Enterprises founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Main Line newspaper, ""The Banner"", serving the fictional town of Llanview, Pennsylvania. A widower, he is the domineering single father of daughters Victoria or ""Viki"" (originally Gillian Spencer) and Meredith or ""Merrie"" (originally Trish Van Devere). The family inhabits Victor's inherited family estate, Llanfair. His wife, Eugenia Randolph Lord, died while giving birth to Meredith and was, ultimately, unable to produce his desired male heir to his estate (a picture of her hangs above the mantle of the Lord library in early episodes). Victor thereby goes about grooming his eldest child, Viki, to assume the role of running the estate by hiring her as an editor for his newspaper."
"Victoria desperately seeks her father's approval and gleefully assumes the role of heiress to the family fortune. Victor eventually grows weary of Victoria's admiration for one of his star reporters, working class executive editor Joe Riley (Lee Patterson). In the early years, Victor is also unhappy at the growing relationship of his younger daughter, Meredith, with upwardly-mobile doctor Larry Wolek (Paul Tulley, Jim Storm). He meddles in the personal relationships of his daughters, causing a rift between him and Victoria. In November 1968, unable to reconcile her feelings for Joe and for her father, Victoria develops multiple-personality disorder, manifesting in an alter-ego, ""Niki Smith,"" and begins dating Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini)."
"As Victoria recovers from her first bout with multiple personalities, Victor concedes to the relationships of his white collar daughters to working class gentlemen when he uncovers that he had a long-lost son. Victor embarks on a search for the son he had long yearned for. Viki and Joe first marry in December 1969, and Merrie (Lynn Benesch onward) and Larry (Michael Storm onward) in June 1970. A short time later, Joe apparently dies in a car crash while reporting in California, giving Victor the opportunity to set his widowed daughter up with a suitor more to his liking. With a vacant editor-in-chief position available, Victor replaces Joe with promoted upper-crust writer Steve Burke (Bernie Grant)."
"In 1971, Victoria (Erika Slezak onward) announces her engagement to Steve, which her father approves of; Victor is, however, unhappy when he discovers his continually frail daughter Meredith is seeking to conceive a child with Larry. Merrie is prescribed bedrest and later gives birth to Victor's first onscreen grandchildren, twins (one which dies a childbirth and the other, a grandson named Daniel). In the summer of 1973, in the midst of Victor's search for his son, Meredith is held hostage in the Llanfair carriage house with brother-in-law Vinny when burglars try to steal Victor's prized art collection. A distressed Victor pleads with the robbers to release Meredith during hostage negotiations with Llanview Police Department Lt. Ed Hall (Al Freeman, Jr.). Meredith is viciously assaulted by the thieves, who are killed by the police, and later dies at Llanview Hospital. Victor is devastated by her death, and he (Graves) leaves Llanview in 1974 in search for his heir-presumptive son."
"The hostage crisis of Meredith and Vinny in 1973 saw the introduction of newly minted Dr. Dorian Cramer (originally, Nancy Pinkerton), who Viki dislikes at first sight. Dorian, at first, dates Llanview Hospital co-worker Dr. Mark Toland (Tom Lee Jones), and in the midst of the romance on-the-job in summer 1974. Dorian is suspected of medical malpractice, and all of the hospital board of directors (except for Viki) vote to fire her. Dorian assumes that Viki's was the deciding vote to fire her and vows revenge. When Victor (Strudwick) reappears in December 1974 and suffers a heart attack, and an unemployed Dorian decides to use him to get even with the Lord family."
"Dorian becomes Victor's personal physician in 1975, and the two quickly elope in May. Soon afterward, Tony Harris (George Reinholt) arrives in Llanview, and Dorian quickly realizes he is Victor's long-sought son. Tony quickly becomes friends with Victor, and when Tony uncovers a diary from Viki and Meredith's mother, Eugenia, and realizing Victor to be his estranged father, to the chagrin of a greedy Dorian. Dorian connives and succeeds in creating a rift between Victor and his new son. When Tony and Victor learn of Dorian's scheme, Tony first confronts Dorian, who denies having done anything wrong. On April 30, 1976, when Victor begins questioning Dorian, the ensuing argument leads Victor to have a debilitating stroke which leaves him unable to speak or dictate alterations to his will. Determined to keep her Victor from speaking to anyone, Dorian brings him home and succeeds from keeping everyone away from him. Soon, Victor suffers a second stroke which sends him back to the hospital. Despite his attempts to speak to Viki, Victor apparently dies in June 16, 1976, and Dorian inherits half of his wealth."
"In 1985, Viki commences celebrations of the 50th anniversary of her father's newspaper. During preparations for the celebration, Viki's goddaughter, Tina (Andrea Evans), happens upon a hidden door in the Llanfair library, leading to a secret room. While in the room, Tina stumbles upon a letter written by Victor addressed to Viki, telling of his affair and brief marriage with Viki's former college friend Irene Manning Clayton and the siring of his daughter Tina. When Tina divulges the revelations, Viki reverts to alter-ego ""Niki Smith"" and Tina, for the following year, embarks on a mission to gain what she believes to be rightfully hers as a member of the Lord family. Recovered, Viki later uncovers in 1988 that she had a daughter, Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), while under the hypnosis insisted upon by Victor and delivered by her longtime friend and brother-in-law, Larry. Megan dies of lupus in 1992."
"Viki engages in an extramarital affair in 1993 with writer Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes), who authors Victor's biography, ""Lord of ""The Banner"""". While penning the book, Dorian (now, Robin Strasser onward) nervously plots to prevent its publication as Sloan's papers allude to Dorian's complicity in Victor's death, a tale which became a Llanview urban legend in the years following Victor's apparent death. Intrigued by Dorian's intense interest in the book, Viki implores the Llanview Police Department to investigate the circumstances of Victor's death. They comply, leading to the arrest (and conviction, after trial) of Dorian for Victor's murder. When Dorian is sentenced to death by lethal injection, con man David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) arrives in town in 1994, claiming to possess the alleged diary of Viki's late friend and Tina's mother, Irene. Later revealed to be a forgery, the diary claims dead Irene smothered Victor, exonerating Dorian at the eleventh hour. Soon afterward, an actual diary entry from Irene reveals she bore Victor another son, reformed rapist Todd Manning (Roger Howarth)."
"When Viki learns of the initial forgery, Viki, still loyal to her late father, vows to send Dorian back to jail for Victor's death in 1995. Dorian then divulges the source of Viki's multiple personalities—Victor had long molested his eldest daughter Victoria and her repressed memories of the molestation led to the creation of her initial alter-ego, Niki. Victoria then suffered a recurrence of her multiple personality disorder, subsequently releasing several new personalities, who accost Dorian and hold her hostage in Victor's secret room. Upon recovery, Viki comes to terms with her father's inappropriate behaviors."
"Because of the pain she had to endure and dark secrets that were revealed, Viki, who had once worshiped the ground her father walked on and idealized him, now has nothing but contempt, rage, and disgust at Victor's depravity and actions."
"Finally in 2003, following the arrival of Viki's long-lost daughter, Natalie (Melissa Archer), an ailing Victor (William Stone Mahoney) resurfaces. It is during this time when Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) marries Natalie in a plot spearheaded by Victor to kill his granddaughter and harvest her heart, as he was dying of old age and heart disease. Viki foils Victor and Mitch's plot, saving Natalie from impending death. Victor is again rushed to the hospital. Larry tells Victor's present children, Viki and Todd (Howarth), to say their final goodbyes to their dying father. Victor dies on-screen in March 2003, a month before a shocked Dorian returns to Llanview."
"In 2007, during the funeral of Asa Buchanan, Dorian and Viki are trapped together in Asa's wine cellar. The two argue and Dorian tells Viki that she, not Viki, killed Victor. Viki, flabbergasted, reminds Dorian that neither she nor Dorian had killed Victor because he had returned from the dead a few years before. Dorian then plants a seed of doubt in Viki's mind, responding ""if that really was him."" During the episode first aired on November 26, 2008, Viki visits her father's grave, and the date of death shown is ""June 16, 1976"", the date of the episode in which Victor originally died. It was never mentioned onscreen whether or not the Victor who appeared in 2003 was an imposter, and the 2003 storyline is not mentioned again in the series, leading to speculation that it was simply retconned out of continuity."
"In 2011, it was revealed by a back-from-the dead Irene that the man known as Todd (Trevor St. John) since May 2003 was in fact his twin, Victor Lord, Jr. (St. John), and the real Todd Manning (Howarth) had been held hostage by her since his disappearance in March 2003. Victor, Jr. is later seemingly killed on the episode that first aired August 31, 2011. On the original finale January 13, 2012, however, Victor, Jr. is revealed to be alive and being held captive by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick)."
"During an interview with ""TV Guide Canada"" in February 2009, ""Dorian Lord"" actress Robin Strasser, offered a belated explanation for the recent reversal about Victor's murderer:"
"The notion that Dorian is Victor's true murderer is bolstered in the August 16, 2011 episode of ""One Life to Live"". When David Vickers Buchanan mentions that the (albeit forged) entry from Irene Manning's diary cleared Dorian of a murder she did not commit, Dorian comments to herself, ""... or so Viki chooses to believe."""
"From the outset, the original portrayal of Victor Lord by actor Ernest Graves was received as ruthless and overbearing, playing a role introduced as the powerful center of the fictional town of Llanview, and of the lives of his daughters Victoria and Meredith. For his portrayal of a dying Victor, actor Shepperd Strudwick earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1976."
"Leading series actress and onscreen daughter Erika Slezak reflected on Victor's transformation at the 25th anniversary of ""OLTL"" in 1993 recalling, ""Once, Victor Lord was a paragon of virtue, then producer Paul Rauch said, 'let's turn him into a dirty old man who sleeps with young women and keeps pornography in the basement.'"""
= = = Truncated dodecadodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the truncated dodecadodecahedron (or stellatruncated dodecadodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is given a Schläfli symbol t{5/3,5}. It has 120 vertices and 54 faces: 30 squares, 12 decagons, and 12 decagrams. The central region of the polyhedron is connected to the exterior via 20 small triangular holes."
"The name ""truncated dodecadodecahedron"" is somewhat misleading: truncation of the dodecadodecahedron would produce rectangular faces rather than squares, and the pentagram faces of the dodecahedron would turn into truncated pentagrams rather than decagrams. However, it is the quasitruncation of the dodecadodecahedron, as defined by . For this reason, it is also known as the quasitruncated dodecadodecahedron. Coxeter et al. credit its discovery to a paper published in 1881 by Austrian mathematician Johann Pitsch."
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated dodecadodecahedron are all the triples of numbers obtained by circular shifts and sign changes from the following points (where formula_1 is the golden ratio):
"Each of these five points has eight possible sign patterns and three possible circular shifts, giving a total of 120 different points."
"The two lead brigades split their advances into two directions, although not on brigade boundaries. The 1st Texas and 3rd Arkansas of Robertson's brigade and the 44th and 48th Alabama of Law's brigade headed in the direction of Devil's Den, while Law directed the remaining five regiments toward the Round Tops."
"Devil's Den was located at the extreme left of the III Corps line, manned by the large brigade (six regiments and two companies of sharpshooters, 2,200 men in all) of Brigadier General J. H. Hobart Ward, in Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division. It was the southern end of Houck's Ridge, a modest elevation on the northwest side of Plum Run Valley, made distinctive by piles of huge boulders. These boulders were not the direct avenue of approach used by the Confederates. The 3rd Arkansas and the 1st Texas drove through Rose Woods and hit Ward's line head-on. His troops had lacked the time or inclination to erect breastworks, and for over an hour both sides participated in a standup fight of unusual ferocity. In the first 30 minutes, the 20th Indiana lost more than half of its men. Its colonel, John Wheeler, was killed and its lieutenant colonel wounded. The 86th New York also lost its commander. The commander of the 3rd Arkansas fell wounded, one of 182 casualties in his regiment."
"Meanwhile, the two regiments from Law's brigade that had split from the column advancing to the Round Tops pushed up Plum Run Valley and threatened to turn Ward's flank. Their target was the 4th Maine and the 124th New York, defending the 4th New York Independent artillery battery commanded by Captain James Smith, whose fire was causing considerable disruption in Law's brigade's advance. The pressure grew great enough that Ward needed to call the 99th Pennsylvania from his far right to reinforce his left. The commander of the 124th New York, Colonel Augustus Van Horne Ellis, and his major, James Cromwell, decided to counterattack. They mounted their horses despite the protests of soldiers who urged them to lead more safely on foot. Maj. Cromwell said, ""The men must see us today."" They led the charge of their ""Orange Blossoms"" regiment to the west, down the slope of Houck's Ridge through a triangular field surrounded by a low stone fence, sending the 1st Texas reeling back . But both Colonel Ellis and Major Cromwell were shot dead as the Texans rallied with a massed volley; and the New Yorkers retreated to their starting point, with only 100 survivors from the 283 they started with. As reinforcements from the 99th Pennsylvania arrived, Ward's brigade retook the crest."
"The second wave of Hood's assault was the brigades of Henry Benning and George ""Tige"" Anderson. They detected a gap in Birney's division line: to Ward's right, there was a considerable gap before the brigade of Régis de Trobriand began. Anderson's line smashed into Trobriand and the gap at the southern edge of the Wheatfield. Trobriand wrote that the Confederates ""converged on me like an avalanche, but we piled all the dead and wounded men in our front."" The Union defense was fierce, and Anderson's brigade pulled back; its commander was wounded in the leg and was carried from the battle."
"Two of Benning's Confederate regiments, the 2nd and 17th Georgia, moved down Plum Run Valley around Ward's flank. They received murderous fire from the 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery on Little Round Top, but they kept pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day."
"Birney scrambled to find reinforcements. He sent the 40th New York and 6th New Jersey from the Wheatfield into Plum Run Valley to block the approach into Ward's flank. They collided with Benning's and Law's men in rocky, broken ground that the survivors would remember as the ""Slaughter Pen"". (Plum Run itself was known as ""Bloody Run""; Plum Run Valley as the ""Valley of Death"".) Col. Thomas W. Egan, commanding the 40th New York, was called on by Smith to recover his guns. The men of the ""Mozart"" regiment slammed into the 2nd and 17th Georgia regiments, with initial success. As Ward's line along Houck's Ridge continued to collapse, the position manned by the 40th became increasingly untenable. However, Egan pressed his regiment onward, according to Col. Wesley Hodges of the 17th Georgia, launching seven attacks against the Confederate positions within the boulders of Slaughter Pen and Devil's Den. As the men of the 40th fell back under relentless pressure, the 6th New Jersey covered their withdrawal and lost a third of its men in the process."
"The pressure on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, and he was forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted Little Round Top to the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing across the Valley of Death on Union troops massed on Little Round Top."
"Of 2,423 Union troops engaged, there were 821 casualties (138 killed, 548 wounded, 135 missing); the 5,525 Confederates lost 1,814 (329, 1,107, 378)."
"The Confederate assaults on Little Round Top were some of the most famous of the three-day battle and the Civil War. Arriving just as the Confederates approached, Col. Strong Vincent's brigade of the V Corps mounted a spirited defense of this position, the extreme left of the Union line, against furious assaults up the rocky slope. The stand of the 20th Maine under Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain against the 15th Alabama (Col. William C. Oates) is particularly storied, but heroes such as Strong Vincent, Patrick ""Paddy"" O'Rorke, and Charles E. Hazlett also made names for themselves."
"Lafayette McLaws arranged his division on Warfield Ridge similar to Hood's on his right—two lines of two brigades each: left front, facing the Peach Orchard, the brigade of Brig. Gen. William Barksdale; right front, Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw; left rear, Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford; right rear, Brig. Gen. Paul Jones Semmes."
"Lee's original plan called for Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and that the enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the ""en echelon"" attack—one brigade after another in sequence—that would be used for the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard."
"The area known as the Wheatfield had three geographic features, all owned by the John Rose family: the 20 acre (8 ha) field itself, Rose Woods bordering it on the west, and a modest elevation known as Stony Hill, also to the west. Immediately to the southeast was Houck's Ridge and to the south Devil's Den. The fighting here, consisting of numerous confusing attacks and counterattacks over two hours by eleven brigades, earned the field the nickname ""Bloody Wheatfield."""
"The first engagement in the Wheatfield was actually that of Anderson's brigade (Hood's division) attacking the 17th Maine of Trobriand's brigade, a spillover from Hood's attack on Houck's Ridge. Although under pressure and with its neighboring regiments on Stony Hill withdrawing, the 17th Maine held its position behind a low stone wall with the assistance of Winslow's battery, and Anderson fell back. Trobriand wrote, ""I had never seen any men fight with equal obstinacy."""
"By 5:30 p.m., when the first of Kershaw's regiments neared the Rose farmhouse, Stony Hill had been reinforced by two brigades of the 1st Division, V Corps, under Brig. Gen. James Barnes, those of Cols. William S. Tilton and Jacob B. Sweitzer. Kershaw's men placed great pressure on the 17th Maine, but it continued to hold. For some reason, however, Barnes withdrew his understrength division about to the north—without consultation with Birney's men—to a new position near the Wheatfield Road. Trobriand and the 17th Maine had to follow suit, and the Confederates seized Stony Hill and streamed into the Wheatfield. (Barnes's controversial decision was widely criticized after the battle, and it effectively ended his military career.)"
"Earlier that afternoon, as Meade realized the folly of Sickles's movement, he ordered Hancock to send a division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back to the edge of Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault continued down the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again."
"Additional Union troops had arrived by this time. The 2nd Division of the V corps, under Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres, was known as the ""Regular Division"" because two of its three brigades were composed entirely of U.S. Army (regular army) troops, not state volunteers. (The brigade of volunteers, under Brig. Gen. Stephen H. Weed, was already engaged on Little Round Top, so only the regular army brigades arrived at the Wheatfield.) In their advance across the Valley of Death they had come under heavy fire from Confederate sharpshooters in Devil's Den. As the regulars advanced, the Confederates swarmed over Stony Hill and through Rose Woods, flanking the newly arrived brigades. The regulars retreated back to the relative safety of Little Round Top in good order, despite taking heavy casualties and pursuing Confederates. The two regular brigades suffered 829 casualties out of 2,613 engaged."
"This final Confederate assault through the Wheatfield continued past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat in the summer heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield."
"The bloody Wheatfield remained quiet for the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare."
"While the right wing of Kershaw's brigade attacked into the Wheatfield, its left wing wheeled left to attack the Pennsylvania troops in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Charles K. Graham, the right flank of Birney's line, where 30 guns from the III Corps and the Artillery Reserve attempted to hold the sector. The South Carolinians were subjected to infantry volleys from the Peach Orchard and canister from all along the line. Suddenly someone unknown shouted a false command, and the attacking regiments turned to their right, toward the Wheatfield, which presented their left flank to the batteries. Kershaw later wrote, ""Hundreds of the bravest and best men of Carolina fell, victims of this fatal blunder."""
"Meanwhile, the two brigades on McLaws's left—Barksdale's in front and Wofford's behind—charged directly into the Peach Orchard, the point of the salient in Sickles's line. Gen. Barksdale led the charge on horseback, long hair flowing in the wind, sword waving in the air. Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division had only about 1,000 men to cover the from the Peach Orchard northward along the Emmitsburg Road to the lane leading to the Abraham Trostle farm. Some were still facing south, from where they had been firing on Kershaw's brigade, so they were hit in their vulnerable flank. Barksdale's 1,600 Mississippians wheeled left against the flank of Humphreys's division, collapsing their line, regiment by regiment. Graham's brigade retreated back toward Cemetery Ridge; Graham had two horses shot out from under him. He was hit by a shell fragment, and by a bullet in his upper body. He was eventually captured by the 21st Mississippi. Wofford's men dealt with the defenders of the orchard."
"As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's headquarters near the Trostle barn, the general and his staff began to move to the rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force."
"The relentless infantry charges posed extreme danger to the Union artillery batteries in the orchard and on the Wheatfield Road, and they were forced to withdraw under pressure. The six Napoleons of Capt. John Bigelow's 9th Massachusetts Light Artillery, on the left of the line, ""retired by prolonge,"" a technique rarely used in which the cannon was dragged backwards as it fired rapidly, the movement aided by the gun's recoil. By the time they reached the Trostle house, they were told to hold the position to cover the infantry retreat, but they were eventually overrun by troops of the 21st Mississippi, who captured three of their guns."
"Humphreys's fate was sealed when the Confederate ""en echelon"" attack continued and his front and right flank began to be assaulted by the Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson on Cemetery Ridge."
"The remaining portion of the ""en echelon"" attack was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of A.P. Hill's Third Corps, and he attacked starting at about 6 p.m. with five brigades in line, commencing on the right with Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox, followed by Perry's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Lang), Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright, Brig. Gen. Carnot Posey, and Brig. Gen. William Mahone."
"The brigades of Wilcox and Lang hit the front and right flank of Humphreys's line, dooming any chance for his division to maintain its position on the Emmitsburg Road and completing the collapse of the III Corps. Humphrey displayed considerable bravery during the attack, leading his men from horseback and forcing them to maintain good order during their withdrawal. He wrote to his wife, ""Twenty times did I [bring] my men to a halt and face about ... forcing the men to it."""
"On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were scrambling to find reinforcements. Meade had sent virtually all of his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving the center of his line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery."
"The long march from Seminary Ridge had left some of the Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused momentarily at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn."
"As Hancock rode north to find additional reinforcements, he saw Wilcox's brigade nearing the base of the ridge, aiming at a gap in the Union line. The timing was critical, and Hancock chose the only troops at hand, the men of the 1st Minnesota, Harrow's Brigade, of the 2nd Division of the II Corps. They were originally placed there to guard Thomas's U.S. Battery. He pointed to a Confederate flag over the advancing line and shouted to Col. William Colvill, ""Advance, Colonel, and take those colors!"" The 262 Minnesotans charged the Alabama brigade with bayonets fixed, and they blunted their advance at Plum Run but at horrible cost—215 casualties (82%), including 40 deaths or mortal wounds, one of the largest regimental single-action losses of the war. Despite overwhelming Confederate numbers, the small 1st Minnesota, with the support of Willard's brigade on their left, checked Wilcox's advance and the Alabamians were forced to withdraw."
"The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments posted on the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, captured the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward a gap in the Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers in this part of the line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him if he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge."
"Wright told Lee that it was relatively easy to get to the crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle."
"Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Ewell to launch a demonstration, or minor diversionary attack, on the Union right flank. He started the attack at 4 p.m. with an artillery bombardment from Benner's Hill, which caused little damage to the Union lines, but the counterbattery fire returned upon the lower hill was deadly. Ewell's best artillery officer, 19-year-old Joseph W. Latimer, the ""Boy Major"", was mortally wounded, eventually dying a month later. Ewell did not launch a conventional infantry attack until after 7 p.m., after Anderson's assault on Cemetery Ridge had crested. At around 8 p.m., two brigades of Jubal Early's division reached the Union artillery of East Cemetery Hill near the Baltimore Pike, but Union reinforcements drove them from the hill."
"Maj. Gen. Edward ""Allegheny"" Johnson's Confederate division attacked Brig. Gen. George S. Greene's XII Corps brigade behind strong breastworks on Culp's Hill. The Confederates suffered severe casualties and gained only the portions of the Union line that had been vacated under orders that afternoon by General Meade to reinforce the left flank of his line against Longstreet."
